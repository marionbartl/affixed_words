IT ’S tempting to think of a résumé as a low - maintenance aspect of your job search .
Just list where you worked , what you did and where you went to school , attach that to each application and press the button .
In fact , though , you have considerable flexibility in how you structure your résumé .
The decisions you make about what it says and how it looks can affect whether you get the job you really want , or get a job at all .
A résumé is a marketing document that “ can serve as a magnet to draw job opportunities to you , ” said Susan Ireland , author of “ The Complete Idiot ’s Guide to the Perfect Résumé . ”
That ’s largely because more résumés are now on job boards and social media sites , and are included on company databases , she said .
Often , people place too much emphasis on the parts of past jobs that they hated  and get new jobs they end up hating , too , she said .
“ Your résumé is about your future , ” she said , “ it ’s not about your past , ” so stress experiences that are most relevant to the position you aspire to hold .
The heat and humidity here on Christmas Island is unrelentingly oppressive .
Grey clouds hang damply over the mountain , making visibility poor and the roads treacherous .
It is not only the weather that is threatening here .
The island 's main business , the detention of asylum seekers , is sadly booming .
The Immigration Detention Centre at North - West Point that was built for 400 people with a surge capacity of 800 , now houses more than 1,500 asylum seekers with a further 500 held at other detention facilities on the island , quirkily known as Phosphate Hill and the Construction Camp .
The government denies the over - crowding , arguing that capacity has always been ' flexible ' .
Standing at Jack 's
Hill , overlooking the detention centre , this flexibility is evident by the presence of tents reminiscent of accommodation in refugee camps in the third world .
There are rising tensions in the flexibly expanding detention centre .
Last week a fight erupted between detainees , now euphemistically known as clients .
The change in rhetoric does not change reality .
A few days ago a near fatal suicide attempt by a Sri Lankan man signalled a loss of hope after ten months in detention .
His level of distress is not unusual among those who are experiencing long delays and no answers to their refugee claims .
The Prime Minister 's announcement on Friday of a freeze on the processing of claims of new arrivals from the two largest groups on the island , Afghans and Sri Lankans , was a jolt .
Already Sri Lankans and others sit for months in detention awaiting security clearances by an over - stretched ASIO .
Long periods of detention create boredom , uncertainty and concern about their fate and that of family members left behind .
For those undeterred by the new policy , the uncertainty and stress will magnify .
We can only speculate that the increased presence of Australian Federal Police is a recognition that tensions may erupt into protest built on despair .
On the morning of the new policy announcement we sit in one of the few coffee shops on the island .
The ABC radio news is in the background and locals , refugee advocates and off - duty detention workers congregate at the loud speaker expressing shock ; each from their own perspectives .
We know from past experience that deterrence measures are unlikely to stop desperate people .
What will this now mean for newly arrived boatpeople who will have nothing to do but wait and experience increasing despair and lack of hope ?
Who will help them with their stress , given the lack of mental health services and supportive visitors on the island ?
What will it mean for Christmas Islanders who are already experiencing strain on the island and who on Friday observed the federal police reinforcements unloading riot gear along the main road in full view of residents ?
And what of the over - worked and over - stressed detention staff who are trying to implement Labor 's detention values of 2008 , an ethos which is increasingly diminishing .
We overheard two young off duty detention guards air their frustration : ' Let Rudd come here and do a stint up here and see about his ideas then .
Christmas Island is a stupid place for detention and it's just going to get worse ' .
Observing our eavesdropping they fell silent .
But they are right .
Christmas Island is a stupid place for a detention centre and the policies are foolhardy .
The guards seem to know that maintaining a safe detention environment will become harder as more people languish without a progressing of claims .
From their outrage we guess that they anticipate more ' critical incidents ' in their daily work such as fights , hunger strikes and self - harm as the federal police presence seems to indicate .
We are at a loss for words when current immigration detainees ask us why the Afghans and Sri Lankans are singled out for punitive treatment .
Perhaps we 're naive , but we 're sure that if Australians could sit with any boatpeople and listen to their stories - of violence and loss , their grief at losing children in wars with seemingly no bounds , where all civilians are targets and life is precarious , could see the physical scars and injuries that confirm these tales are not fantasies - they would be as moved as we have been .
Our leaders have an opportunity to lead .
Instead of the constant rhetoric about border protection and fear of a few thousand people arriving on wooden boats , our politicians could talk to us about why people have left their homelands and draw out the compassion we are sure exists .
Good public policy should be beyond politics .
In an election year the government is running scared and trying to appease community anxiety that is fuelled by the constant opposition criticism , which is regrettably gaining traction .
What the government fails to acknowledge is that the current problems of overcrowding and isolation will now magnify .
In our short time on the island we are observing and hearing how resources are stretched to the limit including health services , a fundamental human right .
The government is irrationally devoted to maintaining offshore processing for boat arrivals even thought it knows it causes immense harm to people , creates enormous expense for the tax - payer and is a serious blight on Australia 's human rights record .
Electoral fortunes should not rest with people 's lives and the only just solution is to bring all asylum seekers to the mainland for fair and equitable processing while they live in the community .
It is an insult to the Australian public to presume that this will signify ' soft on border protection ' policy .
Surely we look to our politicians for leadership that is courageous , plausible and humane .

The corporate threat to both our health and our liberties ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 4/4/2010 , 10:05 am PT
Guest blogged by Ernest A. Canning
" You 've got a small number of multinational corporations that control the entire food system from seed to the supermarket .
This is n't just about what we 're allowed to eat .
This is about what we 're allowed to say ; what we 're allowed to know .
It 's not just our health at risk ... They have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products .
There is an effort to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation . "
- Food , Inc. narration .
We hear it constantly from Republicans ; an ideological mantra to the effect that government , especially government programs that would place the interests of public health , safety , and equality above the profits and power of those who already have too much of both , threatens our liberties .
Perhaps in a manner even more successful than Michael Moore 's very powerful presentations in Sicko ! and in Capitalism : A Love Story , Robert Kenner and Eric Schlosser , in their Academy Award nominated documentary feature Food , Inc. ( trailer posted at end of article ) , expose the lie behind the myth that so - called " free markets " make us free ....
Food , Inc. on public health and ecology
While this piece is intended to cover the tyranny inflicted by a corporate controlled economy , one suspects that most in Food , Inc . 's audience will find the film to be a real eye opener when it comes to the dangers posed by what Kenner and Schlosser describe as food - producing " factories , " or what is described in the film 's " press kit " [ PDF ] as " the Orwellian underbelly that 's been deliberately hidden from the American consumer . "
The film takes the audience to the giant holding pens , formally known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ( CAFOs ) , where corn -fed cattle stand knee deep in their own manure ; to sheds , half as long as football fields , where thousands of chickens , bio -engineered to grow so rapidly and large that they are incapable of taking more than a step or two before falling flat on a floor laden with their feces ; chickens kept in the dark not to produce a better product but to make them more docile when they are rounded up for slaughter .
( In the must - see , deleted scenes we find the mother of a factory chicken farmer who has to keep the windows of her home closed to fend off the noxious odors from the nearby chicken sheds ; can't eat outside because she and her husband would be swarmed with flies ) .
" If you can grow a chicken in 49 days , why would you want one you gotta grow in three months ? " asks one of the corporate - controlled farmers interviewed in the film .
In a brilliant stroke , Kenner and Schlausser provide stark contrast to the nightmares of factory farming by taking their audience to Polyface Farms where we meet Joel Salatin , the organic farm's owner who possesses an extraordinary level of country good sense , and who has no taste for corporate greed .
There we see cows grazing on grass in an open pasture , while healthy chickens roam about the barnyard .
The CAFOs and the mass produced chicken operations are designed not to improve quality but to maximize profits .
The decisions that affect the daily operations of the CAFOs are not made by farmers , but by corporate titans sitting in board rooms in cities sometimes thousands of miles away .
Unfortunately , the corporate engineers , so good at efficiency of mass production , ignored a basic fact of evolutionary biology .
Cattle evolved as a grass eating animal .
The corn they are fed produces dangerous , potentially lethal , strains of E - coli bacteria which , according to the film 's press kit , " sickens roughly 73,000 Americans annually .
And because of the high proliferation of processed foods derived from corn , Americans are facing epidemic levels of diabetes among adults and alarming increases in obesity , especially among children . "
While corn remains a cheap source of feed , thanks to heavy subsidies paid by the U.S. government to these giant agricultural conglomerates ( your tax dollars at work ) , the real cost , especially to the environment , is substantial .
Corn must be transported in trucks and trains , and the huge , toxic amounts of manure must be carted away , adding to consumption of fossil fuels and our global climate change footprint .
Meanwhile , Salitin points to his cattle grazing on open land ; notes that they are mowing and fertilizing the grass all at the same time --- an entire , ecologically efficient system captured in a single frame .
( In the deleted scenes , Salitin explains the ecologically efficient , symbiotic relationship between the multiple strains of grass he has never had to plant or replant , his cattle , chickens , and pigs , which naturally convert manure into soil enriching compost ) .
Schlosser asserts that CAFO cattle will experience a more than 80 % reduction in E - coli if they are simply taken out to pasture five days prior to their slaughter .
Yet the corporate titans , according to Food , Inc. , persist on keeping the cattle in the CAFO until they are moved off to be slaughtered .
They show carcasses , streaked with excrement , on hooks leading into slaughterhouses .
The corporate titans apparently believe it more efficient to fend off infection by bathing the butchered meat in ammonia and ammonia hydroxide .
Subsidies and NAFTA 's dirty little secret
When they were first introduced during the early days of the New Deal , farm subsidies were intended to stabilize prices in order to offset the extraordinary low prices brought on by over - production and by the Great Depression ; to keep farmers on their farms and in their homes .
Today , it would be fair to say that farm subsidies , like Wall Street bailouts , flow to those who need them the least .
In Thieves in High Places , Jim Hightower provides the classic example --- billionaire stockbroker Charles R. Schwab ; the proud owner of Casa de Patos , " 1,500 acres of picturesque wetlands in Northern California . "
Schwab grows rice on the land , not for harvesting purposes but because the rice attracts ducks .
Schwab is one of those rich folks who likes to invite friends and clients to go duck hunting .
( Careful you do n't invite Dick Cheney , Mr. Schwab . )
So Schwab has no intent to harvest the rice , but that does n't prevent this man with an estimated $ 4.7 billion net worth from collecting $ 500,000 / year in federal farm subsidies because he does not market the rice .
Hightower laments , " Sadly , it 's legal , and it's a fine upstanding example of what George [ W. Bush ] and his base like to call ' entrepreneurship . ' "
As revealed by Jeff Faux in The Global Class War , and as touched upon in Food , Inc. , with the 1993 passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , some of the wealthiest citizens of this country not only gorged themselves at the public trough by way of subsidies , but parlayed this into a means to engage in unfair competition in Mexico , selling corn at well below the cost of production .
This drove nearly 1.5 million Mexican farmers off the land , creating a massive migration to Mexico 's cities .
Faux asserts this created an overabundance of cheap labor in the Northern Mexico cities which was exploited by U.S. manufacturers , who saw a golden opportunity to dispose of their unionized U.S. workers , in what amounted to the first step in the wholesale outsourcing of almost everything made in the U.S. , save military weapons , first south to Mexico and then to China , India , and and other parts east --- short - term greed with devastating long - term economic consequences .
But the NAFTA scheme entailed much more than Ross Perot 's ominous warning during the 1992 Presidential debates of a " giant sucking sound of jobs headed South . "
As Kenner and Schlosser reveal in Food , Inc. , when the U.S. - subsidized corn drove Mexican farmers off their land , it created a golden opportunity for the meat packing industry to shift to cheap labor even while remaining in the U.S. .
American meat packers actively recruited the displaced Mexican farmers , drawing the undocumented into an increasingly consolidated U.S. meat packing industry --- an industry which once paid union wages in the 1950s that were on par with the middle class wages in the auto industry .
As a result , the job of meat packing was set back both in terms of economics and safety to levels not seen since Roosevelt --- Teddy Roosevelt that is .
From the standpoint of the industrial titans at the top of the U.S. food chain , this maneuver not only provided a ready source of cheap , exploitable labor but came with the added benefit that these recruited Mexican economic refugees could be scapegoated for the misfortunes of the American middle class whose real demise was occasioned when President Bill Clinton joined with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan to ram NAFTA through on the fast track .
Curiously , Clinton recently apologized for his role in forcing other countries to accept U.S. agricultural products at the expense of their own agricultural systems , which he admitted , in the case of Haiti , destroyed that impoverished nation 's self sufficiency by eliminating its ability to produce rice .
Clinton conceded that U.S. agricultural policies since 1981 ( the year Reagan took office ) not only destroyed local economies but undermined their culture and " fabric of life . "
While describing the consequences he now has to " live with every day , " the apology from the former President and now Special Envoy to Haiti came with a positive spin that U.S. policy makers were simply trying to " relieve " these nations of the " burden " of food production so they could " leap into the industrial era . "
Clinton 's spin ignores the profits , subsidies , and monopoly power which flowed to the wealthy CEOs and investors at the top of the corporate U.S. food producing industry .
Democracy Now's Juan Gonzales described the concessions as the former President having , in large measure , renounced NAFTA .
Making Monsanto's monopoly
In a 2005 article published in the Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property , Haley Stein wrote :
Until recently , certain concepts were universally accepted among farmers .
First , out of economic necessity , farmers had the right to save , replant , and resell seeds to other farmers willing to buy seeds with desirable characteristics .
Second , the genetic composition of seeds , rather than the seed itself , was considered part of a common heritage and widely shared among farmers .
Third , seeds were not seen as a commodity ; rather , the right to use and reproduce seeds was inherent in the first purchase of the seed .
Until the nineteenth century , seeds were seen as a public commons which were bred and then freely distributed by the public sector .
All that changed on Dec. 10 , 2001 , when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a 6 - 2 decision which insured that Monsanto and other companies holding patent rights on genetically modified seeds could prevent farmers from saving , replanting , or selling their genetically - modified seeds .
In Food , Inc. , Kenner and Schlosser note that the decision was written by Justice Clarence Thomas who , as it turns out , had previously served as Monsanto 's attorney .
While there are many occasions on numerous issues that I would find fault with the Federalist Society - connected Clarence Thomas , this would not be one of them .
The decision appears to be a relatively routine instance of statutory interpretation .
The problem with the direction of intellectual property law in this instance is more appropriately attributed to the impact of corporate lobbyists and money in Congress and the revolving door between the private sector and government .
Congress has become a millionaire 's club which spends its time crafting legislation on behalf of billionaires --- that is , when it does n't simply sit back and permit K - Street lobbyists to draft legislation for members of Congress to simply introduce and vote into law .
In his book , Let 's Stop Beating Around the Bush , Jim Hightower noted perhaps the classic case of how the very agencies that are designed to regulate corporate industries actually work on their behalf .
During the reign of the Bush / Cheney cabal , an occasion arose in which Monsanto was required to submit a report to the FDA in order to demonstrate the safety of placing its artificial growth hormone in milk . *
It assigned the task of preparing a report to one of its leading researchers , Margaret Miller .
So far , nothing extraordinary .
After preparing the report , Miller was hired by the FDA , which then assigned her the daunting task of reviewing her own report .
Damned if she was n't persuaded .
Of course , there was still the question of whether Monsanto 's milk would require a warning label , a task that was then assigned to another FDA official , Mark Taylor , who just happened to be a former Monsanto lobbyist , as had been Linda Fisher , whom Bush appointed as the deputy administrator of the EPA .**
In 1996 , only 2 % of the soybeans harvested in the U.S. contained Monsanto 's patented genes .***
By 2008 , Monsanto genes could be found in more than 90 % of the U.S. soybean crop .
This extraordinary rise to market dominance did not occur by chance .
As revealed by Food , Inc. , Monsanto , which is well within its rights to do so ( based on the corporate - friendly laws which allow it ) , aggressively defends its patent rights against any and all farmers it believes intentionally violated them .
However , where the film implied that this would include farmers whose fields were infected by airborne patented seeds from neighboring fields , Monsanto , which declined to be interviewed for the film , posted on line that it does not " exercise its patent rights where trace amounts of our patented traits are present in farmers ' fields as a result of inadvertent means . "
( Monsanto 's on - line post does not explain what would constitute " trace amounts . " )
On March 13 , the Los Angeles Times reported that " U.S. Atty .
Gen. Eric Holder and a team of top federal officials on Friday pledged a sweeping examination of alleged monopolistic practices in the food sector , and promised to bust those who violate antitrust laws . "
The article followed two earlier articles that appeared in the Los Angeles Times and in The New York Times referencing anti-trust concerns pertaining to Monsanto 's market share and a sudden rise in seed prices .
Corporate tyranny
Food , Inc. covered the lawsuit brought by Monsanto against Moe Parr , who cleans seed from the most recent harvest using machinery that dates back to the 19th Century , providing seed for the next year 's crop .
Monsanto alleged that some of the seeds Parr cleaned contained Monsanto 's patented genes .
In its online response to the movie , Monsanto said it sued Parr only after years of " other efforts " to resolve the issue .
Monsanto points to an injunction obtained by way of the case resolution that prevents Parr from cleaning Monsanto seed .
What it does not mention is the gross disparity between the modest income of these rural Americans and a huge corporation with teams of attorneys at its disposal ; attorneys who humiliated Parr by subpoenaing his bank records and going through every transaction with every farmer mentioned in the account .
Yes , Monsanto is right .
It was well within its legal rights to aggressively defend its patents --- the film also mentions teams of investigators spying on farmers .
But that right does n't negate a vital issue --- that the manipulation of the legislative process by members of Congress seeking to please corporate America produced intellectual property laws that destroyed what had been a standard farming practice for a thousand years .
Congress gave this huge corporation extraordinary control over the lives of previously independent , honest , hard - working farmers --- farmers who are finding it increasingly difficult to find seed that has not been contaminated with the Monsanto patented gene .
The tyranny of corporate economic control can indeed be found in Monsanto 's ability to legally intimidate these hard working farmers and their seed cleaner , Moe Parr .
As denoted in Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine , these cases are but a microcosm of the exploitation and extension of oppressive corporate power over the lives of ordinary citizens occasioned by laws that facilitate the privatization of the commons --- in this case seeds --- though , one suspects that if corporations could come up with a way to patent the air we breathe , they 'd privatize it , then sue us for breaking their patent if we did n't pay for it .
Liberty lost to corporate power
In an earlier segment , Food , Inc. reveals a relationship between farmers whose contracts to produce chickens are all too reminiscent to those of serfs and masters of Medieval times .
The cost of erecting two of the large buildings where the chickens are kept in the dark is approximately $ 500,000 .
The company demands that the farmer provide upgrades , at the risk of loss of the farmer 's contract .
After all that the farmer earns about $ 18,000 / year --- a sum that insures the farmer can never get out from under the debt .
Food , Inc. begins with a mother whose previously healthy toddler , Kevin , died just twelve days after a food related E - coli infection .
It includes her tireless , but unsuccessful efforts to get Congress to pass " Kevin 's law , " reversing a court decision that ruled the FDA has no authority to shut down a factory farm / meat packer no matter how many times they ship contaminated meat .
Yet this same mother , fearful of financial ruin should she be sued , refused to make any comment about the product she believes had killed her son .
We 're supposed to have a First Amendment guaranteeing free speech as a fundamental right , but what good is that " legal " right if corporate wealth can terrorize a victim into silence ?
As Bill Moyers observed in Moyers on America , " America was not meant to be a country where the winner takes all . "
The principles upon which this nation was founded were reflected in the Preamble of the U.S. Constitution which states our government was formed " to promote the general Welfare . "
An oppressive , greed - based society , in which nearly 45,000 citizens die annually simply because they cannot afford health insurance ; where 73,000 Americans are annually infected with potentially lethal bacteria , yet are deprived of the right to so much as speak out , let alone investigate and prosecute those responsible , bears no resemblance whatsoever to the egalitarian principles espoused by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence [ emphasis added ] :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights ; that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . -
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , - That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Food , Inc. provides a poignant example of how a corporate - controlled economy endangers our lives , our liberty , and our pursuit of happiness .

Description
Hippos are n't the world 's largest land mammals — that honor belongs , by a hair , to the largest breeds of elephants and rhinoceroses — but they come pretty close .
The biggest male hippos can approach three tons and 17 feet , and apparently , never stop growing throughout their 50 - year life span .
The females are a few hundred pounds lighter , but every bit as menacing , especially when defending their young .
Hippopotamuses have very little body hair — a trait that puts them in the company of humans , whales , and a handful of other mammals .
Hippos have hair only around their mouths and on the tips of their tails .
To make up for this deficit , hippos do have extremely thick skin , consisting of about two inches of the epidermis and only a thin layer of underlying fat — there 's not much need to conserve heat in the wilds of equatorial Africa .
Hippos do , however , have very delicate skin that needs to be protected from the harsh sun .
The hippo produces its own natural sunscreen — a substance called " blood sweat " or " red sweat , " it consists of red and orange acids that absorb ultraviolet light and inhibit the growth of bacteria .
This has led to the widespread myth that hippos sweat blood ; in fact , these mammals do n't possess any sweat glands at all , which would be superfluous considering their semi-aquatic lifestyle .
Many animals , including humans , are sexually dimorphic — the males tend to be larger than the females ( or vice - versa ) , and there are other ways , besides directly examining the genitals , to distinguish between the two sexes .
A male hippo , though , looks pretty much exactly like a female hippo , except that males are 10 percent heavier than females .
The inability to easily tell whether a particular animal is male or female makes it difficult for researchers in the field to investigate the social life of a lounging herd of hippos .

Species
While there is only one hippopotamus species —
Hippopotamus amphibius — researchers recognize five different subspecies , corresponding to the parts of Africa where these mammals live .
H. amphibius amphibius , also known as the Nile hippopotamus or the great northern hippopotamus , lives in Mozambique and Tanzania ;
H. amphibius kiboko , the East African hippopotamus , lives in Kenya and Somalia ;
H. amphibius capensis , the South African hippo or the Cape hippo , extends from Zambia to South Africa ;
H. amphibius tchadensis , the West African or Chad hippo , lives in ( you guessed it ) western Africa and Chad ; and the Angola hippopotamus ; and
H. amphibius constrictus , the Angola hippo , is restricted to Angola , Congo , and Namibia .
The name " hippopotamus " derives from Greek — a combination of " hippo , " meaning " horse , " and " potamus , " meaning " river . "
Of course , this mammal coexisted with human populations of Africa for thousands of years before the Greeks ever laid eyes on it , and is known by various extant tribes as the " mvuvu , " " kiboko , " " timondo , " and dozens of other local variants .
There is no right or wrong way to pluralize " hippopotamus : " some people prefer " hippopotamuses , " others like " hippopotami , " but you should always say " hippos " rather than " hippi . "
Groups of hippopotamuses ( or hippopotami ) are called herds , dales , pods , or bloats .
Habitat and Range
Hippos spend most of each day in shallow water , emerging at night to travel to " hippo lawns , " grassy areas where they graze .
Grazing only at night allows them to keep their skins moist and out of the African sun .
When they 're not grazing on grass — which at night takes them into the African lowlands several miles away from the water and for periods of five or six hours at a stretch — hippos prefer to spend their time fully or partially submerged in freshwater lakes and rivers , and occasionally even in saltwater estuaries .
Even at night , some hippos remain in the water , in essence taking turns at the hippo lawns .
Diet
Hippos eat between 65 – 100 pounds of grass and foliage each night .
Somewhat confusingly , hippos are classified as " pseudoruminants " — they 're equipped with multiple - chambered stomachs , like cows , but they do not chew a cud ( which , considering the huge size of their jaws , would make for a pretty comical sight ) .
Fermentation takes place primarily in their fore - stomachs .
A hippo has an enormous mouth and it can open up to a whopping 150 - degree angle .
Their diets certainly have something to do with it — a two - ton mammal has to eat a lot of food to sustain its metabolism .
But sexual selection also plays a major role : Opening one 's mouth very widely is a good way to impress females ( and deter competing males ) during mating season , the same reason that males are equipped with such enormous incisors , which otherwise would make no sense given their vegetarian menus .
Hippos do n't use their incisors to eat ; they pluck plant parts with their lips and chew on them with their molars .
A hippo can chomp down on branches and leaves with a force of about 2,000 pounds per square inch , enough to cleave a luckless tourist in half ( which occasionally happens during unsupervised safaris ) .
By way of comparison , a healthy human male has a bite force of about 200 PSI , and a full - grown saltwater crocodile tilts the dials at 4,000 PSI .
Behavior
If you ignore the difference in size , hippopotamuses may be the closest thing to amphibians in the mammal kingdom .
In the water , hippos live in loose polygynous groups made up mostly of females with their offspring , one territorial male and several unallied bachelors :
The alpha male has a section of beach or lake edge for a territory .
Hippopotamuses have sex in the water — the natural buoyancy helps to protect the females from the suffocating weight of the males — fight in the water , and even give birth in the water .
Amazingly , a hippo can even sleep underwater , as its autonomic nervous system prompts it to float to the surface every few minutes and take a gulp of air .
The main problem with a semi-aquatic African habitat , of course , is that hippos have to share their homes with crocodiles , which occasionally pick off smaller newborns unable to defend themselves .
Although male hippos do have territories , and they squabble a bit , that is usually restricted to roaring vocalizations and ritual .
The only real battles are when a bachelor male challenges a territorial male for rights over his patch and harem .
Reproduction and Offspring
Hippopotamuses are polygynous :
One bull mates with multiple cows in his territorial / social group .
Hippo females usually mate once every two years , and the bull mates with whichever cows are in heat .
Although mating can occur throughout the year , conception only occurs from February to August .
The gestation period lasts nearly a year , with births taking place between October and April .
Hippos only give birth to one calf at a time ; calves weigh 50 – 120 pounds at birth and are adapted to underwater nursing .
Juvenile hippos stay with their mothers and are reliant on mother 's milk for nearly a year ( 324 days ) .
Female juveniles remain in their mother 's group , while males leave after they are sexually mature , about three and a half years .

Evolutionary History
Unlike the case with rhinoceroses and elephants , the evolutionary tree of hippopotamuses is rooted in mystery .
Modern hippos shared a last common ancestor , or " concestor , " with modern whales , and this presumed species lived in Eurasia about 60 million years ago , only five million years after the dinosaurs had gone extinct .
Still , there are tens of millions of years bearing little or no fossil evidence , spanning most of the Cenozoic Era , until the first identifiable " hippopotamids " like Anthracotherium and Kenyapotamus appear on the scene .
The branch leading to the modern genus of hippopotamus split off from the branch leading to the pygmy hippopotamus ( genus Choeropsis ) less than 10 million years ago .
The pygmy hippopotamus of western Africa weighs less than 500 pounds but otherwise looks uncannily like a full - sized hippo .
Conservation Status
The Internal Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that there are 115,000 – 130,000 hippos in central and southern Africa , a sharp drop from their census numbers in prehistoric times ; they classify hippos as " vulnerable , " experiencing a continuing decline in area , extent , and quality of habitat .
Threats
Hippopotamuses live exclusively in sub-Saharan Africa ( though they once had a more widespread distribution ) .
Their numbers have declined most precipitously in the Congo in central Africa , where poachers and hungry soldiers have left only about 1,000 hippos standing out of a previous population of almost 30,000 .
Unlike elephants , which are valued for their ivory , hippos do n't have much to offer traders , with the exception of their enormous teeth — which are sometimes sold as ivory substitutes .
Another direct threat to the hippopotamus is the loss of habitat .
Hippos need water , at least mudholes , all year round to take care of their skin ; but they also need grazing lands , and those patches are in danger of disappearing as a result of climate - change - driven desertification .

12 Evilest Pope Pictures
Pope Benedict XVI has been given a lot of flack lately , but in all of this it 's important not to forget what the man is actually good at : looking absolutely bloodcurdlingly godawfully creepy .
Here 's a selection of some of Benny 's greatest hits , did I forget any ?
KABUL , Afghanistan —
It is being called Operation Omid .
The word omid means " hope " in Afghanistan ’s Dari language .
But , judging by the reaction of local residents , the coming U.S. - led military offensive against the Taliban in Kandahar could not be more inappropriately named .
In Kandahar , residents like Abdul Salaam , a farmer , feel more a sense of dread than hope about a military operation that is being billed as one of the largest in the war to date .
“ Operation Omid will bring more insecurity , instead of peace , ” said Salaam , who lives in the Maiwand district of Kandahar Province .
“ We have just seen that the opposition has accelerated its attacks .
There are more and more explosions in the province .
You can not bring peace through war . ”
Operation Omid will not be fully underway until early summer , according to the U.S. military .
The exact size of the force to be deployed is not yet clear , but it is expected to swallow a good portion of the 30,000 additional troops being sent to Afghanistan this year .
The operation will center on two districts — Arghandab and Zheray — rather than on the city itself .
Fighting in a major population center , moreover one that is home to some of Islam ’s most cherished relics , such as the cloak of the Prophet , would go against the hearts and minds strategy that has been a central tenet of the new U.S. strategy .
The Taliban seem eager to get things started .
Over the past week , a series of suicide explosions have rocked the city center .
This , along with the much - publicized shooting of a civilian bus by U.S. troops , has given Kandaharis a taste of the approaching conflict .
They do not seem to relish the prospect .
The U.S. military has been talking of Kandahar ever since they declared success in Marjah , a dusty patch of desert in neighboring Helmand Province .
Once the Afghan flag was raised over the Marjah district center in early March , Kandahar became the focal point of the stepped - up battle against the Taliban .
The choice of target was not coincidental : Kandahar , Afghanistan ’s second - largest city , is the spiritual home of the Taliban , the birthplace of the movement that took over most of the country in the mid to late ‘ 90s .
The city is not under Taliban control — the government , in the person of Ahmad Wali Karzai , the president ’s half - brother and head of Kandahar ’s Provincial Council , dominates the center .
This is one reason that the fighting will be spread out to the districts surrounding the center .
Observers say that this will prompt the Taliban to adopt their usual tactics — melting away until the foreign forces retreat , then flooding back into the area .
“ The armed opposition is experienced in guerrilla warfare , ” said Bismillah Afghanmal , a senator from Kandahar .
“ They know when and where to fight , and they know very well how to flee the area that is the focus of the operation .
Omid will not bring good results . ”
Some of the fighters are moving into more remote districts , but a good number are heading for the city , where they appear ready to carry out regular acts of “ asymmetrical warfare ” — suicide bombings , the planting of Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) , and other measures designed to spread terror .
As a result , the situation in Kandahar city is deteriorating rapidly , according to author Alex Strick van Linschoten , who has been living in the southern capital for more than two years conducting research on the Taliban .
“ We are running out of ways to say how bad things are , ” he said .
“ There is a general feeling of paranoia and fear — fear of what ’s going to happen tomorrow , of what the future will bring .
No one wants to be in Kandahar .
Everyone is trying to sell up and get out . ”
The panic was heightened over the past week week , when a double suicide bombing on April 15 killed at least 10 people and injured dozens of others .
The first explosion occurred outside Noor Jehan , a hotel popular with the international press , while a second , larger blast followed it hours later , when a vehicle crammed with explosives penetrated the outer defenses of a compound housing foreign contractors .
This is having the desired effect of intimidating the local population .
“ The Taliban are signaling to the foreign forces that they have the power to answer any attack , ” said Abdul Salaam .
“ They are trying to show that they have not been weakened by the Marjah operation . ”
Nevertheless , the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , has assured the Afghan people that the U.S. forces would “ absolutely secure Kandahar . ”
In a press conference in March , McChrystal outlined the military ’s plans in broad strokes .
Rather than beginning the operation with a Marjah - style bang , the Kandahar “ process ” will be more subtle , he indicated .
“ There wo n’t be a D - Day that is climactic , ” said McChrystal .
“ It will be a rising tide of security as it comes . ”
But so far the tide seems to be going out .
“ The Taliban are prepared for this operation , ” said Felix Kuehn , who along with van Linschoten co-edited an autobiography of Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaeef , former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan , who spent nearly four years in Guantanamo and now lives under virtual house arrest in Kabul .
Kuehn has also spent the better part of two years in Kandahar .
“ It will be close to impossible to stop their attacks , " he said .
The intelligence required is simply not available .
The local population does not trust the foreign forces , and knows that they will not be safe if they cooperate . ”
In Marjah , the Taliban has carried out brutal retribution against residents who are seen to assist the government or the foreign forces .
Residents tell of people being dragged out of their houses at night , hanged or beheaded , their bodies left as a warning to others .
In addition to ordinary Kandaharis , added Kuehn , the business community is also being asked to provide goods and services to the insurgency .
“ Businessmen are being pressured to team up with the Taliban , ” he said .
“ They are told , ' It is for your own good .
You know in the end we will be in control , so it is best to be on our side now . ' ”
Few are willing to bet their livelihoods — and their lives — on the success of the foreign forces , said both Kuehn and van Linschoten .
Gaining the trust and support of the local population is vital for McChrystal ’s much - touted counterinsurgency strategy , or COIN .
But it will be an uphill battle to win the hearts and minds of Kandaharis , given the current situation .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has promised local elders that the operation will not take place without their consent .
In a shura , or council , with tribal elders in Kandahar on April 4 , Karzai asked those assembled whether they wanted the operation .
They assured him they did not .
According to a journalist who was present at the shura , the mood of the gathering was openly hostile , and Karzai ’s neighbors on the podium — McChrystal and Mark Sedwill , the Senior NATO civilian representative in Afghanistan , looked distinctly uncomfortable .
Relations between the local population and the United States worsened still further on April 12 , when U.S. troops opened fire on a passenger bus near a Kandahar checkpoint , killing four and injuring 18 .
The incident sparked violent anti-American protests , as hundreds of demonstrators poured out onto the streets , blocking roads and shouting “ Death to the infidels ! ”
A week later , the anger is still smoldering .
“ All the people on that bus were innocent passengers , ” said Haji Mohammad Daud , a resident of the Karez Bazaar area of Kandahar city .
“ What will the families of the victims think ? ”
Relatives of civilian victims often end up joining the insurgency , he added .
“ The opposition uses cases like this as a propaganda tool against the government ; they tell people that foreign forces are not here to help — they have come to kill you . ”
The U.S. military apologized for the incident , calling it “ a tragic loss of life , ” but McChrystal appealed for understanding .
“ We really ask a lot of our young service people out on checkpoints because there is danger , they ’re asked to make very rapid decisions in often very unclear situations , ” The New York Times quoted him as saying .
Several hours after the bus shooting , insurgents attacked the headquarters of Kandahar ’s intelligence service .
The attackers were the only ones to die , but four officials and five civilians were wounded , further raising anxieties in the city .
Against this backdrop of fear and turmoil , prospects for success are looking dim to those on the ground in Kandahar .
“ The foreign forces will never have the knowledge and control they need to secure the city , ” said van Linschoten .
“ The Taliban are already there , and can do whatever they want .
Short of erecting barbed wire barriers and total ID check , like Baghdad in Year Zero , they can not do anything .
It is a recipe for disaster . ”
Ahmad Nadeem , a freelance journalist from Kandahar , contributed to this report from Kandahar .

LOS ANGELES —
Only miles from the scenic vistas and celebrity mansions that draw sightseers from around the globe - but a world away from the glitz and glamour - a bus tour is rolling through the dark side of the city 's gang turf .
Passengers paying $ 65 a head Saturday signed waivers acknowledging they could be crime victims and put their fate in the hands of tattooed ex-gang members who say they have negotiated a cease - fire among rivals in the most violent gangland in America .
In this Jan. 10 , 2010 photo , former gang member Alfred Lomas talks with reporters during a " LA Gang Tours " tour of Los Angeles .
If that sounds daunting , consider the challenge facing organizers of LA Gang Tours : trying to build a thriving venture that provides a glimpse into gang life while also trying to convince people that gang - plagued communities are not as hopeless as movies depict .
" There 's a fascination with gangs , " said founder Alfred Lomas , a former member of the Florencia 13 gang .
" We can either address the issue head - on , create awareness and discuss the positive things that go on in these communities , or we can try to sweep it under the carpet . "
Several observers have questioned the premise behind the tours , and some city politicians have been more blunt .
" It 's a terrible idea , " City Councilman Dennis Zine said .
" Is it worth that thrill for 65 bucks ?
You can go to a ( gang ) movie for a lot less and not put yourself at risk . "
More than 50 people brushed aside safety concerns for Saturday 's maiden tour to hear how notorious gangs got started and bear witness to the struggling neighborhoods where tens of thousands of residents have been lured into gang life .
The unmarked chartered coach wound its way through downtown .
The first sight was a stretch of concrete riverbed featured in such movies as " Terminator " and " Grease , " where countless splotches of gray paint conceal graffiti that is often the mark of street gangs and tagging crews .
After that , it was on to the Central Jail , home to many a thug , past Skid Row 's squalor and homeless masses and into South Los Angeles , breeding ground for some of the city 's deadliest gangs .
Motoring through an industrial area , the bus enters the Florence - Firestone neighborhood , close to the birthplace of the Crips and current home to Florencia 13 , a Latino gang that was accused by federal prosecutors of racist attacks against black residents .
Gray warehouses soon merge with single - story stucco homes as the bus heads south .
Few gangsters risk hanging out on street corners , as local rules mean they could get arrested even for congregating , but graffiti on walls , road signs and convenience storefronts betray the presence of Florencia 13 and other gangs .
Sieglinde Lemke , 46 , an American Studies professor from the University of Freiburg in Germany , said she enjoyed the opportunity to interact with former gang members .
" It brings to life the class divisions you have in America , " she said .
" This is an area that 's blocked out of my mental map of the States .
It 's important to get a firsthand account of the area . "
Junior high school teacher Prisca Ricks , 37 , was of two minds about going on the tour after reading critical blog comments about it being " ghettotainment . "
But ultimately , she was pleased she went , and said she appreciated the focus on trying to help the community .
Lomas , 45 , a respected activist who has worked with the faith - based Los Angeles Dream Center to distribute hundreds of tons of food to low - income families across the inner city , left gang life about five years ago .
He stresses the aim of his nonprofit company is to bring jobs to communities along the route and to reinvest money through micro-loans and scholarships , though he 's not sure how the tour will accomplish that .
He also eventually wants to start a gallery and gang museum .
He said the tour will create 10 part - time jobs , mainly for ex-gang members working as guides and talking about their own struggles and efforts to reduce violence .
The tour is initially scheduled to run once a month .
No tour quite like this runs elsewhere in the country .
Chicago has a prohibition - era gangster tour , and another Los Angeles group buses people to infamous crime scenes , including the Black Dahlia murder .
Lomas faces a quandary as he tries to show the troubled history of the area once known as South Central , before politicians renamed it South Los Angeles in 2003 in an attempt to change its deep association with urban strife .
The tour is billed as " the first in the history of Los Angeles to experience areas that were forbidden . "
But tour leaders do n't want it to be voyeuristic and sensational .
" We ain't going on no tour saying , ' Look at them Crips , look at them Bloods , look at them crack heads , ' " said Frederick " Scorpio " Smith , an ex-Crip helping narrate , who helped broker the cease - fire among the Grape Street Crips , 18th Street , F13 and the East Coast Crips .
Out of sensitivity to residents , passengers are banned from shooting photographs or video from the bus .
The only place that is allowed is near the end of the trip , when they can step off the bus and film an outdoor area where graffiti is allowed .
Stretches of the tour have almost nothing to do with gangs , but instead exploit famous chapters of violence in the city 's history , such as a deadly 1974 shootout between police and the Symbionese Liberation Army and the site of the riots that followed the acquittal of officers in the Rodney King beating .
If done right , the tour could highlight the decades - long struggle to solve the gang problem , said civil rights lawyer and gang expert Connie Rice .
Gang crime has fallen in recent years , but groups continue to grow and gain influence .
Over the past quarter century , officials in Los Angeles County have spent $ 25 billion fighting gangs only to see the number of gangsters double to as many as 90,000 and a six - fold increase in the number of gangs .
" If it is carried out well and carefully and carried out with the consent of the community , it could teach people about the very entrenched culture that gangs now have in Los Angeles , " Rice said .
City Councilwoman Jan Perry said she would rather tourists see the development potential in the neighborhoods that make up part of her district .
About two years ago , she organized her own tour in the area for about 200 real estate agents and business representatives , resulting in the development of buildings with homes and businesses .
" I 'd prefer we focus on showing the community in a positive light , " she said .

Featuring a truly unique design , Hang Nga ’s Tree House Hotel is , without a doubt , one of the most bizarre buildings in the world .
Located in Da Lang , Vietnam , Hang Nga ’s Tree House Hotel , better known as Crazy House , features giant tree trunks and branches that try to trick you into believing this is an actual tree house .
In reality , it ’s built from conventional construction materials .
But there ’s nothing conventional about the architectural principles used by Hang Nga , the woman behind Vietnam ’s Crazy House .
Daughter of a former president of Vietnam , Hang Nga was confronted with almost no restrictions at all , when she decided to build her wacky hotel .
The Vietnamese government simply looked the other way and allowed her to let loose her imagination , without considering rules and regulations .
And you can witness the end result in the photos below .
The interior of Hang Nga ’s hotel is just as unusual as the outside .
It ’s filled with unexpected twists and turns , narrow hallways , bizarre rooms and dotted with strangely shaped windows .
This is probably why Crazy House is more successful as a tourist attraction , than a hotel .
Hang Nga , who lives in her “ masterpiece ” , tries to convince people to stay at least a night , but most prefer to take some photos and look for a more conventional hotel .
Into the Wild
So , I ’m watching two douche bags wearing rhinestoned , Ed Hardy t- shirts beat the Hell out of each other on a Wednesday afternoon … I ’ve been back on Long Island for six hours .
In high school I had a science teacher who used to tell us that , “ Nature puts on the best shows in the universe , if you know where to look . ”
She was right .
When on Long Island , I find that the best place to witness local nature perform is anywhere I hear the phrase “ Strong Island ” being used .
Visual cues include , but are certainly not limited to , men with fancy eyebrows and the fashion stylings of Don Ed Hardy .
I rarely have to wait long ; but if you ’re choosing to endeavor on a safari of this type for the first time please remember my guiding principle , “ Do not interfere with nature in progress . ”
I ’m not saying if a dimwitted gazelle wanders into a herd of elephants , I ’m going to let her get trampled .
But if two idiots from the same herd want to go head to head to over whose sunglasses have the lightest tint or who has the sickest rims on their leased Expedition , I say enjoy the majesty of nature .
Merry Christmas .

NITERÓI , Brazil —
Rescue workers worked feverishly on Thursday to clear debris and uncover the bodies of as many as 200 people buried in a neighborhood built atop an old garbage dump that collapsed in a devastating landslide on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro .
Drenching rains essentially swept away the neighborhood on Wednesday night , burying dozens of homes and a small church underneath tons of rubble , mud and rotting debris .
The rains have set off flash floods and mudslides across the state of Rio de Janeiro in recent days , paralyzing Rio ’s airports and transportation systems and killing as many as 170 people .
That toll could rise significantly as the bodies are removed from the landslide .
In Morro do Bumba , a hillside neighborhood of Niterói , a Rio suburb , the rains appeared to weaken decades - old layers of compressed refuse and dirt upon which some of the homes had been built .
Around 9 p.m. on Wednesday , the neighborhood gave way .
The landslide traveled more than about 2,000 feet , destroying an estimated 60 homes and a church .
Residents said the church might have had as many as 30 people inside it at the time .

Bishop Bertone Blames Erotic Internet Sex for Priest Abuse of Children
Just days after Cardinal Ratzinger ’s “ number two ” in the Vatican – Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone – caused outrage when he blamed homosexuals for clerical abuse in the Catholic Church , a Mexican bishop he declared that the root cause was , in fact , eroticism on TV and internet porn .
Bishop Felipe Arizmendi , addressing an annual meeting of Mexican bishops near Mexico City , said :
With so much invasion of eroticism , sometimes it ’s not easy to stay celibate or to respect children .
If on television and on the Internet and in so many media outlets there is pornography , it is very difficult to stay pure and chaste .
He added :
Obviously when there is generalized sexual freedom it ’s more likely there could be cases of pedophilia .
The bishop said that loose morals in society had made it difficult to keep seminarians committed to the faith .
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone
His comments came after the Vatican tried to distance itself from remarks by Bertone , who claimed :
Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and pedophilia , but many others have shown that there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia .
The inference one can draw from that is only gay men choose to have sex with little boys .
A front - page editorial in Rome ’s left - leaning La Repubblica newspaper headed The Confusion in the Church said Bertone ’s comments would end up causing the Church more “ harm to itself , not homosexuals . ”
Bertone was also criticized by Alessandra Mussolini , a right - wing parliamentarian whose grandfather , wartime Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , sent gays into internal exile .
You ca n’t link sexual orientation to pedophilia … this link risks becoming dangerously misleading for the protection of children .
ArciLesbica , Italy ’s main lesbian rights group , accused the Vatican of using “ violent and deceptive statements ” to divert attention from its abuse scandal and said Italian parents should consider removing their children from Church - run institutions .
It has now emerged that the Bishop of Tenerife recently sought to blame the victims themselves for pedophile activities of priests .
Bishop Bernando Álvarez said that there were chil­dren who want­ed to be abused .
Bishop Bernando Álvarez
There are 13 year old ado­les­cents who are under age and who are per­fectly in agree­ment with , and what ’s more want­ing it , and if you are care­less they will even pro­voke you .
He too sought to link pedophilia with homosexuality , which he claimed was prej­u­di­cial to the peo­ple and to soci­ety , and he warned that we would pay the con­se­quences in the long term .
The bishop later did some back - pedaling in a statement that explained that he did not intend to imply that “ an event as con­demnable as the abuse of young­sters ” could be justified .
Of course not your holiness .
Thx to Free Thinkers ..
The most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy , Bartholomew “ Black Bart ” Roberts , included eighty - eight blacks amongst his crew of 368 in 1721 .
A year later , there were seventy blacks among 267 pirates .
These men did n’t do menial work , either .
They received shares in any treasure taken and voted with the rest of the crew whenever a decision had to be made .
A mulatto , who had served aboard the Royal Rover , was hanged for piracy with six others in 1720 .
One of his mates requested a bottle of wine and drank after declaring , “ Damnation to the governor and confusion to the Colony . ”
The others concurred then all were executed and hung in chains as a lesson to others .
Two years later , however , the seventy black pirates captured after Bartholomew Roberts ’ demise in 1722 were given to the Royal African Company , who promptly enslaved them .
The black pirate most written about is Black Caesar .
Legend identifies him as a tall African chief with great strength and keen intelligence .
A conniving captain lured him and his warriors aboard a slaver with greater treasures than the gold watch that fascinated Caesar .
Once on board , the captain and his men plied the Africans with food while enticing them with musical instruments , jewels , silk scarves , and furs .
With his focus on these unusual treasures , Caesar failed to notice that the slaver put to sea .
Upon learning the truth , he and his men fought the ship 's crew , but the slavers eventually subdued the Africans .
During his confinement , Caesar refused to eat or drink .
One sailor showed Caesar kindness , and the two eventually became friends .
When the slaver wrecked on the reefs off Florida , the sailor freed Caesar , and the two escaped in a long boat loaded with supplies and ammunition .
They left the others to die .
Caesar and his friend decided to attack passing ships .
Whenever one was spotted , they rowed the long boat near the vessel and pretended to be shipwrecked sailors .
Once aboard their victim , they seized control and took their treasure ashore .
Eventually , they buried a large cache of booty somewhere on Elliott Key , or so legend says .
One day Caesar ’s friend brought a beautiful woman to their island .
The two men argued , and Caesar slew his friend and took the woman for himself .
Alone , he continued his piratical raids until he acquired a number of ships and men .
They attacked passing ships , then escaped into the coves and inlets where their prey could not pursue them .
Another Caesar , who became a pirate sometime in the early 1700s , joined forces with Blackbeard .
Prior to that he was a slave owned by Tobias Knight of North Carolina .
In November 1718 , Lieutenant Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy and his men attacked Blackbeard near Ocracoke Island .
Under his captain ’s orders , Caesar stood in the powder room with a lit match .
If the navy succeeded in subduing the pirates , he was to blow up the ship .
He was about to do just that when two prisoners , whom Blackbeard had stowed below during the fight , stopped Caesar .
He was taken to Virginia and convicted of piracy .
Whether he actually danced the hempen jig in Williamsburg is unknown ; some accounts say he was pardoned .
Caesar was the only one of the five black pirates – James Black , Thomas Gates , Richard Stiles , and James White being the others – arrested who refused to give evidence against his comrades .
Blacks became pirates for the same reasons as other men did , but they also sought the freedom often denied them elsewhere .
W. Jeffrey Bolster wrote in Black Jacks ,
" No accurate numbers of black buccaneers exist , although the impression is that they were more numerous than the proportion of black sailors in commercial or naval service at the time . "
( Bolster , 13 ) It is n't known how many of the estimated 400 pirates hanged for their crimes between 1716 and 1726 were black , for the historical record fails to show this .
Like their brethren who were n't given the chance to stand trial , but were sold into slavery , these pirates remain lost to history .
Meet Other Black Pirates
In 1731 Juan Andres ( Andresote ) was the leader of some runaway slaves and Indians .
These villains plundered and murdered along the coast of Venezuela .
Authorities assumed he had died when two years later the attacks ceased .
In reality , he merely moved to the safety of Curacao before resuming his bloody assaults .
One hundred years after Black Caesar died , another man of mixed parentage adopted his name .
Black Caesar ( II ) attacked ships off Florida ’s east coast , but in 1828 , President Andrew Jackson ordered the area be swept of pirates .
Black Caesar ( II ) escaped to the west coast .
One story says he was captured and burned to death , but there is no definitive record as to his fate .
Peter Cloise , a slave , became a pirate after Edward Davis took him from his owner in 1679 .
They became close companions and went on pirating expeditions in the Caribbean and along South America ’s Pacific coast .
After Davis ’ ship put into Philadelphia in May 1688 , Cloise was arrested .
His fate remains unknown .
In late September 1720 , Captain Nicholas de Concepcion and 140 pirates ( Spaniards “ and others of diverse Nations ” ) cruised the waters of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay aboard a well - armed Spanish brigantine from Saint Augustine .
Their first capture was a Philadelphia sloop named Mary , commanded by Captain Jacobs .
She carried a cargo of bread and flour .
Concepcion decided she would make an excellent consort to the pirate brigantine .
Captain Sipkin was master of the pirates ’ second capture .
A prize crew was put aboard and the ship set sail for Saint Augustine .
The pirates seized a pink , bound to Virginia from Barbados , in the Chesapeake Bay on 23 September .
Her captain was a man named Spicer .
Once again Concepcion sent a prize crew aboard the pink to sail her to Florida .
Sometime later , Concepcion and his men took a Liverpool merchantman named Planter that was eventually retaken .
During a search of her papers , her rescuers discovered a forged letter of marque from the Governor of Saint Augustine .
It was dated after the war between England and Spain ended .
Attempts were made to capture the pirates , but they escaped .
Little is known of Domingo Eucalla ’s pirating career , but he and ten others were hanged in Kingston , Jamaica on 7 February 1823 .
Before he died , he gave a passionate speech and a prayer .
He showed the most courage of the pirates awaiting death that day .
Diego Grillo , also known as “ El Mulato , ” was of mixed ancestry – African and Spanish .
After escaping from Havana , Cuba , he went on the account .
When Henry Morgan sacked Panama in January 1671 , Grillo captained a ship mounting ten guns .
He refused to accept the king ’s pardon , preferring instead to remain a pirate .
He and his men attacked Spanish ships from a fifteen - gun ship and sold the booty in Tortuga .
Three ships were sent to capture him , but he defeated them all and slaughtered every sailor aboard who had been born in Spain .
He eventually was captured in 1673 and hanged .
Francisco Farnondo captured 250,000 pieces of eight in a single incident .
Afterward , he retired .
Old South , a mulatto , led the men who sailed aboard Good Fortune .
Although his true name has been lost , , a mulatto , led the men who sailed aboard
Hendrick Quintor , a mulatto born in Amsterdam , sailed aboard the Whydah .
Before he went on the account , Quintor was a crewman on a Spanish brig .
He was hanged in Boston .
Diego de los Reyes , a mulatto from Cuba , earned the nickname “ Diego Lucifer . ”
He hunted during the 1630s and 1640s .
Abraham Samuel , the son of a Martinique planter and a black slave , went on the account under Captain John Hoar .
After cruising the Caribbean , the John and Rebecca sailed for richer prey in the Indian Ocean .
At some point Samuel ’s fellow pirates elected him their quartermaster .
After capturing a prize near Surrat , the sea rovers put in at St. Mary ’s in February 1697 .
Unbeknownst to them , the Malagasy had rebelled against Adam Baldridge , the retired pirate who became the go - between for the pirates and New York merchants who bought their booty .
Captain Hoar and a number of pirates died in the uprising , but Samuel and others escaped .
They set sail for New York , but the ship sank after hitting a reef near Fort Dauphin , an abandoned French settlement .
After the death of her husband , the chief ’s wife ruled the Malagasy .
One day she saw the shipwrecked men bathing in the ocean and noticed strange markings on Samuel ’s body .
They were the same markings her own child had had , but she had n’t seen her son in many years .
His father , a Frenchman , had taken the child with him when he fled Madagascar in 1674 .
The woman declared Samuel her long - lost son and made him chief of the Malagasy .
With the assistance of his fellow shipwrecked pirates , some of whom became his bodyguards , and the Malagasy , Samuel traded with slavers and pirates alike .
Fort Dauphin became popular it rivaled St. Mary 's as a trading center .
In November 1699 , Samuel assessed an American slaver £ 100 for a trading license .
The following year , Captain Littleton , a member of the English Royal Navy , invited Samuel and two of his wives to dine with him aboard his ship .
Littleton reported Samuel was much loved by the Malagasy .
In September 1699 , a pirate named Evan Jones raided an American slave ship in the port .
He gave the ship to Samuel , who sold it to four other pirates for 1,100 pieces of eight .
He signed the document detailing the purchase and added " King of Fort Dauphin , Tollannare , Farrawe , Ganquest , and Founzahíra . "
News of the attack and sale , and Samuel 's participation in it , spread and ships ceased to visit the port .
When a Dutch slaver anchored there in December 1706 , Abraham Samuel was gone and the new chief declined to discuss his fate .
Stewart
, a mulatto , and three whites seized the Amity off the coast of Virginia in 1785 .
They swore to “ Perform on a Cruce [ cruise ]
In Defense of Our Selves and Against all Other Nation and Nations . ”
If any one of them broke these articles , they agreed the guilty party would “ Be Put to Death or any Punishment that the Rest shal think they Justley Deserv . ” ( Bolster , 16 )
Hendrick van der Heul

No video for now ( they ’re a bit time consuming to produce , so I ’m waiting until I have more to show ) .
Each of the map themes has a gameplay flavor to it , and this one adds a whole new tile called a Toggle Space .
If you were an Outwitters fan , you might know these as Capture Spaces – it ’s the same mechanic with a very different movement system !
Simply run ( or swat , or dash ) a minion across the space to claim it .
If your team still owns the toggler at the start of your turn , the map ’s laser turret with automatically fire on a random enemy !
It deals a reasonable two damage for a modest advantage that ’s super satisfying .
I ’m jumping straight into the next map now , which will feature more Toggle Spaces that control a different map advantage .
Other changes this update : Lolli now needs 3VP to use his Captain ’s Gambit .
Units like the Sniper can now shoot through allied units , just like their own .
Added legs to the Captains ’ victory / defeat portraits
Added more rollover tips for special spaces , and changed the way hex snapping / hovering works .
An exciting update to the Hex Gambit : Respawned Demo and Beta today : the eighth and final minion class is here !
The Punk is a combat unit that punches well above his weight .
His Roll ability lets hims cut through lines of minions , dealing damage to any enemies you can line up , and providing a little extra mobility .

Split Strike is the main reason I wanted to squeeze him in before calling the minion roster done .
It deals damage equal to half your target ’s HP , rounded up .
So the bigger they are , the harder it hits !
Other fixes and changes in 0.1.5 : Redistributed the minion loadouts for extra variety .
Smarter AI is now smarter .
Changed the way activate / deactivating minions works under the hood .
Overhauled camera system to behave itself .
Fixed floating minions on the Battle Hall maps .
Grim Drake ’s Gambit will no longer target spawning minions .
The captains and map updates gave me a lot of pretty new content to showcase , so I thought it was time for another trailer !

Other fixes and changes in 0.1.4 : Swapped the Cancel and Accept buttons for controllers !

The writer is a Jerusalem - based rabbiand lawyer with an international relations degree from GeorgetownUniversity .
He is the author of

Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu made a mistake in not attending the International Nuclear Summit in Washington earlier this month .
Not only should he have attended , but he should have also dropped this ( pardon the pun ) bombshell : “ Israel is now prepared to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty . ”
That , of course , would lead to a reverse in the decades ’ long policy of obfuscation about our nuclear program , admitting publicly for the first time what everyone already knows .
Netanyahu should not have stopped there .
He should also have seized the opportunity – and the world ’s stage – to declare Israel ’s willingness to not only open up its nuclear facilities for inspection , but also a desire to reduce , and eventually completely decommission , our entire nuclear arsenal .
What could justify such a dramatic reversal of policy ?
It is not , as some readers might assume , because I am a wild - eyed , naïve liberal who never found a weapons system I did n’t hate nor a war worth pursuing .
To the contrary , most people who know me would consider me a part of the right - of - center camp .
Indeed , as a student of realpolitik , I firmly believe in not only the projection of power ( as a necessity for deterrence ) but also actual power itself .
And if I ever had any doubts , I eerily completed writing the above sentence just as the soul - piercing siren blasted here in Israel to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day .
Upon hearing it , I dutifully rose from my chair and stood silently in contemplation .
For those two minutes during which this siren rang on the outside , the conviction to never allow Jews to relinquish the ability to defend themselves rang equally powerfully on my inside .
SO WHAT gives ?
Why should Israel voluntarily relinquish its nuclear weaponry , our most powerful commitment to and meaningful expression of the phrase “ never again ” ?
There are two answers :
The world has changed , and our values have not .
Let ’s talk about the world first .
When Israel developed nuclear weapons , our neighborhood was populated by some very dangerous – but marginally rational – states .
The threat of being wiped off the map by an Israel that felt it had no other available option provided the necessary incentive for these states to behave slightly more rationally and slightly less dangerously .
Nuclear weapons , therefore , made sense .
In deterring our enemies from taking too risky a gamble at destroying us , they lowered the flame of both the potential for war as well as the intensity of one if in fact it broke out .
Today , however , our nuclear arsenal is beginning to play an entirely different role .
Rather than keeping the flame low , it is inspiring others to pursue their own nuclear ambitions – and unfortunately , it is our justified desire to prevent these ambitions from being fulfilled that might ignite the next significant war .
So rather than serving as a deterrent for war , it might actually become an accelerator .
Additionally , it might very well be the relative powerlessness of these states that has inspired them to use terror proxies to attack us on our northern and southern borders .
Which leads me to the next point :
The greatest threat to Israel ’s existence today does not emanate from these dangerous state actors alone , but also from a variety of dangerous nonstate actors – such as terrorist entities which might somehow acquire a small nuclear device capable of being concealed in a suitcase .
Against such a threat , our nuclear arsenal is impotent .
After all , unlike our enemies of days gone by , these terrorists have no address to send a return package .
Worse still , they would enjoy nothing more than the chaos and condemnation created by pushing Israel into a corner where it might actually push the button .
In such a new world , the once sanguine policy of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) is simply mad .
And then , of course , there are our values , which thankfully have not changed .
Simply put , Judaism cherishes life and commands us to pursue policies that protect it at every turn – first , of course , the lives of our own people ( as is the responsibility of every state ) , but also significantly , the lives of innocent people everywhere .
A few decades ago , the policy of nuclear ambiguity fulfilled this directive beautifully .
War was minimized because the threat to our enemies of annihilation was not .
Today , Israel must continue to project power in a number of ways to continue to protect life , and for that reason I am a firm believer in a strong army and a strong – and immediate – response to any threat confronting the country .
But the projection of nuclear power is not one of those ways .
If Iran acquires the bomb , what will happen ?
Are we prepared to preemptively launch a nuclear attack sure to kill millions of innocent civilians ?
I ca n’t imagine that would be the case ; such a scenario , one very much unlike our preemptive military attack in 1967 , is the polar opposite of our commitment to life .
On the other hand , if our nuclear weapons are used merely in response to an Iranian attack , that means we ’re all probably dead and Israel is an uninhabitable wasteland .
In such a case , our arsenal is not a deterrent but rather a tool for vengeance .
TODAY , THE most important nuclear goals we can pursue are to prevent Iran from acquiring such weapons and to limit nuclear technology in such a way as to minimize the risk of it falling into the hands of a terrorist organization .
Our nuclear arsenal cannot help in either cause .
If , however , we become the first nuclear power to voluntarily eliminate our nuclear stockpile – a stockpile , as I suggest above , which no longer helps us anyway – we are in an infinitely better position to pursue both of these goals .
We remove the alleged justification for any of our enemies to pursue their own nuclear program .
We remove any hesitation other states might have harbored as an excuse to pursue sanctions against Iran – and military intervention if it becomes necessary .
No longer can it be argued that Iran is simply defending itself .
Orthat a double standard exists .
Or that the world ’s tolerance of Israel ’s nuclear program means that everyone has a right to thetechnology .
On the positive side , it allows Israel to not only attendthese conferences on nuclear policy with its head held high , but alsofrees us to take a leadership position in the decommissioning ofnuclear weapons everywhere .
And that might just change the world yet again , this time for the better – and thanks to our values .
The Accidental Zionist
Thank goodness Victoria University ’s $ 60,000 “ Eyelink 1000 ” eye - tracking device was available recently to psychology PhD student Barnaby Dixson , for now we have more clarity on what , exactly , men think of women ’s breasts .
Dixson recruited men to look at images of naked images of women that were digitally altered to increase or decrease the size of her bust and the color of her areola ( the ring around the nipples ) .
In keeping with evolutionary theory and previous experiments on men ’s breast size preferences , Dixson hypothesized that guys would gaze longer at larger breasts and prefer light areolae .
Fair to light pigmented areolae and nipples would be considered sexier , he reasoned , because these hormonally - sensitive features darken with pregnancy and with age .
He also asked the guys to rate the attractiveness of each photo .
But the results were n’t exactly as expected .
Turns out that men did indeed rate women with medium - sized and large breasts as more attractive than women with small breasts .
But variation in breast size did not affect their eye movements — they were just as likely to fixate on small breasts as large ones , and for the same number of times .
And the nipple data was even more shocking .
The first thing men fixed their gaze on was women ’s areolae .
And while they fixed their gaze just as often and as long on pale nipples as dark ones , the majority expressed a distinct preference for dark areolae .
Dark nipples appear to play a significant role in men ’s judgments of women ’s attractiveness .
Like large breasts , Dixson reasoned , dark areolae suggest sexual maturity .
Yes , older and pregnant women have darker nipples than younger women , but those pigment changes also come from hormones that suggest fertility — high levels of estrogen and progesterone .
Is a successful line of nipple and areolae blush in this PhD student ’s future ?
Philippa talks about consent and how women can react to sexual violence , compared to how juries and others expect us to react .
Jack Tweed and Anthony Davis have been found not guilty of raping a teenage girl .
While this verdict has now been passed , and I therefore cannot suggest that either of them are guilty , I do want to challenge the idea that a woman not saying no means that you are able to just fuck them .
In Davis ’s testimony , it turns out that
The court heard that in the police interview Mr Davis said he saw his friend having sex with the woman against a window and that “ she did n’t protest it ” .
“ She did n’t say ‘ stop ’ .
She did n’t say anything to suggest she did n’t want it to happen , ” he added .
“ She did n’t say anything at all . ” “ I just got closer and closer .
She did n’t say anything . ”
It is never ok for a man to presume that he can fuck a woman based on the fact that she is being fucked by someone else , and that when he approaches she does n’t say anything .
Hugo Schwyzer says , “ The opposite of rape is not consent .
The opposite of rape is enthusiasm ” , and there is a lot of truth in that .
Davis went on to say
“ If a girl had been assaulted or raped , she would have come out of that room traumatised .
“ She would have been screaming , surely someone would have heard something . ”
This is a common misconception , and one which contributes to the low conviction rates of rapists in this country .
That rape victims behave in a certain way .
If she is not screaming and crying , if she does n’t instantly call the police , then she ca n’t have really been raped .
Women cope in whatever way they can in order to survive .
This can include denial and withdrawal as much as anger and seeking justice .
There is a lot of shame for rape survivors , and a lot of self - questioning , which can mean that women do not immediately tell people – least of all the police , who do n’t have a great reputation for sensitivity in these situations – what has happened .
This does not mean it did not happen !
aest.org have an article about Rape Trauma Syndrome which outlines and explains some of the many possible reactions that people who have been raped can experience and display .
I ca n’t comment on Tweed and Davis being found not guilty .
But I am using some details of their testimony to challenge some commonly - used assumptions about women ’s reactions to male violence , which apply in many rape cases we see .
The teenager charged with murdering 19 - year - old Michelle Morrissey in Mudgee in central western New South Wales has been shot while allegedly fleeing custody .
Luke Cotterill , 18 , was being transported from Bathurst to a mental health unit at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre in Sydney when it is alleged he tried to escape .
Corrective Services Commissioner Ron Woodham says Cotterill was confined to an isolation cell on the bus after other prisoners threatened to kill him .
Through the CCTV view of the cell , the two guards on the bus witnessed him attempt to hang himself .
After pulling over on the Great Western Highway , one guard entered the cell unarmed where Cotterill appeared to be unconscious .
It is alleged that Cotterill then kicked the guard and ran outside .
He was then shot three times - once in the hip , leg and arm .
Commissioner Woodham believes the guards did their job .
" If they want to play those games and run away from us there 's a price they 'll pay , and they could get hurt , " he said .
Cotterill is now in a stable condition at Westmead Hospital .
Candy and food giant Nestle is finding itself between a rock and a hard place .
The online campaign against Nestle continues : today protesters once again posted thousands of negative messages on the company ’s Facebook page , most demanding that Nestle cut out palm oil linked to deforestation from its products .
At the same time , a new problem has cropped up for Nestle : Indonesian oil palm planters are threatening to boycott Nestle products .
Proving that the issues surrounding oil palm and deforestation are nothing if not complex : Facebook protestors say they will boycott Nestle if it does n’t cut out all links to Sinar Mas , a company that Greenpeace has linked to deforestation , whereas the Indonesia Palm Oil Growers Association are preparing a boycott if Nestle stops buying from Sinar Mas , according to the Jakarta Globe .

“ About 10 million oil palm farmers in 20 Indonesian provinces have stated their readiness to boycott Nestle products .
Apkasindo [ Indonesian Palm Oil Growers Association ] is now preparing to draw up a list of Nestle products on the market , ” Asmar Arsjad , Apkasindo secretary general , said over the weekend , adding that if Nestle stops buying from Sinar Mas it would hurt palm oil producers .
Adding fuel to fire , Antara News reports that Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil producers are threatening to stop exports of crude palm oil to the US and the EU if negative campaigns over their environmental practices continue .
Palm oil , the world ’s most productive oil seed , has come to be used in everything from food products to cosmetics .
Nestle has already promised it will stop purchasing from Sinar Mas due to a report from Greenpeace showing that the Indonesian company was involved in destruction of rainforests and peatlands for oil palm plantations .
However , Nestle still buys indirectly from Sinar Mas , since one of its suppliers , Cargill , buys from the Indonesian company .
Greenpeace and thousands of online protestors are demanding that Nestle sever all ties with Sinar Mas , direct or indirect .
The company has responded that it will purchase only sustainable palm oil by 2015 — a comment that angered most .

By virtue of its high yield , palm oil is a cheaper substitute than other vegetable oils .

The online protest against the multi billion - dollar corporation , which began last Wednesday , took on a life of its own after the company had a Greenpeace video criticizing the company removed from YouTube , citing copyright violations .
This action , seen by many as censorship , caused the video to go viral : it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times since .
Statements made by Nestle on their Facebook fan page , which many viewed as rude , only worsened the situation for the company .
At the crux of the conflict is the importance of the world ’s rainforests for mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity .
Indonesia is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world due largely to deforestation .
Between 1990 and 2005 , Indonesia lost more than 28 million hectares of forest , including 21.7 hectares of virgin forest .
The country ’s forest cover has declined from 82 percent in the 1960s to less than fifty percent today .
One of the world ’s most biodiverse countries , many of Indonesia ’s species are gravely threatened by deforestation , including both the Bornean and Sumatran orangutans ; Asian elephants ; Sumatran tigers ; Javan and Sumatran rhinos ; several species of tarsiers ; the small wild cattle , anoa ; and the proboscis monkey to name a few .
In all , Indonesia is home to over 30,000 recorded species of plants and over 3,000 mammals , birds , reptiles , and amphibians .
Yet , the deputy assistant of biodiversity conservation at the State Environment Ministry , Utami Andayani , recently told the Jakarta Post that likely only half of Indonesia ’s species are known to science .

Orangutans vs palm oil in Malaysia : setting the record straight
( 01/16/2010 ) The Malaysian palm oil industry has been broadly accused of contributing to the dramatic decline in orangutan populations in Sabah , a state in northern Borneo , over the past 30 years .
The industry has staunchly denied these charges and responded with marketing campaigns claiming the opposite : that oil palm plantations can support and nourish the great red apes .
The issue came to a head last October at the Orangutan Colloquium held in Kota Kinabalu .
There , confronted by orangutan biologists , the palm oil industry pledged to support restoring forest corridors along rivers in order to help facilitate movement of orangutans between remaining forest reserves across seas of oil palm plantations .
Attending NGOs agreed that they would need to work with industry to find a balance that would allow the ongoing survival of orangutans in the wild .
Nevertheless the conference was still marked by much of the same rhetoric that has characterized most of these meetings — chief palm oil industry officials again made dubious claims about the environmental stewardship of the industry .
However this time there was at least acknowledgment that palm oil needs to play an active role in conservation .

Consumers should help pay the bill for ‘ greener ’ palm oil
( 01/12/2010 ) Palm oil is one of the world ’s most traded and versatile agricultural commodities .
It can be used as edible vegetable oil , industrial lubricant , raw material in cosmetic and skincare products and feedstock for biofuel production .
Growing global demand for palm oil and the ensuing cropland expansion has been blamed for a wide range of environmental ills , including tropical deforestation , peatland degradation , biodiversity loss and CO2 emissions .
In response to these concerns , a group of stakeholders — including activists , investors , producers and retailers — formed the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) to develop a certification scheme for palm oil produced through environmentally - and socially - responsible ways .
It is widely anticipated that the creation of a premium market for RSPO - certified sustainable palm oil ( CSPO ) would incentivize palm oil producers to improve their management practices .

Unilever suspends palm oil contract after supplier found to be destroying rainforests
( 12/12/2009 )
The world ’s largest user of palm oil , Unilever , has suspended its $ 32.6 million contract with the Indonesian group Sinar Mas after an independent audit proved that Sinar Mas is involved in the destruction of rainforest , reports Reuters .
The audit was conducted early this year after a report by Greenpeace alleged that Sinar Mas was engaged in deforestation and the draining of peatlands , both of which release significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
Deforestation across Indonesia and Malaysia , in part for oil palm plantations , has also added pressure on many many endangered species , including orangutans , tigers , elephants , and rhinos .

A moorland peatbog is to be dug up wholesale and put into storage for more than 30 years in an unprecedented measure to protect it from destruction .
The peatbog on Shetland is in the way of a gas processing facility which is to be built as an extension to the Sullom Voe oil terminal on the island .
The oil company Total has agreed , as part of the deal to be allowed to build the £ 500 m gas facility , to store the peat so that it can be returned at the end of the plant 's operational life .
It 's estimated that more than 260,000 cubic metres of peat – enough to fill 100 Olympic swimming pools – will have to be cut out and moved away to be piled up in " peat terraces " and covered with a layer of vegetation to protect them from drying out .
Peat bogs are an increasingly rare feature of the British and European landscapes because so many have been drained to turn them into agricultural land .
Others have been dug up for the gardening industry .
They are formed over many years as layer upon layer of vegetation dies and is covered up by more plants .
Because of the low oxygen levels the dead plant material is preserved rather than decomposing , which means that peat stores huge quantities of carbon and when burned or broken up releases it back into the atmosphere , contributing to global warming .
Peatlands are calculated to lock in twice as much carbon as forests , despite covering just 3 per cent of the land .
Brian O'Neill , a spokesman for Total , said the peat would be kept in conditions as close to their natural state as possible .
" It will be wetted by the rain and drain in a similar way as it would naturally , which should ensure it is maintained in the same kind of wet anoroebic conditions as in nature , " he said .
" The condition of the peat in the stores will be monitored through the life of the plant to ensure it remains in a suitable condition to be used for site restoration . "
The International Peat Society , which monitors peatlands across the globe amid concerns they are disappearing , welcomed the innovative decision by Shetland Islands Council to insist on the peat being stored rather than destroyed .
There remains , however , uncertainty about whether the peat , which will be stored within the perimeter of the gas plant , will survive the process .
A report by the council cautioned : " There is no absolute certainty that the peat will be suitable for site restoration at the end of the gas plant 's life . "
The new gas facility , which it is estimated will be operational for 30 to 35 years , is intended as a staging post for gas piped from fields that are to be drilled west of the Shetlands .
Once processed at Sullom Voe , the gas will be piped to the St Fergus terminal near Peterhead and then put into the national gas grid .
Andrew Cougar , of Scottish Natural Heritage , described peatbogs as an " incredibly important " part of the landscape and said : " There is a real rarity value to the Scottish peatlands .
But because it seems we have so much of it here in Scotland we may tend to take it for granted . "
Peatlands are home to wildlife including birds such as red- throated divers and whimbrels .
Only a tiny fraction of Britain 's ancient peatlands remain because of extraction , drainage , erosion and overgrazing .
Peatbogs contain so much water that when drained the ground level can slump by several feet .
Sphagnum moss , a common component of the vegetation covering peat , can contain 20 times its own weight in water .
WINSTON - SALEM , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Inspired by a standard office inkjet printer , U.S. researchers have rigged up a device that can spray skin cells directly onto burn victims , quickly protecting and healing their wounds as an alternative to skin grafts .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
They have mounted the device , which has so far only been tested on mice , in a frame that can be wheeled over a patient in a hospital bed , they reported on Wednesday .
A laser can take a reading of the wound ’s size and shape so that a layer of healing skin cells can be precisely applied , said the team at Wake Forest University in Winston - Salem , North Carolina .
“ We literally print the cells directly onto the wound , ” said student Kyle Binder , who helped design the device .
“ We can put specific cells where they need to go . ”
Tests on mice showed the spray system , called bioprinting , could heal wounds quickly and safely , the researchers reported at the Translational Regenerative Medicine Forumb .
“ We were able to close the entire wound in two weeks , ” Binder said .
Mice with plugs of skin removed that were not treated took five weeks to heal , he said .
The team will eventually seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to test the device on humans , said George Christ , a professor of regenerative medicine at the school .
They are working with the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine to come up with ways to help soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It could be used to close various types of wounds as well as burns .
Binder and colleagues dissolved human skin cells from pieces of skin , separating and purifying the various cell types such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes .
They put them in a nutritious solution to make them multiply and then used a system similar to a multicolor office inkjet printer to apply first a layer of fibroblasts and then a layer of keratinocytes , which form the protective outer layer of skin .
The wound on the mouse was completely closed by three weeks , they reported .
Experts say victims of massive burns usually die of infection within two weeks unless they receive skin grafts , and normal grafting often leaves severe scars .
The sprayed cells also incorporated themselves into surrounding skin , hair follicles and sebaceous glands , probably because immature cells called stem cells were mixed in with the sprayed cells , the researchers said .
“ You have to give a lot of credit to the cells .
When you put them into the wound , they know what to do , ” Binder said .
The next step is to try the system on pigs , whose skin more closely resembles the skin of humans .
Binder said it may also be useful for treating diabetic foot ulcers , a common problem .

" He may be bit of a geek , " a recent Cosmo piece begins , " but the guy you 've always thought of as ' just a friend ' could be the best boyfriend you 've ever had . "
Or , you know , he could be a total jackass .

To celebrate the film She 's Out Of My League , which appears to be yet another movie based around an unlikely relationship between the stereotypical " dorky dude " and the stereotypical " hot girl , " Cosmo suggests that we all should consider dating the Brian Krakows and Duckie Dales in our lives for reasons that seem to have been plucked from Encyclopedia Stereotypica .
Let 's take a look at a few of their pro-geek dating points , shall we ?
Although the dumb jock thing is a total cliche , you 're unlikely to meet a dorky guy who can't string together a sentence and carry on an intelligent conversation .

Oh , that 's right !
The " dumb jock " thing is a total cliche , but the " smart dork " thing is n't a cliche at all !
Everyone knows that every single dorky , awkward person on earth also has an IQ of 140 + .
Have n't you guys ever seen The Big Bang Theory ?
That 's totally representative of every geek on Earth .
I saw it on television , so it must be so !
Sure , he may secretly want to get it on with his super hot neighbor , but knowing that you 're the hottest girl he 's ever been with will probably keep him from cheating .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Is this or is this not one of the most pathetic things you 've ever read ?
What kind of relationship is based on this kind of gross " I 'm so much hotter than him , he wo n't cheat on me " mentality outside of 7th grade ?
He was probably bullied during high school so he 'll be sympathetic when you vent about the office bitch ... and help you plot a plan to bring her down .

Ah yes , the geek sympathy card .
As someone who rocked coke - bottle lenses and front teeth that turned in the opposite direction in middle school , I certainly understand the trauma of growing up on the dorkier side of things .
But the creepy wave of geeky guys who use their awkward pasts to justify heinous behaviors in adulthood , particularly the manipulation of women , has really got to stop .
The faux " nice guy " who was " there all along " does n't automatically get to get in your pants , or treat other people like shit just because someone shoved him in a locker in 7th grade .
Sorry dudes .
It does n't work that way .
The notion that geeks are some weird breed of angelic , flawless dudes who would never be mean , never cheat , never lie , never hurt you , and are owed your love and affection somehow is extremely tired and ridiculous , as is the heavy reliance on high school stereotypes to push some sort of flipped romantic ideal .
Not every jock is straight out of Varsity Blues , and not every geek is a knight in shining armor , and if you need to go through a stereotypes checklist in order to justify dating someone , the problem you have in finding a decent relationship can probably be found in the mirror .

The Associated Press ( of all people ) published a story on a troubling trend wherein overtly partisan operatives " are bankrolling startup news organizations around the country . "
It is an apparent attempt to exploit the ailing news business by " fill[ing ] a void created by the downsizing of traditional " media .
These efforts are almost exclusively run by conservatives and are popping up nationally in places like Michigan , Texas , Florida , Montana , and more .
The pseudo - news enterprises are deliberately trying to pass themselves off as traditional news sites on the Internet .
But their origins are somewhat mysterious , as is their financing .
The reporting jobs at these outfits often pay better than conventional news gigs , sort of like PR .
In applications for local press credentials these groups refuse to identify their financial backers .
If nothing else , that absence of transparency is sufficient cause to be suspicious .
This initiative to inject rightist propaganda into local reporting did not spring up out of nowhere .
Two years ago I wrote an article about plans just like these that were just being formulated .
They were hatched by the National Legal and Policy Center , a right - wing think tank that argued that ...
" The long - term decline in newspaper circulation presents the conservative movement with an excellent opportunity to increase its influence with the media .
Falling readership and tighter budgets are forcing newspapers to dedicate fewer staff to investigative reporting .
As a result , they are increasingly relying upon nonprofit organizations to fill the gap . " [...and... ] " [ B ] y aggressively getting involved in investigative journalism conservative nonprofit organizations stand to enormously change the terms of the media debate , perhaps in much the same way that Fox News and Talk Radio revolutionized media coverage . "
The National Legal and Policy Center has received about 73 % of their foundational funding since 1995 from the ultra- right Scaife family of foundations ( The Scaife Family Foundation , the Sarah Scaife Foundation , and the Carthage Foundation ) who are famous for financing wild conspiracy theories and extremists in the media .
The plan , then as now , is for conservative think tanks to produce stories that they could feed to newspapers and television who , due to their desperation for content , would gladly publish it .
This is not unlike the Bush administration 's illegal distribution of propaganda through the use of video press releases and payoffs to pundits and celebrities .
It is just shifting it to the private sector where it could pick up steam from aggressive fundraising , marketing , and the absence of oversight .
This plan is now beginning to take shape .
The AP 's reporting documents precisely the sort of journalistic charade that conservative strategists have been plotting for years .
This makes it more critical than ever to be vigilant and to pay attention to where the " news " is coming from .
And do n't be shy about exposing the masquerade and embarrassing any press outlet that engages in it .
A lawyer for the Vatican claimed , in a statement earlier today , that the two years it took the current pope to defrock a convicted pedophile was quick .
But in 2006 he excommunicated an Archbishop who defied the celibacy doctrine ' automatically ' .
On September 24th 2006 Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo , of Zambia , defied the Vatican by ordaining four married priests .
On September 26th the Vatican issued a press release announcing that he had been excommunicated for " ordaining bishops without the approval of the Holy See . "
On December 11th 2006 , in defiance of that excommunication , Milingo ordained a further four married priests in Washington .
On December the 17th , six days later , the Vatican issued a press release announcing that he had been dismissed " from the clerical state " — apparently an extraordinary measure that made the participation of Catholics in any ceremonies led by him unlawful ( in the eyes of the church ) .
" The commission of these grave crimes , which has recently been established , " said the press release , " is to be considered as proof of the persistent contumacy of Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo .
The Holy See has therefore been obliged to impose upon him the further penalty of dismissal from the clerical state . "
All the clergy he ordained were excommunicated automatically too .
Milingo had been defying the church for many years .
But when he finally committed what the Vatican thought was a ' grave crime ' , there was no delay .
Flagrantly breaking with the doctrine of celibacy was met with swift , decisive condemnation .
The men he ordained were removed immediately too .
In 1978 the Reverend Stephen Kiesle , of Oakland , California , pleaded no contest to charges of tying up and molesting two young boys in a rectory .
He was not removed from the church until 1987 , despite requesting it himself in 1981 .
A portion of that delay meant that Kiesle was still dealing with children .
The Associated Press have a letter from the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , about removing Kiesle — a process that took days in the case of Milingo in 2006 .
He said that " the arguments for removing Kiesle were of " grave significance " but such actions required very careful review and more time . "
It was not the only occasion that such " careful review " , was required .
In two other cases that we know of , in Germany and in Wisconsin , he failed to act decisively to remove known pedophiles from the church .
The German priest , the Reverend Peter Hullermann was , according to the New York Times , " later convicted of molesting boys in another parish . "
All of Fox News was atwitter yesterday morning with the big break news that someone had taken a shot at the office of Republican Rep. Eric Cantor , the House Minority whip .
Cantor himself went on TV and pronounced :
Just recently I have been directly threatened .
A bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office in Richmond this week .
Moreover , he blamed all of this violent behavior breaking out everywhere on the Democratic congressmen who are standing up and calling it out :
It 's reckless to use these incidents as media vehicles for political gain .
That is why I have deep concerns that some - DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen and DNC Chairman Tim Cain , in particular - are dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon .
But then the whole story came out :
In a news release Thursday , police said the bullet struck at about 1 a.m. on Tuesday .
The preliminary investigation showed that " a bullet was fired into the air and struck the window in a downward direction , landing on the floor about a foot from the window .
The round struck with enough force to break the windowpane but did not penetrate the window blinds .
There was no other damage to the room , which is used occasionally for meetings by the congressman . "
The building , which has several tenants including an office used by Cantor , was unoccupied at the time , the news release said .
Richmond police spokesman Gene Lepley told CNN Friday that it was the result of " random gunfire . "
Gee , sounds awfully familiar .
This is just like Lou Dobbs ' attempts to gain martyrdom .
Meanwhile , none of the right - wing bloggers who raced to get this story up -- folks like RedState , Gateway Pundit , Schmuck of Spades , and Daily Caller -- have bothered to update their posts and correct the record for their readers .
Which means , of course , that you have a broad swath of wingnuts who really believe Eric Cantor 's office was shot at too .
Yet another addition to the already ridiculously long list of provably untrue things right - wingers believe .
SHOCK ADMISSION : Leith Castle , 36 , hands himself and his stash of drugs over to the head of New Plymouth CIB 's drug squad , Detective Sergeant Greg Gray , yesterday .
Police were astounded when a man claiming to be a methamphetamine dealer walked into the New Plymouth station and handed over his stash yesterday .
Leith Castle , 36 , arrived at the station just before 5 pm with ten $ 200 bags of the class A drug , a glass pipe used to smoke it , two bags of cannabis and gave it to Detective Sergeant Greg Gray , head of the CIB drug squad .
Earlier in the day Mr Castle , who was fidgety and rocked uncontrollably during the whole process , contacted the Taranaki Daily News and asked a photographer and reporter to accompany him and to record what he was doing .
ILLEGAL STASH : Leith Castle , 36 , shows the Taranaki Daily News a handful of packages of methamphetamine shortly before he handed himself and the drugs over to police yesterday .
" I want it recognised so it does n't just get taken off me and I get thrown out of the door , " he said .
" I 've got to be the craziest person in the country . "
A surprised Mr Gray , who said he had no idea what was going on , took Mr Castle into an interview room and asked him what he wanted to happen .
" I want to be arrested and I want this to go to court and I want witnesses to be called , " Mr Castle said .
He admitted to smoking " impossible amounts " of meth over the years .
Mr Gray was stunned by the admissions .
" As strange as it is , we do n't often have drug dealers come in and offer themselves up , " he said .
" These are fairly drastic measures to take , " Mr Gray said .
Mr Castle told the reporter he believed police had been following him hoping he would lead them to a big supplier .
" If I 'm wrong then I 'm wrong , but if I 'm not then I 'm right . "
Earlier Mr Castle told the Taranaki Daily News he had bought the drugs in New Plymouth from people he suspected were undercover police officers .
He alleged undercover police were trying to use others , including prostitutes , to " get " to him and he wanted it to stop .
" I do n't really care what happens to me .
At the end of the day it will stop all of the kids getting screwed to get to me .
It will get me off the scene so they can't try to get to me .
" This is the only way I could fight it .
You can't fight the police on the street , " Mr Castle said .
He asked Mr Gray to have the drugs tested as he believed they had been tampered with .
Mr Gray said he was happy to listen to any concerns Mr Castle had but did not want to do it in front of the media and we were asked to leave .
After police interviewed Mr Castle he was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine for supply .
He was in police custody overnight and will appear in the New Plymouth District Court today .
Mr Gray said he had never experienced such a situation in 22 years on the force .
" It is probably a little bit out of the ordinary for somebody to come in and admit what they are doing , " he said .
Police will investigate Mr Castle 's claims .
" There are aspects of Mr Castle 's situation that he outlined to us in relation to his suppliers and we are conducting inquiries to verify those or otherwise , " Mr Gary said .
Outside the police station the man who dropped Mr Castle off said he had been behaving the same way for years .
The man said he feared that Mr Castle would have been " rolled " if he had not handed himself in .
Samsung ’s Galaxy S , an Android 2.1 smartphone first unveiled at CTIA 2010 , made a good impression thanks not only to its above average specs but its 4 ″ WVGA Super AMOLED capacitive display .
Easily a front - runner for the most gorgeous screen on a mobile phone to date , it appears Samsung is convinced not everyone will be keen to leave greasy fingerprints all over the display as word is the Korean company is working hard on finishing up the Galaxy S Pro.
Rumored to be nearly identical to the Galaxy S when it comes to critical specs , the Galaxy S Pro would mainly be differentiated by its full - QWERTY keypad .
Speaking for ourselves we ’re not super enthusiastic about this idea based on nothing more than Samsung ’s track record of unimpressive keypads , but we ’re curious to know what you all think of this .

Nurse Whistle - Blower Not Guilty for Reporting Doctor Jury rules
Texas whistle - blower fired for confidential letter is not guilty .
Feb. 11 , 2010  -- A
Texas jury has found veteran nurse Anne Mitchell not guilty of harassment after she wrote a confidential letter to the Texas Medical Board complaining about a doctor she believed practiced shoddy medicine .
Her lawyer , John H. Cook IV , announced the verdict today on the fourth day of the trial in Andrew , Texas .
Jurors took less than an hour to reach their verdict .
" We are glad that this phase of this ordeal has ended and that Anne has been restored to her liberty , " Cook told media today .
" But there was great damage done in this case , and this does not make them whole . "
Mitchell , 52 , could have faced 10 years in prison for doing what she believed was her obligation under the law -- to report unsafe medical practices .
The verdict could have had a profound effect on whistle - blowers in Texas and nationwide .
Mitchell had asssumed the letter she wrote to Dr. Rolando Arafiles Jr. was anonymous .
Instead , he fired her after reporting her to the local sheriff -- a former patient and admirer of the doctor -- for maliciously ruining his reputation .
Police in Kermit , Texas , searched Mitchell 's computer and found the letter , then charged her with " misuse of official information " in her role at Winkler Memorial Hospital , a third - degree felony in Texas under an abuse - of - power statute .
The case was so contentious that it set friends against one another in this oil and cow town of 5,200 near the New Mexico border , and had to be moved miles away to a state court in Andrew , where the trial got under way Monday .
Local residents worry about losing doctors and nurses .
There are only a dozen nurses and three doctors in all of Winkler County .
" Who wants to move to the desert , you know ? " resident Bryant Van Zandt told ABCNews.com .
" Who wants to move out here in the middle of nowhere ? "
" I think that nurses must be on the side of patients , " added resident Phil Parks .
" They spend more time with patients than doctors do . "
" The doctor himself , he saved my life in October , " said local resident Betty Edwards . " So I have very high aspirations for him . "
Arafiles is still practicing medicine at Winkler Memorial Hospital .
The case sent shock waves around the country , particularly among the state and national nursing associations , which raised $ 40,000 for Mitchell 's defense .
They said they 're afraid that if she is found guilty , there will be no watchdogs for unsound or unsafe medicine .
" This would be a true implosion for the nursing profession , because nurses might think twice about what they report , " said Gwen Agabatekwe , a nurse who flew from St. David Medical Center in Austin to sit in on the pretrial hearings on the case .
" If they see something that 's not right or unsound or unsafe , it 's our obligation to report it , " said the 54 - year - old who is a member of the National Nurses Organizing Committee - Texas , which sponsored the whistle - blower legislation .
" We are here to protect and serve , much like policemen and firefighters , " she told ABCNews.com .
" If a professional person is not acting [ safely ] , they need to be called on it . "
Charges against Vickilyn Galle , a nurse who helped Mitchell write the letter and was also fired , were dropped by the prosecution last week .
All along , Arafiles said he was the victim in the case , even though he had been reprimanded several times by the hospital .
" I 'm the first one to testify today , " was all he would say as he entered the courtroom Monday .
Fired Nurses File Civil Lawsuit
Mitchell and Galle , who both now live in New Mexico , have fired back with a civil lawsuit against the county , hospital , sheriff , doctor and prosecutor , accusing them of vindictive prosecution and denial of the nurses '
First Amendment rights .
According to the Texas Occupations Code , " a nurse may report a licensed health care practitioner , agency , or facility that the nurse has reasonable cause to believe has exposed a patient to substantial risk of harm as a result of failing to provide patient care . "
Mitchell alleged that Arafiles had improperly prescribed herbal medicines he sold on the side and performed unauthorized surgical procedures .
In her letter to the medical board , she cited a skin graft she said he'd botched in the emergency room , where he did not have surgical privileges .
She said Arafiles sutured a rubber tip to a patient 's crushed finger for protection , an unconventional remedy that was later flagged as inappropriate by the Texas Department of State Health Services .
When the medical board notified Arafiles of the anonymous letter in April 2009 , he went to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts -- his former heart patient -- claiming he was being harassed .
Roberts ordered the search warrant to seize the nurses ' computers and found Mitchell 's letter
The sheriff , who has served the city for 18 years , has told reporters that Arafiles was " the most sincerely caring person I have ever met . "
Two months later in June , the nurses were fired without explanation , according to Mitchell 's civil suit .
Mitchell said in her suit that she and Galle began to worry about Arafiles in 2008 , just after the hospital hired him , but administrators did not pay attention to their concerns .
They cited six cases " of concern , " including recommending to patients that they use an herbal supplement he sold on the side .
But the prosecution insists that Mitchell had a history of " inflammatory " remarks that slandered Arafiles .
To get a conviction , prosecutors had to prove that Mitchell used her position to spread information for a " nongovernmental purpose " with intent to harm the doctor .
Arafiles , 47 , received his medical degree in his native Philippines and trained in Baltimore and Buffalo , and now practices family medicine at Winkler Medical Center .
The state medical board , which licenses and regulates doctors , had its own sharp words for the legal action .
" Our mission at the Texas Medical Board is to protect patients through the regulation of doctors , " said spokeswoman Leigh Hopper .
" That said , we are a complaint - driven agency and the only way that we learn that something may be amiss with doctors is when it comes from co-workers , doctors , peers in the hospital , patients and patients ' families .
" We take it very seriously , it 's our job , " she told ABCNews.com .
" It 's sort of an alarming idea that somebody reporting a doctor of concern has to be afraid of criminal charges . "
Texas Medical Board Chastised Doctor
The board gets 6,000 complaints and investigates about 2,800 of them a year -- at least one of them about Arafiles , who had a contract to oversee medical care at a weight - loss clinic .
A year before Mitchell 's letter in April 2007 , the Texas board slapped the doctor with a $ 1,000 fine and ordered him to complete additional " continuing medical education in the area of ethics , medical records and the treatment of obesity . "
Arafiles was also prohibited from supervising physician assistants or advanced nurse practitioners .
According to that order , Arafiles supervised a physician assistant and oversaw the protocol for using phentermine -- an appetite suppressant and amphetamine -- for treatment of obesity that can cause hypertension .
The board said that he only spent 5 percent of his professional time at the clinic and did not " adequately document the physician assistant 's efforts to counsel patients , regarding other , healthier treatments for obesity , other than medicine . "
But , Arafiles ' lawyer insisted , " The town has not heard the whole story . "
" The only side of the story that the town has heard is that these are sisters of mercy , missionaries of peace , " prosecutor Scott M. Tidwell told The New York Times .
" If you look at every Gallup Poll , nurses come out No. 1 in public trust and ethics every year except 2001 , when it was the firefighters , " Charles Idelson , spokesman for the California Nursing Association , which had been carefully watching the case , told ABCNews.com .
" The reason for that is when you are in a hospital bed and vulnerable , you can count on a nurse to the advocate for you . "
About a decade ago , Miguel Torres planted 104 hectares of pinot noir grapes in the Spanish Pyrenees , 3,300 feet above sea level .
It ’s cold up there and not much good for grapes — at least not these days .
But Torres , the head of one of Spain ’s foremost wine families , knows that the climate is changing .
His company ’s scientists reckon that the Rioja wine region could be unviable within 40 to 70 years , as temperatures increase and Europe ’s wine belt moves north by up to 25 miles per decade .
Other winemakers are talking about growing grapes as far north as Scandinavia and southern England .
Torres ’ Pyrenees vineyards are a hedge and may not be necessary .
But if climate change redraws the map of Europe ’s wine world , he will be prepared .
And his company will be one of a very few taking steps to adapt to the future effects of climate change .
How companies are preparing for these changes is a pressing topic , but when I agreed to write this piece I knew I was no expert .
I set out to educate myself by posting open requests on my finance blog at Reuters , asking my eager - to - comment audience of business wonks to tell me stories of how big corporations are getting ready .
The idea was that my readers and other bloggers would cheerfully provide me with examples of how companies are preparing for the downsides — not to mention the opportunities — of climate change .
I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of responses ; what I got was a shocking lack of evidence that the corporate sector is doing much of anything .
Most companies seem to focus solely on mitigating changes to the climate : reducing carbon emissions , improving environmental sustainability , and striving to be an enlightened steward of the planet .
Adaptation is the opposite , more pessimistic approach :
It is about ensuring survival in the exceedingly likely event that climate change occurs .
The U.S. government is trying to create incentives for businesses and their investors to plan ahead .
Newly issued SEC regulations mandate that any material risk connected to climate change has to be revealed , in an attempt to bring these issues out into the open and to allow investors to compare the ways that companies see climate risks and adapt their strategies accordingly .
There are , to be sure , a few examples of corporations that are treating climate change as an ominous reality , or even as an opportunity .
The biggest funders of Brazilian agricultural projects , state - owned banks BNDES and Banco do Brasil , are looking carefully at whether it makes sense to support projects which might not be viable in 20 or 30 years ’ time .
Agribusiness giants like Cargill and Monsanto are developing hardier crops , global shipping firms are planning for an ice - free Arctic passage [ Clive link TK ] , and power company TransAlta has scrapped potential new plants in the American West because it could n’t ensure that water rights would be available for the next 40 years .
But those are at the margins .
In the mainstream business world , climate change adaptation strategies are scant .
The reasons for inaction are sometimes simple , but also counter - intuitively complex .
Start with the superficial : Adaptation strategies have essentially zero PR value .
They have nothing to do with saving the planet .
Instead , they ’re all about trying to thrive if and when the planet starts to fall apart .
That ’s not something any savvy company wants to trumpet to the world .
Then there is the mismatch of time horizons .
Climate change takes place over decades , and corporate timescales generally max out in the five to seven year range .
Businesses typically wo n’t spend significant money planning beyond that period , especially because the effects on business models and future profitability are so difficult to predict .
It ’s easy to talk about how hotel companies with coastal property might have to face more hurricanes , or rising sea levels .
But it ’s quite hard to know what is going to happen to any given beachfront resort with a sufficiently high degree of certainty .
Given the enormous amount of variability in any complex model , if a company spent a lot of money carefully mitigating the risk of X , it could end up getting blindsided by Y instead .
“ There are very difficult models to develop , with more rain here , less rain there , ” says Andy Hoffman , associate director of the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan .
Finally , even if the effects of climate change are foreseeable , they can be impossible to hedge .
Say you ’re an electronics manufacturer who is pretty sure that climate change is going to wallop Bolivia , resulting in political unrest and a spike in the price of lithium .
All your devices run on lithium batteries , so this is a serious risk , but it ’s far from obvious what you can do about it .
It ’s silly to start stockpiling lithium , and you ca n’t even bet on rising lithium prices 10 years from now , since it ’s not a metal that is heavily traded in the futures markets .
Essentially all that you can do is be very clear about the risk in your SEC filings , and go about your business as normal .
And identifying a risk is not the same thing as being able to negate it .
A classic business hedging strategy is to buy insurance .
Reinsurance companies have expensive and sophisticated climate - change models .
Pricing such risk is what they do .
In many cases , they will make more money as the effects of climate change become increasingly visible and expensive , since they ’ll simply raise premiums on everybody while refusing to insure the most vulnerable at any price .
But insurance does n’t work very well as an adaptation strategy .
Policies only last for one year , or at most two .
The insurance companies do n’t need to charge higher rates now if they see big and nasty things happening to the global climate in 20 years ’ time — they can continue more or less as they are for the time being .
It ’s easy to forget that if you ’re simply renewing an insurance policy every year : the existence of the insurance market gives companies a sense of false security that their risks are hedged .
To put it another way , insurance is a highly imperfect hedge for climate change , because it can go away or rise in cost very suddenly .
After the Bhopal disaster in 1984 , pollution liability insurance first disappeared entirely , and then , when it came back , cost ten times as much .
The risk of rising insurance costs — or insurance becoming impossible to buy at any price — is something so inherently difficult to protect against , most companies do n’t even bother trying .
The behavioral economist Dan Ariely , author of “ Predictably Irrational , ” likes to say that climate change is a problem that is perfectly designed to make people do nothing :
It happens far in the future ; its effects will be felt most greatly by other people ; and the efforts of any one individual are minuscule .
Companies too tend to behave in predictably irrational ways .
Executives should try to imagine their companies 30 years down the line , struggling with the deleterious effects of climate change on profitability and corporate survival .
But they do n’t .
That ’s a job for the next CEO ’s successor ’s successor .
Right now there are a million other things that seem much more urgent , starting with this quarter ’s earnings .
Can posting a link to someone else 's website constitute defamation ?
The Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear the case of a former Green Party campaign manager who says it does .
Internet law specialists say everyone involved in web publication will be watching the case closely .
An internet law specialist says it's an important case that everyone involved in the web will be watching closely .
The top court on Thursday granted Wayne Crookes leave to appeal a British Columbia ruling that went against him in 2008 .
He had argued that when a Canadian website posted links to two U.S. websites that featured defamatory statements , it was the same as publishing defamatory material itself .
The website did not reproduce any of the disputed material , nor did it make any comment .
Is a hyperlink publication ?
Justice Stephen Kelleher of the B.C. Supreme Court dismissed the case , saying the links were like a footnote or a reference to a website in a newsletter .
" I conclude there has been no publication , " he wrote .
Crookes had launched several libel actions against members of the Green Party of Canada , Google , Myspace.com and Wikipedia .
David Fewer , director of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa , said the lower courts got the decision right and there 's concern about the high court taking the case .
" If they 're doing it to give a pretty clear validation of the decision at trial and the court of appeal . . . kind of wanting to progress the law , then it 's probably a good thing . "
But a decision overturning the lower courts in favour of Crookes could cast a chill on the web , he said .
" The Crookes case is really talking about hyperlinks , " he said .

Fewer said the internet is based on the use of hyperlinks .

TOKYO — The Japanese Coast Guard on Friday arrested an anti-whaling activist from New Zealand who had boarded a whaling ship in the southern Antarctic last month .
Peter Bethune , a member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , was brought back to Tokyo by the whaling ship , the Shonan Maru 2 , after he boarded it without permission on Feb. 15 .
Coast Guard officials were waiting for him at the docks in Tokyo , along with a throng of Japanese reporters and television crews .
Mr. Bethune , 44 , was being held in Coast Guard custody in Tokyo , said a guard spokesman , Tomoyuki Suzuki , who added that Mr. Bethune had been formally charged with “ vessel invasion . ”
A Coast Guard investigation was under way , he said , and it was expected that Mr. Bethune would be transferred to police custody on Sunday .
Japanese media reports suggested that Tokyo intends to use Mr. Bethune ’s arrest as a warning to Sea Shepherd to end its confrontations on the high seas with Japan ’s whaling fleet .

THE long - anticipated nuclear renaissance has arrived .
In his State of the Union address last month , President Barack Obama announced plans for the US to build a new generation of nuclear power plants , and his budget for 2011 proposes large funding increases for the industry .
Several European countries are also likely to restart their nuclear power programmes soon .
The UK plans to increase to 20 per cent the proportion of its electricity generated from nuclear .
A return to nuclear power is attractive right now for many reasons .
It promises to help cut carbon emissions …
Twitter launched it ’s @anywhere platform not too long ago .
This new platform integrates twitter into your site with a few lines of JavaScript .
It allows for more tweets , more traffic , more follows , more engagement , more users , and more insight .
You can now embed a tweet box on your site where people can directly tweet from your site .
It also converts all twitter usernames to a link ( @wpbeginner ) .
If you enable the hovercard option , then users will see a hover box with a follow button and user information .
You can also create connect with twitter buttons , follow @wpbeginner on twitter buttons and much more .
We think this new platform will play a huge part in the future of web as twitter grows .
In this article , we will share how you can add some elements of Twitter ’s anywhere platform on your WordPress blog .
Update : Twitter is turning off @anywhere API on Dec. 6th , 2012 .
Here is more details .
Step 1 : Registering an API
Before you can add the anywhere platform on your site , you need to register an API .
You will be prompted to a page which would look like this :
Once you register , you should receive an API key .
Next thing you want to make sure is that the permission level is set to Read and Write , otherwise users would not be able to click the follow button .
This is a glitch with twitter , but they are working on it to fix this .
But to stay on the safe side , we will provide the directions on how to do this .
First click on the link http://twitter.com/oauth.
On this page , you will see the application that you registered .
Click on your application ’s name , and it should take you to the application details page .
There is a button called “ Edit Application Settings ” .
Click on this button to go to the edit page where you will need to scroll down to the item labeled “ Default Access type ” .
Change this to “ Read & Write ” .
Step 2 : Implementing it on your site
Because there are numerous features in the anywhere platform , we will explain each of them one by one .
First thing you need to do is call the main JavaScript .
Twitter recommends that you place this script in your header .
php file ( < head >
In between these two codes < / head > ) .
< script src= " http://platform.twitter.com/anywhere.js?id=YourAPIKey&v=1 " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
Remember to add your API key where it says YourAPIKey in the link .
Now lets take a look at the individual features this platform can do for you .
Auto - Link all Twitter usernames
This function will auto - link all twitter usernames on your posts and comments .
If you mention a twitter username in this format : @wpbeginner <<
It will automatically be linked to the appropriate twitter account .
This can save you a lot of time if you write posts with mentions to twitter users .
To add this feature , you simply paste the following code in your site 's header , after the main script .
[ php ] < script type = " text / javascript " > twttr.anywhere(onAnywhereLoad ) ; function on AnywhereLoad ( twitter ) { twitter.linkifyUsers ( ) ; } ; </script > [ / php ]
This will link all twitter usernames mentioned in your body tag excluding the links , scripts , iframes , text area , title tags , and other buttons .
Auto - Link all Twitter usernames with a Hovercard
This feature auto - links all twitter usernames found on the page , and it also provides a hovercard on a mouseover effect .
So when your site ’s user bring the mouse over to a username like @wpbeginner they will see a hoverbox like shown in the example above .
If they click the follow button , then they can directly follow the user from your website .
To enable this function , simply paste the following code in your site ’s header below the main script .
< script type =" text / javascript " > twttr.anywhere(onAnywhereLoad ) ; function on AnywhereLoad ( twitter ) { twitter.hovercards ( ) ; } ; </script >
Smart Follow Buttons for Twitter
Smart follow button lets your user follow your account directly from your site .
You can create buttons for your site and use them in your post or anywhere else .
See the live example below :
To add this type of button your site , first paste the following code in your site ’s header below the main script :
< script type =" text / javascript " > twttr.anywhere( onAnywhereLoad ) ; function on AnywhereLoad ( twitter ) { twitter ('#follow-wpbeginner ' ) .followButton ( " wpbeginner " ) ; } ; </script >
Second , you need to add the following div tag where you want this button to show :
< div id =" follow - wpbeginner " ></div >
Remember to change wpbeginner to your username otherwise it will show a follow link to our twitter account .
Live Tweet Box on your site
You can create a tweet box on your site which will allow users to directly tweet from your site without ever going on twitter .
An example of this box can be seen below : ( Remember if you click tweet , it will tweet ) .
Try tweeting from the live box above to see how cool it is .
We would really appreciate if you tweet the default content , so it helps us
Well as you can see that this live tweet box is really powerful .
You can even add Retweet text in there if you want with slight customization .
To add a live tweet box on your site , first paste the following code in your site ’s header after the main script :
< script type =" text / javascript " > twttr.anywhere( onAnywhereLoad ) ; function on AnywhereLoad ( twitter ) { twitter ( " #custom - tweetbox " ) .
tweetBox ( { label : " Live Tweet Box : " , defaultContent : " Everyone should follow @wpbeginner for awesome # Word Press tips " , height : 50 , width : 480 , } ) ; } ; </script >
Then add the following code where you want to display the live tweet box :
< div id =" custom - tweetbox " ></div >
We see that there are already few plugins in the WordPress plugin directory that lets you use the basic features such as hover card , or auto - link .
You can use those plugins if you want , but this is something so simple that you are better of placing the codes manually .
If you liked this article then please retweet it .
If we missed anything then please let us know in the comments .

Google have replaced their normal logo for a doodle of the Hubble telescope to celebrate its 20th anniversary .
Hovering your mouse pointer over the telescope brings up the words “ 20th Anniversary of Hubble Telescope Launch by NASA ” .
Clicking on it brings up the Google search page for “ Hubble Telescope ” , while clicking on “ I ’m feeling lucky ” brings up the Hubble ’s own website .
What is much more interesting is if you click your mouse on one of the stars in the picture you are then directed to google sky , a space version of google street - view that allows you to zoom in to see the stars at a very high - resolution ; nearly all of the articles covering this Google doodle have missed this .
Hubble is 20 years old today , it is due to be retired in 2013 .
It orbits Earth every 96 minutes , 360 miles above the surface of our planet , at a speed of five miles per second .
It has beamed hundreds of thousands of images back to Earth , it has allowed scientists to estimate that the universe is around 13 billion years old and has been key to understanding dark matter .
30,000 research projects have been successfully concluded as a result of Hubble .
Its replacement , the James Webb Space Telescope is expected to launch in 2014 .

IN 1997 Labour swept the Conservatives from power .
Five years ago Labour won an unprecedented third term .
This time around , things look extremely close .
This evening , our map will be updated every half an hour , showing the changes as they happen .
At the start of the evening , constituencies will be lightly shaded to reflect the situation at the dissolution of Parliament on April 12th .
As seats are declared , they will be re-coloured in bolder tones .
Move your mouse over any constituency to see the latest set of results .
At the bustling Counter Terror Expo in London ’s Olympia this week they are giving top billing to the security industry ’s favourite politician .
‘ The most experienced cabinet minister of modern times ’ , they call him : Dr John Reid .
Home office colleagues say Reid — Labour hard man , former secretary of state for health and defence , and home secretary — is the minister who brought business in from the cold .
These days relations are warm and cosy .
Marketing their wares as vital to the war on terror , while dreaming up everyday applications for intrusive high security kit , Reid ’s friends have quietly advanced deep into the public sector — running schools , GP clinics and police investigations .
Out of government but still a serving MP , Reid has been taking £ 50,000 a year from G4S — the Group 4 Securicor giant .
He has been hosting ‘ business breakfasts ’ , and talking up the scary threats and looming crises — cyber attacks , pandemics , global warming , energy shortages , mass migration — that spell opportunity to his friends .
( They ’ve made him honorary professor at the shadowy new Institute of Security and Resilience , at University College London ; staff are n’t allowed to say whether industry is paying the bills . )
Life is good for G4S whose annual revenues have doubled to £ 6 billion in the past five years .
Last month they picked up contracts for guarding foreign office buildings in the UK and in Afghanistan .
They can afford to pay chief executive Nick Buckles ( pictured ) £ 3,835 every day .
G4S — slogan ‘ Securing Your World ’ — runs prisons , secure training centres and immigration centres including Tinsley House , where last year an asylum seeker who had been forcibly arrested and locked up , let go , arrested and locked up again , got predictably distressed — she was only ten years old — and tried to strangle herself .
Former Ghurkas - turned G4S personnel train British soldiers in mine clearance and ambush drills as part of their ( increasingly outsourced ) training before deployment to Afghanistan .
John Whitwam , the former lieutenant colonel managing privatised Ghurkas , explains : ‘ On Monday and Tuesday , they would be wearing Army uniform or dressed as the Taliban , by the end of the week they would be working elsewhere in G4S . ’
Taking over core public services , G4S people monitor 12000 electronically - tagged offenders , run hundreds of police and court cells , tackle anti-social behaviour and transport half a million prisoners every year — as well as doing things like covert surveillance for insurance companies .
They are aggressively expanding the market for intrusive high security kit , touting number plate recognition technology to retailers so they can tell how frequently customers drop by .
They ’re installing CCTV in schools — giving parents ‘ an added sense of security ’ — and more cameras in shopping centres , harvesting information about how we shop .
They ’re promoting biometrics to help employers catch workers trying to cheat the clock - in system .
Their newest division screens and vets employees , not just at recruitment , but all through their working lives .
That ’s G4S , ‘ Securing Your World ’ .
All sorts of questions spring to mind .
Do we want our world secured this way ?
What on earth was G4S doing locking up that little girl ?
Is the rise in surveillance evidence - based ?
Or is it Nick Buckles and his mates chasing five grand a day ?
Whose interests has John Reid been serving all these years ?
And . . . are environmentalists so very dangerous that G4S had to deploy Ghurkas — battle - hardened in Iraq and Afghanistan — to protect ‘ sensitive utilities ’ ahead of last year ’s London Climate Camp ?
Were they serious ?
Or was that a sales - boosting stunt ?
G4S has even got a ‘ police business unit ’ , whose managing director said late last year :
‘ We have a team of 30 of our guys in one force on a major investigation right now , practically doing all of the roles except that of the senior investigating officer . ’
Does that make us feel secure ?
Or would we rather have real police officers , trained for public service ?
G4S is n’t the only gigantic security company doing surprising things .
There ’s Serco , ‘ Bringing Services to Life ’ and misery to thousands of children who have passed through the company ’s Yarl ’s Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire .
Business is brilliant .
Shortly after celebrating record annual results — profits up 30 per cent to £ 177 million — chief executive Chris Hyman ( £ 3,233 every day ) spent one recent bright spring day down at Silverstone , test - driving his team ’s Ferrari F430 ahead of the new racing season .
Besides locking up asylum seekers ‘ with respect and understanding ’ , Serco brings its ‘ deep public service ethos ’ and ‘ commercial know - how ’ to defence , transport , civil government , science , the private sector and , with rising excitement , education and the NHS .
They have got an awful lot under corporate control .
Serco trains RAF helicopter crews , helps run the National Nuclear Laboratory and the Atomic Weapons Establishment .
They sell intelligence systems to law enforcement agencies including the National Crime Squad and the tax - man .
They help police forces connect intelligence with number plate recognition in systems so fast and flexible they can easily adapt to new police powers .
Serco supplies the rising numbers of covert surveillance vehicles that police forces demand , builds and runs prisons and youth offender facilities , monitors electronically tagged offenders , enforces curfews .
They ’re running state schools in Bradford , Walsall , Stoke - on - Trent , they ’ve got their fingers on 3,500 Sure Start children ’s centres .
They provide out - of - hours GP services in Cornwall , employ ‘ community matrons ’ in Newham , they manage stacks of PFIs and will take more than £ 250 million from the NHS over the next ten years for pathology services alone .
They ’ve got 7000 security - cleared staff working on ‘ significant elements ’ of the government ’s counter - terrorism strategy .
And guess who has won the freshly privatised cabinet office contract to run the Emergency Planning College at Hawkhills in North Yorkshire ?
Yes .
From Friday , Serco controls the training of the people who would take charge during emergencies and disasters when the Civil Contingencies
Act — the one with all those alarming arbitrary powers — kicks in .
‘ The challenges we face are unprecedented , ’ says Serco .
‘ They call for a seamless , holistic approach to security and civil contingency . ’
Yikes .
For someone who gets so much business from the UK government , Chris Hyman seems surprisingly unruffled by the election .
‘ We have very significant business with local authorities , ’ he told CNBC ’s business channel earlier this year .
Regionalisation , ‘has gone very well with us . ’
And anyway , ‘ It ’s pretty much , we work for the civil servants really .
There ’s not much that we do that has to go through Parliament for decisions . ’
If that ’s the case , then we must rely on civil servants to fight our corner should conflicts arise between the interests of society and the security industry .
Conflicts like this one , maybe .
For years , doctors working among asylum seekers noted disturbing numbers of injuries to people being moved about by private security companies .
Two years ago , doctors and lawyers from Medical Justice published a report about it — called Outsourcing Abuse .
The government asked former Northern Ireland police ombudsman Dame Nuala O’Loan to make independent inquiries .
Reporting last month she said there was , ‘ inadequate management of the use of force by the private sector companies ’ , and made 22 recommendations for change .
The civil servant nominally in charge of the companies is Lin Homer , chief executive of the UK Border Agency .
Responding to O’Loan ’s criticisms , Homer spoke not a word against her commercial partners .
She saved her reproach for the doctors and lawyers who had brought these troubling matters to light .
Their offence ?
‘ Seeking to damage the reputation of our contractors ’ .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DAVID v. GOLIATH PRODUCTIONS announced this week that their new and highly anticipated documentary , 8 : THE MORMON PROPOSITION , a film by Reed Cowan & narrated by Oscar - winning writer of MILK , Dustin Lance Black , will debut its world premiere at the world renowned SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL in January 2010 .
Reed Cowan saying today , " I ’ve had a chance to talk to our film ’s narrator , Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black about our SUNDANCE acceptance and he is thrilled .
Our Executive Producer Bruce Bastian is thrilled and our other Producers , Steven Greenstreet , Emily Pearson and Chris Volz are also ... over the moon .
Additionally , our production staff which includes Richard Samuels and Brian Bayerl of Greendoor Productions and Jess Elwood our animator are also thrilled .
Months ago , in an interview with THE ADVOCATE magazine , SUNDANCE ’s John Cooper said : " I think we ’re going to see a lot more hard - hitting political documentaries .
Prop. 8 was sort of a wake - up call .
I can see that fire in the belly to finish this thing off , to get to the next phase in American life . "
Everyone involved with 8 : THE MORMON PROPOSITION is honored to be a part of what Mr. Cooper was talking about .
8 :TMP is indeed the hardest - hitting political documentary to be released in years .
It is to Mormons and their anti-gay allies what Fahrenheit 9- 11 was to the Bush Administration .
That ’s why our team will have a ground presence in Park City and Salt Lake City the likes of which has never been seen before through our SLC manager Jacob Whipple .
For that , we ’ll be enlisting the help of thousands of people ... details to come .
This is an important film .
Our team believes it strikes at the heart of one of our country ’s highest held values — separation of church and state .
And mostly , this film is important because it honors in a very respectful and dignified way , those who felt the sting of prop .
8 and other legislation like it .
This is their story .
And with the invitation from SUNDANCE , it will now be the world ’s to experience .

Salt Lake Crawler : Prop 8 film ' kind of scary '
The Hollywood Reporter takes top prize for including this illuminating exchange in their Sundance piece :
Of cheeky note is the inclusion of the Spotlight documentary " 8 : The Mormon Proposition , " from director Reed Cowan .
Sundance watchers will remember that last year 's festival was threatened with a boycott as a result of the Mormon church 's support for the passage of California 's Proposition 8 , which outlawed same - sex marriage in the state .
The festival 's " crime " was that it is held in Utah , Mormon ground zero , and one of its theater 's CEOs contributed to the campaign for Prop 8 .
The proposed protest never sat well with Sundance organizers , who pointed to the festival 's longtime support of gay - themed films .
Perhaps including " 8 " is payback ?
" I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Cooper said with feigned guilelessness .
Then he chuckled .
" I think showing ' 8 ' is going to have , especially on a local level , some controversy , " said Cooper , who remembers hearing about the work in progress from Cowan at last year 's fest .
" It teaches you a lot , that movie .
It 's kind of scary .
It spells it all out in ways that you can understand . "
P.S. Check this out : 8 - The Mormon Proposition movie ?
Should it be allowed ?
Allowed ?!?
P.P.S. Rec list ?
Seriously ?
OK , I 'll be back soon with fresh video deserving of this honor ;-)

Two officers called to a home day care to subdue an unruly 10 - year - old have been suspended after one used a stun gun on the boy and another slapped him in the mouth , a central Indiana police chief said Thursday .
The child suffered no significant injuries .
Both officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while police investigate the confrontation Tuesday at Tender Teddies .

Martinsville Police Chief Jon Davis said he believed the officers could have controlled the 94 - pound boy without using force .
“ I think they could have just restrained the young man , ” he said at a news conference .
“ Just held him down .
Might have ended the situation . ”
The Morgan County Sheriff ’s Department has taken over the investigation , and the police department plans an internal review of the incident , he said .
It was the second time police had been called to the day care for an incident involving the boy , who was not identified .
Capt .
William Jennings went to the home in February after receiving a report from a neighbor about the boy being chased through his yard .
Jennings , a 36 - year veteran , and Officer Darren Johnson responded to the home again Tuesday to find the boy hitting , kicking and spitting on a caretaker as she held him down on the front porch , according to police reports .
Another woman , identified as the boy ’s guardian , also was on the porch , and several small children watched the struggle from the front yard .

The officers tried to restrain the boy , but he remained combative and kicked Johnson , who has been with the department almost three years , according to police .
In a written report , Johnson said he showed the child his stun gun and pushed the button to display the zap of electricity .
He told the child he would use the gun if the boy did n’t settle down .
Jennings smacked the boy in the mouth after he yelled an expletive at his guardian , Johnson said .
Jennings ’ account of the incident does n’t mention striking the boy .
The boy then lunged at his guardian , and Johnson said he used his stun gun for 1 to 2 seconds .
Jennings ’ report said the boy calmed down after that .

The officers did n’t attend Thursday ’s news conference and did not have listed home telephone numbers .
E-mails from the Associated Press sent to their Police Department e-mail addresses went unreturned .
Assistant Police Chief Dan Riffel said neither officer had been disciplined previously before for excessive force .
He said he spoke with the boy and his mother Wednesday and the boy ’s only injuries were marks on his upper left arm where he was shocked by the stun gun .

Marcus Barlow , a spokesman for the Family and Social Services Administration , said Tender Teddies is a licensed home day care and his agency had received no complaints about the facility and was not investigating the incident .
A woman who answered the door at the day care Thursday declined to comment .
Tuesday ’s incident was at least the fourth time in two years in which police across the country have used stun guns on children .
A police officer in Arkansas was fired in November after using a stun gun on a 10 - year - old girl .
However , he was n’t fired for stunning the child but for violating department policy by failing to use a camera attached to the weapon .

The Martinsville police policy is to use stun guns when reasonable , taking into account the size of the officers compared to the subject and whether anyone ’s safety is at risk , Davis said .
Stun guns can be safely used on children , although the public may not find that acceptable , said Steve Tuttle , spokesman for Taser International Inc. , which made Johnson ’s weapon .
Mayor Phil Deckard said he was “ sickened ” by the incident and officials in the 12,000 - person city about 25 miles southwest of Indianapolis would n’t tolerate unnecessary force by police officers .
Some neighbors said they thought the officers went too far .

“ I do n’t think it was right , ” said Kenneth Frazier , 55 , who lives next door to the day care .
“ Police are supposed to be trained to be able to deal with adults and children . ”

After two decades of the same left turns at the same tracks over and over again , NASCAR finally upended its stagnant calendar with a 2021 schedule that is as radical as the sport has ever seen .
It is a true shakeup after a lack of imagination created the most predictable schedule in sports , one that favored new speedways - 1.5 - mile ovals that not only all looked the same , but raced the same , too .
Not since Indianapolis Motor Speedway was added in 1994 had a Cup race been awarded to a track that was not part of an ownership group for an active speedway .
Terminal Lance # 32 “ The Quest to Check Out ”
This is probably obviously inspired by recent events .
As I mentioned previously , I went on Terminal on Wednesday .
Officially now , Terminal Lance is based on a true story .
I can honestly say though , that I hated every moment of the check out process .
Running around with sheet in hand , unclear of the proper steps because TAP class ’s brief 2 minute coverage of it just was n’t pulling itself up in my memory .
The list of places you need to check out is long and terribly absurd .
I have trouble buying the idea that it ’s a completely necessary process .
I stayed my hand from doing a strip about CIF , as that was one of the trouble spots I had while in the said process .
PMO was a noteworthy adversary in my battle to check out on Wednesday .
I am staying on the island for 2 weeks , presumably to give myself time to sell my vehicles and deal with the whole housing situation .
Apparently , you ’re not supposed to go on Terminal until you ’ve already sold your vehicles , despite the fact that I showed PMO my itinerary given to me by IPAC .
The result was me having to jump through a series of hoops –steaming with the fresh stench of bullshit–to get the civilian woman at PMO to sign my sheet .
It left a rather sour taste in my mouth , but ultimately the day ended with me getting a new ID card , and a letter from the Commandant congratulating me on my honorable service .
Terminal Lance is officially Terminal .
Well , almost , 45 minutes later I got a call from IPAC telling me I was missing a couple of things from my package .
I drove back over there and handed the items over–which ultimately finished the process .
It ’s a strange feeling , knowing that the day I ’ve been waiting for for the last 4 years is here .
Stranger yet , not shaving at all for the last 3 days and walking around as usual in all my unkept glory .
In site news , as of press time I have sold and shipped 8 of the Limited Edition prints .
There are only 2 left !
I suggest buying those bad boys up before it ’s too late .
Terminal Lance is hardly going to be the last of my artistic endeavors , I assure you .
Owning the first print I ’ve ever released might not be a bad idea .
To those that have already purchased them : thank you for the support .
You may see more of these sorts of print drives and whatnot coming up .
It ’s time to face it : I ’m out of a paycheck here pretty soon .
Gotta make that green !
It ’s terribly late , so I will go to bed now .
I spent tonight ( Earth Day , mind you ) watching Avatar at my good friend Kyle ’s place .
I admire the movie for all of its technical achievements , I think it did what it was supposed to do exceedingly well .
I also recommend you all go buy it on BluRay and do n’t even bother with the DVD .
If you do n’t have BluRay players … go buy a PS3 .
Echo - Three Uniform , over and out .
Despite several claims made to the contrary over the past several months , US commander Gen.
Stanley McChrystal today conceded that there was no proof that the Iranian government has been sending fighters or weapons to Afghanistan .
Gen. McChrystal
At the same time McChrystal did note that some weapons and ammunition have crossed the border from Iran to Afghanistan and that some Taliban may have even trained inside Iran , but that they were not “ operationally significant ” amounts .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had last month accused Iran of supporting the Taliban behind the scenes , despite Iran ’s formal ties with the Karzai government and long history of animosity .
Though the flow of arms back and forth across the long , largely unguarded border is perhaps unsurprising , the claims of training camps operating in the area around Zahedan suggest that the more reasonable explanation is that Taliban receiving training there could well be forging ties with the Sunni insurgency in the Sistan - Balochistan region as opposed to the Iranian government .
In the end , it ’s usually our principles that betray us .
Former CNN chief Rick Kaplan told Ken Auletta in his 2004 biography of founder Ted Turner , “ Basically , the Fox prime - time schedule is just talk radio .
And with the networks convinced they do n’t need to cover the world , there really is a need for CNN .
You need to have one network that really covers the news , not talks about covering the news . ”
As it turns out , of course , he was wrong : Last week , Nielsen reported that CNN had lost roughly half its prime - time viewers in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier , despite news events like the Haiti earthquake .
Meanwhile , Fox News ’s “ talk radio ” on TV propelled it to second place among all cable networks in the same time period .
In 2009 , led by the twin riders of the apocalypse Glenn Beck ( up 50 percent year over year ) and his comparatively more fact - based coeval Bill O’Reilly ( up a mere 28 percent , but still boasting an audience nearly five times that of Larry King ’s ) , Fox had its best year ever .
It ’s easy to forget that CNN was once revolutionary .
Founded in 1980 , back when the idea of watching a channel other than ABC , NBC , or CBS seemed exotic ( Fox would not start for another six years ; Fox News not till 1996 ) , it was , in terms of cultural impact , the Google of its day .
Its gonzo “ fluid news ” style , low - cost methods , and disdain for the woolly orthodoxies of traditional TV news - gathering terrified the big three , and attracted their most forward - thinking journos .
And the internal contradictions in Turner ’s vision ( public service versus profit growth ) were for years obfuscated by the extraordinary cash - spewing awesomeness of the cable business .
By 2000 , CNN was making $ 300 million , causing Jerry Levin , the CEO of Time Warner , to rank CNN alongside Time magazine as the “ crown jewels ” of his empire .
It ’s hard to see the fervor of early CNN in today ’s product , with chummy King cozying up to out - of - date celebrities and the resolutely humorless Wolf Blitzer stumbling through banter with Jack Cafferty .
As with USA Today , CNN ’s best work and workers ( Sanjay Gupta , Christiane Amanpour , Fareed Zakaria ) strain to break through a stultifying smog of midmarket general - interestness , neither high - toned enough to feed into upmarket affectations nor downmarket enough to be … fun .
The news of CNN ’s decline prompted a flurry of free advice , from bringing back Crossfire to NYU media prof Jay Rosen ’s idea of having a show produced by liberals about conservatives , and vice versa .
But it ’s always easy to pontificate when you ’re not weighed down by decades of process , staff , relationships , and cash flow .
Would you want to tell Larry King it ’s time to retire ?
But CNN ’s biggest problem may actually be its founding principles .
In an era when news flows like water — available everywhere , all the time , instantly — a network devoted to providing headlines topped with a touch of analysis no longer seems quite so useful .
If anything , sitting down for 22 minutes to watch a middlebrow mix of politics and weather that ’s too proud to dabble more than passingly in the latest Hollywood crack - whoredom seems … inefficient .
What was very urgent in 1980 or on 9/11 no longer seems crucial when we ’re drowning in news .
CNN ’s decline may be , in Wall Street analyst - speak , secular as opposed to cyclical .
As bulwarks of old media are discovering , it ’s hard - to - nigh - on - impossible to refresh an entrenched brand at the speed required by our rapidly metastasizing digital culture ( and wait till we ’re all watching video on our iPads ! ) .
CNN took two generations to go from vanguard to rearguard .
It should consider itself lucky .
AOL and Yahoo , both now in the throes of their own frantic rethinks , only got one .

Speaking of ISIS , " We 're losing a lot of people because of the Internet and we have to do something .
We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what 's happening .
We have to talk to them , maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way .
Somebody will say , 'oh , freedom of speech , freedom of speech . '
These are foolish people … we 've got to maybe do something with the Internet because they ( ISIS ) are recruiting by the thousands , they are leaving our country and then when they come back , we take them back . "
Let ’s discuss some of the factors affecting the functioning of pistols in general , and short 45 ’s in particular .
To contribute to this discussion , head over to SigForum and join in .
Let ’s imagine a theoretical pistol , say a .45 caliber firing a given load , in which magazine timing efficiency and lockup were basically constant values .
This means that the magazine requires a minimum period in which to present rounds before the breechface , and that the barrel and slide remained mechanically locked together for a set travel .
Let ’s say that the variables at play are barrel length and spring tunnel length in proportion ; slide mass ; breechface over - run ( it ’s rearward travel past the magazine that , in part , dictates how much time the magazine is given to do it ’s job ) ; and recoil spring rate / weight .
Shortening the barrel length reduces total reciprocating mass , while increasing bore pressure at the muzzle which drives slide velocity as a function of the jet effect of expanding gas behind the bullet .
Thus , if we make our theoretical .45 shorter , we get faster unlocking and higher slide velocity due to reduced mass , AND even more slide velocity driven by higher residual bore pressure .
Besides rendering our theoretical pistol unpleasant to shoot , excessive slide velocity has obvious consequences in the form of increased wear and breakages , plus the possibility of recoil - induced magazine malfunctions like double feeds and the like .
We ’ve agreed that in this pistol we ca n’t decrease slide velocity by increasing lockup travel to ( partially ) compensate for reduced slide mass .
Yet , our shorter pistol has room for an even shorter recoil spring that is taxed to do even more work in less travel and with fewer coils in a shorter space .
So , an obvious answer is to use a heavier - rated spring to slow that slide down .
It makes sense .
There are some problems and limitations at work against us here , however .
First , our shorter spring needs to exert even more pressure in battery to attenuate the increased speed of unlocking from our lighter slide ; to accomplish this , we can open up the coil spacing but at the expense of significantly reduced service life as we see with the various small 1911 - style guns .
One workaround : the multui-strand spring that SIG has pioneered already .
However , that spring ’s large net wire diameter limits how short it can go .
Another ?
The flat - wound spring type .
So , let ’s say we can engineer a trick 26 - pound spring that gives us all the closing pressure against that light slide in battery we want , and slows down that gnarly slide velocity like a champ .
Great !
The problem is that we ’re up against another variable and one of our constants : we ’ve had to shorten slide stroke considerably to arrive at this small package , and thus have reduced breechface over - run .
Along with our ultra-strong recoil spring , we now are n’t giving the magazine enough time to function reliably .
Our choice of .45 ACP , being heavier and with a less - optimal transfer factor compared to other rounds like , say , 9X19 , makes this timing even more critical .
So , we decide to lose the garage - door spring and back off the tension / rate just enough to allow the mags to feed , without permitting excessive wear and breakages from too much slide speed .
Great !
Our theoretical test gun survives a torture test in fine form on our test range , fed by a stack of new mags loaded by assistants .
Why , then , do our imaginary customers complain that their pistols start in with FTF ’s after a few hundred rounds or so ?
That likely has to do with the difference in fatigue rates between magazine and recoil springs .
The same physics are at play when we shorten the magazines , and magazine springs , as well .
Unlike our torture - testers , our customers have only a few mags to work with , and as these mags take a set they no longer can keep up .
Yet another factor needs to be considered : extractor tension .
Our imaginary light slide , short barreled pistol unlocks quickly with higher residual bore pressure , and thus requires more positive extractor tension as a hedge to overcome increased case adhesion forces during extraction .
Yet , that light slide carries with it much less momentum during the feeding cycle , and we ca n’t get as much closing pressure from that short spring to overcome the resistance that our increased extractor tension exerts upon the case rim as it tries to slide up the breechface , much less from a marginally - timed , short magazine with a less - than - adequate mag spring .
Thus , the classic 3 - point FTF jam we see all the time in short .45’s .
So , we can try another workaround to deal with feeding issues caused by both higher extractor tension and a reduced magazine timing window : we increase magazine spring tension to compensate .
That , however , also has consequences as the slide has to overcome more resistance as it strips rounds out of the feedlips .
That , in brief , is an explanation of some of the fundamental problems that make shortened pistols so problematic .
The tension between these factors is difficult to balance .
If some of these factors seem familiar to your experience with various short .45 ’s , I hope it will help explain why I generally try to steer folks away from them .
I hope to lend some technical perspective to the subject of short pistols , and hopefully help explain my preference for at least somewhat longer guns .
In a world of highly critical , perhaps over - engineered handgun designs , I believe a few extra coils of recoil spring , a bit more slide mass or a little bit longer slide travel can make all the difference .
I look forward to reading your informed input and alternative viewpoints .

Summary :
The following article is reprinted from The Open Borders Network : How a Web of Alien Activists , Journalists , Corporations , Politicians , and Civil Rights Lawyers Undermine U.S. Border Security and National Sovereignty by Kevin Lamb , with permission from the publisher , Representative Government Press ( Lexington , Virginia ) .
In a less than perfect world , the allocation of rights based on territory must be defended if a ruinous breeding race is to be avoided .
It is unlikely that civilization and dignity can survive everywhere ; but better in a few places than in none .
Fortunate minorities act as the trustees of a civilization that is threatened by uninformed good intentions .
Garrett Hardin1
When it comes to advancing goals , objectives , and agendas , groups that are well organized , and consequently well funded , will eventually triumph over the unorganized , underrepresented , and underfunded .
This is the overall truism that emerges from examining the organizational structure and effectiveness of successful interest groups .
The same can be said of the organizations that comprise the open - borders network .
No matter how actively engaged grassroots , patriotic Middle Americans are in trying to individually register their views by writing their congressman or publishing letters to the editor of their local newspaper or simply casting a vote , in a pluralistic representative democracy such activities are no match for the well - organized , open - borders network and ethnic - immigrant lobbies .
Those who remain unorganized will eventually find themselves outmatched and politically outmaneuvered by well - organized adversaries .
In a pluralistic political system such as the two - party democratic republic in the U.S. or the multi-party system of European parliamentary democracies , organized interest groups can influence public policy by pressuring political and societal elites .
Immigrant organizations , such as the National Council of La Raza , promote the interests of their ethnic constituency .
Ethnicity , in the words of sociologist Robert Nisbet , “ is , and has been throughout history , one of the most dominant criteria of status . ”
Nisbet argued that “ [ e] thnicity — broadly defined — is most likely to be the basis of caste in contrast to class in society .
Even in relatively equalitarian ages , when ethnic militance and political law combine to reduce the extremer manifestations of status inequality , especially in the larger spheres of political and economic society , ethnicity continues to matter . ” 2
Nisbet ’s observation underscores the rise and influence of ethnic - immigrant interest groups in America ’s political system : Egalitarianism — the eradication of economic , social , and political inequalities — is the driving force behind the political activism of ethnic lobbies in the U.S .
The central aim of immigrant - ethnic activism is to strip out all barriers , distinctions , and obstacles to achieve full equality .
As the population of the U.S. becomes ethnically more diverse , notably in the wake of the immigration reforms of the mid-1960s , ethnic - based immigrant activists have mobilized their constituency to network with other organized interest groups on the radical Left to influence policy decisions in the U.S. and other Western democracies .
Even though ethnic - immigrant groups constitute one fraction of the greater orbit of organized lobbies ( whether civic , religious , political , social , or cultural ) , these groups network across the social , cultural , and political divide in shoring up mutual interests ( business , corporate , and labor ) to advance their agenda of a world without borders .
William Hawkins and Erin Anderson , authors of The Open Borders Lobby , identify the ideological agenda behind the push for open borders : “ The concept of ‘ open borders ’ has long been an agenda of the ideological left .
Since the 1960s , a vast network including hundreds of organizations and tens of thousands of grassroots activists , backed by hundreds of millions of dollars from leftwing foundations , has waged a sustained campaign to open America ’s borders to a mass migration from the Third World .
Though these groups talk in terms of ‘ human rights , ’ the rights they demand are not the restrictions on government enshrined in the American Bill of Rights , but the claims on society for ‘ equity ’ and ‘ welfare ’ and special treatment for designated groups that are the familiar menu of the left and would , if enacted , amount to a revolution in America ’s existing social order . ”

Immigrant - ethnic lobbies serve as the radical Left ’s cultural beachhead .
Multiculturalists — working via ethnic - immigrant advocacy groups — actively undermine America ’s national sovereignty and thwart the process of assimilation by breaking down traditional cultural barriers .
An open - borders agenda advances the goals and objectives of ethnic - immigrant and indigenous cultures to “ diversify ” America ’s European - based heritage .
The conventional idea of assimilation ( adopting the values , tradition , customs , and folkways of the host nation ) is now one of cultural accommodation , weaving the tapestry of the immigrant - ethnic culture into America ’s national fabric .
Consider the transformation over the years that has taken place in accommodating the “ diversity ” of languages with the widespread voice - bank message of a caller ’s frustration when hearing , “ press 1 for English or 2 for Spanish , ” or going to an ATM and having to “ press 1 for English ” before proceeding with a transaction .
That America has undergone and continues to undergo an unprecedented demographic transition ( four states now have minority - majority populations ) is uncontested .
What this change represents in terms of America ’s national interests , notably the preservation of America ’s national sovereignty and the nation ’s deeply rooted European cultural traditions , is a major focus of this book .
This article highlights some of the largest , most prominent ethnic - immigrant organizations pushing for open - borders and the sources of their funding .
Organized Ethnic Lobbies
League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC )
LULAC dates back to the 1920s .
The first LULAC convention was held in May 1929 .
According to LULAC ’s website ,
LULAC is the largest and oldest Hispanic Organization in the United States .
LULAC advances the economic condition , educational attainment , political influence , health and civil rights of Hispanic Americans through community - based programs operating at more than 700 LULAC councils nationwide .
The organization involves and serves all Hispanic nationality groups .
Historically , LULAC has focused heavily on education , civil rights , and employment for Hispanics .
LULAC councils provide more than a million dollars in scholarships to Hispanic students each year , conduct citizenship and voter registration drives , develop low income housing units , conduct youth leadership training programs , and seek to empower the Hispanic community at the local , state and national level .
In addition , the LULAC National Educational Service Centers , LULAC ’s educational arm , provides counseling services to more than 18,000 Hispanic students per year at sixteen regional centers .
SER Jobs for Progress , LULAC ’s employment arm , provides job skills and literacy training to the Hispanic community through more than forty - eight employment training centers located throughout the United States .
The LULAC Corporate Alliance , an advisory board of Fortune 500 companies , fosters stronger partnerships between Corporate America and the Hispanic community . ”
LULAC ’s success in attaining major funding for its various projects is evident in this abstract of an article from The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education :
The AT&T Foundation , philanthropic arm of AT&T Inc. , and the League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) have unveiled 32 locations that will house new community technology centers in low - income Hispanic communities through LULAC ’s Empower Hispanic America with Technology initiative .
The centers are being supported by a $ 1.5 million grant that builds on the success of the foundation ’s $ 1 million grant to LULAC in 2004 .
“ In addition to creating 32 new technology centers , the funds will also enable us to maintain 23 current locations established under the previous grant , ” said LULAC National President Rosa Rosales .
“ More than 55,000 Latinos received access and instruction on computer technology through AT&T ’s support in 2004 .
And we expect this new grant to more than double the number of people we can help . ”
The grant to LULAC is part of AT&T AccessAII , a three - year $ 100 million philanthropic initiative to provide technology access to underserved communities .
It will provide each new facility with computer equipment , personnel support , high - speed Internet service , and videoconferencing .
LULAC recently announced a “ partnership ” with Tyson Foods ( a company once indicted on charges of smuggling illegal alien workers into the U.S. ) to assist “ the hungry in the Latino community ” by setting up a food bank network in San Antonio , Texas .
Tyson ’s latest donations of 15 tons of protein to the San Antonio Food Bank bring the total in - kind donations ( since 2000 ) to over 50 - million pounds or 200 - million meals .
Comcast recently partnered with LULAC to launch “ Our Time to Vote , ” a year - long effort to campaign for voter education and registration in Hispanic communities .
This $ 5 million “ multicultural outreach ” campaign is part of Comcast ’s overall commitment to “ diversity ” in four key areas : “ attracting and retaining a multicultural workforce , developing a diverse supplier group , offering a wide selection of multicultural programming and pledging significant community investments . ”
“ ‘ Our Time to Vote ’ is designed to bring a wide range of diverse Americans into the voting process , ” explained Susan Gonzales , corporate senior director of federal and external affairs and vice president of the Comcast Foundation .
National Council of La Raza
The National Council of La Raza ( NCLR ) , founded in 1968 , is a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Washington , D.C. La Raza ( or “ the race ” ) maintains a network of 300 affiliate “ community - based organizations ” throughout the United States .
The Ford Foundation has provided substantial funding over the years that was instrumental to La Raza ’s founding and growth .
Other recent corporate “ partners ” include , Johnson & Johnson , Bank of America , PepsiCo , Inc. , Citi , Wal - Mart Stores , Inc. , State Farm Insurance Companies , Comcast Communications , and Verizon .
Raul Humberto Yzaguirre , born in San Juan , Texas in 1939 , served as president of La Raza from 1974 to 2004 and now works with several nonprofit organizations as an advocate for creating a political union between Mexico , Canada , and the United States .
Yzaguirre is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations and served on the Independent Task Force on North America , which published Building a North America Community and called for greater cooperation in the free movement of commerce , capital , and people in a North American union .
La Raza ’s headquarter building in Washington , D.C. is named after Yzaguirre .
Wikipedia.com summarizes the activities , goals , and objectives of the NCLR .
( Note that according to Wikipedia.com , NCLR “ advocates on behalf of Hispanics ” and informs “ policy - makers about how proposed or existing legislation affects the Latino community . ” )
NCLR works on a variety of different issues affecting the Latino community in the U.S. such as health , housing , education , workforce development , and youth leadership .
NCLR ’s Institute for Hispanic Health works to reduce the incidence , burden , and impact of health conditions such as diabetes , heart disease , cancer , and HIV / AIDS .
The NCLR Homeownership Network operates in 20 states and provides counseling on purchasing a home and managing the investment after purchase .
NCLR also has both early childhood and secondary education programs which stress literacy , college preparation , and parent involvement .
The organization ’s education programs also address the needs of Latino and English language learner students through a network of community - based charter schools .
In addition , NCLR works to increase employment opportunities for Latino youth through its Escalera program .
Youth leadership is also stressed in the Líderes initiative that links youth development organizations around the country into one national network .
Through all these programs , NCLR provides technical assistance to its network of community - based organizations around the country working on the same issues .
NCLR ’s policy team also works on a range of similar issues including civic engagement , criminal and juvenile justice , wealth - building , housing , education , health , and that for which they are most well - known , immigration .
The organization advocates on behalf of Hispanics in the United States by conducting research and informing policy - makers about how proposed or existing legislation affects the Latino community .
4
Moreover , the NCLR website describes its mission , namely to conduct “ applied research , policy analysis , and advocacy , providing a Latino perspective in five key areas — assets / investments , civil rights / immigration , education , employment and economic status , and health .
In addition , it provides capacity - building assistance to its Affiliates who work at the state and local level to advance opportunities for individuals and families . ”
National Latino Congreso ( NLC )
The National Latino Congreso is an affiliate of the William C. Velasquez Institute ( WCVI ) .
The Velasquez Institute works “ to conduct research into improving the level of political and economic participation in Latino and other underrepresented communities . ”
NLC serves as an umbrella support group coordinating and consolidating the heads of the major organizations representing ethnic - immigrant causes .
The purpose of the National Latino Congreso was to coordinate the activities of leading Latino organizations in stopping “ anti-immigration ” efforts ( translation : tougher border security , protecting America ’s national sovereignty , preserving America ’s European cultural traditions , and deporting illegal aliens ) .
The following organizations comprise the National Latino Congreso :
* Hispanic Federation ( HF ) , hispanicfederation.org

Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ( MALDEF )
Another major ethnic - immigrant advocacy organization is the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ( MALDEF ) .
Founded in 1968 in San Antonio , Texas , it is the “ leading Latino litigation , advocacy , and educational outreach institution in the U.S. ”
The primary mission of MALDEF is to “ foster sound public policies , laws , and programs to safeguard the civil rights of the 45 million Latinos living in the United States and to empower the Latino community to fully participate in our society . ”
MALDEF , with the financial support of a $ 2.2 million grant from the Ford Foundation , maintains several regional offices and a staff of 50 employees and 22 attorneys .
The 25 - member board of directors comprises leaders from the public and private sector , government , and law firms .
Headquartered in Los Angeles , MALDEF has won several significant legal victories for Mexican Americans in lawsuits over voting rights , employment discrimination , and educational funding , and has defended the children of illegal aliens from being excluded from public education .
Corporate sponsors who have contributed over $ 100,000 include :
* Anheuser - Busch companies
* Ford Foundation
* Rockefeller Foundation
* Soros Foundation
* Washington Mutual Bank
National Immigrant Solidarity Network
The National Immigrant Solidarity Network ( NISN ) is “ a coalition of immigrant rights , labor , human rights , religious , and student activist organizations from across the country . ”
The network serves as a coalition of leading immigrant rights , student and labor groups .
In solidarity with their campaigns , the NISN assists in organizing community immigrant rights education campaigns .
From legislative letter - writing campaigns to speaker bureaus and educational materials , they organize critical immigrant - worker campaigns that are moving toward justice for all immigrants !
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán ( MEChA )
MEChA is a self - described “ Chicano ” student organization and wraps itself in the language of “ liberation , ” “ self - determination , ” and “ struggle ” of “ Indigenous people . ”
The MEChA website explains the orientation , background , and objectives of the Chicano student organization :
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán ( MEChA ) is a student organization that promotes higher education , cultura , and historia .
MEChA was founded on the principles of self - determination for the liberation of our people .
We believe that political involvement and education is the avenue for change in our society .
Each word in MEChA symbolizes a great concept in terms of la causa .
Movimiento means that the organization is dedicated to the movement to gain self - determination for our people .
Estudiantil , identifies the organization as a student group for we are part of our Raza ’s future .
At the heart of the name is the use of the identity : Chicano .
At first seen as a negative word , now taken for a badge of honor .
In adopting their new identity , the students committed themselves to return to the barrios , colonias , or campos and together , struggle against the forces that oppress our gente .
Lastly , the affirmation that we are Indigenous people to this land by placing our movement in Aztlan , the homeland of all peoples from Anahuak .
On campuses across Aztlan , MEChA and Mechistas are often the only groups on campus Raza and non-Raza alike that seek to open the doors of higher education para nuestras comunidades and strive for a society free of imperialism , racism , sexism , and homophobia .
An inspirational statement in El Plan Santa Barbara that speaks to this notes :
MEChA must bring to the mind of every young Chicana and Chicano that the liberation of her / his people from prejudice and oppression is in her / his hands and this responsibility is greater than personal achievement and more meaningful than degrees , especially if they are earned at the expense of her / his identity and cultural integrity .
MEChA , then , is more than a name ; it is a spirit of unity , of sisterhood and brotherhood , and a resolve to undertake a struggle for liberation in society where justice is but a word .
MEChA is a means to an end ( El Plan de Santa Barbara ) .

In March of 1969 , at Denver , Colorado the Crusade for Justice organized the first National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference that drafted the basic premises for the Chicana / Chicano Movement in El Plan de Aztlán .
The following month , in April of 1969 , over 100 Chicanas / Chicanos came together at University of California , Santa Barbara to formulate a plan for higher education : El Plan de Santa Barbara .
With this document they were successful in the development of two very important contributions to the Chicano Movement : Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán ( MEChA ) and Chicano Studies .
The adoption of the name Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan signaled a new level of political consciousness among student activists .
It was the final stage in the transformation of what had been loosely organized , local student groups , into a single structure and a unified student movement .
Adamant rejection of the label “ Mexican - American ” meant rejection of the assimilation and accommodationist melting pot ideology that had guided earlier generations of activists .
Chicanismo involves a crucial distinction in a political consciousness between a Mexican - American ( Hispanic ) and a Chicana / o mentality .
El Plan de Santa Barbara speaks to such issues of identity politics by asserting :
The Mexican - American ( Hispanic ) is a person who lacks respect for his / her cultural and ethnic heritage .
Unsure of her / himself , she / he seeks assimilation as a way out of her / his “ degraded ” social status .
Consequently , she / he remains politically ineffective .
In contrast , Chicanismo reflects self - respect and pride on one ’s ethnic and cultural background .
Thus , the Chicana / o acts with confidence and with a range of alternatives in the political world .
She / he is capable of developing an effective ideology through action ( El Plan de Santa Barbara ) .
MEChA played an important role in the creation and implementation of Chicana / o Studies and support services programs on campus .
Chicana /o Studies programs would be a relevant alternative to established curricula .
Most important , the Chicana /o Studies program would be the foundation of MEChA ’s political power base .
Today many Chicana / os Studies Programs would have difficulty operating if it were not for the enthusiasm and dedication of Mechistas to Chicana / o Studies .
DeleteTheBorder.org
One of the more radical operations pushing for open - borders is a consortium of militant - Left activists working to advance “ direct democracy ” and “ direct action ” as well as championing “ indigenous struggles ” and “ immigrant rights , ” is DeleteTheBorder.org ,
According to its website ,
Deletetheborder.org is an online community with the goal of nurturing a global network of movements against borders .
We began the project in 2005 .
Sensing the tremendous potential energy and having seen the existence of many networks around the world like NoBorder.org and No One Is Illegal in Canada , we sought to use the latest technology to provide a site which would make international connections and act as a hub of resistance and emergence ....
Deletetheborder.org is designed to be a place for information sharing through the use of open posting , news feed collection , media galleries , blogs and forums .
We are currently in the midst of the largest migration in human history .
The intense processes of neoliberal enclosure continue on despite unprecedented levels of resistance across the world .
Thus , migration continues , from South to North , from colonized to colonizer .
Most recently , under the guise of the war on terror , States are retaliating against this migration with repressive measures and elaborate systems of control and exploitation that function much like in - country colonization .
Against this murderous violence , movements have sprung up to work in conjunction and solidarity with migrant people .
Our site seeks to aid the growth of these movements by providing information about borders and resistance to borders , but also by providing support for organizers including forums , hosting for data sharing and event calendars .
Our site currently offers visitors the option to see the site ’s interface elements such as menus and buttons in English , Spanish or French .
It also allows visitors to post translations for their stories .
We frequently have posts in each of these languages as the posts often originate in the US , Canada , Mexico and Spain .
Our contexts are some of the most contentious and violent borderlands of the world .
The project was begun , and is maintained by the o.r.g.a.n.i.c. collective and the borderlands hacklab in San Diego , California .
The content of Deletetheborder.org is contributed by numerous organizers , hackers and bloggers in the US , Canada and Mexico .
Stories are regularly posted by members of o.r.g.a.n.i.c , by organizers with No One Is Illegal in Canada and by net activists such as Ricardo Dominguez .
Moving forward , the o.r.g.a.n.i.c collective and the borderlands Hacklab is working on a more formalized North American Network For Freedom of Movement .
The administration of the site therefore will soon include members of various groups around the country , including the Bay Area Coalition to Fight the Minutemen .
Within the last month our site traffic has doubled as the largest mobilizations ever seen in many cities across the US have taken place , including self - organized spontaneous walkouts by tens of thousands of students .
Philanthropic Support : Foundations Funding the Open- Borders Network
The Ford Foundation
Over the years , large private foundations have bankrolled organizations , such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ( MALDEF ) .
Chief among the foundations funding MALDEF and other ethnic - immigrant groups is the Ford Foundation .
The Ford Foundation was chartered in 1936 by Michigan philanthropist Edsel Bryant Ford , the son of Henry Ford , and a former president of Ford Motor Company .
The Ford Foundation is an independent philanthropic organization with no present direct affiliation with the Ford Motor Company ( Henry Ford II resigned from the Ford Foundation board of directors in 1976 ) .
Originally the foundation was established to fund Henry Ford ’s philanthropic vision .
The Ford Foundation is listed as the fourth largest charitable foundation in the U.S. , coming in behind the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
With an endowment of $ 13.7 billion , the Ford Foundation is a major financial supporter of “ those on the margins of social , economic and political life . ”
The Ford Foundation website describes their mission :
As citizens , we each have a central role to play in fulfilling the promises of peace and social justice in our societies .
We support civic groups because we believe they provide a key platform enabling people to share in charting the future of their communities and defending against the abuse of public or private power .
Our work in this area expands opportunities for people around the world to build and sustain civic life in ways that promote peaceful and just communities .
We concentrate on strengthening the organizations , networks and movements through which people exercise citizenship .
We also encourage voluntary associations to hold themselves and their governments accountable for their actions .
Key Strategies
Our grant making focuses on :
Helping grassroots groups , nonprofits and membership organizations articulate common goals , strengthen their capacities and accountability , and build alliances with government and business
Strengthening philanthropy that gives voice to those on the margins of social , economic and political life
Promoting greater civic engagement in the institutions of global governance
We believe that a healthy civil society relies on a critical mass of people and organizations working in a variety of ways on common challenges .
The Open Society Institute
The mission of the Open Society Institute ( OSI ) , a private operating and grant - making foundation established by billionaire George Soros ( see next page ) , “ aims to shape public policy to promote democratic governance , human rights , and economic , legal ,
and social reform .
On a local level , OSI implements a range of initiatives to support the rule of law , education , public health , and independent media .
At the same time , OSI works to build alliances across borders and continents on issues such as combating corruption and rights abuses . ”
OSI has launched some 33 global and local initiatives that span the full range of anti-poverty , “ human rights , ” health , cultural , women ’s rights , and social justice issues in the context of a borderless world .
5
Between 1996 and 2000 , OSI sponsored the Emma Lazarus Fund , which “ focused on combating the unfair treatment of immigrants in the United States .
In its final year , it was the lead funder of the Los Angeles Immigrant Funders ’ Collaborative .... ”
6
An Investor ’s Business Daily editorial in September 2007 raised the irony of the lack of “ transparency ” in which OSI funded various public projects , noting
Did n’t the mainstream media report that 2006 ’s vast immigration rallies across the country began as a spontaneous uprising of 2 million angry Mexican - flag waving illegal immigrants demanding U.S. citizenship in Los Angeles , egged on only by a local Spanish - language radio announcer ?
[ W ] hat looked like a wildfire grassroots movement really was a manipulation from OSI ’s glassy Manhattan offices .
The public had no way of knowing until the release of OSI ’s 2006 annual report … .
Soros ’ “ shaping public policies , ” as OSI calls it , is not illegal .
But it ’s a problem for democracy because it drives issues with cash and then only lets the public know about it after it ’s old news .
That means the public makes decisions about issues without understanding the special agendas of groups behind them .
Without more transparency , it amounts to political manipulation .
This leads to cynicism .
As word of these short - term covert ops gets out , the public grows to distrust what it hears and tunes out .
The irony here is that Soros claims to be an advocate of an “ open society . ”
His OSI does just the legal minimum to disclose its activities .
The public should n’t have to wait until an annual report is out before the light is flipped on about the Open Society ’s political action .

The organizations listed in this article represent well - organized ethnic - immigrant lobbies and advocacy groups , which are actively working to transform the U.S. into a borderless society .
Wealthy radical ideologues , such as Soros , fund a platform to impose their vision on American society — to the detriment of the national interest . ■

7 . “ The Soros Threat to Democracy , ” Investor ’s Business Daily , September 25 , 2007 : A12 .
The idea that genes and culture co-evolve has been around for several decades but has started to win converts only recently .
Two leading proponents , Robert Boyd of the University of California , Los Angeles , and Peter J. Richerson of the University of California , Davis , have argued for years that genes and culture were intertwined in shaping human evolution .
“ It was n’t like we were despised , just kind of ignored , ” Dr. Boyd said .
But in the last few years , references by other scientists to their writings have “ gone up hugely , ” he said .
The best evidence available to Dr. Boyd and Dr. Richerson for culture being a selective force was the lactose tolerance found in many northern Europeans .
Most people switch off the gene that digests the lactose in milk shortly after they are weaned , but in northern Europeans — the descendants of an ancient cattle - rearing culture that emerged in the region some 6,000 years ago — the gene is kept switched on in adulthood .
Lactose tolerance is now well recognized as a case in which a cultural practice — drinking raw milk — has caused an evolutionary change in the human genome .
Presumably the extra nutrition was of such great advantage that adults able to digest milk left more surviving offspring , and the genetic change swept through the population .
This instance of gene - culture interaction turns out to be far from unique .
In the last few years , biologists have been able to scan the whole human genome for the signatures of genes undergoing selection .
Such a signature is formed when one version of a gene becomes more common than other versions because its owners are leaving more surviving offspring .
From the evidence of the scans , up to 10 percent of the genome — some 2,000 genes — shows signs of being under selective pressure .
These pressures are all recent , in evolutionary terms — most probably dating from around 10,000 to 20,000 years ago , in the view of Mark Stoneking , a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
Biologists can infer the reason for these selective forces from the kinds of genes that are tagged by the genome scans .
The roles of most of the 20,000 or so genes in the human genome are still poorly understood , but all can be assigned to broad categories of likely function depending on the physical structure of the protein they specify .
A secret meeting took place in the White House last week between Obama ’s Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and 20 Jewish rabbis .
A short while later , Obama ’s senior advisor David Axelrod appeared before Democratic Jewish organization NJDC .
He said that as one who has known the president for nearly 20 years and who works with him every day , he knows that the president ’s commitment to Israel is rock solid .
Meanwhile , also last week , at the last moment , National Security Advisor Jim Jones confirmed his attendance at a lecture marking the 25th anniversary of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
The very same day , organizers of the annual American Jewish Committee event , to be held this Thursday in Washington , were informed that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will make an appearance .
Calming Message Obama to US Jews : peace cannot be imposed Yitzhak Benhorin US president in letter to head of Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations says is ' deeply committed to fulfilling role US must play for peace to be realized ' but recognizes that for agreement to endure , ' peace can not be imposed from outside ' Obama to US Jews : peace cannot be imposed
Obama and his senior aides have embarked on an intensive public relations campaign aimed at quickly rectifying the impression of a US - Israel rift .
We must keep in mind that when it comes to the White House , nothing is coincidental .
Someone did some thinking over there and reached the conclusion that the top US brass must quickly put out the political fire that is threatening to spread here .
The US Administration is indeed determined to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians , yet suddenly the Jerusalem issue no longer makes headlines , and suddenly , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict no longer risks the lives of US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Moreover , Obama himself stressed that “ Our alliance with Israel serves our national security interests . ”
Now , we hear General Jim Jones declaring that Israel assists the US in training , innovation , intelligence , and whatnot .
We also heard about the strategic alliance between the US and Israel , which are fighting the same enemies .
Later , he told us , Israeli reporters , that the US has no demands of Israel in respect to Jerusalem and tried to convince us that Hillary Clinton is not waiting for answers from Netanyahu , but rather , this is just part of the routine dialogue .
Declining Jewish support
So what happened ?
Was it the phone call from senior Democratic Senator Charles Schumer to Rahm Emanuel , where the former warned of his intention to publicly come out against the Administration ?
Or is it the fact that the New York Times was working on a large story on the ties between US Jews to Israel and to the Obama Administration ?
Is it about Jewish leaders who passed on a message to the White House , letting it now that there ’s a problem with their voters ?
If two months ago Obama still maintained the support of the Jews , even when he pressed Israel to freeze settlement construction and compromise to enable the two - state solution ’s advancement , the US pressure on Jerusalem was apparently the breaking point for quite a few Jews among his supporters .
The White House apparently received reports warning that Obama is losing the support of Jews who voted for him .
A Quinnipiac University survey released recently indicated that Obama made a mistake on the Israel issue , and not only among Jews .
Overall , the US public supports the president ’s foreign policy , mostly in Afghanistan ( 56 % ) and in handling terror ( 61 % ) , yet Americans are dissatisfied with Obama on one issue – his attitude to the Israeli - Palestinian problem .
This trend is especially noticeable among Jews .
While they support Obama on any other issue , when it comes to Israel 67 % of them object to the president ’s policy , while only 28 % support him .
Among the overall population , a majority of 57 % support Israel while only 13 % back the Palestinians .
According to the survey , 66 % of Americans are telling Obama that they expect him to support Israel .
Just before the weekend , AIPAC made sure to provide the American media with analysis via email regarding the president confirming the significant of the Israel - US alliance .
AIPAC , which had been working against the Administration ’s moves behind the scene , went out of its way to praise Obama as well as top government and military officials .
The Obama Administration ’s PR campaign among Jews should not lead to the conclusion that the White House changed its policy towards the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Peace and the two - state solution are still among the most urgent challenges on the American president ’s agenda .
The pressure on Israel and the Palestinians will continue in order to quickly facilitate direct talks on the core issues .
However , it appears that the Americans will be making every effort to avoid public confrontations vis-à - vis the Israeli government in the future .
David Coulthard ( to Mika Hakkinen in 98 and 99 )
When David Coulthard joined Finn Mika Hakkinen at McLaren in 1996 , many predicted a titanic battle between the two and a coin flip as to whom would come out on top .
The first signs of trouble for Coulthard surfaced at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix when the Scot was forced to concede the lead and win after a pre-race team agreement deemed that whoever led into the first corner would take the victory .
Coulthard went on to win only one race that season and spent most of the season in a supporting role as Hakkinen clinched the title .
1999 followed a similar pattern with DC winning just twice as Hakkinen secured back - to - back titles .
Eddie Irvine ( to Michael Schumacher in 96-99 )
" He 's not only the best driver in the world , he 's also the best No. 2 in the world , " said Irvine of Schumacher when the German came back from a broken leg to help him win the 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix and put him firmly in the title hunt .
In reality it was Irvine , not Schumacher , who was the perfect No. 2 . " I did the majority of the testing , the tyre work and the chassis work .
Michael could just get in the car and drive it faster than anyone else , " admitted the Ulsterman , who would never again get close to winning the drivers ' title .
Damon Hill ( to Alain Prost in 93 )
If ever there was an example of a driver making the most out of his talent , the prize must go to Damon Hill .
A test - driver for Williams in 1991 , Hill 's big break came in securing a team - drive alongside then three - time world champion Alain Prost in 1993 .
Hill ably supported Prost to his fourth and final drivers ' title and surprised many at the time with ten podium finishes including three wins .
Three years later it was Hill who was the team leader and he went on to win the drivers ' title from rookie team - mate Jacques Villeneuve .
Giancarlo Fisichella ( to Fernando Alonso in 05 and 06 )
When ' Fisi ' stormed to victory in the 2005 Australian Grand Prix , many predicted a tough ride for the Spaniard against his new team - mate in the season ahead .
Sadly , it proved a false dawn for the enigmatic Italian as a combination of poor luck and inconsistency saw Alonso storm to the title as Fisichella managed just fifth in the standings .
2006 proved to be a similar season .
Having won in Malaysia he failed to maintain that pace for the forthcoming races .
Some strong results in the second half of the 2006 season secured him fourth in the drivers ' championship with one win and five podium finishes , a run that took valuable points off Alonso 's competition as the Spaniard secured his second drivers ' title in the final round of the season .
Martin Brundle ( to Michael Schumacher in 92 )
Of all Michael Schumacher 's team - mates , the driver that was able to match him on the most regular basis was Martin Brundle .
Brundle , who famously lost out in the 1983 Formula 3 title to Ayrton Senna on the final laps of the final race , outdrove the German at Imola , Montreal , Magny - Cours and Silverstone , and scored a notable second place at Monza .
Brundle was also close to winning in Canada before transmission failure ended his cause when closing on leader Gerhard Berger .
" The fastest guy I raced against was Mika Hakkinen .
The most naturally gifted was Ayrton Senna - and in my view also the greatest .
The most complete was Schumacher , " confirmed Brundle .

Gerhard Berger ( to Ayrton Senna in 90 , 91 , 92 )
Gerhard Berger 's arrival as Ayrton Senna 's team - mate in 1990 was met with great anticipation as the experienced Austrian had proven genuinely quick during his time at Benetton and Ferrari .
True to form , Berger was often quicker than predecessor Alain Prost in relation to Senna in qualifying .
But he rarely matched the Brazilian 's pace during races .
Accordingly , Berger took only three wins in his three seasons against Senna , including a gifted 1991 Japanese Grand Prix by the newly - crowned champ .
During his three years at McLaren , Berger secured four pole positions and out - qualified Senna eight times .
Perhaps most notably , Berger achieved what no other of Senna 's team - mates accomplished by becoming great friends with the Brazilian .
Many accounts tell of practical jokes thought up by the Austrian to placate Senna 's supremely focused attitude .
Ricardo Patrese ( to Nigel Mansell in 91 and 92 )
After two mixed seasons at Ferrari , Nigel Mansell returned to Williams in 1991 to partner Ricardo Patrese at a team expected to contend for both the drivers ' and constructors ' championships .
Wins in Mexico and Portugal gave Patrese his most competitive ever F1 season but the Italian thus never threatened Mansell or Ayrton Senna .
Williams totally dominated the 1992 season and Patrese continued to deliver in his role of second driver , even moving out of the way for Mansell while leading comfortably at that year 's French Grand Prix .
Patrese took only one win at the Japanese Grand Prix and had eight other podium finishes , including six second - place results , whilst Mansell recorded nine wins en-route to dominating the championship .
Rubens Barrichello ( to Michael Schumacher in 2000 - 2005 )
Unquestionably Michael Schumacher 's most consistent team - mate was Rubens Barrichello .
The popular Brazilian supported Schumacher to drivers ' titles from 2000 - 2004 and helped Ferrari win the constructors ' championship on no fewer than five occasions .
Although he rarely threatened his team - mate , Barrichello enjoyed his most successful season in 2002 , when he won four races for the team and finished a career best second place in the drivers ' championship .
But the year was marked by controversy when Ferrari team orders required Barrichello to let Schumacher pass him on the final straight of the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix for victory .
Schumacher exchanged places with Barrichello at the podium ceremony and gave him the winner 's trophy .
The drivers were fined for disrupting podium protocol and Ferrari 's conduct led to the FIA banning team orders in 2003 .
Francois Cevert ( to Jackie Stewart in 1973 )
Few Formula
One aficionados disagree that Sir Jackie Stewart 's supremely talented young French team - mate would have gone on to be world champion had tragedy at Watkins Glen not robbed the sport of one of its future stars .
Even as Cevert began to draw even with Stewart 's driving abilities , the Scot was secretly planning to retire after the last race of the season in the United States and hand over the mantle of Tyrrell team leader .
Leading up to the final race of the 1973 season , Cevert had finished second six times , three times behind Stewart .
With Stewart having already clinched his third world championship , Cevert was killed during Saturday morning qualifying , while battling for pole position with Ronnie Peterson .
Sir Stirling Moss ( to Juan Manuel Fangio in 1955 )
Sir Stirling
Moss is one driver who never settled for second best , but even he admits it may have been the case against the great Juan Manuel Fangio .
Moss finished second to the Argentine in the 1955 championship , winning the British Grand Prix and finishing second in Belgium and Holland .
Such was the aura of Fangio , Moss himself doubted whether he allowed him to win his home grand prix .
He dramatically passed Fangio at the last corner to record a famous win in front of his home crowd but asked afterwards , " Did you let me win ? " to which Fangio replied , " No . You were just better than me . "
But if the question of pure sportsmanship was the basis of the decision , then Moss wins hands down .
This noble attitude cost him the 1958 Formula One world championship .
When rival Mike Hawthorn was threatened with a penalty in the Portuguese Grand Prix for reversing in the track after spinning his car , Moss defended his rival 's actions .
Hawthorn went on to beat
Moss by a single point , even though he had only won one race that year to Moss 's four .
It made Hawthorn Britain 's first world champion .
The green rockets of spring are taking to the air .
Finally , we can get our noses out of the misted produce isles and the never - ending harvest of mediocre corporate veggies .
Here in southeast Ohio , asparagus is the first hint of what is to come : morel mushrooms , ramps , strawberries , rhubarb , blueberries , kholrabi , garlic tops , arugula , mustard greens and kale , until the baby zucchini blossoms herald the full frontal assault of summer .
When I visited the Ervin Hershberger farm in Chesterhill Ohio , Ervin ’s wife Rachael shoved a one - year old in my arms and we stumbled out back to the asparagus field .
“ I do n’t know if there ’s…oh my , we DO have alot of asparagus , ” she said as I looked at the green stalks peeking their delicious heads up from the field .
Short and fat ones grew alongside long skinny ones just waiting for me to grab and twist before dropping them into the aspargus bucket .
As my delight in the first bounty of spring heightened , I kept reminding myself , “ Do n’t drop baby John … do n’t drop baby John … do n’t … ”
The best hint on buying asparagus is to never buy asparagus that has been cut with a knife .
Asparagus has a fabulous way of telling you when you ’ve reached the spot where the stalk turns to wood .
Grab the stalk and twist – it breaks right at that inedible point .
While waiting tables in Chicago years ago , my friend Chrisensio told me that , while new to this country , he tried every job as a migrant worker .
“ The two jobs I would rather die than go back to are cutting asparagus and planting pine trees in a clear - cut forest . ”
The field managers walked among the pickers , telling them to cut under the earth to get as much poundage as possible .
Sounds like a real back - breaking job .
It also gave me a hint of how are foodstuffs are managed by the large companies .
I decided to make a pizza with asparagus using Serrano ham from Spain .
I will pair this magnificent combination with Manchego cheese ( Spanish cheddar from the La Mancia region of Spain ) , sweet San Marzano tomatoes , and fresh mozzarella .
Jamon Serrano means “ Mountain ham ” and can best be described as having a taste like Italian prosciutto crudo or the French Jambon Bayonne .
This ham is dry cured with salt and is only made from the “ Landrace ” breed of pig from the Sierra mountains in Spain .
The taste , compared to the Prosciutto crudo , is more of an upfront salty - pork flavor and noticably lacking in the last Parmesan - umami taste at the back of the throat that prosciutto exhibits .
I like this ham on pizza because of the amount of fat in each slice .
I tear the fatty pieces to cook in the oven ( which creates some bodacious cracklings ) , while saving the crudo for topping the warm pizza .
I love fresh raw asparagus on pizza as much as the next guy but with this recipe , I take off the outer skin and “ shock ” the asparagus .
This par -cooks the aspargus for 30 seconds and then fast - cools it , setting the chlorophyl or green color .
Asparagus and Serrano Ham Pizza
1 Easy Dough recipe
4 to 7 fat stalks of fresh , local aparagus
6 to 7 slices of Serrano ham
3 whole canned San Marzano tomatoes
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 tablespoons shredded imported Manchego cheese
5 to 6 small balls of Boccocini ( fresh mozzarella balls )
Make two 7 ounce dough balls .
Freeze one for later or double this recipe for 2 pies .
Preheat an upturned cookie sheet on the middle rack of your oven set at 475 degrees .
Put a 3 - quart pan filled halfway with water on a high burner to boil .
Add a teaspoon of salt to the water .
Using a peeler , lay the asparagus down on cutting board and run the peeler down along the stalk , taking as little of the skin of as possible .
Roll the stalk and peel the skin around the whole stalk .
Do not run the peeler twice in the same spot or you will take the meat off and end up with nothing .
Fill a large bowl with water and add 4 to 6 ice cubes .
Place asparagus in the boiling water and count to 30 seconds .
Do not walk away .
Grab the asparagus with tongs and transfer to the ice bath .
Take the asparagus out of the water and cut each stalk in half lengthwise .
Cut the fatty portion off each slice of Serrano ham .
Wrap the non fatty portion around each half - stalk of asparagus .
Open the can of tomatoes and place in a colander to drain .
Tear the best 3 tomatoes into filets .
Place on a plate .
( For true San Marzano tomatoes , note the D.O.P. or Denominazione D’Origine Protetta on the side of the can , the 3 seals on the left side of the can ) .
To Assemble the Pizza :
Form the pizza dough according to the easy pizza dough recipe .
Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper .
1. 2 . 3 . 4 .
1 . Pour the extra virgin olive oil onto the dough .
2. , 3 . Scatter the Manchego on the dough , followed by the fatty ham and the tomato filets .
4 . Place the fresh mozzarella balls on top .
Place the pizza with the parchment on the preheated cookie sheet and close the oven .
This pizza should cook in 10 to 12 minutes .
Check for even cooking after 5 minutes and turn accordingly .
The final pizza should be golden brown and more brown on the bottom .
Pull from oven and place aspargus on the pizza in spokes .
You may have to trim the asparagus .
Place one half mozarrella ball in the middle of the spoke .
Serve immediately .
Do n’t cut this baby until you get a ‘ wow factor ’ response from your family or hungry guests .
They come galloping out of the volcanic storm , hooves muffled in the ash , manes flying .
Shutting the last of his 17 horses into an old barn , Ingi Sveinbjoernsson , 56 , breathes a sigh of relief .
Only 24 hours earlier he had lost the shaggy Icelandic horses in an ash cloud that turned day into terrifying night , blanketing the wild landscape in glutinous grey mud .
" I went out to fetch them and realised I could n't see my own hand .
That 's how dark it was , " he said , shaken .
" I never imagined anything like it . "
The Icelandic horse is something of a national emblem on the north Atlantic island .
About 80,000 live in Iceland , according to the Horse Breeding Association - a horse for every four people in a population of almost 320,000 .
Pony - like in size , but immensely sturdy , and crowned with tufty forelocks and thick manes , Icelandic horses are also valuable , a top stallion fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars .
So when Eyjafjoell volcano erupted last week , spewing dust across Europe and debris over southern Iceland , farmers raced their herds to cover .
Four - by - fours pulling horse boxes became a ubiquitous sight on roads leading away from the volcano .
Others were too late .
They evacuated their horses only Saturday , when the ash storm was upon them , driving herds sometimes a hundred strong through blizzards of dust .
Still others , like Sigurgeir Ingolfsson , had to wait until a lull Sunday .
Ingolfsson said he made the " incredibly hard decision " to abandon his farm the previous day when the air became hard to breathe .
When he brought the horses in early Sunday they were matted with dust .
" You could sense they were happy to come inside , " he said .
At Yzta - Baeli farm , within sound of Atlantic waves and in direct line of Eyjafjoell volcano , Mr Sveinbjoernsson and two friends trudged through ash to gather their lost herd .
The spirited little horses pranced and tossed their heads , before cantering toward a corral .
From there they were transferred , two by two , into a trailer , then the barn .
The horses ' chestnut and honey - coloured hair disguised the ash that had rained on them .
The herd 's one white horse was streaked in grey and a slap on the rump of any of the beasts sent up puffs of volcanic dust .
Mr Sveinbjoernsson 's family friend Ingimundur Vilhjalsson , 65 , examined the horses .
A few appeared to have runny eyes , but Mr Vilhjalsson said the extent of ill effects was unclear .
" I think they 're OK , but I do n't know what they 've been eating all that time , so I 'm worried , " he said .
The extraordinarily resilient animals - exported mostly to Europe for riding and as far as Japan for meat - almost never go indoors .
Postcards and tourist posters portray them as cute , almost vain - looking animals .
But they are as tough as Icelanders themselves , with double coats adapted to resist the fierce north Atlantic weather , five walking gaits , and easy going temperaments to boot .
" What makes the Icelandic pony so unique is its good temper and sure - footedness , " Sveinn Steinarsson , south Iceland representative of The Horse Breeding Association , said .
He said the tainted grass is not immediately poisonous , but as fluoride levels rise from the ash , so does the danger .
" In areas where there 's ash fall and horses are outside the conditions are terrible .
They can't survive in this if it carries on too long .
The horses have to be fed with hay and have access to running water to avoid them consuming a lot of ash . "
Mr Vilhjalsson said he thought Iceland 's volcano horses would survive .
" Because they 're so small , their strength constantly surprises people , " he said .
What he could n't tell was how long these brave animals , usually scornful of home comforts , would be cooped up in the barn .
" I do n't know , " Mr Vilhjalsson said .
" The volcano will decide . "

The Pope is due to visit Birmingham and Scotland in September The Foreign Office has apologised for a " foolish " document which suggested the Pope 's visit to the UK could be marked by the launch of " Benedict " condoms .
Called " The ideal visit would see ... " , it said the Pope could be invited to open an abortion clinic and bless a gay marriage during September 's visit .
The Foreign Office stressed the paper , which resulted from a " brainstorm " on the visit , did not reflect its views .
The Bishop of Nottingham said , if anything , it was " appalling manners " .
The Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon said : " I think it 's a lot worse that we invite someone into our country - a person like the Pope - and then he 's treated in this way .
" I think it 's appalling manners more than anything else . "
The junior civil servant responsible had been put on other duties , the Foreign Office said .
Details of the document emerged after it was obtained by the Sunday Telegraph .
' Song with Queen '
The UK's ambassador to the Vatican , Francis Campbell , has met senior officials of the Holy See to express regret on behalf of the government .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband is said to have been " appalled " by the incident .
ANALYSIS Robert Pigott , BBC religious affairs correspondent
It 's clear that what the Foreign Office has called " this foolish document " did not reflect government policy .
Its tone is clearly frivolous , and it came from junior officials .
But it has , nevertheless , the potential to cause considerable damage .
Whether fairly or not , it will leave some Catholics with the impression of a culture within official circles in which their Church 's teaching is not taken seriously .
Some will suspect prejudice against faith groups .
Perhaps most damaging of all , it could leave an impression that the Pope might be regarded as a figure of fun less than five months before his visit to Britain .
Apart from the pressure on the papal visit from public feeling about sex abuse , and the threat of demonstrations against the Pope , the government needs the Vatican 's help in a global diplomatic effort to curb climate change and fight poverty .
How serious and far - reaching the effect of the document is depends partly on how the Church itself responds .
The paper was attached as one of three " background documents " to a memo dated 5 March 2010 inviting officials in Whitehall and Downing Street to attend a meeting to discuss themes for the papal visit .
It suggested Benedict XVI could show his hard line on the sensitive issue of child abuse allegations against Roman Catholic priests by " sacking dodgy bishops " and launching a helpline for abused children .
The document went on to propose the Pope could apologise for the Spanish Armada or sing a song with the Queen for charity .
It listed " positive " public figures who could be made part of the Pope 's visit , including former Prime Minister Tony Blair and 2009 Britain 's Got Talent runner - up Susan Boyle , and those considered " negative " , such as Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney and prominent atheist Richard Dawkins .
The civil servant responsible for sending round the memo said in a cover note : " Please protect ; these should not be shared externally .
The ' ideal visit ' paper in particular was the product of a brainstorm which took into account even the most far - fetched of ideas . "
An investigation was launched after some recipients of the memo , said to have been circulated to a restricted list , objected to its tone .
A Foreign Office spokesman said the department was " deeply sorry " for any offence the document had caused .
" This is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect UK government or Foreign Office policy or views .
Many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill - judged , naive and disrespectful , " he said .
" The text was not cleared or shown to ministers or senior officials before circulation .
As soon as senior officials became aware of the document , it was withdrawn from circulation .
" The individual responsible has been transferred to other duties .
He has been told orally and in writing that this was a serious error of judgement and has accepted this view . "
' Blue - skies thinking '
The Foreign Office said the memo had resulted from discussions by a group of three or four junior staff in a team working on early planning for the papal visit .
A source told the BBC News website the individual since moved to other duties had called the group together for " some blue - skies creative thinking about how to make the visit a success " , but their discussions had become " a joke that has gone too far " .
The source added that others in the group had been spoken to about the incident , but had not faced any formal action .
I think it 's a joke that has gone wrong - light relief that has gone out of control .
Jack Valero , Catholic Voices Bishop McMahon said he hoped it was meant to be " light hearted " .
But he added : " That in itself can be dangerous if these memos move around the departments , they tend to gain momentum . "
He said he did not think Catholics would be upset by the memo as they " are used to getting a bad press " .
Jack Valero from the organisation Catholic Voices said he was not taking the memo seriously .
" I think it 's a joke that has gone wrong - light relief that has gone out of control .
And I think Catholics will just take it like this , you know , that they 'll think about it today and then they will forget about it . "
He said those that have been scarred by abortion would find the joke " a bit thin " .
But he added : " In the Catholic church we are used to forgiveness , it 's part of our culture to forgive people 's mistakes . "
Earlier this year the Pope announced 2010 would see the first papal visit to the UK since John Paul II 's visit in 1982 .
Pope Benedict XVI 's visit will take place from 16 to 19 September , during which time he is expected to visit Birmingham , as part of the planned beatification of Cardinal John Newman , and Scotland .
The visit will come in the autumn of what is proving to be a difficult year for the Pope with a wave of allegations that Church authorities in Europe and North and South America failed to deal properly with priests accused of paedophilia .
The Pope himself has been accused of being part of a culture of secrecy and of not taking strong enough steps against paedophiles when he had that responsibility as a cardinal in Rome .
However , his supporters say he has been the most pro-active Pope yet in confronting abuse .

The thousand - year reich of Downfall parodies has ended in ruins .
Constantin Films , the German producer of the 2004 film Der Untergang , has compelled YouTube to start taking down the popular Hitler - rants - about - funny - thing - X clips .
If you 're unfamiliar with these parodies , first , welcome back from the Russian front .
Der Untergang ( known to Americans — and in fact widely known to Americans , solely thanks to the parodies — as Downfall ) , features a scene in which a bunker - trapped Hitler harangues his inner circle ( in German ) as the Russians close in on Berlin .
A few years ago , some inspired genius put on new subtitles in which the Führer ranted about getting banned from Xbox Live rather than about the 11th - hour desertion of his generals .
Because Hitler has been bringing the laughs at least since the Beer Hall Putsch , the result was pretty funny , and it spawned a vast genre in which , simply through subtitle changes , Hitler rants about Jay 's replacing Conan , Hitler can't get Miley Cyrus tickets , Hitler 's pissed off about getting bad seats for a Bruce Springsteen concert , etc .
There 's even one where the dictator is mad about all the people making Downfall parodies , which you can still see :
I 've always suspected the appeal of Downfall parodies rests in the charisma of the great Bruno Ganz , whose rant never loses its effect no matter how many sets of subtitles you 've read .
In any event , the massive popularity of the meme was not enough to stop YouTube 's overly cautious response to copyright challenges .
Open Video Alliance reports :
A recent wave of takedowns affecting many of the Hitler " Downfall " parody videos has resulted in their removal from YouTube .
( EDIT : These videos were blocked by YouTube 's Content ID system , not taken down via DMCA notices .
For more on the difference between these two , see the EFF's Guide to YouTube Removals . )
The copyright claim is being filed on behalf of Constantin Films , the German production company that owns the rights to the 2004 film … from which the clip originates .
Downfall parodies are a well - established part of online culture …
The Downfall format has been used to mock everything from social networking sites , to politicians , to the iPad , to self - important hipsters .
The list goes on , but as of this week Downfall videos are disappearing fast .
Indeed they are .
The 4.3 million - view original , in which Hitler gets banned from Xbox Live , has been replaced by the notice : " This video contains content from Constantin Film , who has blocked it on copyright grounds . "
A quick search of YouTube shows that many others have vanished .
The legal merits of Constantin 's argument are clear :
They do not exist .
Downfall parodies take less than four minutes of a 156 - minute film , and use them in a way that is unquestionably transformative .
Maybe Moturk49 was somehow making a ton of money from his or her Xbox - related parody , but it seems unlikely .
In any event , the Supreme Court 's 1994 decision in the " Hairy Woman " lawsuit established that the commercial nature of a parody does not render it presumptively unfair , and that a sufficient parodic purpose offers protection against the charge of copying .
Not that that will matter .
The issue is YouTube 's kneejerk takedowns .
The site is free to do what it likes ; nobody will bother going to court over something so ephemeral as a Hitler joke ; and though YouTube is obviously the best and most popular forum for any video , it 's not like there 's some inalienable right to run your content there .
Still , the use of immediate takedowns is a blunt instrument that YouTube and its owner Google will , I hope , learn to refine in the future .
Meanwhile , brand - new Downfall parodies , including the inevitable Hitler - issues - DMCA - takedowns version , are available elsewhere .
Of course , Constantin films should be overjoyed at the success of the Downfall meme .
I do n't know that it would even be possible to total up all the views on all the parodies out there , but it is conceivable that thanks to these parodies more Americans are aware of Downfall than of any non-English - language film ever made .
And the company really fell into the schmaltz barrel by virtue of the fact that everybody refers to them as " Downfall parodies , " so if you 're intrigued enough to check out the ( well worth seeing ) original film , you know what to look for .
Just do n't look for it on YouTube .
The United Nations has quietly upped this year 's peacekeeping budget for earthquake - shattered Haiti to $ 732.4 million , with two - thirds of that amount going for the salary , perks and upkeep of its own personnel , not residents of the devastated island .
The world organization plans to spend the money on an expanded force of some 12,675 soldiers and police , plus some 479 international staffers , 669 international contract personnel , and 1,300 local workers , just for the 12 months ending June 30 , 2010 .
Some $ 495.8 million goes for salaries , benefits , hazard pay , mandatory R&R allowances and upkeep for the peacekeepers and their international staff support .
Only about $ 33.9 million , or 4.6 percent , of that salary total is going to what the U.N. calls " national staff " attached to the peacekeeping effort .
Click here to see the supplementary budget document .
Presumably , the budget also includes at least part of some $ 10 million that the U.N. has spent on renting two passenger vessels , the Sea Voyager ( known to some U.N. staffers as the " Love Boat " ) and the Ola Esmeralda , for a minimum of 90 days each , as highly subsidized housing for some of its peacekeepers and humanitarian staff .
The tab for the two vessels , which offer catered food , linen service and comfortable staterooms and lounges , is about $ 112,500 per day .
Under a cost - sharing formula , the U.S. pays a 27 percent share of the entire $ 732.4 million peacekeeping tab for Haiti during this 12 month period , or about $ 197.7 million .
The ultimate size of the peacekeeping bill for Haiti this year has been a source of much concern among the three dozen or so of the U.N. 's 192 members who pick up roughly 96 percent of the U.N. 's overall peacekeeping bill .
That concern rose sharply about a month ago , when U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 's office issued an updated peacekeeping estimate that used a $ 700 million figure strictly as a placeholder for the final Haiti post - quake number .
The new figures take some of the uncertainty out of that estimate , but even so , the U.N. was taking no chances of raising concerns higher with its new tally ; rather than take a new vote on the expanded peacekeeper budget , the U.N. Secretariat simply issued its revised tally as an extension of the previous $ 611 million allotment it had voted for Haiti .
The Haitian peacekeeping budget is relatively unique among U.N. efforts , because there was no civil war or widespread bloodletting to inspire the original peacekeeping force , which arrived in 2004 .
Instead , the mission has mainly been intended to bolster political order in a society crushed by hurricanes , political turbulence , and grinding misery .
The revised peacekeeping tab is over and above the roughly $ 15 billion in short - and long - term aid that the international community — led by the U.S. and European Union — pledged to Haiti at an international donor 's conference last month .
It is also over and above the $ 773 million in humanitarian aid raised from donor nations and private citizens in a " flash " appeal in the days after the Jan. 12 earthquake — which is about half the total hoped for by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs when it raised the appeal .
Moreover , the revised Haiti peacekeeping budget only covers a period that ends in about 10 more weeks — on June 30 , 2010 — at which time , Ban 's office will have to formulate another peacekeeping estimate for the stricken island , not to mention the remainder of its global peacekeeping effort .
Given the temporary nature of this year 's sudden 20 percent boost in Haiti peacekeeping costs , there is some possibility that next year 's budget will mark a decrease from the $ 732.4 million figure .
Since the U.N. installed peacekeepers on the island in 2004 , however , the budgeted cost of peacekeeping has roughly doubled , from an original $ 372.8 million .

NFL Draft day has always been among my favorite sporting events of the year .
While no games are played , it can often make or break a season for teams , and the combination NFL and college football , scouting , and statistics makes it the trifecta for a sports fan .
My least favorite part of the draft is Mel Kiper Jr. , ESPN ’s self - proclaimed draft guru .
He does know a lot about college football , but I ’m turned off by his bombastic nature .
I wondered , does Kiper know what he ’s talking about , or is he really full of hot air ?
I took Kiper ’s mock draft , along with 10 other football “ experts ” to see who came out on top for predicting the draft .
Here ’s the lineup I looked at …
Kiper – ESPN
Bill Simmons – ESPN ( first time doing a mock draft )
Peter King – Sports Illustrated
Pete Prisco – CBS
Pat Kirwin – NFL.com
Chris Steuber – Scout.com
Doug Farrar – Yahoo
Cory Bonini – KFFL
Clark Judge – CBS
Chad Reuter – CBS
Rob Rang – CBS
I took their mock drafts they posted on Wednesday ( I had to draw the line somewhere ; Kiper was on version 3 or 4 by that point ) , and compared their selections to the final results .
I scored them based on two criteria :
# of correct picks ( either correct numerical slot or correct team – since there is so much trading that happens ) .
Average number of picks off ( # of Predicted Pick – # of Actual Pick for each player ) .
For example , Kiper guessed # 4 for Russell Okung and he went to # 6 Seattle , so the number of picks off is “ 2 ” ) .
If the player was not selected in the first round , I considered him drafted in slot 33 since we will not know his true draft slot until the draft resumes .
The winner of most # of correct picks was Doug Farrar of Yahoo .
Peter King was a close 2nd , and Bill Simmons was 3rd .
As you can tell , it ’s tough to actually get a pick right , as Doug nailed only 10 of the 32 picks .
# of correct picks is kind of like measuring Olympics success by only counting gold medals .
I wanted a more holistic view .
Next , I looked at average number of picks off .
The rationale here is that while you might not predict the precise slot and team for each draftee , you should be able to select player in the right range .
I think this is the superior method for measuring prediction success , as every pick matters ( including horrible picks like Kiper slotting Jimmy Clausen to Oakland in pick # 8 ) .
Peter King dominated this contest .
For each player , he was within 4.5 slots on average , quite a feat .
Bill Simmons was second , off by 4.9 slots .
So who ’s the champion ?
I took the average and standard deviation for each set of metrics , and compared how each entrant fared , plotted on a 2 X 2 matrix .
Using the interaction between the rating systems , Peter King is the overwhelming winner and the earns the title “ Prognosticator of prognosticators . ”
Bill Simmons is the clear runner up , not bad for his first mock draft !
Noticeably absent from the winner ’s circle is Mel Kiper Jr. However , I do give him props for being among the top half of “ experts ” and admit he ’s not all hot air .

Walled In
Science and humanities students view each other with incomprehension : blame our dumb , narrow schooling .
By George Monbiot , published in the Guardian 6th April 2010
The MPs were kind to Professor Phil Jones .
During its hearings , the Commons Science and Technology Committee did n’t even ask the man at the centre of the hacked climate emails crisis about the central charge he faces : that he urged other scientists to delete material subject to a freedom of information request ( 1 ) .
Last week the committee published its report , and blamed his university for the “ culture of non-disclosure ” over which Jones presided ( 2 ) .
Perhaps the MPs were swayed by the disastrous performance of his boss at the hearings .
Edward Acton , vice - chancellor of the University of East Anglia , came across as flamboyant , slippery and insincere ( 3 ) .
Jones , on the other hand , seemed both deathly dull and painfully honest .
How could this decent , nerdy man have messed up so badly ?
None of it made sense : the intolerant dismissal of requests for information , the utter failure to engage when the hacked emails were made public , the refusal by other scientists to accept that anything was wrong .
Then I read an article by the computer scientist Steve Easterbrook and for the first time the light began to dawn ( 4 ) .
Easterbrook , seeking to defend Jones and his colleagues , describes a closed culture in which the rest of the world is a tedious and incomprehensible distraction .
“ Scientists normally only interact with other scientists .
We live rather sheltered lives … to a scientist , anyone stupid enough to try to get scientific data through repeated FOI requests quite clearly deserves our utter contempt .
Jones was merely expressing ( in private ) a sentiment that most scientists would share – and extreme frustration with people who clearly do n’t get it . ”
When I read that , I was struck by the gulf between our worlds .
To those of us who clamoured for freedom of information laws in the UK , FoI requests are almost sacred .
The passing of these laws was a rare democratic victory ; they ’re among the few means we possess of ensuring that politicians and public servants are answerable to the public .
What scientists might regard as trivial and annoying , journalists and democracy campaigners see as central and irreducible .
We speak in different tongues and inhabit different worlds .
I know how it happens .
Like most people with a science degree , I left university with a store of recondite knowledge that I could share with almost no one .
Ill - equipped to understand any subject but my own , I felt cut off from the rest of the planet .
The temptation to retreat into a safe place was almost irresistible .
Only the extreme specialisation demanded by a PhD , which would have walled me in like an anchorite , dissuaded me .
I hated this isolation .
I had a passionate interest in literature , history , foreign languages and the arts , but at the age of 15 I ’d been forced , like all students , to decide whether to study science or humanities .
From that point we divided into two cultures , and the process made idiots of us all .
Perhaps eventually we ’ll split into two species .
Reproducing only with each other , scientists will soon become so genetically isolated that they ’ll no longer be able to breed with other humans .
We all detest closed worlds : the Vatican and its dismissal of the paedophilia scandals as “ idle chatter ” ( 5 ) ; the Palace of Westminster , whose members could n’t understand the public outrage about their expenses , the police forces which refuse to discipline their errant officers ( 6 ) .
Most of us would endorse George Bernard Shaw ’s opinion that all professions are conspiracies against the laity .
Much of the public hostility to science arises from the perception that it ’s owned by a race to which we do n’t belong .
But science happens to be the closed world with one of the most effective forms of self - regulation : the peer - review process .
It is also intensely competitive , and the competition consists of seeking to knock each other down .
The greatest scientific triumph is to falsify a dominant theory .
It happens very rarely , as only those theories which have withstood constant battery still stand .
If anyone succeeded in overturning the canon of climate science , they would soon become as celebrated as Newton or Einstein .
There are no rewards for agreeing with your colleagues , tremendous incentives to prove them wrong .
These are the last circumstances in which a genuine conspiracy could be hatched .
But it is no longer sufficient for scientists to speak only to each other .
Painful and disorienting as it is , they must engage with that irritating distraction called the rest of the world .
Everyone owes something to the laity , and science would die were it not for the billions we spend on it .
Scientists need make no intellectual concessions , but they have a duty to understand the context in which they operate .
It is no longer acceptable for climate researchers to wall themselves off and leave the defence of their profession to other people .
There are signs that this is changing .
The prominent climate change scientist Simon Lewis has just sent a long submission to the Press Complaints Commission ( PCC ) about misrepresentation in the Sunday Times ( 7 ) .
The paper claimed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s contention that global warming could destroy up to 40 % of the Amazon rainforest “ was based on an unsubstantiated claim by green campaigners who had little scientific expertise . ” (8 ) It quoted Lewis to suggest that he supported the story .
The article and its claims were reproduced all over the world .
But the claims were wrong : there is solid scientific research showing that damage on this scale is plausible in the Amazon ( 9,10 ) .
Lewis claims that the Sunday Times falsely represented his views .
He left a comment on the website but it was deleted .
He sent a letter to the paper but it was n’t published .
Only after he submitted his complaint to the PCC did the Sunday Times respond to him .
The paper left a message on his answerphone , which he has made public : “ it ’s been recognised that the story was flawed .
” ( 11 ) After seven weeks of stonewalling him , the Sunday Times offered to run his letter .
But it has neither taken down the flawed article nor published a correction .
Good luck to Simon Lewis , but as the Press Complaints Commission ’s treatment of the News of the World phone hacking scandal suggests , he ’s likely to find himself shut out of another closed world – journalism – in which self - regulation manifestly does n’t work ( 12 ) .
Here ’s a profession which looks like a conspiracy against the laity , even from the inside .
The incomprehension with which science and humanities students regard each other is a tragedy of lost opportunities .
Early specialisation might allow us to compete in the ever more specialised labour market , but it equips us for nothing else .
As Professor Don Nutbeam , vice - chancellor of Southampton University complains , “ young people learn more and more about less and less . ” ( 13 )
We are deprived by our stupid schooling system of most of the wonders of the world , of the skills and knowledge required to navigate it , above all of the ability to understand each other .
Our narrow , antiquated education is forcing us apart like the characters in a Francis Bacon painting , each locked in our boxes , unable to communicate .

Pop quiz : what organization recently provided the following quotes on " graduated response " to the White House 's Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator , Victoria Espinel ?
" Private entities are not created or meant to conduct the law enforcement and judicial balancing act that would be required ; they are not charged with sitting in judgment of facts ; and they are not empowered to punish alleged criminals without a court order or other government sanction .
Indeed , the liability implications of ISPs acting as a quasi - law - enforcement / judicial branch could be enormous . "
" There are instances in which such [ infringement ] notices [ from rightsholders ] may be misdirected against non-infringing members of the household , against persons who have valid defenses , or against persons who are victims of unauthorized access to their home networks . "
" It should give the government pause that a third - party allegation , alone , without any sanction by government or order by a court , could cause an entire family to be deprived of communications , access to financial or medical information , the ability to access government services , or even the ability of children to do their school work or interact with their teachers . "
It sounds like something right from the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's playbook , but in fact all of these concerns were mooted by AT&T ( PDF ) .
The company simply refuses to play the role of a voluntary Internet cop , dishing out penalties on behalf of rightsholders , and we could n't agree more with the problems that AT&T highlighted .
But that does n't mean AT&T is opposed to various forms of " three strikes " or " graduated response " programs meant to deter online copyright infringement ; it just wants someone else to implement them .
If the government wants to get into the enforcement business , AT&T would be fine with that .
Actually , the company would be more than fine with the proposal — it suggests that the government get into the business of adjudicating such cases and dishing out penalties .
This might sound like a role for the courts , but AT&T and rightsholders argue that the current legal process is simply too slow and too expensive to deal wisely with online copyright infringement .
Instead , AT&T proposes a " streamlined and reasonable adjudication system for rights holders to resolve civil infringement claims against end users . "
Call it " court lite . "
If you 're thinking to yourself , " Self , is n't this exactly what they have in France ? " you 're on the right track .
France has gone this route , creating an official tribunal called HADOPI to oversee the graduated response system ( after constitutional concerns , a judge now has to oversee the final step in the process ) .
In France , the ultimate penalty is Internet disconnection ; AT&T says nothing about what penalties it prefers in the US .
Such a system " would provide a meaningful deterrent by heightening end - users ' understanding that infringement activities are being monitored by the content industry and that there are material consequences associated with their actions . "
Also , AT&T thinks that getting the US government into website blocking would be a pretty terrific idea .
AT&T suggests that the Department of Justice " create and maintain a list of international websites known to host and traffic in infringed copyrighted works . "
After " thorough investigation and governmental due process , " the Department of Justice could simply require ISPs to block all access to those sites .
Warnings work
The odd thing about these proposals is how little they seem to be needed .
AT&T has been forwarding infringement notices to subscribers for some time .
It has developed an " Automatic Customer Notification Service " to automate this process , though it will not share user data with rightsholders unless it gets a court order .
One might suspect that simple warnings would do no good , but AT&T says that " in our experience , the automated notice - forwarding systems that ISPs have established are highly effective at deterring the offending behavior . "
Verizon makes the same observation .
In a separate letter , Verizon tells the government that it has " implemented a notice forwarding program as part of our commercial relationships with several content owners that we believe strikes an appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of rights holders in protecting their copyrights and the important privacy and other interests of our wireline Internet access customers . "
The voluntary program was in place for all of 2009 , and it has " proven very effective in not only notifying customers about allegations of infringing behavior involving their Internet connection , but also , importantly , at educating customers about copyrights and the importance of stopping any potentially infringing behavior , all with minimal adverse customer reaction . "
( Verizon also refuses to pass subscriber information to rightsholders without a court order , so this is merely an informational notice . )
The program has been hugely successful .
" In 2009 , the first full year for which we have data , roughly 70 percent of the notices we processed were for customers receiving their first notice , " said Verizon .
" As customers progress through our multi-step process we see the number of notices processed declining rapidly at each stage , which demonstrates that the Verizon notice forwarding system is having the intended effect of decreasing dramatically the number of customers who receive multiple notices of alleged infringement .
And importantly , the program is working with minimal customer complaints . "
Critics of such warning - only schemes often charge that they can't possibly work without a serious deterrent , such as Internet disconnection .
But warning letters are a serious deterrent , for two reasons .
First , you can already be sued by rightsholders , and if you do n't think this is a big deal , look at the $ 675,000 judgment against Joel Tenenbaum .
Second , there 's the " dad factor . "
A pretty high percentage of these notices probably go to families in which widespread P2P activity is frowned upon , especially when it puts a family member at risk of a federal lawsuit .
Simply alerting parents to the issue is enough , in many cases , to bring an end to it in the household .
Survey : Women Barebacking at Higher Rates Than Gay Men
A new survey by the New York City health department finds that women engage in unprotected anal sex with male partners far more frequently than gay men do .
According to Creative Loafing , which reported on the survey , “ Of the more than 100,000 NYC women who engage in anal sex each year , only 23 % use condoms compared to 61 % of men who have sex with men . ”
The survey also reported that women who engage in unprotected anal sex get tested for HIV far less frequently than women who always use condoms during anal sex , at rates of 35 % and 63 % , respectively .
Unprotected anal sex was more frequent among younger women under age 24 and women who have many sexual partners , according to the survey .

Not only did Larry Wall answer your questions , but he said they were excellent questions .
You 've got to love Larry Wall , not just because he 's a nice guy and created Perl , but also because he is the first Slashdot interview guestto send his answers preformatted in squeaky - clean HTML .
We appreciate this like you would n't believe .
They 're great answers , too -- straightforward , heartfelt , and entertaining .
Enjoy !

I 've been using perl for a very long time , but primarily as a scripting language .
I indeed mostly use it for extraction and reporting .
With the recent developments in perl , however , there seems to be the trend that perl is able to do much , much more ( while retaining compatibility to be " just " a scripting language ) .
What do you think about how people are using Perl today ?
Are you satisfied that most people use it for simple tasks like log parsing ?
Would you like to see more advanced applications being built with Perl verses a compiled language ?
A :
I am perfectly happy for Perl to continue parsing logfiles .
Perl has always been , and always will be ( I hope ) , a humble language .
When I am 80 years old , even if everyone in the whole world puts me on a pedestal and thinks I 'm the renaissanciest man that ever lived , I still intend to take out the trash when my wife asks me to .
Just because I 'm learning Japanese does n't mean I have to stop speaking English .
But just as people grow ( and are stretched ) , Perl continues to grow ( and be stretched ) .
Perl has acquired new skills over the years , and people have been using Perl to do all sorts of things that are arguably at the limits of its capabiliites .
The solution to that is not to stop people from doing that , but to increase Perl 's dynamic range .
The thing is , people are already building more advanced applications with Perl .
But there are some aspects of that process that are n't as easy as they could be .
They 're hard .
In times past we were proud of the fact that the hard things were even possible with Perl5 .
We often chant the slogan : " Easy things should be easy , and hard things should be possible . "
But as with any slogan , there are some qustionable assumptions hidden behind the sentiment .
We assume that it 's obvious which things should be easy or hard , and that the things that are currently easy are the things that ought to be easy .
We assume that making the hard things easy will necessarily cause the easy things to become hard .
But sometimes it 's not obvious what should be easy or hard .
Sometimes the wrong things are easy .
And sometimes there are ways to make the hard things easier without making the easy things harder .
Some of the complexity in a Perl5 program is necessary to the solution , and some of it is n't .
We can't eliminate the necessary complexity , but we can hope to get rid of some of the needless complexity .
That will make everything easier .
Well , most everything ...
I 'm really under no illusions that we can make everything easier at once .
There 's no such thing as a perfect language .
Merely making a more expressive language means it's in some sense more difficult to learn to express yourself responsibly .
That 's the price of power .
Manhattan will always be more difficult to understand than a set of beads .
But in any event , let me assure you that Perl6 will not be as difficult to learn as Japanese . :-)
2 ) Perl Beginners
by KoopaTroopa
I 'm a CS student who 's recently become very interested in Perl along with other languages .
However , I do n't really have too much everyday ( or even occasional ) need to actually USE much Perl .
I am big into learning as much as I can about it for its own sake .
Now , for the question : Given this approach to learning Perl ( just for a general working knowledge , maybe light usage , ) is it really worth spending a lot of my time learning Perl now , or should I wait for the big Perl6 revision ?
A :
I do n't think you would be damaged by learning Perl5 , though I 'm sure there are those who would disagree -- or at least choose to be disagreeable .
It really depends on your curiosity level , I think .
Some people would learn both Perl5 and Perl6 merely to see how a language design evolves over time .
Those folks are pretty hardcore .
Count yourself lucky if you 're not one of them .
But despite appearances , Perl5 is n't a totally horrible language , and we 're hoping to save all the good bits of it in Perl6 .
People moving from Perl5 to Perl6 should n't find it too difficult to unlearn the naughty bits , especially since it 's the naughty bits that tend to be frustrating .
And if you 're ever in a situation where you need to use Perl6 for real , it 's likely you 'll have to deal with legacy Perl5 code anyway .
So as usual the answer is : " It depends ... "
Gildor was silent for a moment .
' I do not like this news , ' he said at last .
' That Gandalf should be late , does not bode well .
But it is said :
Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards , for they are subtle and quick to anger .
The choice is yours : to go or wait . '
' And it is also said , ' answered Frodo : ' Go not to the Elves for counsel , for they will say both no and yes . '
' Is it indeed ? ' laughed Gildor .
' Elves seldom give unguarded advice , for advice is a dangerous gift , even from the wise to the wise , and all courses may run ill .
But what would you ?
You have not told me all concerning yourself ; and how then shall I choose better than you ?
But if you demand advice , I will for friendship 's sake give it .
I think you should now go at once , without delay ; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out , then I also advise this : do not go alone .
Take such friends as are trusty and willing .
Now you should be grateful , for I do not give this counsel gladly . '
3 ) Structured programming and perl
by slashnot007
The reason I like perl is it is not a structured programming language .
In my work I find it is 50 % a get the job done parsing language and 25 % sequencer of programs and deamons and 25 % major ojbect oriented programming effort often a cgi .
Thus I worry that perl has Python - envy .
I 've tried to use python several times but always go back to perl .
The reason is my daily need for a parser dominates my choice of language and maintains my fluency , since I dont want to have to be fluent in both , perl becomes my language of choice for advanced tasks too , even though python might be better for strcutrued programming .
So my question is , is perl6 making make perl a structued language like python ?
Would it be a good idea if perl did not develop any further for fear of becoming too complicated and thus disorganized ?
( witness the evolution of java from clean slate to giant mess with intricate redundant libraries half of which are deprecated ) .
A :
Er , what do you mean by " structured " ?
25 years ago all of these languages would have been considered " structured " , in the sense that a block generally has only one entrance point .
( There were also people who thought that a block should only have one exit .
Thankfully these folks did not prevail , since functions representing decision trees often have one entry but multiple exit points . )
But you obviously mean " structured " in a different sense , or perhaps several different senses .
Syntax is structure , and different languages have different syntax , but I do n't think that 's what you mean .
I 'll assume you mean " structured " the way a grade school teacher means it , as in " structured play time " , as opposed to " free play time " .
Python 's slogan is " There 's only one obvious way to do it . "
That 's fine from the computer 's viewpoint , but kinda sucks from the human viewpoint .
" You can play any game you like , as long as it was organized by the teacher . "
Java was , in that sense , much less structured than Python , I think .
That 's part of the reason for Java 's success , but it came at a price .
One of the problems with Java is that they swept a bit too much of the innate complexity of life under the carpet of the libraries .
And so now they 've had to replace the carpets several times .
So , yes , Java started with a " clean slate " , but it was a rather undersized slate , methinks .
But as for " structured play time " in Java , the structure has been imposed more by cultural norms than by the language itself .
As for Perl , it has never been " structured " in that sense , though it has always been structured in the sense that you can create as much structure as you like .
The whole point is that the structure is optional , not imposed externally .
If you 're playing with your schoolmates at recess , you can always choose to organize a football game , but the teacher is n't making you do that .
Playing football is like programming in the large .
You have to agree on a lot of rules to do it with other people .
Perl5 does n't make it terribly easy to agree on a set of rules , and we hope to make that easier in Perl6 .
You have to have discipline to do programming in the large , but you 'll choose the discipline by turning up the big discipline knob yourself , not by having someone else turn it up for you .
Perl6 will give you the big knob .
I am philosophically opposed to turning up the knob for you , because I do n't know how fast you want it turned up .
( Perl6 will turn it up for you a little by default -- if you write a module or class , it 'll automatically default to a stricter mode than it uses for your main program . )
But the reason I do n't like doing it for you is that you know how fast you want to learn , and I do n't .
As Gildor says , you have n't told me enough about yourself for me to give you advice .
If I do n't know how hard you can paddle , I can't tell you how big of a wave to try to catch .
We all have to start with the small waves .
We find the same problem in teaching reading to kids .
Some people shout " Whole language ! " while others shout " Phonics ! "
Well , guess what , they 're both oversimplifying .
You have to learn some phonics , and then you learn some larger bits based on that , and some larger bits based on that , and eventually you find that you 're intuiting whole language .
The whole language folks fall into what I call the " Expert Fallacy " .
You look at how experts do something , and assume that 's how everyone should do it .
There are some people who are natural readers .
They naturally figure out the bits and pieces themselves .
But if you try and teach everyone that way , half your kids never figure out the phonics .
Programming is the same way .
Language designers tend to look at how experts program and then think that everyone ought to learn to program that way from the start .
That 's a bit like expecting a new surfer to do well on 40 foot waves .
Some will make it , but most will wipe out .
Perl is designed to help people learn the bits of programming they need right now without forcing them to learn the techniques they are n't ready for .
But when they are ready for them , Perl tries to be there too .
We just do n't tell the beginners that the speedometer on their golf cart wraps around several times .
4 ) What will you * not * put into Perl 6 ?
by TreyHarris
What would you say has been the number one requested feature that you will not put into Perl6 , and why not ?
A :
That depends on what you call a feature , and what you call a request .
If you look at all the RFCs at dev.perl.org , you 'll find that most of the feature requests are bogus on some level or other because they tend to suggest bandaid solutions .
Nevertheless , I think it 's best to treat them all as a " cry for help " .
With computer languages , about 75 % of the bandaids have a bullet hole underneath .
So , for instance , I officially rejected the RFC asking for multiline comments , while actually accepting the underlying premise that it was too difficult to do block comments .
But the better solution is not to introduce more syntax , but to fix the POD syntax to do what people want .
But this is Perl , after all , so there has to be more than one solution .
The other solution is to make the Perl grammar malleable enough that the user can install their own multiline comment mechanism anyway via a pragma , so there !
That 's fine by me , as long as the syntactic warpage is lexically scoped .
" All is fair if you predeclare . "
Another often - requested feature that 's not going into Perl6 is implicit lexical declarations .
That 's one of those features that seems like a good idea when you 're looking at small snippets of code , but it breaks down when the scopes get larger than you can see in a glance .
Scoping by indentation has the same problem , but nobody has seriously requested that for Perl6 , for some strange reason ...
Now you might think that getting rid of the $ , @ , and % sigils would be the number one requested feature , but typically that is suggested only by people who do n't know Perl and probably would n't use Perl even if we did get rid of them .
The folks who know Perl tend to like the sigils .
5 ) perl vs other languages
by larry bagina
Whenever perl pops up in slashdot , there are plenty of language zealots claiming perl is obsolete and you should really be using php or ruby or python instead .
What are your thoughts on these other scripting languages ?
What do you like about them , what do you dislike ?
A :
Well , in general , the thing I do n't like about other computer languages is that they 're not Perl . :-)
Seriously , Perl matches the way I think pretty well , because what I mostly want in a computer language is a wide dynamic range .
I want a language in which you can say both dirty , low - level stuff and fancy , high - level stuff .
I want a language where both baby - talk and fluency are acceptable .
Other computer languages tend to try to level those distinctions .
As for specifics , I must say that the example of Ruby is the main reason I decided against implicit lexical scoping for Perl6 .
We 'll be sticking with explicit my declarations .
But I have to like the majority of Ruby simply because that 's the part that was borrowed straight out of Perl . :-)
I also liked Ruby 's unary splat operator , so I borrowed it for Perl6 .
The main problem I see with Ruby is that the Principle of Least Surprise can lead you astray , as it did with implicit lexical scoping .
The question is , whose surprise are you pessimizing ?
Experts are surprised by different things than beginners .
People who are trying to grow small programs into large programs are surprised by different things than people who design their programs large to begin with .
For instance , I think it 's a violation of the Beginner 's Principle of Least Surprise to make everything an object .
To a beginner , a number is just a number .
A string is a string .
They may well be objects as far as the computer is concerned , and it 's even fine for experts to treat them as objects .
But premature OO is a speed bump in the novice 's onramp .
I confess , I have a soft spot in my heart for inside - out languages like PHP .
The first real compiler I ever wrote was for a sort of text - processing macro language in which the commands were embedded in the data .
This is part of a more general class of programming languages in which a peculiar form of processing is assumed by default , such as the pattern / action syntax of awk that assumes an invisible outer loop .
Perl can do that , but it 's not the default .
I think languages like awk and PHP hobble themselves in the long run by attaching themselves to a particular ecological niche , particularly when a generalist like Perl can effectively occupy the same niche .
So I 've never felt tempted to even try PHP .
I 'd only be speaking second - hand if I said that PHP has some serious namespace and extension mechanism issues .
So I wo n't say that . :-)
Python is cool to look at small bits of , but I think the " outline " syntax breaks down with larger chunks of code .
I 'm with Aristotle on the structure of discourse - - a story should have a beginning , and middle , and an end .
So should blocks .
There 's something to be said for forcing everyone to code in the same style , but that 's not the Perl Way .
At least , it 's not the default Perl Way .
But all is fair if you predeclare .
It 's perfectly fine for you to import a pragmatic module that enforces a certain style policy .
It 's even fine if your company forces you to import that pragma .
Of course , if you want real programming discipline , I 'd suggest you use Damian 's Klingon module ...
6 ) Perl and .NET
by prostoalex
What is your opinion of .NET in general and Perl 's role in it ?
Given that .NET supports
Perl as one of the languages would you recommend actually using it for any projects ?
Do you see good future for this tandem ?
A :
As far as I 'm concerned , .NET is just another architecture that we need to port Perl to run on natively .
The current approach to .NET interoperability is a bit of a hack , I think .
That is partly Perl 's fault for not having a sufficiently powerful type declaration system , but it's also a problem that .NET does n't really support dynamically typed languages very well .
I foresee that we 'll have something like a Parrot interface that functions as a ( hopefully thin ) layer of glue over other VMs such as .NET or Java machines .
The less impedence mismatch there is , the thinner the layer can be .
I recommend that you use Perl where it makes sense to use Perl , and avoid using it where it does n't make sense .
I am not the judge of whether it makes sense to use Perl on .NET , simply because I 'm way too ignorant and stupid to be making those kinds of decisions for you .
Sorry .
As for the future , I really do n't know .
Long , long ago ( when our galaxy was far away ) I shoehorned Perl and Java into the same process , and it never aroused much excitement .
Certainly the Java folks tend to turn up their noses at non-100 % Java solutions , but it got a pretty chilly reception from the other end as well .
By and large , Perl programmers do n't seem to have much appreciation for Java .
I think the language architects who are n't living in reality tend to like multi-language solutions a lot more than ordinary folks do .
Which is , of course , why we 're doing exactly the same thing with Parrot .
Go figure . :-)
6.5 ) From a project managers prospective
by mustangdavis
What are your thoughts on the comments made by people that Perl is not designed for projects that require more than one programmer ?
Many people have stated over and over again that Perl code can not be managed by more than one person ... what are your thoughts on that statement ?
How would you manage a large Perl project ?
Do you think Perl should be used for large projects ?
( or should it be used strictly as a " quick and dirty " programming language ? )
BTW : I love your work ( someone had to say it )
A :
I do not manage any large projects , appearances to the contrary notwithstanding .
I have n't an executive bone in my body .
All my managerial skills are delegated .
Ask anyone I 've delegated to ...
However , those who claim that Perl code cannot be managed by more than one person are obviously smoking something worse than crack .
They 're simply ignoring the many examples of people who have done just that .
But you would n't expect to hire random people off the street to come in and collaborate on writing a novel .
You can do it by hiring a few good novelists who already know how to figure out how to work together , or at least how to fight with each other productively .
In the absence of that level of expertise , you can also do it by setting up policies under which random people can work , rather like the rules for writing about the world of Liavek , in which , for instance , every story has to mention a camel .
That being said , there are things we can do to make Perl6 better at helping managers and architects set up such policies for programming in the large .
Having a standardized opaque object type will help there as well .
Nobody is going to claim that Perl6's OO is " bolted on " .
Well , except maybe for certain Slashdotters who do n't know the difference between rational discussion and cheerleading ...
7 ) Role of Religion ?
by Anonymous Cowdog
I remember reading at some point that you are a Christian , and there have been suggestions that some of your early missionary impulses ( a desire to do good , help others ) are perhaps part of the zeal you have put into Perl over the years .
Preferring a scientific view , I am not religious , and have no desire to be .
Perhaps there is a God , but if there is , I think he / she has no opposable thumbs ; in other words , has no power to change anything ; reality is just playing out according to the laws of physics ( whatever those are ) .
Please tell us how in the world a scientific or at least technical mind can believe in God , and what role religion has played in your work on Perl .
A :
Well , hmm , that 's a topic for an entire essay , or a book , or a life .
But I 'll try to keep it short .
When you say " how in the world " , I take it to mean that you find it more or less inconceivable that someone with a scientific mind ( or at least technical mind , hah ! ) could chooose to believe in God .
I 'd like to at least get you to the point where you find it conceivable .
I expect a good deal of the problem is that you are busy disbelieving a different God than the one I am busy believing in .
In theological discussions more than any other kind , it 's easy to talk at right angles and never even realize it .
So let me try to clarify what I mean , and reduce it to as few information bits as possible .
A lot of people have a vested interest in making this a lot tougher to swallow than it needs to be , but it 's supposed to be simple enough that a child can understand it .
It does n't take great energetic gobs of faith on your part -- after all , Jesus said you only have to have faith the size of a mustard seed .
So just how big is that , in information theory terms ?
I think it 's just two bits big .
Please allow me to qoute a couple " bits " from Hebrews , slightly paraphrased :
You can't please God the way Enoch did without some faith , because those who come to God must ( minimally ) believe that :
A ) God exists , and
B ) God is good to people who really look for him .
That 's it .
The " good news " is so simple that a child can understand it , and so deep that a philosopher can't .
Now , it appears that you 're willing to admit the possibility of bit A being a 1 , so you 're almost halfway there .
Or maybe you 're a quarter way there on average , if it 's a qubit that 's still flopping around like Shoedinger 's Cat .
You 're the observer there , not me -- unless of course you 're dead . :-)
A lot of folks get hung up at point B for various reasons , some logical and some moral , but mostly because of Shroedinger again .
People are almost afraid to observe the B qubit because they do n't want the wave function to collapse either to a 0 or a 1 , since both choices are deemed unpalatable .
A lot of people who claim to be agnostics do n't take the position so much because they do n't know , but because they do n't want to know , sometimes desperately so .
Because if it turns out to be a 0 , then we really are the slaves of our selfish genes , and there 's no basis for morality other than various forms of tribalism .
And because if it turns out to be a 1 , then you have swallow a whole bunch of flim - flam that goes with it .
Or do you ?
Let me admit to you that I came at this from the opposite direction .
I grew up in a religious culture , and I had to learn to " unswallow " an awful lot of stuff in order to strip my faith down to these two bits .
I tried to strip it down further , but I could n't , because God told me : " That 's far enough .
I already flipped your faith bits to 1 , because I 'm a better Observer than you are .
You are Shroedinger 's cat in reverse -- you were dead spiritually , but I 've already examined the qubits for you , and I think they 're both 1 .
Who are you to disagree with me ? "
So , who am I to disagree with God ? :-)
If he really is the Author of the universe , he 's allowed to observe the qubits , and he 's probably even allowed to cheat occasionally and force a few bit flips to make it a better story .
That 's how Authors work .
Whether or not they have thumbs ...
Once you see the universe from that point of view , many arguments fade into unimportance , such as Hawking 's argument that the universe fuzzed into existence at the beginning , and therefore there was no creator .
But it 's also true that the Lord of the Rings fuzzed into existence , and that does n't mean it does n't have a creator .
It just means that the creator does n't create on the same schedule as the creature's .
If God is creating the universe sideways like an Author , then the proper place to look for the effects of that is not at the fuzzy edges , but at the heart of the story .
And I am personally convinced that Jesus stands at the heart of the story .
The evidence is there if you care to look , and if you do n't get distracted by the claims of various people who have various agendas to lead you in every possible direction , and if you do n't fall into the trap of looking for a formula rather than looking for God as a person .
All human institutions are fallible , and will create a formula for you to determine whether you belong to the tribe or not .
Very often these formulas are called doctrines and traditions and such , and there is some value in them , as there is some value in any human culture .
But they all kind of miss the point .
" Systematic theology " is an oxymoron .
God is not a system .
Christians are fond of asking : " What would Jesus do in this situation ? "
Unfortunately , they very rarely come up with the correct answer , which is : " Something unexpected ! "
If the Creator really did write himself into his own story , that 's what we ought to expect to see .
Creative solutions .
And this creativity is intended to be transitive .
We are expected to be creative .
And we 're expected to help others be creative .
And that leads us back ( finally ) to the last part of your question , how all this relates to Perl .
Perl is obviously my attempt to help other people be creative .
In my little way , I 'm sneakily helping people understand a bit more about the sort of people God likes .
Going further , we have the notion that a narrative should be defined by its heart and not by its borders .
That ties in with my linguistic notions that things ought to be defined by prototype rather than by formula .
It ties in to my refusal to define who is or is not a " good " Perl programmer , or who exactly is or is n't a member of the " Perl community " .
These things are all defined by their centers , not by their peripheries .
The philosophy of TMTOWTDI ( " There 's more than one way to do it . " ) is a direct result of observing that the Author of the universe is humble , and chooses to exercise control in subtle rather than in heavy - handed ways .
The universe does n't come with enforced style guidelines .
Creative people will develop style on their own .
Those are the sort of people that will make heaven a nice place .
And finally , there is the underlying conviction that , if you define both science and religion from their true centers , they can not be in confict .
So despite all the " religiosity " of Perl culture , we also believe in the benefits of computer science .
I did n't put lexicals and closures into Perl5 just because I thought people would start jumping up and down and shouting " Hallelujah ! "
( Which happens , but that 's not why I did it . )
And now let 's all sing hymn # 42 ...
8 ) Thanks Larry
by wdr1
Like many others , I love Perl .
I use it both professionally and personally .
You 've not only helped make my career , but also given me a very pleasent past - time .
I was wondering what I can do to say thank - you ?
Can we give you money ?
Dontate something to someone , etc.?
When the new Programming Perl came out , I did n't really need anymoe ( viva perldoc ! ) , but wanted to make sure I was putting a few bucks in the pockets of those who made Perl great .
What else can I do to say thanks ?
A :
Hmm , what timing !
You must be from one of those churches where they pass the offering plate right after the sermon ... :-)
Even just saying thanks is much appreciated .
But if you want to help out more , there are lots of places to donate time or money .
Unfortunately , it takes time to figure out how to donate time , since you have to hang out with various interest groups until you get , er , interested in one of them .
But it 's part of Perl culture to value contributions to Perl culture , so do n't hold back just because your contribution is not somehow technical .
That 's not how we work .
Donating money is easy ( except , of course , for the money part ) .
Tax - deductible contributions can be made to the Perl Foundation .
Much of my support for this year has come through the Perl Foundation -- my full - time work on the Apocalypses would have been impossible without it .
If you can persuade the companies you work for to make donations or to match your donations , that 's also a worthwhile investment of time ( and in some cases , agony ) .
Please allow me to express my sincere gratitude here for everyone who has contributed already .
This program is made possible by viewers like you .
9 ) perl 6 niche
by maraist
perl 1 - 5 have been great UNIX configuration / management languages .
This includes small - scale webserver platforms .
It 's very difficult to find any other language that is as versitile in this respect where it reigns in it 's niche .
It is the perfect combination of speed , power , simplicity and huffman encoding ( especially given the co -UNIX - tools look - and - feel ) .
Perl6 on the other hand , changes this formula around ; favoring a more general solution that potentially reduces performance ( due to abstractions ) , and deviates substantially from the UNIX - family - syntax - Namely : c-ish - syntax ( colon , question mark , select , exception - handling , etc ) , awk / sedish reg -ex's , raw c-libray - wrappers , etc .
It was these very similarities that made learning and accepting perl so trivial since learning CIS and UNIX administration was sufficient to master perl in 2 days .
My question is : does perl6 have a niche in mind ?
Or is it spreading itself too thinly ; competing more and more against Java / python / C# and thus losing it 's identifiable niche ?
A :
Excellent question .
I love the evolutionary biologists ' way of talking about organisms as if they 're evolving on purpose : " I think I 'll develop feathers now and become a bird ... " , though in Perl 's case , of course , there is some amount of purpose in my head ( some would say " not enough " ) , not to mention the heads of other Perl developers ( some would say " too much " ( or is it the other way around ? ) ) , but it 's still great fun to talk about Perl as if it were its own beastie , or as if it were a character in a novel that runs away with the plot despite the intentions of the author , kinda like this sentence has .
Anyway , from the start , Perl has never really been satisfied with staying in any one particular ecological niche .
That 's not terribly healthy approach in evolutionary terms , especially when your niche goes away .
Perl 's been pretty lucky so far to land in stable niches , but if some of its current niches dry up someday , that 's really only to be expected , and indeed almost hoped for .
It 's probably the fault of closing ecological niches that we are n't all still swinging from trees , after all .
( Of course , some of us still are , but that portion of us is n't heavily represented on Slashdot .
Er...appearances to the contrary notwithstanding . )
Perl started out as just a text processing language - - a better awk and sed -- but it very rapidly spread to the ecological niche of system administration .
On Unix , at least , a lot of system administration is text processing .
With version3 , however , Perl very intentionally escaped the text - processing - only niche by adding the capability to process binary data .
Perl4 UNintentionally spread from the sysadmin niche into the CGI / Web niche .
Perl5 accellerated that trend by intentionally occupying the extensible - glue - language niche , which had the unforeseen ( by me ) but predictable result of enabling Web sites to hook all their backend databases to the various textual Internet protocols .
But if you 're worried about Perl trying to inhabit the " good for everything " niche , that 's actually been Perl 's intention since Perl5 came out .
After all , you can't add OO to any language without making it perfect . ;-)
Seriously , I think that , for many of the people who use Perl today , the ecological niche they 're thinking of is already labeled " everything " , even if it is n't quite .
For those folks , trying to make Perl better for the " everything " niche is not really an issue -- they 're already panting for it .
These are the people who will actually carry Perl over to the next ecological niche it spills into , and the ones after that .
I just made Perl a glue language , and other people applied it to bootstrapping the Web .
Making
Perl the best tool for growing programs from small to large is actually one of the underlying design goals of Perl6 .
But other people will use that to inhabit , or even create , other ecological niches .
I hope to be surprised again as I was with the Web .
I could , of course , be completely wrong .
10 ) How to get people to take Perl seriously
by kin_korn_karn
I 'm a perl programmer who uses it daily .
The push is on from the C?O types to get rid of Perl , even though a bunch of us here know it and are very proficient and fast with it .
The new standard is Java with web services and all that other BS .
This sickens me , because a ) I 'm biased towards Perl and b ) I know Java is simply a fad language and the overhead / infrastructure only serves to give do - nothing architect types jobs .
The high - level technical people in my company do n't take Perl seriously .
They see it as some kind of super - Awk or an artifact of the early days of the web .
Smart people know better , but we 're not in charge .
What do you think it would take to get people to take Perl seriously as a programming language [ again ] ?
Is widespread use of Perl a goal of yours , or do you not care ?
A :
Well , if Java really is a " fad " language , we do n't have to do anything to beat it , now do we ? :-)
Leaving that aside , my goal is ( and has always been ) for Perl to be as useful as possible .
It naturally follows that if people are avoiding Perl for artificial reasons , Perl is not being as useful as possible .
So there 's a place for advocacy .
It is an unfortunate fact that , human nature being what it is , an ounce of cheerleading often beats a pound of rational discussion .
However , my job is not to lead cheers , but to make sure that Perl is designed to be maximally useful .
It has never been a direct goal of mine to be " taken seriously " .
For good or ill , I am composed of far more levity than gravity .
And I 'm afraid some of that rubs off on Perl , too .
But if Perl is everything it ought to be , it will naturally attract serious attention over the long term .
If ecological niches are natural , and if nature abhors a vacuum , it follows that ecological niches abhor vacuums too .
I expect to hear some great sucking sounds over the next ten or twenty years .
Stocks began the second quarter on a high note , helped by new data showing that the economies of the U.S. , Europe , and China are improving .
Commodity producers led the gains , while the technology sector was a laggard , hurt by weak earnings from Research In Motion .
Some traders were hesitant to place big bets ahead of key jobs data due out Friday , when major U.S. stock exchanges will be closed for a holiday .
Expectations for the report are running high , with traders looking for the first monthly gain in U.S. payrolls in more than two years .
Many money managers wondered this week whether such good news has already been factored into stock prices during what has been an almost non -stop rally since the last monthly jobs report .
Many are preparing for a possible pause in the bull market , though no one on Wall Street believes it is due to end altogether .
" The economy continues to look like its expanding here , which is great , " said strategist Joe Williams , of Commerce Trust .
" The only challenge is how to keep surprising to the upside with each new piece of data . "

By Richard Fidler
March 30 , 2010 -- Life on the Left -- A five - year long attempt to reform the Parti Québécois ( PQ ) as an independentist and “ social - democratic ” party ended abruptly on March 13 when the PQ ’s national executive decided not to renew recognition of its left - wing “ political club ” as an authorised grouping with the party .
The decision , which effectively expelled Syndicalistes et Progressistes pour un Québec Libre ( SPQ Libre ) [ 1 ] from the party , was promptly approved by the PQ ’s conference of constituency presidents .
The PQ leadership ’s move coincided with a weekend symposium sponsored by the party on the theme of reorienting Québécois toward individual enrichment in place of collective enrichment — part of an ongoing campaign to win the hearts and votes of disaffected followers of Action Démocratique du Québec ( ADQ ) .
The far - right ADQ , which the PQ replaced as official parliamentary opposition in the December 2008 general election , has since slipped catastrophically in opinion polls and now ranks just below the left - wing party , Québec solidaire .
In 2005 the PQ had amended its statutes to allow SPQ Libre to join the party as an officially recognised “ club ” .
Party leaders , including former Premier Bernard Landry , hoped to use SPQ Libre to forestall support for Québec solidaire , which was then being formed through a fusion of left - wing organisations .
SPQ Libre member Monique Richard , former president of the CSQ , was elected president of the Parti Québécois and later elected as a PQ candidate to the National Assembly .
Other prominent SPQ Libre members included Vivian Barbot , former president of the Quebec Women ’s Federation ( FFQ ) and later a Bloc Québécois MP ; former PQ minister Robert Dean ; and Marc Laviolette , former president of the CSN ( and current SPQ Libre president ) .
The PQ leadership ’s surprise decision to expel SPQ Libre may have been provoked by the latter ’s publication on the eve of the party symposium of a major document entitled ( in translation ) “ To grow rich sustainably is to grow rich collectively ” .
It argued that Quebec ’s enormous achievements toward overcoming its historic development lag within Canada had been achieved since the 1960s through state action in the interests of the Quebec nation collectively , and that this — not individual profit - seeking — should continue to be the trajectory and hallmark of a sovereign Quebec .
The document said the only other option , which it described as “ the federalist approach ” — but was clearly the direction being mapped by PQ leader Pauline Marois and her executive — was to “ lighten the tax burden of the better - off while crossing our fingers [ in the hope ] that the monies released would not go the path of tax havens but be reinvested in Quebec ” .
The group ’s expulsion sent a clear signal to the media , the ADQ , and the PQ membership and potential funding sources that such talk was no longer acceptable within the party .
Québec solidaire a lifeline ?
But it also raised a new question as to where the now homeless SPQ - Libre and its supporters might find a lodging .
Québec solidaire was quick to respond with a statement issued March 14 by QS leaders Amir Khadir and Françoise David .
They linked the expulsion of SPQ - Libre to the pressure on the PQ of the looming confrontation between the government and the Common Front of public - sector unions , whose contracts expire at the end of March .
David noted that PQ leader Marois had recently criticised the Common Front wage demands as “ somewhat high ” .
The PQ , said David , equated wealth creation with the abandonment of social justice , “ the necessary ingredient of collective prosperity ” .
“ To defend the public sector union members , to press for recognition of the work done by health - care personnel and an end to their impoverishment , would displease our economic élite ” , said Khadir .
“ The PQ desperately lacks the necessary political courage to stand up to these powerful interests . ”
Journalist Paul Cliche , a QS member and long - time left activist — he led the Front d’Action Populaire , or FRAP , a municipal party that challenged the electoral machine of Montréal mayor Jean Drapeau in the early 1970s — issued his own statement : SPQ Libre members could “ console themselves , for there is another sovereigntist party , one resolutely progressive and turned toward the future , which is ready to welcome them — Welcome to Québec solidaire , comrades .... ”
And indeed , the existence of SPQ Libre , with its orientation to working within the PQ , has been an ever - present reminder of the incomplete nature of the left regroupment process that gave birth to Québec solidaire .
SPQ Libre clings to PQ
However , a QS - SPQ Libre fusion , while it would help give Québec solidaire a stronger presence and influence within the labour movement , is not on the immediate agenda .
In a statement issued March 18 , SPQ Libre leaders declared their intention to continue working as individual members within the PQ and urged their supporters to get elected to PQ constituency executives and become delegates to the party ’s next convention , in 2011 .
The statement holds out the hope that the party membership will somehow challenge and reverse the leadership ’s rightward turn .
A parallel statement issued on the same date by SPQ Libre said that as an independent organisation its “ mandate ” would expand , action within the PQ now being only one component .
And in an act of pure hubris , it appealed “ to independentists , progressives and trade unionists , whether members of the PQ or Québec solidaire or without a party ” ... “ to join our ranks ” !
These statements , notwithstanding their defiant tone , confirm the hopelessness of the SPQ Libre strategy .
As they relate , the group had complied with the PQ registration and filing requirements ; its members had been “ good soldiers ” , running as PQ candidates in elections , publicly voting in favour of the party ’s election platforms , loyally attempting to advance their positions within the party structures .
Where they spoke out independently , as in newspaper articles published in their name , it had been to support strikes , oppose the war in Afghanistan , criticise cutbacks in health care , etc. — “ current matters that are not contentious within the PQ , at least we hope so ” .
In party debates , they had achieved “ more victories than defeats ” — winning party support for a resolution on nationalisation of wind - power generation ( soon disavowed by the party leader ) , another resolution to make French the sole language of instruction in the publicly funded junior colleges , proposals in favour of electrification of urban and inter- urban transportation , etc. , while suffering defeat on such issues as ending government subsidies to private schools , or a proposal to allow a referendum on popular initiative , independently of government policy . [ 2 ]
But they had been accused of not conducting their debates publicly instead of confining them to the party ’s institutions .
Fair enough , said SPQ Libre , but “ it is hard to develop coherent thinking in two - minute interventions in the Constituency Presidents Council or the National Council , which meet only twice a year and where we had only one and two delegates , respectively ” .
And SPQ Libre was seldom invited to participate in party consultations .
Furthermore , there was no attempt to use the new technologies to facilitate internal debate .
“ By new technologies , we do n’t mean Twitter [ which is offered on the PQ website ] .
Sorry , we ’re willing to be concise , but 140 characters , that ’s not enough for us ! ”
And now , despite all the efforts of SPQ Libre , the PQ seemed determined to “ appease Capital ” .
Why was Pauline Marois questioning the wage demands of the Common Front ?
“ We deplore the absence of any reference to the union movement in the new PQ discourse ....
Any use of the words “ ouvrier ” , “ travailleur ” or “ populaire ” seems to be banished .
Understandably , the existence of a political club including the word “ syndicalistes ” in its title could grate on some ears . ”
More hope in the Bloc Québécois ?
In short ( although SPQ Libre does not say so ) , the Parti Québécois is what its left critics have long maintained : a bourgeois party , wholly committed to upholding capitalism , incapable of envisaging any reforms that might offer a perspective beyond the narrow horizon of neoliberalism .
The PQ ’s fundamental raison d’être is to use the resources of a “ sovereign ” state to enhance the standing and wealth of a narrow class of homespun Quebec capitalists who themselves are inextricably tied through investments and outlook to the economic and social system that oppresses the majority of Québécois .
This party cannot be the vehicle for a truly independent and progressive Quebec .
It may be that many of SPQ Libre ’s original members had already drawn that lesson .
Although it boasted an initial membership of about 800 , the group was down to some 400 or so by this year , and had just filed a list of 313 party members ’ names with the PQ while promising a dozen more to follow .
Québec solidaire already includes some former SPQ Libre members , and can hope for more in the future .
Other members have simply been absorbed by the Parti Québécois ; for example , Monique Richard , the former president of SPQ Libre and now a PQ member of the National Assembly , did not oppose the club ’s expulsion .
While continuing to hold individual memberships in the PQ , the SPQ Libre leadership seems to hold out greater hope for the federal Bloc Québécois , judging by a major article in the March issue of the monthly journal L’aut ’journal .
Pierre Dubuc , who doubles as the journal ’s editor and SPQ Libre secretary , used the occasion of the Bloc ’s 20th anniversary since its founding to score some points against the PQ leadership and to outline an optimistic perspective of a new rise in the Quebec independence movement in response to trends within the Canadian federal state .
Dubuc praised the Bloc Québécois as a party more conscious of the federalist threat to Quebec than its sister party in Quebec City , the PQ , attributing this firmness in part to the presence of leading trade union figures in its parliamentary deputation .
Dubuc is a talented journalist and a perceptive observer of Quebec and Canadian politics with a remarkable facility to articulate the historical perspective that informs the Quebec independence project , and his article , which I have translated below , merits careful reading .
There is one notable omission , however , in Dubuc ’s comparison of the Bloc Québécois with the PQ .
As I explained in a previous post , while the PQ is waging an Islamophobic campaign for a complete ban on public service employment and provision of government - funded services to anyone wearing conspicuous symbols of their religious faith ( such as the hijab or Muslim headscarf ) , the Bloc Québécois supports what it terms “ open secularism ” and is more receptive to accommodation of public displays of the beliefs of religious and ethnic minorities .
Dubuc ’s L’aut ’journal , however , has itself been conducting a retrograde Islamophobic campaign of its own .
Louise Mailloux , a regular columnist in the journal , has written many articles not only attacking “ reasonable accommodation ” of minority religious beliefs , and in particular Muslims , but viciously attacking Québec solidaire leader Françoise David for her party ’s support of “ open secularism ” .
Differences of this nature , on an important question of principle , could prove a major if not insuperable obstacle — at least in the short run — to a fusion between SPQ Libre and Québec solidaire .

The name translates freely as Trade - unionists and Progressives for a Free Québec .

An op - ed article in Le Devoir by Jean Baribeau , the SPQ Libre treasurer , however , presented a different balance sheet .
The group , he said , had “ sparked many debates , had some successes and suffered many defeats ” .
Many of you have written to us about Ubisoft 's outrageous form of DRM , where players have to be constantly connected to the Internet in order to play the company 's games -- not because the games are multiplayer , but for the sole purpose of the company being able to authenticate and keep an eye on you .
Well , everyone who purchased the games using this system became painfully aware of this deliberate defect yesterday .
Ubisoft 's DRM authentication servers went down , and were reportedly down for at least ten hours .
Since the games are also proprietary software , there 's no legal way for users to work around this problem , since they are n't allowed to modify the code themselves .
When Ubisoft takes a break , the game breaks .
What happens when Ubisoft goes out of business ( as is likely to happen if they keep this up ) , or just decides to take these DRM servers down for good ?
That 's just the way DRM proponents think things are supposed to work .
As a lawyer for the RIAA and MPAA said last year , do n't expect to still be able to use your DRMed media for long .
If you have an Amazon account , sounds like it 's time to tag new Ubisoft games like Assassin 's Creed II with " defectivebydesign " and " drm , " to make sure everyone finds out about this .
Economists :
The stimulus did n't help
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The recovery is picking up steam as employers boost payrolls , but economists think the government 's stimulus package and jobs bill had little to do with the rebound , according to a survey released Monday .
In latest quarterly survey by the National Association for Business Economics , the index that measures employment showed job growth for the first time in two years -- but a majority of respondents felt the fiscal stimulus had no impact .
NABE conducted the study by polling 68 of its members who work in economic roles at private - sector firms .
About 73 % of those surveyed said employment at their company is neither higher nor lower as a result of the $ 787 billion Recovery Act , which the White House 's Council of Economic Advisers says is on track to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of the year .
That sentiment is shared for the recently passed $ 17.7 billion jobs bill that calls for tax breaks for businesses that hire and additional infrastructure spending .
More than two - thirds of those polled believe the measure wo n't affect payrolls , while 30 % expect it to boost hiring " moderately . "
But the economists see conditions improving .
More than half of respondents -- 57 % -- say industrial demand is rising , while just 6 % see it declining .
A growing number also said their firms are increasing spending and profit margins are widening .
Nearly a quarter of those surveyed forecast that gross domestic product , the broadest measure of economic activity , will grow more than 3 % in 2010 , and 70 % of NABE 's respondents expect it to grow more than 2 % .
Still , the survey suggested that tight lending conditions remain a concern .
Almost half of those polled said the credit crunch hurts their business .
Dear Culinary SOS : I ’m not one for tomato soups , but I was at the Lumberyard in Laguna Beach the other day and had the most marvelous tomato bisque .
Do you think you could get the chef to part with the recipe ?

A POINT OF VIEW
New Zealand is talking about whether to become part of Australia .
It would be a sad step for a country which has used its independence to set an example for the rest of the world , says Simon Schama .
On a recent Sunday morning in New Zealand I 'm waiting to do a turn on breakfast TV with a tough , veteran presenter , Paul Holmes , whose sharp tailoring at an hour when most of us are still in pyjamas seems , all by itself , a reproach to dozy thinking .
FIND OUT MORE ...
A Point of View , with Simon Schama , is on Fridays on Radio 4 at 2050 BST and repeated Sundays , 0850 BST
Or listen to it here later I 'm in a studio in Wellington ; he 's in Auckland .
We are connected by a satellite feed , but there is something about Paul that reminds me of a Latin teacher who had an uncanny knack for spotting where my mind was wandering .
The rest of the class would be plodding through Parthia with Caesar 's legions , but Schama ?
He was off somewhere on a Pacific lagoon backing up Elvis as grass skirts swayed to a tropic breeze .
" Boy at the back WAKE UP ! " the Master Conjugator would roar and you can bet I did .
So , this Sunday , even though my fellow writers at the Wellington festival have been making friends with the Pinot Noir until all hours , I sit up straight in the studio and pay attention as Paul and his politician guests tackle a painful question for the half - hour before my interview .
That subject turns out to be the suicide of New Zealand .
No not suicide in New Zealand but a proposal to cash in the country 's independence and become instead , the seventh state of the Australian commonwealth .
An opinion poll has suggested that no less than one in four New Zealanders are in favour of this startling departure , and fully a half of the polled want to begin serious debate about it .
What - in the name of Edmund Hillary , the haka and all things Kiri te Kanawa - are they talking about ?
Do n't they know that Poms live for the moments - and they happen all too infrequently - when the Aussies get shafted by the Men in Black ?
Australia - making all the running against New Zealand
Is n't it bad enough they have the sunshine , the terminally cute wombat , and Nicole Kidman ?
Must they get the kiwi and the juiciest spring lamb in the world too ?
The reasons habitually given for this overture are , surprise , surprise economic and not without a steely logic .
Over the past two decades , per capita incomes in the two countries on opposite sides of the Tasman Sea have been diverging with New Zealand on the short end of the trend .
Young brains have been draining to Melbourne , Sydney and Perth .
As the British and Irish descendants depart for Oz , the great trans -Pacific Asian migration moves in .
New Zealand is one of the least racially defensive places on the face of the Earth , but even in high - minded circles there 's anxiety about a shift in cultural identity .
Which seems to me to be even less of a reason to cash in that identity in for the Mephistophelian allure of the mineral - rich economy of Australia .
I must have registered shock for when Paul asks me to chip in , the words " birthright " and " mess of pottage " escape my lips .
Some days later in Sydney , though , I can see the point of kiwis who are thinking the unthinkable .
Is there any more gorgeous city on the face of the Earth ?
No , there is n't .
Paris ?
Oh please : food and fashion are so over .
New York ?
Uninspired modern art and punitive traffic on the West Side Highway .
London .
OK the great world city .
But unlike London , the economic outlook in Sydney is as sunny as the weather .
Future of megastates Unemployment stands at 5 % .
Property prices are going up .
As are glittering high rise office towers , designed by the usual premier league of celebrity architects .
The creamily clad Opera House sits enthroned on its pedestal in the harbour , as the muscle - toned and the tanned jog by the water .
Something deeper and sadder is lurking here : the embarrassment of smallness
And for a moment you say to yourself , well , all right , who would n't want to be along for that kind of thrilling Aussie ride into the Pacific - Asian future ?
But then you snap out of it .
Because you realise that the economic rationale for making New Zealand more Australian is just that - a rationalisation .
Something deeper and sadder is lurking here : the embarrassment of smallness .
I take a straw poll in the studio in Wellington and it's only the producer who says yes she 'd vote for a union tomorrow because the country might stake more of a claim in the coming world .
By which she means the world of the economic megastates whose population is counted in the hundreds of millions rather than New Zealand 's 4.3 .
Better to be a tickbird on the hide of the pachyderm than trampled ignominiously beneath its thundering feet is it ?
Wretched cookie cutters
To my appeal to leave New Zealand just as it is , my hosts are too polite to retort " that 's rich coming from you " and remind me that in 1973 we ran off to the EU ; responding to sleeve tugging from the orphaned antipodes with a brush - off telegram : " Thanks a ton for Gallipoli and all the butter , but this is just the way it is .
Sorry about the surplus to requirement sheep .
Have a nice life . "
I 'm all for micro-anachronism .
Long live Andorra !
Hail to thee O Liechtenstein !
May Sikkim never perish from the face of the earth !
But even acknowledging the hypocrisy , I still do n't want to see New Zealanders selling short the rich history of their peculiar place in the world .
I 'm not an enthusiast for one - size - fits - all versions of national community : interchangeable airports , cookie - cutter multiplexes , die - stamp shopping malls .
I 'm all for micro-anachronism .
Long live Andorra !
Hail to thee O Liechtenstein !
May Sikkim never perish from the face of the Earth .
I own up to a smidgin of nostalgia here .
For anyone who grew up in the 1950s , it 's a weird and not unpleasant experience to travel thousands of miles to the opposite ends of the Earth and , in New Zealand 's smaller towns , arrive where you began your life amidst drizzle - sprayed bowling greens , rose gardens , and shops selling Bassett 's Liquorice Allsorts .
But that 's the knitted tea -cosy cliche about the country .
The strength of its history could not be less purl and plain .
Wherever you look , the New Zealand story has been heroic , volcanic , singular .
Its island masses , torn from Gondwanaland , stayed so remote that for millions of years they knew no mammalian life .
Insects , reptiles and birds shared the lush ecology and without any predators , many birds evolved flightlessly .
Zoological miracle
In an ambitious ecological restoration project , set around an old 19th Century Wellington reservoir , it 's possible to get a glimpse of that miracle of zoological idiosyncrasy .
Deep in the shade of tree ferns , a lizard - like tuatara , identical to its ancestors 200 million years ago , snoozes , its skin papery , eyelids wrinkled like some retired professor taking a nap .
SuBo sound - alike - the Tui bird Higher up a tui bird goes through its sweetly comical repertoire of impersonations , sounding first like the winding of an old clock , then Susan Boyle in top form .
But the exceptional New Zealand history that needs to be preserved is human .
Whatever its ethnic and social battles , New Zealand has often led the way .
In 1893 it was the first country in the world to give women the vote , and it was the first to offer old - age pensions to the poor .
But it 's the story of Maori and pakeha , the settlers of European origin , that - for all the pain , betrayals and suffering - still deserve to be known and celebrated as offering a different model of cultural encounter than anywhere else in the world .
The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi which , in usual imperial style , seized sovereignty from the Maori and laid it at the feet of Queen Victoria did so on condition that their property rights and political and cultural integrity were respected .
Needless to say in the generations that followed , this pact was respected more in the breach than the observance , but New Zealand history did follow its own extraordinary course .
Divided no longer - Maoris and European descendants
In their first wars against violations of Waitangi the Maori effectively won the battle with the pakeha .
Decimated by imported diseases for which they had no immunity , the Maori were expected , at the turn of the 20th Century to be on their way to extinction or extreme marginalisation like native Americans or Australian aborigines .
Nothing of the sort has happened .
Today they constitute - by one count - almost 20 % of the population and astonishingly a special tribunal created in the 1970s has been ruling on land claims dating back to the post - Waitangi years .
Maori and the descendants of intermarriages that go back deep into the 19th Century , are to be found in every leading walk of life in the country .
Of course there have been serious problems of unequal social opportunity , of street gangs .
But if there is anywhere in the post - colonial world where two cultural worlds truly live an engaged life alongside each other , it 's in New Zealand .

There is a considerable rational argument for two friendly neighbouring countries to join together , but does this really mean creating one country , or just a union ?
If one country is created does that mean regional culture is lost ?
Scotland , Wales , Corsica , Puerto Rico , and many more are not independent , but try telling them they do n't have their own culture !
Another issue NZ would face is one of neglect ; who says Australia would hand over cash indefinitely ?
Max Patrick NZ has no intention of becoming a state of Oz .
It is not in any of the main political parties agendas , nor is it being widely discussed amongst the populous .
Sure , from time to time someone in the media brings the subject up to try to get some debate going and raise their profile - Paul Holmes has had a very lucrative career by sparking such debate .
Lisa GI , Wellington NZ
I do n't believe that NZ needs to become a state of Australia ; however there is certainly a need for an economic alliance much like the EU .
The brain drain is huge and having a big impact on the economy .
I think it 's time the strongest Oceania nations considered banding together to allow the free flow of workers , travellers and businesses .
Aussie and NZ could maintain their unique identities , laws and parliaments .
Richard Lafferty , Auckland , New Zealand
Why would union threaten New Zealand 's proud history ?
It 's already happened .
As for that country 's outstanding natural beauty , again , why would that need to be affected by a political and societal change ?
The Aussies have a pretty decent record when it comes to maintaining national parks and the like ; much of the land around Sydney Harbour - that , if it ever came to market would fetch millions - is protected .
The only smear on Aussie 's card is their past dealings with the Aborigines , but again , that is in the past , and the addition of New Zealand 's experience and conscience in resolving the imperial hangover could really help .
I have learned that nationalism is bunk , in all its forms .
If there are solid economic and social reasons for New Zealand to become part of Australia then good luck to them .
Charlie Nelson , London , UK
As the author suggests , New Zealand has been an example for the world to look at .
Merging with Australia just for economic reasons does n't make any sense to me .
If the bright young brains are leaving for Sydney , then may be it is time to find out why are they doing so .
With a population of only 4.3 million , I do n't think job creation is that much of a problem .
The government should think of giving some perks to young minds that would stay , or open doors to brains from other parts of the world .
I would definitely go to New Zealand !
Sainagakishore Srikantham , Pune , India Having lived in Sydney for 4 years and visited New Zealand in Jan / Feb ' 09 , I would say that both have great beauty , wonderful people and tremendous history .
In this case I believe that the sum of the two would be less than the two individual nations .
Caving into economics in all areas is not the answer .
We have lost control of our nation to the special interests and economic forces .
I realise it is difficult for the younger people to find challenging work , but with appropriate programs that asset can be home grown by carving out special niches .
Other factors are more important ; quality of life , peace and ecological balance are hard to regain once lost .
Think deeply about this proposal .
New Zealand has unique qualities rarely found elsewhere , and certainly not as deeply or as extensively .
Truly a rare paradise !
Kevin McQuillen , San Diego , California , USA I 'm an Australian whose best friends down the years have tended to be Kiwi - which of course I 'll deny ever having written .
Oz and Kiwi-land are two different cultures .
The Kiwis have an extremely interesting and valuable heritage which would be diluted and lost were they to become our seventh state .
I would hate to see that happen , as I have gained great personal and professional value from the differences .
The similarities and shared portions of history are many .
I would much rather see stronger economic and political ties .
There must be ways to improve those short of destroying a great culture .
Erich , Khartoum , Sudan I first read about this poll / debate in the Auckland Herald , and as a proud New Zealander I was absolutely horrified .
I am deeply saddened by the idea that one day I might have to stop calling myself a New Zealander .
I can understand the desire to do something radical to improve NZ 's economic future , but to give up its national identity is surely a step too far !
New Zealand is a unique country - geographically and culturally - and we should be celebrating that uniqueness , capitalising on it and standing tall .
New Zealand holds a strong fascination for the rest of the world ; almost everyone I have ever talked to in my travels / living abroad since 1994 wax lyrical about the beauty of NZ , and are desperate to visit one day !
I cannot see how the giving up of our national identity , pride and uniqueness is the answer to a bright future for Aotearoa .
Fiona Black , Madrid , Spain I think a merger would be an excellent idea .
Why not create a commonwealth of attached countries like the UK , the States within Germany , or the Scandi / Poland - Lithuanian alliances of the past ?
The financial crisis showed that there is safety in numbers , and there are economies of scale and potential co-operation in all things , from the military to medicine .
A UK - like structure ( with devolved assemblies ) would ensure cultural - and sporting - identities were maintained .

Labour and the Liberal Democrats today published their green manifestos , highlighting wide differences between the two parties on how the UK will be powered in the future .
Labour announced support for new low - carbon " economic areas " in each region , and 5,000 new apprentices in the clean - tech economy .
The Lib Dems gave more details about their ambitious main manifesto pledge to create a zero- carbon Britain by the middle of the century .
In addition to their earlier promise to generate all electricity from renewable sources – and at least three - quarters from offshore wind and marine or tidal power – the Lib Dems said Britain would have to slash emissions from transport , heating buildings , industry and agriculture .
The UK could offset up to 10 % of emissions by buying credits from overseas projects .
Labour sources said the pledge was an " empty gesture " as MPs had already voted for an 80 % cut in emissions by 2050 .
Last week , the party attacked the Lib Dems for saying such targets could be met without using nuclear power , which Labour and the Conservatives support .
Simon Hughes , the Lib Dem shadow climate and energy spokesman , told the Observer that the greater use of renewable energy in Scandanavia , the Netherlands and Germany showed that much more could be done , and privately other European politicians have spoken of decarbonising their economies without nuclear power .
The Lib Dems want to focus on insulation programmes for homes and public buildings , and on boosting renewable energy industries , including a major apprenticeship scheme .
The party said these plans would receive £ 3.1 bn from other spending programmes in the first year , and income from a tax on planes in future years .
Labour sources said low - carbon zones could provide a focus for different industries to work together .
Existing examples include a marine energy hub in the south - west and an emerging electric car industry in the north - east .
Other possible coalitions include carbon capture and storage for coal power in Yorkshire and Humberside .
Nick Clegg , the Lib Dem leader , said in his party 's green manifesto that the Tories " talk the talk on green issues only to align themselves with climate deniers in the European parliament " , and claims that voting for the Green party is a waste because they " cannot make a difference in Westminster " .

Although the man was not offended , someone who overheard the remark was , and complained to Mr Amor 's bosses at Opcare , which makes prosthetic limbs .
Mr Amor , 61 , was said to be devastated at the prospect of losing his job and shot himself outside his house , near Bolton , England , just hours after receiving an email from his bosses .
The email had asked him to explain his comment .
According to The Mail on Sunday , Mr Amor left three notes , all of which mentioned Opcare .
One of his friends told the paper : " Roy made a joke along the lines that his friend had better hide in case the officers found him .
" It was nothing more than a good - humoured joke but apparently someone overheard it and made an official complaint because they thought it was racist .
" Roy was devastated when he was suspended and was worried he might lose his job . "
Mr Amor had worked at the prosthetics clinic for 30 years and had not faced any disciplinary action before .

A moon probe has found millions of tons of water on the moon 's north pole , NASA reported Monday .
The vast source of water could one day be used to generate oxygen or sustain a moon base .
A NASA radar aboard India 's Chandrayaan - I lunar orbiter found 40 craters , ranging in size from 1 to 9 miles across , with pockets of ice .
Scientists estimate at least 600 million tons of ice could be entombed in these craters .
The radar , called the Mini -SAR , sends pulses of left - polarized radio waves out to measure the surface roughness of the moon .
While smooth surfaces send back a reversed , right - polarized wave , rough areas return left - polarized waves .
Ice , which is transparent to radio waves , also sends back left - polarized waves .
The Mini-SAR measures the ratio of left to right circular polarized power sent back , or the circular polarized ratio ( CPR ) .
However , a high CPR alone can't distinguish between rough patches and regions with ice .
The north pole craters had a high CPR on the inside , with a low CPR on the edges .
That suggests a material enclosed in the craters , rather than surface roughness , caused the high CPR signal .
According to NASA , the ice would have to be relatively pure ice and at least several feet thick to give this signature .
In November , NASA crashed a probe into the Cabeus crater near the moon ’s south pole and also found evidence of water .

More than 1 in 3 of San Francisco 's nearly 27,000 city workers earned $ 100,000 or more last year - a number that has been growing steadily for the past decade .
The number of city workers paid at least $ 100,000 in base salary totaled 6,449 last year .
When such extras as overtime are included , the number jumped to 9,487 workers , nearly eight times the number from a decade ago .
And that calculation does n't include the cost of often - generous city benefits such as health care and pensions .
The pay data obtained by The Chronicle show that many of the high earners bolstered their base pay with overtime and " other pay , " a category that includes payouts for unused vacation days and extra money for working late - night shifts .
Leading 2009's $ 100,000 Club was the Police Department 's Charles Keohane , a deputy chief who retired midyear .
His total payout was $ 516,118 , city records show , the bulk of which came from cashing out stored - up vacation , sick days and comp time .
Several other police employees who changed rank or retired also saw their annual earnings swell .
When asked how he felt about landing in the No. 1 spot , Keohane joked , " Not so good , if it 's going to get my name in the paper . "
The 36 - year SFPD veteran , whose last assignment was head of administration , said much of that pay was taken out in taxes .
" I helped reduce the deficit , " he said .
The average city worker salary in San Francisco is $ 93,000 before benefits , according to Deputy City Controller Monique Zmuda .
The data take into account everyone from park gardeners and street cleaners to attorneys and technology specialists .
Almost 100 city employees made $ 200,000 or more in 2009 ; six bumped past $ 300,000 when overtime and other cash - outs were included .
Muni chief 's base pay
Only one city employee had a base salary topping $ 300,000 .
Nathaniel Ford , executive director of the Municipal Transportation Agency , made $ 332,489 .
Mayor Gavin Newsom had a base salary of $ 250,903 in 2009 , which put him 29th on the list of best - paid city employees .
The ballooning number of highly paid workers is driven by several factors , including inflation , a persistent reliance on overtime and generous contracts in a city known for its politically potent unions .
The city also negotiated a deal to give raises to some workers who agreed to pick up a portion of their pension contributions , City Controller Ben Rosenfield said .
That arrangement pushed almost 2,000 city employees above the $ 100,000 mark in recent years , he said .
In years past , the $ 100,000 Club included large numbers of Muni operators , transit supervisors , firefighters , police officers and sheriff 's deputies who padded their paychecks with hundreds of hours of overtime , paid out at a rate of time - and - a - half .
But a 2008 rule capped most employees ' overtime to 30 percent of base pay , in effect spreading out overtime opportunities to more employees , Zmuda said .
That and other efforts to curtail overtime appear to be working , with payments projected to drop to $ 139.8 million this fiscal year , down from $ 142.1 million last year and $ 167.7 million the year before , according to the controller 's office .
In the fiscal year that ended in June 2009 , city salaries accounted for $ 2.5 billion of the $ 6.6 billion budget .
That does not include the cost of benefits .
Faced with a $ 483 million deficit heading into the new fiscal year that starts July 1 , Newsom is looking to reduce labor costs to help plug the gap .
The mayor last week struck a tentative deal with union negotiators that includes 12 furlough days , equivalent to a 4.6 percent pay cut , for about 90 percent of city workers .
The mayor also has asked city department heads and their top managers to take a 10 percent pay cut .
The mayor and his chief of staff plan to give up 15 percent of their salary .
Good work
For some government jobs , San Francisco pays similar salaries as other Bay Area jurisdictions , according to compensation surveys compiled by the city 's Department of Human Resources .
For example , a stationary engineer in San Francisco earns a maximum annual base salary of $ 72,488 , 1.6 percent above the Bay Area average .
A San Francisco police officer has a maximum base salary of $ 102,648 , 2.8 percent above the average .
Payroll clerks , however , have a base salary of $ 54,314 , 16.4 percent higher than the average , and firefighters make $ 100,646 in base salary , 6.6 percent above the average , the surveys showed .
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Steve Falk said that annual salaries of $ 100,000 or more are n't as eye - popping as they were a decade ago .
" I do n't think the $ 100,000 pay threshold continues to be the best measure of city government efficiency .
It is certainly a good tool for monitoring anomalies and excessive overtime pay , but the real concern is the pay comparison with the private sector , " he said .
Above private sector
He pointed to state Employment Development Department data that show city workers on average earn 20 percent more than those in the private sector in San Francisco .
In addition , Falk said , city workers " have significantly better health and pension benefits " that continue to be the biggest cost driver threatening city services .
That needs to be reformed , he said .
Many of the highest - earning city employees - including engineers , doctors and attorneys - are paid comparably to their counterparts in the private sector or can help make up for earning less pay with better benefits .
" City government is becomingly increasingly technical and more sophisticated , and you have to pay for the talent , " said Bob Muscat , head of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 21 .
In 2007 , when Newsom was running for a second term as mayor , he negotiated a 23 percent pay increase for police and firefighters spread over four years .
Muni drivers , whose pay is guaranteed under the voter - approved city charter to be the second highest among American transit operators , are set to get an 8 percent raise July 1 .

The cocktails started early , before the train left Manhattan , and by 6 p.m. most of the passengers were already on the second round .
Tiny vodka bottles and punched ticket stubs littered the floor .
A game of dice by the bar was getting rowdy as a couple canoodled in the corner , beers in hand .
The bar car is a mainstay of the commuting life , a lurching lounge on wheels inseparable from the suburbia of Cheever and “ Mad Men . ”
“ The commute is so bad as it is , ” explained Paul Hornung , a financial worker , as he sipped a Stella Artois .
“ This is the one thing you can look forward to . ”
But perhaps not for long .
Having survived numerous attempts at prohibition and outlasted its brethren in the suburbs of Chicago and New Jersey , the bar car out of Grand Central Terminal is now facing its gravest threat : the great recession .
A new fleet of cars will soon replace the 1970s - era models now used by commuters on the Metro - North Railroad line heading to Connecticut .
But with money tight , railroad officials said they could not yet commit themselves to a fresh set of bar cars , citing higher costs for the cars ’ custom design .
Alleged request not to be served by ' people of colour ' emerges in writ by waiter against Ritz - Carlton in Naples , Florida
A British family has been banned from staying at a chain of luxury hotels after allegedly requesting not to be served by " people of colour " at a Florida resort .
The demand , allegedly lodged by the family on arrival , has emerged in a claim by a Haitian - born waiter against the Ritz - Carlton hotel in Naples , Florida .
The family , named by the hotel as the Morgans , are said to have checked in on 28 February .
According to the writ , the hotel – at the direction of its managing director , Edward Staros – recorded on its computers the " preference " that the family not be served by " people of colour " or staff with " foreign accents " .
The note reportedly added : " This couple is very very prejudice " .
The claimant , Wadner Tranchant , 40 , a naturalised US citizen who has worked at the Ritz - Carlton for 15 years , said that on 12 March the hotel " instructed the serving staff regarding the stated prejudice of the Morgan family " when they reserved a table in the restaurant .
Tranchant 's attorney , Michael McDonnell , told the Guardian : " As a lawyer you are required to conduct an investigation before taking a case , and we have done that .
There are a number of witnesses to support his story . "
Tranchant is still employed at the Ritz - Carlton despite his lawsuit against the hotel chain , McDonnell said .
The lawsuit seeks more than $ 75,000 ( £ 49,000 ) in compensation for Tranchant , who was " humiliated , embarrassed , frightened , intimidated , subject to undeserved shame and suffered severe emotional distress " .
No date has been set for a hearing .
The hotel has 20 days from when the lawsuit was filed on Tuesday to submit a formal response .
The Ritz - Carlton 's website promises " world class restaurants and impeccable service " at its Naples property , a 450 - room waterfront hotel with panoramic views of the Gulf of Mexico , two heated swimming pools and two golf courses designed by the former world No 1 Greg Norman where rates start at $ 439 .
Tranchant 's claim states that staff in the restaurant were advised " through its computer notification system and word of mouth " of the family 's " stated prejudice " , and that as Tranchant began to serve them " he was prevented by his supervisors from doing so because they did not want to be waited on by a black person " .
The lawsuit adds : " Other employees also encountered similar treatment on multiple occasions " , with " such conduct so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person in [ Tranchant 's ] position would find the work environment to be hostile or abusive " .
The Ritz - Carlton group declined to say whether any staff had been disciplined , but confirmed the family had been contacted and " banned from staying at any Ritz - Carlton hotel " .
Vivian Deuschl , a company spokeswoman in Washington , said the hotel " does not tolerate or condone discrimination of any kind by its employees or visiting guests . "
Bruce Seigel , the hotel 's director of marketing , added : " The hotel has very strict policies in place to prohibit discrimination and harassment and we take very seriously any allegation of discrimination or harassment . "
The case provoked a flurry of comments on US websites .
" The hotel should be fined heavily … and the money given to a charity that helps fight racism , " was one view .
" Those beastly boors from Britain should have been given the boot the moment they made their bigoted request , " noted another blogger .
One New Yorker posted : " I know this may sound wrong , but I have to side with the hotel on this one .
They 're simply doing what they 're supposed to and honor the old adage about the customer always being right . "

NEW YORK , Feb 24 ( Reuters ) - Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O will announce in March new technology for communications service providers to offer more advanced , high - speed Internet connections , a source familiar with the plan said on Wednesday .
The move comes as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission plans to demand faster Internet speeds as part of its National Broadband Plan to be unveiled on March 17 .
Cisco said on Wednesday it will unveil technology on March 9 that will “ forever change the Internet . ”
On its website , the network equipment maker said the change would show “ what ’s possible when networking gets an adrenaline boost . ”
The company declined to elaborate , but the source said the technology would help telecom service providers like phone companies offer better , high - speed Internet service .
The FCC wants minimum Internet data transmission speeds of 100 megabits per second ( Mbps ) to 100 million homes within a decade , compared with current industry estimates of less than 4 Mbps .
Google Inc GOOG.O has also rattled the service provider industry with a plan to build a super - fast Internet network of its own .
Cisco is the world ’s top maker of routers , switches , and other network equipment that help phone companies and corporations manage their networks and enable faster , more stable Internet connections .

Well , she 's not going to be the next Oprah .
Big surprise here — no one liked it .
Not the Daily News , LAT , or anyone else .
Some of the words used in reviews : " overly - scripted , " " flat " and " boring . "
The results are in !
While she managed to get some of her favorite themes across — government is bad , corporate America is good , I will exploit my family for money — the show was nothing more than a collection of semi-tear jerking stories spliced with some one - liners .
The generally Palin - friendly Daily News ( comparatively speaking at least ) gave the show only two stars , but blamed Fox producers , not Palin , for blowing it .
The Times ' Alessandra Stanley was a little more direct in her critique :
Ms. Palin , who mostly narrated taped stories about inspiring Americans - a war hero , a philanthropist , a boy with cerebral palsy and his service dog - gave a competent , but generic performance , as cheery and bland as any news anchor 's in the mainstream media she deplores .
Ms. Palin is telegenic , but her restraint was more noticeable than her charm .
Put it this way :
She made the former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , who has his own talk show on Fox News called " Huckabee , " seem like Jerry Lee Lewis . "
The LA Times said :
Despite her time on the campaign trail and in front of often - unfriendly cameras , Palin still has an eyes - locked - on - the - teleprompter stiffness . "
So there you have it .
The critics have spoken and no one should be shocked that Real American Stories sucked .
Now all we can do is wait for Sarah Palin 's Alaska to totally blow our minds .

Most books are intended to be easily read and understood , and the oldest ones can often serve as windows into long - extinct cultures and ways of life .
But others , either because of intentional obfuscation by the author or by virtue of being written in dead languages , remain mysterious to the scholars that study them .
From obscure religious texts and books about magic to unbreakable codes and ciphers , the following are the ten artifacts of literature that have most confounded researchers and translators .
10 . The Codex Seraphinianus
Written between 1976 and 1978 by Italian artist Luigi Serafini , the Codex Seraphinianus is nothing if not an intentional attempt at creating something mysterious .
As much as it can be understood , the book is said to be an encyclopedia of an imaginary planet , complete with maps and drawings of plant and animal life .
Most interesting of all , Serafini wrote the book in the language of his hypothetical world .
The whole Codex is composed in a bizarre alphabet that has still yet to be translated even after intense study by linguists .
Since the text itself is unreadable , the Codex has become most famous for Serafini ’s artwork , which ranges from the surreal and beautiful to the downright disturbing .
One page depicts fruit that seems to bleed , while another shows fish that are shaped like flying saucers .
In one of the book ’s most famous images ( it ’s been the cover in most editions ) , a series of panels depict a naked man and woman slowly transforming into an alligator .
Possible Explanations
Theories abound as to what the secret of the Codex Seraphinianus really is , but Serafini has remained tight - lipped about the book ’s meaning ever since its release in the early 80s .
Critics and admirers have proposed numerous theories , among them that the book ’s text is actually a false language that means nothing , but no real answers have ever been uncovered .
9 . The Liber Linteus
The Liber Linteus is an ancient text that dates back to the days of the Etruscans , a culture that flourished in Italy in the years prior to the rise of the Roman Empire .
In addition to being one of the oldest and longest Etruscan documents , the Liber Linteus is also notable for being the only known example of a book made from linen .
Even more interesting than the document itself is the context of its discovery .
After the fall of the Etruscans , artifacts of their culture like the Liber Linteus ceased to hold any significance to the Romans .
What they did care about , though , was the linen cloth that the book was written on .
This was because after the Romans conquered Egypt , many of them began to embrace the custom of mummification , which required that the body be wrapped in cloth .
It was through this practice that the Liber Linteus , which was probably seen as a useless artifact , was eventually used as a funeral wrapping for the mummified body of the wife an Egyptian tailor .
This same mummified corpse was purchased hundreds of years later by a wealthy Croatian , who intended to use it as a wall decoration .
After his death in the 1800s , the mummy was donated to a museum , and only then was the great cultural significance of the Liber Linteus realized .
Possible Explanations
In its entirety , the Liber Linteus consists of 230 lines of text totaling 1,200 words .
Very little is known today about the Etruscan language , and as such the document has never been fully translated .
But based on their limited knowledge , scholars have determined that the Liber Linteus is most likely a calendar describing Etruscan religious ritual .
8. The Book of Soyga
The Middle Ages produced their share of strange texts , but perhaps none was as mysterious as the Book of Soyga , a treatise on magic and the paranormal that contains passages that have yet to be translated by scholars .
The book is most famously associated with John Dee , a noted thinker of the Elizabethan era who was known to dabble in the occult .
In the 1500s , Dee was said to be in possession of one of the only copies of the book , and he supposedly became obsessed with unlocking its secrets , particularly a series of encrypted tables that Dee believed held the key to some kind of esoteric spiritual knowledge .
This was no easy task , as the book ’s unknown author had utilized a number of typographical tricks , including writing certain words backwards and encoding others in mathematical script .
Dee became so fixated on cracking the codes that he even traveled to continental Europe in order to meet with a famous spiritual medium called Edward Kelley .
Through Kelley , Dee claimed to have contacted the archangel Uriel , who he claimed told him that the book ’s origins dated back to the Garden of Eden .
Possible Explanations
Unfortunately , Dee was unable to finish decoding the mysteries of the Book of Soyga before his death .
The book itself , though known to have existed , was believed lost until 1994 , when two copies of it were rediscovered in England .
Scholars have since studied the book , and one of them was able to partially translate the tables that had so fascinated Dee .
Still , beyond finding that the book is most likely related to Kabbalah , a mystical sect of Judaism , these researchers have not been able to decipher the book ’s real significance .
7. The Rohonc Codex
One document that has proven resistant to any kind of consistent translation or explanation is the Rohonc Codex , a centuries - old book that is said to have surfaced in Hungary sometime in the 1700s .
The Codex consists of 448 pages of text , all of it written in a still - unknown language .
Scholars have argued that it could be anything from early Hungarian to Hindi , but it lacks many of the prominent features of any of these languages .
Moreover , the alphabet features many more characters than any major language outside of Chinese .
Perhaps even more fascinating than the text of the Rohonc Codex are the 87 illustrations that accompany it .
These depict everything from landscapes to military battles , but they also employ religious iconography that is unique to a number of different religions , including Christianity , Hindu , and Islam .
This would suggest that whatever culture the document depicts had many different faiths in existence simultaneously .
Possible Explanations
There have been several partial translations of the Rohonc Codex , each with its own unique results .
One scholar proclaimed the document to be a religious text , while another said it was a history of the Vlachs , a Latin culture that once thrived in modern - day Romania .
But perhaps the most popular take on the document ’s origin is that it was a hoax perpetrated by Samuel Literati Nemes , a notorious forger from the mid-1800s .
This idea has often been disputed , but though they have managed to prove that the text of the Codex is not just gibberish , modern scholars have been unable to prove the forgery theory wrong .
6. Rongorongo
Rongorongo is n’t so much a text as it is series of artifacts .
The name refers to an indecipherable system of pictographic writing that originated on the small island nation of Rapa Nui , also known as Easter Island .
Few examples of Rongorongo exist , outside of some stone carvings and wood tablets , but it remains one of the biggest unsolved linguistic mysteries in the world .
This is because Easter Island ’s sheer isolation means that Rongorongo would have been created without the influence of other languages , a feature that provides scientists a unique opportunity to examine how writing first came into existence .
Like Egyptian hieroglyphics , Rongorongo is pictographic in nature , consisting of a series of glyphs and symbols .
The glyphs themselves are thought to be a key to when the script was first invented , as they include certain plants and animals that would have only been prevalent on Easter Island in the era before its discovery by Europeans in the 1700s .
Possible Explanations
Despite a great deal of study , scientists have been unable to translate any of the Rongorongo writing system .
In fact , so little is known about it that some have argued that it is n’t writing at all , but rather an ornamental kind of artwork .
The discovery of a tablet that depicts a lunar calendar seems to prove this theory wrong , but until the Rongorongo glyphs are fully translated , very little will be known about them for sure .
5 . The Beale Ciphers
The story behind the Beale Ciphers , which have foiled would - be code breakers for over 100 years , is the kind of old - fashioned buried treasure yarn that Hollywood screenwriters would be proud to come up with .
The story begins in Virginia in 1820 , when a man named Thomas Beale supposedly entrusted a box containing three pages of coded text to an innkeeper , with instructions that the box should only be opened if Beale did not return to claim it within ten years .
Beale subsequently disappeared without a trace , and the innkeeper , named Robert Morriss , later spent several years trying to decode the pages .
One of them was finally cracked by one of Morriss ’ friends , who used the Declaration of Independence as a key .
It was then that it was discovered that the pages were a map to the location of a cache of buried treasure .
According to the document , Beale and some accomplices had discovered thousands of pounds of gold and silver in New Mexico and later buried it in Bedford County , VA .
Unfortunately , Morriss and his friend were unable to decode the other two pages , which give the treasure ’s exact location and the names of its owners , and Beale ’s bizarre method of encryption has managed to confound anyone who ’s tried to decipher it since .
Possible Explanations
The Beale Ciphers have since become their own mini-phenomenon ( hundreds of would - be treasure hunters have been arrested for trespassing in Bedford County ) , but Beale ’s gold and jewels have never been found .
Many have since claimed that ciphers are nothing but an elaborate hoax , and many of the story ’s details — like certain words in the documents that were not in popular usage until years later — seem to back this up .
Still , this has n’t stopped people from trying to unlock Beale ’s secrets , especially since the treasure would now be valued at roughly $ 40 million .
4. Kryptos
Artist Jim Sanborn ’s sculpture Kryptos might not be a document , but it ’s included here because the text inscribed on it has created a mystery that even the best code - breakers in the CIA have not been able to unravel .
The sculpture was commissioned by the CIA as a monument to the intelligence gathering work that made the agency famous , and it was installed at their headquarters in Langley , VA in 1990 .
Rather than just make a beautiful work of art , Sanborn took things a step further .
He collaborated with Ed Scheidt , a top CIA cryptographer , and inscribed a coded series of letters and question marks on the sculpture , which resembles a scroll .
The codes are made up of 869 characters , and can be broken into four separate parts , each one of which is supposedly a partial key to the answer of the others .
Together they serve as the building blocks of what Sanborn calls “ a riddle within a riddle ” that can only be solved by using sophisticated decoding techniques .

Possible Explanations
Sanborn and Scheidt ’s cipher has since become an obsession for amateur and professional cryptographers alike .
Members of the CIA and the NSA have all tried their hand at cracking it , and there is even an online group devoted to it that has thousands of members .
Twenty years later , these enthusiasts have succeeded in cracking three of the four parts of the cipher , but the fourth and most important continues to have them stumped .
Sanborn has hinted that the contents of the other three parts — which give the longitude and latitude of a point 200 feet southeast of the sculpture and include quotations relating to Howard Carter ’s discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen — offer the best clues .
As of yet , though , no one has succeeded in getting to the bottom of the mystery .
3. The Urantia Book
The Urantia Book is a pseudo - religious text that claims to “ expand cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception ” through its discussions of philosophy , cosmology , and the life of Jesus .
The book supposedly originated in Chicago , Illinois sometime in the early - to - mid twentieth century , and today it has become its own kind of phenomenon , having inspired a great deal of study and even a foundation that seeks to promote the book and its teachings .
The over 2,000 - page text has no known author , and the story of its origin is particularly bizarre : in 1925 , a doctor named William Sadler ( pictured above ) supposedly came in contact with a sickly man who would often drift in trances and speak aloud at length .
Sadler and a stenographer recorded these monologues , which the doctor claimed were later added to by some kind of celestial , supernatural process .
The Urantia Book supposedly shares many common characteristics with major religions , particularly Christianity , but it also spends a great deal of time discussing scientific theories .
Most notable are the book ’s descriptions of the geography of the universe , which it splits up into “ superuniverses ” and the “ local universe , ” which it says is composed of around 1,000 inhabited planets .
Possible Explanations
This all may sound like science fiction , and indeed the idea that the Urantia Book is a clever piece of literature is a popular explanation of the mystery behind it .
Skeptics , among them science writer Martin Gardner , argue that Sadler and a group of confidants most likely composed the book themselves sometime during the 1920s .
Recent research , including an essay that claims the Urantia Book plagiarized a number of academic texts on religion , seems to back up this assertion , but there has yet to be any definitive proof of who was really behind it all .
2. The Gnostic Gospels
Also known as the Nag Hammadi library , the Gnostic Gospels are a collection of leather - bound books that date back to the 4th century .
They make up the major texts of Gnosticism , an offshoot of Christianity that existed around the time of the 2nd century , whose adherents are said to have believed that true salvation came through deep self - knowledge and an understanding of a “ higher reality . ”
The Gnostic Gospels , which feature such volumes as “ The Gospel of Thomas , ” “ The Gospel of Mary , ” and even “ The Gospel of Judas , ” were discovered in 1945 by a pair of farmers in Nag Hammadi , Egypt .
They had been buried in a protective jar centuries earlier , most likely by a priest hoping to hide them from the orthodox Christian church , which regarded the Gnostics as heretics .
The books went through many different owners , at one point even being sold on the black market , and it was not until the 1970s that they were finally translated into English .
They ’ve since become a popular philosophical text , and have even figured prominently in a number of different movies and novels .
They ’re also quite controversial , not just for their overlap with the Bible , but for the ways in which they attribute sayings to Jesus that do n’t appear in the New Testament .
Possible Explanations
Unlike some of the other entries on this list , scholars generally understand the Gnostic Gospels , and the texts have been successfully translated into a number of languages .
Still , the books are notable because of the place they hold in helping to develop the study and history of Gnosticism as a belief system .
More importantly , the discovery of ancient texts that claim to offer previously undiscovered background stories about Jesus has sparked a fierce debate in religious and academic circles .
Some have claimed that the books are nothing more than heretical fabrications , while others have argued that the Gnostic Gospels should be considered on the same terms as the Bible .
1. The Voynich Manuscript
Of all the bizarre and mysterious texts that have been uncovered over the years , perhaps none is as famous as the Voynich Manuscript , a book written by an anonymous author in an unknown language that has baffled nearly every cryptographer that ’s ever tried to translate it .
From what researchers have been able to uncover , the 15th century manuscript was part of a Jesuit library in the 1800s , and from there it passed through several hands before falling into the possession of a Polish book dealer named Wilfrid Voynich in 1909 .
After Voynich ’s death , the manuscript became a subject of fascination for linguists and cryptographers , many of whom spent years studying the book ’s mysterious language and alphabet .
There are numerous theories about the text of the Voynich Manuscript , including that it is some kind of encoded puzzle ; that it ’s written in a heretofore undiscovered language ; that it is meant to be read under a microscope ; and even that it ’s some kind of divinely inspired religious document that was written in a trance .
But these are all just theories , and even after some fifty years of examination by the world ’s top code - breakers , nothing is known for sure .
Crude drawings of plants and jars in the book ’s margins have led many to claim that it must be a manual on medicine or alchemy , but this too is just conjecture .
Possible Explanations
Because it has proven so resistant to translation , the Voynich Manuscript has inevitably been written off by many as a hoax .
Critics of this theory argue that the book ’s syntax is too sophisticated to have been faked , but others have shown that the technology of the time — particularly an encoding device called a “ Cardan Grille ” — would have made it possible for someone to fabricate the Voynich as a hoax .
Still , none of these arguments have fully convinced Voynich scholars , who are either unwilling or unable to admit that the document might be a fake .
Carbon dating has recently proven that the manuscript does indeed date back to the 1400s , but beyond that its origin and purpose still remain an enigma .

Anyone remember what happened this easter weekend ?
I ’m a bit hazy about it myself – because I was in Germany living it up at the last ever Breakpoint .
A party / festival that ’s been running on the easter weekend for the past 8 years in Bingen am Rhein , it was a unique gathering of 1000 + creative and technical types who go there to show their work or see what the others have done , but stay for the massive , massive party .
I ca n’t overstate how much I ’ve enjoyed it over the past few years .
The atmosphere is unique – it ’s amazing to see the enthusiasm everyone there had just for being part of it .
So much has happened to me personally at that event on previous occasions : hotel food fights ; TV appearances I can’t remotely remember ; big - screen and stage appearances I ’ll always remember ; appalling hung over football performances ; all - nighters working in the freezing cold , where you had to get a coffee just to hold it ; close brushes with hospitalisation ; and I never even got thrown out once !
( I was “ helped out ” once though .
Cheers Docd !)
My record of actually getting something finished for it is patchy ; we have won there before , but most years we either end up working all weekend in the hotel to just make the deadline , or giving up immediately and going on a massive bender instead – because the party was too much fun to miss .
But seeing as it was the last one ever , we thought we owed it to get something done and support the event .
And to actually get it done beforehand .
And then go on that massive bender I was talking about .
A couple of months ago we started thinking about what we could do in the time available .
Frameranger was our last big piece – a blockbuster , the kind of piece you go into a competition with being pretty confident you ’re going to win – but that took far too much time , effort and pain to want to repeat in a hurry .
Besides , one problem with Breakpoint is Farbrausch – they co-organise Breakpoint , and it was very likely they were going to show up with another massive production like Debris , which effectively defined the scene in 2007 and who ’s influence still ripples across it .
Without 6 moths or a year to work on something we probably would n’t be able to compete with them if they decided to push something big out .
We also realised that we did n’t actually want to compete : it would be better to make something that we liked , that was enjoyable to produce , that had a bit more depth to it , showed more maturity , and that perhaps had some more relevance outside of the scene than the big multi-part spectacular we could make that might win .
So , there and then we gave up on winning .
That was actually quite liberating , and we got on with making it .
First we tried to source a soundtrack .
Our first idea was to try and chance it , and contact a major label we admired and asked them to use a certain track we liked .
Unfortunately they never even bothered to reply , so we started talking to some musician friends of ours to try and sort something out .
They showed us a big load of material that they had been working on and we picked something out , and did a great job fixing it up .
Result – we were hooked up with the ideal soundtrack from day one and could design the whole piece around it .
Note : since release , some copyright issues have come to light with the soundtrack due to the large volume of material sampled from one source : “ Queen of the Universe ” by Socrates .
This did n’t get credited in the original release of the production because of a misunderstanding between the musicians and the artists ; we ’re working to resolve it ASAP .
We decided early on that the approach we should take with the visuals was to try and do everything with particles using a developed version of the particle system from Blunderbuss .
It meant we had the ability to make something much more organic and flowing – every part of the screen could be moving all the time , and it would give it an abstract element that ’s hard to achieve with polygons alone .
However , this time we wanted to combine particles with actual graphics and make a full piece with multiple scenes from it .
Usually we develop the tech and the visuals in tandem – and sometimes the tools too – which often causes a lot of problems .
The good thing for this project was that for once we actually had most of the core tech done before we started on the visuals .
What we had from Blunderbuss gave us the basics – lots of particles , sorted and rendered with shadows , and a few effects like ( fake ) fluids on top .
But it was essentially quite simple – one ( point ) emitter at a time , affectors affect all the particles , and the affectors and emitters were quite basic in themselves .
It worked for that piece but it was n’t enough for something larger and more complicated .
What it lacked was control – we needed to combine multiple emitters , control particle counts per emitter , and add some more advanced features to cope with using meshes and scenes with animation , targeting into other meshes and scenes , more advanced affectors and much more control and quality in the rendering .
And to not completely destroy the frame rate on the way .
Particles and meshes
Emitting from meshes was something I ’ve already worked out – I have a routine that generates a big texture containing lots of positions spawned at random places on the polygonal surface of the model .
This was simply done using random barycentric coordinates on each triangular face of the mesh .
The number of random positions per triangle is weighted by the area of the triangle , so the points are evenly spread across the mesh and you get a pretty solid object .
On top of this I added support for sampling the model ’s material colours , vertex colours and textures and storing those resulting colour values in a texture too .
Adding support for skinned , animated meshes as emitters and targets was more difficult .
The first task was to be able to apply skin / bone transforms in pixel shaders to calculate the animated position of the particle representation at the current point in time .
That was quite straightforward : I added the skin weights and bone indices as additional textures , then the bone matrices themselves in a dynamic 1d texture which could be looked up by the bone indices .
The skinning code was basically a copy - paste from the vertex shader version I already have , reading bone matrices from texture lookups instead of from vertex shader constants .
Spawning a particle at this final resulting skinned position worked fine – the spawned particles appeared where the mesh was posed at the current frame .
However , it gave an ugly motionblur - esque trail to the movement because the particles did n’t move with the animation – they spawned where the animation posed them and then the affectors ( fluid , forces etc ) took over .
What I needed was to combine the spawning with an affector step which also moved the particles with the animated pose , by calculating the current position and moving them to it .
I had set it up so that each particle had a unique and corresponding entry in the mesh position texture so it was easy to follow which particle was tied to which point on the mesh , so it was also straightforward to add – but it did n’t do the job either , because I ’d swapped following the affectors for following the animation .
I needed a blend of those two functions which allowed a particle to follow the animation “ a certain amount ” , and follow the affectors too .
That ’s where it all starts to get fuzzy – there ’s no “ right result ” for that , so I just had to work on what looked good .
I computed the current and previous frame ’s skinned mesh position for the particle using the skinning routine .
Then I had a weighting function based on the particle ’s position compared to the mesh position , which also factored in a function based on the life of the particle .
I computed that weight for the particle ’s previous position and against the previous mesh position , and for the current positions , and picked the greater of the two weights ; then I used that weight to blend between the particle ’s current position and the current mesh position .
The result was that the particle was able to become more affected by the mesh as it got closer to it , until it eventually “ stuck ” to the mesh and followed it through the animation – until it got towards the end of its life , when it stops being affected as much and gradually falls away from the anim ( under control of other affectors ) .
Being able to emit from one mesh was n’t good enough – we wanted to throw a whole Lightwave scene at it with multiple objects and animation and even modifiers like Fertilizer ( making meshes appear to grow in over time ) and animated visibility , and it would figure it out .
This just meant that we had to combine all the meshes into one big soup when generating the particles – as long as we kept the object ID per particle in the texture , it was possible to match up the particle to information about the source mesh – transforms , visibility – stored in 1d texture lookup tables , and perform the necessary processing in the pixel shader .
Multiple emitters and materials
Part of the requirement for building a more complex scene was that we had more than one mesh / scene emitting particles at once .
The naive solution was to just add more particle systems , but – apart from the performance implications – this had a fundamental flaw : the particles were n’t in the same render targets anymore so they did n’t sort against each other .
In some places this was not a problem – it was an easy way to solve e.g. the background / sky particles – but it was n’t sufficient for a complex scene .
We needed to be able to emit from multiple emitters and share the same render targets .
So I assigned each emitter a scissor region dynamically which controlled which part of the spawn information targets they could write to , and in turn which particles were spawned from each emitter .
I also preserved the ID of the emitter which spawned a particle in the particle GBuffers .
Those particle GBuffers are starting to look more and more like a deferred renderer .
The emitter index can be used to access all sorts of things that can now be controlled per emitter rather than globally – e.g. material colour , diffuse , ambient , particle size and so on – just like we had in the deferred renderer using a material index or object index .
We can also use the emitter index to look up a table of transforms – so we can choose to move the particles with the emitter they came from .
Screen - space emitters
The particle system started to look increasingly like a deferred renderer , but what about that deferred renderer we had for rendering polygons ?
It ’s not producing anything that makes it to the final render in the demo , but it still has a role .
The GBuffers produced when rendering solid objects are now used to emit particles from .
The depth buffer can be used to reconstruct the world position of a pixel on screen ; the colour buffer provides the base material / texture colour ; and we can even run the usual lighting passes and post - fx and obtain a buffer of lit , shaded pixels as would be rendered to the final screen .
Most of the background scenes were rendered with lighting and SSAO before the particles took on the colour ; they were then lit additionally by the particle lighting and shadowing .
This gives you something that ’s 3d - in - 2d – 2.5d ?
– so it is n’t as solid as emitting in 3d from a mesh , but it has that advantage of looking much more solid ( from the initial perspective it was emitted from ) with far fewer particles than when emitting from a mesh .
A side issue was how to make affectors override other affectors , given that they only produce a velocity buffer .
That was quite simple – I sorted them using a controllable key and changed the blend mode .
Whereas most affectors ( velocity , fluid ) blend additively , certain affectors ( mesh / image attractors ) render towards the end of the list and blend linearly – so they override the motions of the additive affectors but blend by their affecting weight .
We also wanted to be able to tie emitters only to certain affectors , and this was handled again with a 1d lookup table on emitter index .
Another thing we wanted was to be able to keyframe the effect of an affector on a particle , and other properties of a particle , over the particle ’s life time .
Given everything was done on the GPU and needed to be efficient , arbitrary keyframe data was never going to be practical – so we used a simple approximation that still gave us control : we attached 1D bezier curves for many properties .
They can be evaluated very efficiently in a shader and they still give a decent amount of control .
We added a few new affectors to the engine ; not least was proper fluid dynamics support .
I ’ve had GPU versions of 2D and 3D Navier Stokes grid solvers for quite some time , and I tied in the 2D one to drive particles .
2D solvers are very effective in the right use - case , even in a 3D scene : we put them on a plane in 3D space , projected the particles onto that plane and sampled the velocity , and applied a falloff towards the edges of the plane and on the z distance from the plane .
This did the job neatly for destroying the moon – the one place we needed “ proper fluid dynamics ” to make it look good .
Making the demo
As usual , we were running late .
With 4 weeks to go we had a few sketches of ideas and the basis for some scenes , but nothing was too far along .
The problem was that we had the music and the technical plan already sorted , but we did n’t have a solid visual concept and story locked down – just a few bits of graphics and some test scenes .
The first scene that was laid down was the flowers , which was the first thing we really tried to do with it and existed in some form for several weeks .
That helped us nail down our look and flow , and got the tech more or less finalised too .
Much of the time was spent with Jani trying out ideas in the tool , and me fixing all the many things that did n’t work and responding to feature requests .
With 2 weeks to go we hit the point where we could n’t go any further without a fully fleshed out concept and we rapidly went through a few revisions – some were quite tight and story - driven and others much more vague .
Finally we hit upon something that would flow and we got busy making the extra content .
In the last week things finally started to move .
We went into full - on crunch , and worked late into the night every evening .
My day started at 6 am and ended around 1 - 2 am ; living on coffee , squeezing work on the piece into spare minutes at lunchtime or on the train , and then hammering on at it late into the night .
It turns out you can adjust quite quickly to less than 5 hours sleep a night as anyone with kids would probably know , but still – apologies to any of my friends or colleages who thought I looked like a big stupid zombie that week .
Of course I was totally 100 % mentally switched on at all times .
Honestly .
The final stages of production on any large project are always a bit painful .
The start of a project is a slow , steady high – you have so many possibilities and the deadline where you actually have to deliver something seems so far away , and it ’s all about ideas and the fun of trying to implement them .
But then there ’s a horrible point where you realise you actually have to get something made pretty soon , and you have nothing .
From then on it ’s a constant stream of ups and downs – something goes right or somebody does something great and you feel like it ’s all going to work out , and you ’re on a high ; then something does n’t go to plan and you feel like it ’s just never going to happen and you ’re right back down again .
This gets more and more extreme until the end , where you feel this huge wave of relief / joy / anger / exhaustedness ( depending on how it ended up ) .
The whole process is a bit like romancing a really high maintainance nymphomaniac .
Who ’s on uppers .
And never stops calling you up during the day .
And keeps making you buy her shoes .
Highly enjoyable in some ways but you sure suffer for it in others .
And somehow you always forget enough of the downsides to want to repeat the experience a few months later .
As the week progressed the demo moved forward a lot .
The scene with the running people , then the intro and the final part were built in quick succession .
The part with the creature in the forest was done last – that was the one part I actually built myself , although Jani did a lot of work on it afterwards to make it into something decent .
One advantage with building everything from particles is that it hides a multitude of sins – you do n’t need the same level of polish and work on the models and textures as if you were showing them as plain 3D because it becomes so vague when it gets turned to particles anyway .
By the end of the week we still seemed a long way from finishing , but somehow on thursday night – after a final almost - all - nighter – it all came together .
It was a very strange situation – we were done early .
Let me illustrate the significance of that : that the last production I submitted to Breakpoint was entered during the competition while the 8th entry was currently playing on the big screen .
So on past experience I had expected a certain amount of pressure this time .
I think I ’ve come to enjoy that a little bit over the years – even rely on it – so having almost nothing to do during the event was a little disconcerting .
This was the first time I can remember us having time to sit and polish something in years .
Naturally I spent most of the time living it up instead , but Jani used the extra time wisely and kept polishing it .
New versions appeared over the weekend , each one getting better and better , until Sunday when we packed the final version .
Naturally , in keeping with tradition , we did our best to ignore the deadline ; shortly after it had passed , and after a kind announcement by KB over the loudspeaker to remind us to enter , I wandered up to the organisers area with the finished piece .
For the whole time we worked on the project , I did n’t expect to win .
Although I was really happy how it turned out I thought it could go down like a lead balloon in the competition – it ’s slow , abstract and it does n’t have the crowd - pleasing bling you need to win big .
It was a risk for us to do something like this , and I had n’t thought of it as a competition piece at all .
Yet somehow , in a strong field and up against our old german friends from Farbrausch , it won out .
I still do n’t really understand it , and I received the prize in a bit of a state of shock .
I was half thinking “ there ’s been a mistake ; run for it before they change their minds ” .
In this scene of ours it ’s easy to get obsessed with winning .
But if there ’s something I ’ve learnt from this it ’s that it ’s so much better just to make something you want to make and are happy with ; competition , winning , that ’s something that happens sometimes and wo n’t happen other times , but either way it does n’t really matter .
It ’s the icing on the cake if it happens , but the cake still tastes pretty good un-iced .
I never liked marzipan anyway .
In the end the piece is a series of scenes that were connected by the common motifs that they followed through it , and a loose storyline driven in part by the music .
Yep , you got it – I do n’t want to explain the content of the piece too much .
It ’s much better if you draw your own conclusions .
Some underlying themes are explored , and you ’re welcome to look for them or just take it at face value .
People have said to me , “ what ’s next , are n’t you bored of particles ? ” – and I say “ no ” .
Particles / points are a primitive , just like polygons .
We have n’t got bored of polygons yet after what – 30 years +?
There ’s much more that can be done , and we ’ve only scratched the surface of what ’s possible .
New ideas and new hardware make more things happen all the time .
We ’ll be back .
I ’m not sure in what form , but watch this space .
There ’s been quite a lot of coverage of Breakpoint that we ’ve benefited from – including a feature on the German TV channel 3Sat .
By the way , you really do need a good GPU to watch this in realtime .
The “ detail settings ” we had for Blunderbuss to make it watchable on low - end hardware did n’t work here because the scenes were much more complex and we had to tune it for one detail setting – the highest .
So you ’ll need something top - of - the - line ( think Geforce 280 ) to be able to enjoy it .
Do n’t worry about running it at less than highest resolution though – you wo n’t gain much from 1080 p over 720 p , for example .
CPU and memory do n’t make much difference , though .

The NAB Show , the largest media conference in the world hosted by the National Association of Broadcasters and taking place in Las Vegas April 10th - 16th , is upon us .
Beginning last year NAB officially recognized the importance of the video game industry by devoting an entire day ’s worth of session with such luminaries as Alternative Reality Gaming guru Jane McGonigal .
This year promises to be even better with a variety of up - to - minute discussions from the biggest movers and shakers in the industry .
Here is the blurb for one of the sessions that caught our attention , titled “ She ’s Got Game : Exploring the Rising Importance and Influence of Women in Interactive Entertainment ”
“ Although women and girls represent 51 % of the global population and are the fastest growing segment of the video game market , they have been largely ignored as a primary audience to date .
Women now represent more than 45 % of the video game marketplace , and their influence is rapidly growing across all genres of games : console , casual and application - based .
A very significant opportunity exists to drive revenue and build franchise brand loyalty by developing and marketing video game content that focuses on interests of women / girls , and by reflecting them as the primary content characters . ”
Moderated by Belinda Van Sickle , president , GameDocs and chair of Women in Games International , the session features Jennifer MacLean , CEO of 38 Games ; Kellee Santiago , president , That Game Company and Megan Gaiser , president & CEO , HER Interactive .
Other sessions include :

IGR will be there and reporting from the show , so stay tuned for a week of exciting news and ideas !
His book Band of Brothers – which chronicled the exploits of one company of US airborne troops in second world war Europe – was turned into a highly praised TV series .
But now American historian Professor Stephen Ambrose , who was President Dwight D Eisenhower 's official biographer and wrote or edited more than a dozen books about him , is embroiled in a posthumous controversy .
It is alleged that he invented many meetings he claimed to have had with Eisenhower , and even fabricated entire interviews with him .
The revelations have sent shock waves through the scholarly community in the United States .
The books written by Ambrose , who died in 2002 , brought him popular acclaim , and director Steven Spielberg used him as a military adviser on his 1998 Oscar - winning film Saving Private Ryan .
Band of Brothers became a cultural milestone when it was turned into a TV series on which Ambrose was a producer .
It was hailed for educating an entire generation about the sacrifices of their forefathers .
But it appears that Ambrose indulged in some sort of fantasy about the extent of his relationship with Eisenhower .
In TV interviews , he claimed to have spent " hundreds and hundreds of hours " with the former president .
He even once said he would spend two days a week working with Eisenhower in his office .
However , recently studied records of Eisenhower 's meetings contradict the notion that the pair had any lengthy face - to - face contact .
" I think five hours [ in total ] is a generous estimation of the actual time they spent together .
I personally would push it back to less than two or three , " said Tim Rives , deputy director of the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene , Kansas .
The discovery came to light almost by accident .
The museum had been planning an exhibition exploring the relationship between Ambrose and Eisenhower .
Rives found that the records showed that Ambrose and Eisenhower had met only three times , and never alone .
He found that on seven occasions when Ambrose had claimed in the footnotes to his book Supreme Commander to have met Eisenhower , his subject was either elsewhere in the country or holding meetings with other people at the time .
In one example , Ambrose claimed to have had an interview with Eisenhower in Pennsylvania , when Eisenhower was in Kansas .
" The whole story kind of unravelled from there .
It was quite a surprise .
We were not looking for it , so it sort of happened almost by accident , " Rives said .
Given that the lives of former presidents are meticulously detailed by their staff , there is almost no chance Ambrose could have held interviews with Eisenhower that went unrecorded .
Later claims by Ambrose in other books to have interviewed Eisenhower lack specific dates or places , but were just footnoted as " Interview with DDE " .
However , the range of subjects Ambrose claimed to have discussed with Eisenhower increased to take in topics such as giving up smoking or the Vietnam war .
Rives believes there is no way that Ambrose could have discussed such a vast array of subjects in the tiny amount of time he actually spent with his subject .
" I find that very doubtful .
That should be something that would be a concern for scholars .
It could cast doubt . "
Ambrose claimed that Eisenhower asked him to be his biographer by ringing him out of the blue in 1964 .
But Rives found letters from Ambrose to Eisenhower introducing himself and then asking him to agree to Ambrose writing his biography .
This is not the first scandal over Ambrose 's work .
In 2002 he was accused of plagiarism in his book The Wild Blue .
His publisher issued an apology but Ambrose said he had merely failed to put some short passages taken from elsewhere in quotation marks .

The March unemployment report was a bit of a disappointment , and shows the job market skipping like a stone across the bottom .
Since October we have been popping just above or just below new job creation .
The report claims 162 k new jobs , seasonally adjusted .
Without the seasonal adjustment , only 136 k new jobs were created .
Without 81 k statistically - generated jobs from the birth / death model , only 55 k jobs were actually counted .
Without the 48 k census jobs , only 7 k jobs were created .
Or so it could be argued .
More hopeful is the alternative method of counting , the BLS Household Survey , which says over a million jobs were added by small business in Q1 .
That survey is often volatile , and is considered less reliable , but it seems to be pointing to an underlying strength belied by all the negativity surrounding the main survey .
As I have said , every W starts as a V , and we may have upside surprise in employment over the next quarter .
GS thought BLS would report 275k jobs ( revised down to 200 k the night before ) , and TrimTabs , which seems to be able to track better than the BLS , expected 280k .
The " consensus " had been 184k .
Much of the shortfall was due to fewer census workers ( 48 k ) than expected ( 100k ) .
It may be the census hires have been grossly undercounted ( irony abounds ) .
Most likely the 162 k gets adjusted upwards later .
Again , I expect a positive surprise in the next few months .
The rate stayed at 9.7 % , although it would have been 9.8 % without the census workers , and a good argument can be made that they should have been skipped from the seasonally - adjusted number since they go away in a few months .
( The BLS subtracts them from the non-seasonally adjusted number before applying the seasonal adjustment , then adds them back . )
Inside the 9.7 % number , rounding masks an increase of 0.5 % ( 9.69 % to 9.75 % ) .
We need around 200 k new jobs to employ all the net new workers coming in ( eg college grads ) .
Lower than that and the rate still falls , or should fall , except that the BLS has been dropping the total workforce fairly steeply through this period .
I discussed this in some detail in Feb .
The way to avoid the noise is to look at the totals not the rates .
We have lost 2.3 M jobs in the past 12 months , and 8.2 M since the start of the Great Recession .
It had been 8.4 M .
We are skimming the bottom ( see chart from Calculated Risk ) , and the critical question is whether we bend up rapidly as in prior recessions or stay down in the U shaped bottom for an extended period .
Ominously , the most recent recession in 2001 and the prior one in 1991 both are the U shaped curves in this compendium chart , and suggest a similar valley of death awaits us this time :
Tragically , the stats underneath the numbers are not promising .
An astounding 44 % of unemployed are long - term , and the number of these chronic unemployed ( meaning unemployed for more than 26 weeks , or half a year ) is at record levels ( 6.5 M ) .
The number of part - time workers ( 9.1M ) is also at record levels , and after a few good months has has gone back up from 8.3 M in Jan and 8.8 M in Feb to the horrendous level of last Oct ( 9.2M ) .
Weather effects in Feb may account for about 100k of the total .
Weather adjustment plus census workers add to 148k , very close to the total .
Temp help rose 40 k , healthcare 27 k , state & local govt held constant ; with the census ( 48 k ) , a major part of the increase was of the wrong sort of workers ( 115k ) instead of productive private sector positions ( 41 k ) , such as manufacturing ( 17 k ) .
If you expect the private sector temp positions to roll into permanent , the report suggests 123 k growth in private sector jobs , albeit 81 k of them are statistical , meaning created by the BLS 's questionable birth / death model for small businesses .
Analyst reactions were mixed .
Looking forward , the blogosphere reports that job postings are increasing , but a new survey by the BLS says the opposite : the number of unemployed per opening has trended up to 5.5 , and the total number of job openings has dropped a bit .
This chart is a bit complex , but compares the unemployment rate to the job opening rate .
As you can see , it ticked down a bit in Feb , but this might be due to weather effects .
Hence the blogosphere may be a better leading indicator than the backwards - looking BLS survey .
As we bounce off the bottom , we might see several months of a real uptick , partly driven by census workers and also driven by good private sector hiring .
Then the Summer of Disappointment could hit : census jobs go away , and a huge wave of state & local layoffs are expected to commence this summer .
Whether the net increase of real private sector jobs will exceed the drag of govt jobs is unclear .
The Onion had the last word : it reported that the Dept of Labor had created one special new job for $ 40B of stimulus .
The position would be based in the US Virgin Islands and be paid $ 500 k salary plus multi-million bonuses to study multiple orgasms in a hot - tub environment .

Voluntown - Even though Tyler Griffin was five years older than his neighbor Michael Delamater , he always had time for his younger friend , showing him a thing or two with the soccer ball .
" I 'm so sad to see him go , " Delamater said Sunday .
" He always talked about being a Marine . "
The 19 - year - old Griffin , who joined the Marines in 2008 , was killed last week in Afghanistan .
He was 19 years old .
On Sunday morning , a military transport plane returned his body to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware where his mother and stepfather had traveled .
As of Sunday , the Department of Defense has not released any details about the death of Griffin , who was a lance corporal .
Reached Sunday afternoon , Maj . Charles Jaworski , a spokesperson for the Connecticut National Guard , did not have further details about Griffin 's death or any memorial activities .
According to Voluntown First Selectman Ronald J. Millovitsch , Griffin 's mother , Susan Wilding , and stepfather , John Wilding , drove to Delaware Saturday to attend to the body .
Funeral arrangements have not been announced .
In the meantime , Millovitsch said this small town of 2,600 people " will do everything it can for the family . "
" We only have four flags in front of our public buildings , " Millovitsch said .
" And all of them are at half - staff . "
Mourners have been leaving flowers and notes of condolence by the Wildings ' mailbox and two memorial pages on Facebook have been set up totaling more than 700 fans .
Griffin graduated from Griswold High School in 2008 and was a member of the school 's football team .
Gov. M. Jodi Rell Saturday ordered flags at government buildings in the state to be at half staff .
The Delameters , who live across Congdon Road from Griffin 's family , also lowered the American flag in their front yard as a commemoration .
' Tyler was such an inspiration , " said John Delamater Jr. , Michael 's father . "
It 's really sad .
He was a good kid , from a really good family . "
Delamater Jr. said they always knew when Griffin was home on leave because the house would be flying a Marine Corps flag .
" They were very , very proud of him , " Delamater Jr. said .
Bill Martin , who lives next door to the Wildings , said Griffin 's father died about five years ago .
His mother has since remarried .
He said Griffin had a reputation for being a " good kid " in the neighborhood .
Martin recalled Griffin would go running around the neighborhood to prepare for basic training .
" We 'd see him out there on Route 49 , " Martin said .
" He 'd always wave . "
SANTIAGO , Chile —
With a torrent of criticism over her government ’s response to the earthquake and little more than a week to dispel it before leaving office , President Michelle Bachelet on Wednesday intensified her efforts to provide help to the hundreds of thousands of people affected by the disaster and publicly began the fight to preserve her legacy .
In the morning , Ms. Bachelet seemed a portrait of strength , reassuring the leaders of Chile ’s most powerful business association that the country had the reserves to rebuild its shattered infrastructure , and later cheering on volunteers who had begun building temporary houses for those displaced .
Then , during an extensive interview on Chile ’s most popular radio station , the typically poised president vigorously defended the way her government had managed the crisis and gave way to emotion , saying , “ Everyone claims to be a general after the war . ”
“ Enough with assigning blame , ” she said .
Observers said the impassioned hourlong exchange was one more sign that just days after one of the most powerful earthquakes in recorded history , Chile ’s political landscape had shifted as well , exposing fault lines that threaten to plunge a country that has enjoyed decades of stability into the kinds of polarizing struggles still experienced by some of its neighbors .
At age 22 , Eliezer Sternberg has just published his second book on neuroscience and philosophy : “ My Brain Made Me Do It , ” now out from Prometheus Books .
In it , he argues that our growing understanding of how the brain works does not mean the end of moral responsibility .
Rather , he sees free will as a special property that emerges from more basic brain functions .
A student at Tufts Medical School , he took time out from his first - year exams to talk with Mind Matters co-editor Carey Goldberg .
Q : Moral responsibility has been in the news most recently as people discussed the Tiger Woods scandal .
How do you see his case ?
A : Tiger Woods does take full responsibility and he should take full responsibility .
Some have considered the possibility that his serial adultery was caused by the fact that he had no control over his libido — that he did not act of his own free will .
But unless neurologists confirm substantial damage to his frontal lobe , his ability to freely make decisions was intact and he could have taken measures to control his tendencies .
He has free will , and is morally responsible .
Q : In your book you say that recent developments in neuroscience seem to cast increasing doubt on our concept of free will .
What findings seem to most threaten it ?
A : The work of [ the late University of California , San Francisco physiologist ]
Benjamin Libet -- which is itself not very recent but is still being pursued by other researchers .
He found in lab experiments that the brain begins initiating an action before the person has actually decided to take that action .
That very stark example really makes you think .
Q : What do you consider the most powerful counter - argument to Libet ’s findings ?
A : That argument is based on the idea of a “ readiness potential ” that appears 350 milliseconds before the conscious decision of an action is declared .
But my argument would be that there ’s really no way of knowing that this potential -- which is just a brainwave , actually -- is the brain beginning to take the action .
It ’s an assumption made , but for all we know , it could be associated with thousands of different processes .
Q : So how would you sum up your own conclusions about how we can reconcile the accumulating findings in neuroscience with the concept of free will ?
A : I believe that , over time , traditional neuronal and biochemical accounts of the mind will run their course — they will try to explain as much as they can , but will fall short of accounting for human consciousness .
There will still be more to explain .
At this point , researchers will have to search for new kinds of explanations that are unprecedented in other scientific fields .
Q : So you ’re saying free will is qualitatively different from the rest of the workings of the brain , which are more mechanistic ?
A : Yes .
But I think it ’s still based in the brain ’s mechanical architecture .
It ’s not a separate entity but it ’s an emergent property of the mechanism of the brain .
Q : You are 22 .
What do you reasonably expect to see in your lifetime in terms of unraveling this question of what the brain has to say about free will vs. determinism ?
A : I think that the trend will move further and further into thinking that free will does not exist .
Two factors will push that belief .
First :
There will be more complete accounts of how decisions or behaviors arise from cellular connections in the brain .
And second , the incredible expansion of brain - related technologies , including intelligence drugs , and cortical implants , which would have electrodes plugged into various areas of the brain to stimulate or suppress feeling and ideas .
I think this merging of mind and mechanism is going to get people thinking more and more along these lines .
We ’ll see machines and human behavior and see them interacting , so we ’ll assume it ’s the same kind of system , just one ’s made out of flesh and the other ’s made out of silicon .
I wrote the book to say that all that does n’t matter , because there ’s a fundamental gap that none of that will breach .
Q : What future do you foresee for legal defenses based on “ My Brain Made Me Do It ? ”
A : I think that neuroscience is expanding incredibly quickly and when the field really does reach its apex , I do think that major legal questions will become relevant as more and more scientists become convinced that the brain is controlling more than we assumed in the past .
Q : How might a deterministic neuroscience affect the way we view criminals ?
A : If I ’m wrong , and all our behaviors are completely controlled by neuronal processes beyond our control , that would mean that our concept of morality does n’t make any sense and there seems to be no way to hold people responsible for anything .
Q : In fact , in our society , we do have highly deterministic neuroscience , which enjoys quite a bit of respect , and yet our courts do keep the concept of personal responsibility pretty intact .
Something does n’t quite jibe .
A : You are right when you say we already have pretty deterministic neuroscience but that is known by few people .
Once science and technology make the perceived determinism of neuroscience more concrete , that is when people are going to start questioning whether our legal system and our concepts of crime and punishment are justified .
Obviously , I think it is justified but there will be people who do n’t think that .
Q : It does seem like a collision is coming , but for now they ’re separate .
A : I ’m not the kind of person who can compartmentalize ideas that way .
I need to believe something consistent and go with it .
So it was pretty hard for me when I was working in various neuroscience labs and would ask questions about free will and personal identity .
Anyone I asked would simply brush it off , and say ‘ Oh , we do n’t deal with that kind of stuff here , this is a laboratory .
We deal with serious things . ’
It made for fewer people to talk with .
Before the rapper tucks into his backstage grub , it must be “ inspected for hair . ”

This could be a game changer .
From the University of California , Irvine press release , a finding that suggests soil microbes have a negative feedback with temperature increase .
This has broad implications for the amount of CO2 emitted estimated in climate models .
It had been assumed that as temperature increased , microbes and fungii would increase their CO2 output .
Globally , this microbiotic contribution is large .
The amount of CO2 released from soils worldwide each year is estimated to be about 8 - 10 times greater than the amount released by humans .
This study shows that soil microbes wo n’t go into a an “ overdrive ” mode when soil temperature increases .
Soil microbes produce less atmospheric CO2 than expected with climate warming
Key players in the carbon cycle , they multiply slowly when overheated
— Irvine , Calif. , April 26 , 2010 —
The physiology of microbes living underground could determine the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from soil on a warmer Earth , according to a study published online this week in Nature Geoscience .
Researchers at UC Irvine , Colorado State University and the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies found that as global temperatures increase , microbes in soil become less efficient over time at converting carbon in soil into carbon dioxide , a key contributor to climate warming .
Microbes , in the form of bacteria and fungi , use carbon for energy to breathe , or respire , and to grow in size and in number .
A model developed by the researchers shows microbes exhaling carbon dioxide furiously for a short period of time in a warmer environment , leaving less carbon to grow on .
As warmer temperatures are maintained , the less efficient use of carbon by the microbes causes them to decrease in number , eventually resulting in less carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere .
“ Microbes are n’t the destructive agents of global warming that scientists had previously believed , ” said Steven Allison , assistant professor of ecology & evolutionary biology at UCI and lead author on the study .
“ Microbes function like humans :
They take in carbon - based fuel and breathe out carbon dioxide .
They are the engines that drive carbon cycling in soil .
In a balanced environment , plants store carbon in the soil and microbes use that carbon to grow .
The microbes then produce enzymes that convert soil carbon into atmospheric carbon dioxide . ”
The study , “ Soil - Carbon Response to Warming Dependent on Microbial Physiology , ” contradicts the results of older models that assume microbes will continue to spew ever - increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as the climate continues to warm .
The new simulations suggest that if microbial efficiency declines in a warmer world , carbon dioxide emissions will fall back to pre-warming levels , a pattern seen in field experiments .
But if microbes manage to adapt to the warmth – for instance , through increased enzyme activity – emissions could intensify .
“ When we developed a model based on the actual biology of soil microbes , we found that soil carbon may not be lost to the atmosphere as the climate warms , ” said Matthew Wallenstein of the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University .
“ Conventional ecosystem models that did n’t include enzymes did not make the same predictions . ”
Mark Bradford , assistant professor of terrestrial ecosystem ecology at Yale , said there is intense debate in the scientific community over whether the loss of soil carbon will contribute to global warming .
“ The challenge we have in predicting this is that the microbial processes causing this loss are poorly understood , ” he said .
“ More research in this area will help reduce uncertainties in climate prediction . ”

Nine members of a Christian militia group known as Hutaree ( website Google cache ) were today indicted on multiple charges involving an alleged plot to attack police , including seditious conspiracy and attempted use of weapons of mass destruction , announced the U.S. Attorney in Michigan .
Reports : New York Times , Talking Points Memo .
No coincidence they 're in Michigan , it would seem : the group reportedly planned attacks on Muslims in Detroit and elsewhere .
The state is home to some of America 's largest and most densely populated Muslim communities .
" I wonder if these fundamentalist extremist terrorists will be waterboarded and held without trial indefinitely , " quipped a friend of a friend .
Above , while it lasts , what is purported to be a Hutaree - produced video grabbed from hutaree.com .
The video features guys in camo traipsing through the forest , over a Sisters of Mercy track ( Christian militias are into goth ?
Okay . )
The website makes much reference to a " Christian Republic , " " end time battles , " and the voices of " Christian martyrs , " " Jesus warriors , " and talk of " Jesus and the ten virgins . "
If you translated this website into Arabic , you 'd have the sort of stuff that 's presented to America as the reason we 're in Afghanistan and Iraq .
While the homepage is inaccessible , some portions of the site are accessible at the publish time of this blog post , including details about a training camp planned for April 24 , and their rank taxonomy .
The top guys in the organization are known as RADOK [ RD ] , BORAMANDER [ BM ] , ZULIF [ ZL ] , and ARKON [ AK ] , and the lowest guys are " gunners . "
The Hutaree doctine is spelled out here .
From the " About us " page :
Christ is our king of kings and top general of all things , for we are not of this world but we live in it .
The Hutaree will one day see its enemy and meet him on the battlefield if so God wills it .
We will reach out to those who are yet blind in the last days of the kingdoms of men and bring them to life in Christ .
(…)
Oh and do n't forget that you can write us through the contact us link on the Hutaree homepage .
Once again thanks for visiting Hutaree.com and may Christ bless you widely .
Kämpfe bei Kunduz Drei Bundeswehrsoldaten sterben bei Gefecht in Afghanistan
Es sind die schwersten Gefechte seit Beginn des Bundeswehreinsatzes in Afghanistan : Nahe Kunduz haben Taliban eine deutsche Patrouille angegriffen .
Drei Soldaten wurden getötet .
Es ist einer der schlimmsten Vorfälle seit Beginn der Mission am Hindukusch .
Dr. Anil K. Gandhi , who performs both awake procedures at his office in Cerritos , Calif. , said he had taught “ more than 100 doctors ” in two - day $ 7,000 seminars for the National Society of Cosmetic Physicians .
His students are doctors who typically did their residencies in ob / gyn or family medicine and who take a weekend course ( or two ) to learn how to do aesthetic surgeries with local anesthesia and sedation .
This shortcut to practicing aesthetic surgery tends to outrage the traditionalists .
After all , board - certified plastic surgeons spend five to eight years after medical school learning operations and then have their surgical skills vetted in exams .
“ Two - day courses , it ’s just crazy , ” said Dr. William P. Adams Jr. , a plastic surgeon in Dallas who teaches residents at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center .
“ It took us six years to fully train plastic surgeons to do breast augmentation . ”
He said it was irresponsible to let fuzzy - headed patients choose their implants .
“ They do n’t let people drive after a six - pack of beers , ” said Dr. Adams , who is an investigator for Mentor and Allergan , makers of breast implants ( and a consultant for Allergan ) .
“ How well will people choose an implant size after narcotics ? ”
Dr. Adams and other plastic surgeons say that mid-surgery consultations can be harmful if the patient chooses implants too large for her chest .
Overaugmentation can produce unsightly rippling , said Dr. Mark L. Jewell , a plastic surgeon who does breast augmentations with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation in an accredited facility in Eugene , Ore .
“ Decisions should be made ahead of time , ” said Dr. Jewell , an investigator for Mentor and Allergan as well as a consultant for Allergan .
Several doctors said that promoting local anesthesia and sedation for aesthetic surgeries was just a gimmick that played down the risks .
“ Promotion of these surgeries as so easy that only local anesthesia is required , it ’s intended to make someone think , ‘ It ’s not serious , ’ “ said Dr. Douglas R. Blake , an anesthesiologist in Providence , R.I. , who specializes in office - based procedures .
“ The promise to get by with just local anesthesia may in fact be shortchanging the patient . ”
Say a patient feels faint , or has a panic attack mid-surgery , “ who ’s there to attend to the patient ? ” he asked .
Practitioners of awake breast augmentation offer patients sedation and then pump in a numbing fluid .
This liquid — which has been used for years in a kind of liposuction called “ tumescent ” — includes lidocaine , an anesthetic , and epinephrine , which controls bleeding .
GOOGLE has been fined $ US8500 ( $ 9169 ) in Brazil after an anonymous internet user posted defamatory messages on one of its sites against a priest , calling him a " paedophile " .
A court in the state of Minas Gerais ruled in favour of the 54 - year - old priest , identified by his initials J.R. , after rejecting Google 's argument that it was not responsible for what users posted on its Orkut social networking site .
The verdict upheld a lower court 's judgment made after the priest sued for defamation in 2008 over the post , which called him " the paedophile ... the thief who has a lover " , according to the O Globo daily .
" By making space available on virtual networking sites , in which users can post any type of message without any checks beforehand , with offensive and injurious content , and , in many cases , of unknown origin , ( Google ) assumes the risk of causing damage " to other people , judge Alvimar de Avila said .
Google 's Orkut is a hugely popular networking site in Brazil , although a Portuguese - language version of Facebook is now making serious inroads into its dominance .

A few weeks ago I already twittered a screenshot that showed what disassembled code looks like in IDA Pro after automatically importing function information from MSDN .
Today , I have finally managed to upload our IDA Pro script , ida-msdn , to the zynamics GitHub account .
If you are analyzing Windows executable files in IDA Pro you can now benefit from automated API calls documentation .
There is a slight problem , however .
Since we can not distribute the MSDN documentation ourselves for legal reasons , you need to have your own local installation of the MSDN .
Furthermore , the import process is divided into two parts .
At first you have to parse your local MSDN documentation into an XML file .
This can be done with msdn- crawler , another open source zynamics project .
msdn-crawler parses your locally installed Windows API documentation files from the MSDN and generates an XML file that contains information about Windows API functions ( description , argument names and descriptions , and return values ) .
In this first version , msdn- crawler finds 33984 Windows API functions in the MSDN and generates an XML file that contains more than 30 MB of function information .
To see a brief example of what the XML file looks like , please check the readme .
txt file on GitHub .
Once you have generated the msdn.xml file with msdn- parser you can use ida-msdn to import Windows API documentation into arbitrary IDB files .
ida -msdn does two things :
First , ida -msdn tries to match imported functions found in the IDB file to function information from the XML file .
When information about an imported function is found , the information is imported from the XML file into the IDB file .
Second , ida - msdn tries to find out if you are actually working on a DLL file ( like shell 32.dll or user32.dll ) that exports Windows API functions .
In that case , the exported functions recognized by ida-msdn are annotated with information from the XML file too .
Happy MSDN importing . 🙂

A few days ago freelance writer Laura Spencer ( @TXWriter ) tweeted a link to a Mashable post .
The hyped up headline read “ Facebook Now Controls 41 % of Social Media Traffic . ”
Before I even read the post my gut screamed “ Bullshit ! ”
It often does that .
My gut is rather talented at sniffing out shady statistics .
It must be that past life in PR where we all learn that statistics can say just about anything we want them to if we twist them enough ( my disgust of that attitude makes me hypersensitive to them now ) .
Then I did read the article .
What I found was baffling ( okay , it was n’t really — it was about what I expected ) :
Charts with no reference points related to the supposed trends shown
Assumptions about people jumping from one site to another without any real evidence to back that up ( and data charts right in the post that contradicted the claim )
Other statistical claims that did n’t jive with the “ relative ” charts shown in the post
Big social media sites being completely left out of the comparison
Whole niches of social media completely left out of the comparison
Sites that probably should n’t have been included but were
A huge social media site included in the first set of stats suddenly disappeared from later ones
Yikes .
I bet you ’re wondering why I have n’t linked you to the post yet .
That ’s because it seems to have gone “ Poof ! ” Vanished into thin air it did .
Because of that I wo n’t pull the actual charts to show you the problems ( does n’t seem right to publish their charts when they ’ve pulled them — especially when it was n’t even clear in the post if they belonged to Mashable or were Comscore charts taken somewhat out of context ) .
However , I do want to highlight something from the cached version which illustrates my biggest problem of all :
Do you see those nice little Twitter and Facebook counts to the left of the post title ?
That ’s how many times this story was shared just on those two platforms before it was moved or removed .
That ’s terrifying .
Why ?
Because it shows just how easily and quickly bad information can spread on the Web .
Let ’s look at some of the specific problems .
1. Major segments of social media ( and sites ) are ignored . —
The first chart shown in the post supposedly illustrates traffic changes for eight social media properties from February 2009 — February 2010 .
Those sites are Facebook , Myspace , Gmail , Twitter , LinkedIn , Ning , YouTube , and Hulu .
While I do n’t claim the 41 % statistic came from this data set ( if you can call it that ) , it ’s a good indication of how narrow these stats clearly are .
( The chart showing how big Facebook ’s piece of the pie supposedly is actually highlights only six social media sites — take YouTube and Hulu out of the previous group . )
I guess they forgot two of the grandfather platforms of social media — forums and blogs .
How can you claim anything controls 41 % of the entire industry ’s traffic ( as their post title did ) when you ignore huge segments of it ?
You can ’t .
The claim made was clearly too broad , and there ’s no excuse for that ( especially when readers trust the information you put in front of them ) .
I also found myself wondering where other reasonably large players were .
Anyone remember Flickr , Delicious , Digg , StumbleUpon , Flixter , Classmates.com , or Reddit for example ?
If you want to really know how much of the social media space Facebook controls , do n’t forget you have to include all of the socially - driven P2P ( peer - to - peer ) networks too — Limewire , BitTorrent , and related sites .
Why do we so often forget about old school social media when it does n’t suit our statistical purposes ?
What ’s just as questionable as not including some resources is including sites like Hulu in social media stats when it ’s little more than a glorified vlog ( and that ’s coming from someone who loves Hulu just for the record ) .
It ’s not so much about social content as it is content consumption .
Yes , you can comment and share .
But unless I missed something , you ca n’t really contribute to the primary content base .
I ’m not saying Hulu does n’t fall within the realms of social media — only that it ’s completely senseless to include it in any “ relative ” statistic on what ’s happening in social media as a whole while ignoring blogs and other significant sources operating in similar ways .
2 . What happened to YouTube ? —
If you could still view the first chart they showed , you would see a dateline from Feb. ’09 through Feb . ’ 10 .
What you would not see are any metrics showing what stats were actually being measured during that time — just a blank y - axis .
When the author was questioned about the missing reference points in the comments , the reply was “ Units of measurement are relative , since they come from a panel audience of a few hundred thousand .
But the data definitely reflect average consumer behavior !
comScore would n’t lead us astray . ”
Um , yeah .
This is how faulty information spreads .
Even worse , this is how poor interpretations of faulty information spreads .
Why do I call it faulty ?
Because if you look at that chart ( which clearly shows YouTube with higher starting and ending traffic levels than Facebook ) and look at it in relation to the statistics shared in the post , they just do n’t add up .
What does basic logic tell us ?
If you ’re showing YouTube as having more traffic , then the percentage of total social media traffic must be higher than Facebook’s .
That would put it at more than 41 % .
However , the author goes on to state that “ As of March 2010 , Facebook traffic made up 41 % of all traffic on a list of popular social destinations .
MySpace was in second place , capturing around 24 % of traffic .
Gmail had 15 % , and Twitter had 8 % . ”
We ’ve already talked about how the “ list of popular social destinations ” was faulty and did n’t justify Mashable ’s claim to begin with .
But here we have 88 % of social media traffic ( for those listed sites ) accounted for .
If YouTube was already shown to have more in another chart from the same source that would mean at least 42 % of traffic went to them — putting us over 100 % .
That would tell us that YouTube was n’t included in the list that led to the 41 % statistic ( or the metric - free graph from earlier in the post was complete hogwash ) .
Neither should be acceptable to anyone reading the site or getting these statistics from anywhere .
It gets better though .
I ca n’t find anything that shows YouTube having more visitors than Facebook .
So okay .
We ’re back to the problem of missing reference points in their first chart .
Maybe they would n’t be at least at 42 % as the first chart in this post would suggest .
However , on checking some other statistical sources just for more background ( Compete and Alexa — note that I do n’t put much faith in either of their stats individually either ) , it appears that YouTube does get more traffic than Myspace , even if not Facebook .
So based on the 41 % statistic for Facebook and the 24 % statistic for Myspace , it still would n’t add up unless YouTube was given the boot from the calculations .
Why ?
3. Jumping to conclusions —
One of my favorite assumptions is that because Myspace ’s traffic share was shown to decrease and Facebook ’s was shown to increase , that meant users were jumping from one social network to another .
Of course there was no actual evidence to back up the claim .
Nothing in the post suggests that it ’s more than supposition .
In fact , two graphs in the post show that Myspace ’s traffic remained relatively stable .
In other words , on one hand they were showing that we had one maturing source leveling out in traffic over that year and one rapidly growing .
On the other hand , that was somehow twisted into a mass migration .
Of course traffic share for other sites will decrease when another comes in and shows massive gains .
Less of the pie is available to them .
What would be far more interesting is to look at truly active users — with that “ active ” status being set uniformly by some kind of social media standard ( if everyone could actually agree on one ) .
Facebook is n’t exactly known for making it easy for people to delete their accounts .
MySpace has been much easier to leave ( as are other social media sites ) .
That ’s one reason I ’ve always been skeptical of Facebook ’s traffic numbers ( at least their own claims ) .
To some degree they ’re like a black hole , sucking in social media users and not letting them back out .
Okay .
They apparently can delete accounts .
But unless things have very recently changed , they do n’t make the process easy enough to pretend we ’re comparing apples to apples in most cases .
Then again , relying on “ member ” numbers is an inherent fault of measuring social media for this very reason .
How many members are active ?
How many are legitimate members vs automated bot - driven “ members ” and other spammers ?
What kind of activity are we talking about anyway ?
Are traffic numbers high because people are really interested in more information , or are the numbers high because the social media site requires multiple page views to do simple things to inflate their overall traffic numbers ?
Every site is different in what they consider an active member , how good they are at weeding out the automated spammers , and how they direct traffic on the backend of their sites .
Rarely are they directly comparable , and that does n’t bode well for these types of comparisons beyond very general trends .
There is No Excuse for Spreading Ignorance
This is just one example of why I so often cringe when I see social media statistics thrown about by a supposedly reputable source .
This information spreads .
Quickly .
People do n’t seem to analyze information before passing it along anymore ( or maybe a good question is “ did they ever ? ” ) .
I do n’t think there ’s any excuse for it .
I ’ll give Mashable some major credit for pulling the piece .
I do n’t know what their reasons were , and I wo n’t make assumptions .
But even if it ’s just an unintended benefit , I ’m glad to see the stop of the spreading of that post .
One of my first comments in that initial Twitter discussion about the post was that I feared it would spread .
It clearly did .
The Bigger Problem of Social Media Statistics
This is n’t a problem with Jolie O’Dell .
This is n’t even a problem with Mashable .
This is a widespread problem in social media .
Companies are essentially able to create their own self - fulfilling prophecies by interpreting and publishing incomplete or distorted data .
Actually , it goes well beyond social media .
I ’m not saying this is always intentional .
Sure , sometimes it might be a case of creating linkbait headlines or trying to puff up a company ’s image to bring in more traffic and members ( even if just out of sheer curiosity ) .
I do n’t assume that O’Dell had any ill intentions .
Her post just happened to be the latest example of stats gone awry .
I also ca n’t give you any easy answers when it comes to social media measurement .
In no way am I saying that Facebook does n’t have a commanding presence in the industry .
The point is that we ’ll probably never know exactly what percentage of social media traffic any given site has , and it ’s silly at best to pretend we have authoritative data when we do n’t .
That ’s because we do n’t know every social media site out there .
New ones pop up every day .
Sometimes they disappear or are sold off and merged ( like recent news from AOL about Bebo ) .
And sometimes one changes its business model , potentially fueling the growth of new social platforms ( can anybody say “ Ning exodus ? ” ) .
Does that mean we should stop gathering and interpreting data ?
Absolutely not .
But I do think it means that we have a greater responsibility as publishers to help our readers form their own opinions from that data .
We can do that by pointing out not only interesting possibilities but also potential flaws .
Or have we just become fad - feeders , discouraging critical thinking and informed decision - making in favor of a “ Join me !
Follow me !
Friend me ! ” approach of hyping up the tools we use in order to build our own audiences there ?
The Combahee River Collective Statement
Combahee River Collective
We are a collective of Black feminists who have been meeting together since 1974 . [ 1 ]
During that time we have been involved in the process of defining and clarifying our politics , while at the same time doing political work within our own group and in coalition with other progressive organizations and movements .
The most general statement of our politics at the present time would be that we are actively committed to struggling against racial , sexual , heterosexual , and class oppression , and see as our particular task the development of integrated analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are interlocking .
The synthesis of these oppressions creates the conditions of our lives .
As Black women we see Black feminism as the logical political movement to combat the manifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face .
We will discuss four major topics in the paper that follows : ( 1 ) the genesis of contemporary Black feminism ; ( 2 ) what we believe , i.e. , the specific province of our politics ; ( 3 ) the problems in organizing Black feminists , including a brief herstory of our collective ; and ( 4 ) Black feminist issues and practice .
1 . The genesis of Contemporary Black Feminism
Before looking at the recent development of Black feminism we would like to affirm that we find our origins in the historical reality of Afro- American women 's continuous life - and - death struggle for survival and liberation .
Black women 's extremely negative relationship to the American political system ( a system of white male rule ) has always been determined by our membership in two oppressed racial and sexual castes .
As Angela Davis points out in " Reflections on the Black Woman 's Role in the Community of Slaves , " Black women have always embodied , if only in their physical manifestation , an adversary stance to white male rule and have actively resisted its inroads upon them and their communities in both dramatic and subtle ways .
There have always been Black women activists — some known , like Sojourner Truth , Harriet Tubman , Frances E. W. Harper , Ida B. Wells Barnett , and Mary Church Terrell , and thousands upon thousands unknown — who have had a shared awareness of how their sexual identity combined with their racial identity to make their whole life situation and the focus of their political struggles unique .
Contemporary Black feminism is the outgrowth of countless generations of personal sacrifice , militancy , and work by our mothers and sisters .
A Black feminist presence has evolved most obviously in connection with the second wave of the American women 's movement beginning in the late 1960s .
Black , other Third World , and working women have been involved in the feminist movement from its start , but both outside reactionary forces and racism and elitism within the movement itself have served to obscure our participation .
In 1973 , Black feminists , primarily located in New York , felt the necessity of forming a separate Black feminist group .
This became the National Black Feminist Organization ( NBFO ) .
Black feminist politics also have an obvious connection to movements for Black liberation , particularly those of the 1960s and 1970s .
Many of us were active in those movements ( Civil Rights , Black nationalism , the Black Panthers ) , and all of our lives were greatly affected and changed by their ideologies , their goals , and the tactics used to achieve their goals .
It was our experience and disillusionment within these liberation movements , as well as experience on the periphery of the white male left , that led to the need to develop a politics that was anti-racist , unlike those of white women , and anti-sexist , unlike those of Black and white men .
There is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black Feminism , that is , the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal experiences of individual Black women 's lives .
Black feminists and many more Black women who do not define themselves as feminists have all experienced sexual oppression as a constant factor in our day - to - day existence .
As children we realized that we were different from boys and that we were treated differently .
For example , we were told in the same breath to be quiet both for the sake of being " ladylike " and to make us less objectionable in the eyes of white people .
As we grew older we became aware of the threat of physical and sexual abuse by men .
However , we had no way of conceptualizing what was so apparent to us , what we knew was really happening .
Black feminists often talk about their feelings of craziness before becoming conscious of the concepts of sexual politics , patriarchal rule , and most importantly , feminism , the political analysis and practice that we women use to struggle against our oppression .
The fact that racial politics and indeed racism are pervasive factors in our lives did not allow us , and still does not allow most Black women , to look more deeply into our own experiences and , from that sharing and growing consciousness , to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression .
Our development must also be tied to the contemporary economic and political position of Black people .
The post World War II generation of Black youth was the first to be able to minimally partake of certain educational and employment options , previously closed completely to Black people .
Although our economic position is still at the very bottom of the American capitalistic economy , a handful of us have been able to gain certain tools as a result of tokenism in education and employment which potentially enable us to more effectively fight our oppression .
A combined anti-racist and anti-sexist position drew us together initially , and as we developed politically we addressed ourselves to heterosexism and economic oppression under capItalism .
2. What We Believe
Above all else , our politics initially sprang from the shared belief that Black women are inherently valuable , that our liberation is a necessity not as an adjunct to somebody else 's but because of our need as human persons for autonomy .
This may seem so obvious as to sound simplistic , but it is apparent that no other ostensibly progressive movement has ever considered our specific oppression as a priority or worked seriously for the ending of that oppression .
Merely naming the pejorative stereotypes attributed to Black women ( e.g. mammy , matriarch , Sapphire , whore , bulldagger ) , let alone cataloguing the cruel , often murderous , treatment we receive , indicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the Western hemisphere .
We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation are us .
Our politics evolve from a healthy love for ourselves , our sisters and our community which allows us to continue our struggle and work .
This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics .
We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity , as opposed to working to end somebody else 's oppression .
In the case of Black women this is a particularly repugnant , dangerous , threatening , and therefore revolutionary concept because it is obvious from looking at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more worthy of liberation than ourselves .
We reject pedestals , queenhood , and walking ten paces behind .
To be recognized as human , levelly human , is enough .
We believe that sexual politics under patriarchy is as pervasive in Black women 's lives as are the politics of class and race .
We also often find it difficult to separate race from class from sex oppression because in our lives they are most often experienced simultaneously .
We know that there is such a thing as racial - sexual oppression which is neither solely racial nor solely sexual , e.g. , the history of rape of Black women by white men as a weapon of political repression .
Although we are feminists and Lesbians , we feel solidarity with progressive Black men and do not advocate the fractionalization that white women who are separatists demand .
Our situation as Black people necessitates that we have solidarity around the fact of race , which white women of course do not need to have with white men , unless it is their negative solidarity as racial oppressors .
We struggle together with Black men against racism , while we also struggle with Black men about sexism .
We realize that the liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political - economic systems of capitalism and imperialism as well as patriarchy .
We are socialists because we believe that work must be organized for the collective benefit of those who do the work and create the products , and not for the profit of the bosses .
Material resources must be equally distributed among those who create these resources .
We are not convinced , however , that a socialist revolution that is not also a feminist and anti-racist revolution will guarantee our liberation .
We have arrived at the necessity for developing an understanding of class relationships that takes into account the specific class position of Black women who are generally marginal in the labor force , while at this particular time some of us are temporarily viewed as doubly desirable tokens at white - collar and professional levels .
We need to articulate the real class situation of persons who are not merely raceless , sexless workers , but for whom racial and sexual oppression are significant determinants in their working / economic lives .
Although we are in essential agreement with Marx 's theory as it applied to the very specific economic relationships he analyzed , we know that his analysis must be extended further in order for us to understand our specific economic situation as Black women .
A political contribution which we feel we have already made is the expansion of the feminist principle that the personal is political .
In our consciousness - raising sessions , for example , we have in many ways gone beyond white women 's revelations because we are dealing with the implications of race and class as well as sex .
Even our Black women 's style of talking / testifying in Black language about what we have experienced has a resonance that is both cultural and political .
We have spent a great deal of energy delving into the cultural and experiential nature of our oppression out of necessity because none of these matters has ever been looked at before .
No one before has ever examined the multilayered texture of Black women 's lives .
An example of this kind of revelation / conceptualization occurred at a meeting as we discussed the ways in which our early intellectual interests had been attacked by our peers , particularly Black males .
We discovered that all of us , because we were " smart " had also been considered " ugly , " i.e. , " smart - ugly . "
" Smart - ugly " crystallized the way in which most of us had been forced to develop our intellects at great cost to our " social " lives .
The sanctions
In the Black and white communities against Black women thinkers is comparatively much higher than for white women , particularly ones from the educated middle and upper classes .
As we have already stated , we reject the stance of Lesbian separatism because it is not a viable political analysis or strategy for us .
It leaves out far too much and far too many people , particularly Black men , women , and children .
We have a great deal of criticism and loathing for what men have been socialized to be in this society : what they support , how they act , and how they oppress .
But we do not have the misguided notion that it is their maleness , per se — i.e. , their biological maleness — that makes them what they are .
As BIack women we find any type of biological determinism a particularly dangerous and reactionary basis upon which to build a politic .
We must also question whether Lesbian separatism is an adequate and progressive political analysis and strategy , even for those who practice it , since it so completely denies any but the sexual sources of women 's oppression , negating the facts of class and race .
3. Problems in Organizing Black Feminists
During our years together as a Black feminist collective we have experienced success and defeat , joy and pain , victory and failure .
We have found that it is very difficult to organize around Black feminist issues , difficult even to announce in certain contexts that we are Black feminists .
We have tried to think about the reasons for our difficulties , particularly since the white women 's movement continues to be strong and to grow in many directions .
In this section we will discuss some of the general reasons for the organizing problems we face and also talk specifically about the stages in organizing our own collective .
The major source of difficulty in our political work is that we are not just trying to fight oppression on one front or even two , but instead to address a whole range of oppressions .
We do not have racial , sexual , heterosexual , or class privilege to rely upon , nor do we have even the minimal access to resources and power that groups who possess anyone of these types of privilege have .
The psychological toll of being a Black woman and the difficulties this presents in reaching political consciousness and doing political work can never be underestimated .
There is a very low value placed upon Black women 's psyches in this society , which is both racist and sexist .
As an early group member once said , " We are all damaged people merely by virtue of being Black women . "
We are dispossessed psychologically and on every other level , and yet we feel the necessity to struggle to change the condition of all Black women .
In " A Black Feminist 's Search for Sisterhood , " Michele Wallace arrives at this conclusion :
We exists as women who are Black who are feminists , each stranded for the moment , working independently because there is not yet an environment in this society remotely congenial to our struggle — because , being on the bottom , we would have to do what no one else has done : we would have to fight the world . [ 2 ]
Wallace is pessimistic but realistic in her assessment of Black feminists ' position , particularly in her allusion to the nearly classic isolation most of us face .
We might use our position at the bottom , however , to make a clear leap into revolutionary action .
If Black women were free , it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression .
Feminism is , nevertheless , very threatening to the majority of Black people because it calls into question some of the most basic assumptions about our existence , i.e. , that sex should be a determinant of power relationships .
Here is the way male and female roles were defined in a Black nationalist pamphlet from the early 1970s :
We understand that it is and has been traditional that the man is the head of the house .
He is the leader of the house / nation because his knowledge of the world is broader , his awareness is greater , his understanding is fuller and his application of this information is wiser ...
After all , it is only reasonable that the man be the head of the house because he is able to defend and protect the development of his home ...
Women cannot do the same things as men — they are made by nature to function differently .
Equality of men and women is something that cannot happen even in the abstract world .
Men are not equal to other men , i.e. ability , experience or even understanding .
The value of men and women can be seen as in the value of gold and silver — they are not equal but both have great value .
We must realize that men and women are a complement to each other because there is no house / family without a man and his wife .
Both are essential to the development of any life . [ 3 ]
The material conditions of most Black women would hardly lead them to upset both economic and sexual arrangements that seem to represent some stability in their lives .
Many
Black women have a good understanding of both sexism and racism , but because of the everyday constrictions of their lives , cannot risk struggling against them both .
The reaction of Black men to feminism has been notoriously negative .
They are , of course , even more threatened than Black women by the possibility that Black feminists might organize around our own needs .
They realize that they might not only lose valuable and hardworking allies in their struggles but that they might also be forced to change their habitually sexist ways of interacting with and oppressing Black women .
Accusations that Black feminism divides the Black struggle are powerful deterrents to the growth of an autonomous Black women 's movement .
Still , hundreds of women have been active at different times during the three - year existence of our group .
And every Black woman who came , came out of a strongly - felt need for some level of possibility that did not previously exist in her life .
When we first started meeting early in 1974 after the NBFO first eastern regional conference , we did not have a strategy for organizing , or even a focus .
We just wanted to see what we had .
After a period of months of not meeting , we began to meet again late in the year and started doing an intense variety of consciousness - raising .
The overwhelming feeling that we had is that after years and years we had finally found each other .
Although we were not doing political work as a group , individuals continued their involvement in Lesbian politics , sterilization abuse and abortion rights work , Third World Women 's International Women 's Day activities , and support activity for the trials of Dr. Kenneth Edelin , Joan Little , and Inéz García .
During our first summer when membership had dropped off considerably , those of us remaining devoted serious discussion to the possibility of opening a refuge for battered women in a Black community .
( There was no refuge in Boston at that time . )
We also decided around that time to become an independent collective since we had serious disagreements with NBFO 's bourgeois - feminist stance and their lack of a clear politIcal focus .
We also were contacted at that time by socialist feminists , with whom we had worked on abortion rights activities , who wanted to encourage us to attend the National Socialist Feminist Conference in Yellow Springs .
One of our members did attend and despite the narrowness of the ideology that was promoted at that particular conference , we became more aware of the need for us to understand our own economic situation and to make our own economic analysis .
In the fall , when some members returned , we experienced several months of comparative inactivity and internal disagreements which were first conceptualized as a Lesbian - straight split but which were also the result of class and political differences .
During the summer those of us who were still meeting had determined the need to do political work and to move beyond consciousness - raising and serving exclusively as an emotional support group .
At the beginning of 1976 , when some of the women who had not wanted to do political work and who also had voiced disagreements stopped attending of their own accord , we again looked for a focus .
We decided at that time , with the addition of new members , to become a study group .
We had always shared our reading with each other , and some of us had written papers on Black feminism for group discussion a few months before this decision was made .
We began functioning as a study group and also began discussing the possibility of starting a Black feminist publication .
We had a retreat in the late spring which provided a time for both political discussion and working out interpersonal issues .
Currently we are planning to gather together a collection of Black feminist writing .
We feel that it is absolutely essential to demonstrate the reality of our politics to other Black women and believe that we can do this through writing and distributing our work .
The fact that individual Black feminists are living in isolation all over the country , that our own numbers are small , and that we have some skills in writing , printing , and publishing makes us want to carry out these kinds of projects as a means of organizing Black feminists as we continue to do political work in coalition with other groups .
4. Black Feminist Issues and Projects
During our time together we have identified and worked on many issues of particular relevance to Black women .
The inclusiveness of our politics makes us concerned with any situation that impinges upon the lives of women , Third World and working people .
We are of course particularly committed to working on those struggles in which race , sex , and class are simultaneous factors in oppression .
We might , for example , become involved in workplace organizing at a factory that employs Third World women or picket a hospital that is cutting back on already inadequate heath care to a Third World community , or set up a rape crisis center in a Black neighborhood .
Organizing around welfare and daycare concerns might also be a focus .
The work to be done and the countless issues that this work represents merely reflect the pervasiveness of our oppression .
Issues and projects that collective members have actually worked on are sterilization abuse , abortion rights , battered women , rape and health care .
We have also done many workshops and educationals on Black feminism on college campuses , at women 's conferences , and most recently for high school women .
One issue that is of major concern to us and that we have begun to publicly address is racism in the white women 's movement .
As Black feminists we are made constantly and painfully aware of how little effort white women have made to understand and combat their racism , which requires among other things that they have a more than superficial comprehension of race , color , and Black history and culture .
Eliminating racism in the white women 's movement is by definition work for white women to do , but we will continue to speak to and demand accountability on this issue .
In the practice of our politics we do not believe that the end always justifies the means .
Many reactionary and destructive acts have been done in the name of achieving " correct " political goals .
As feminists we do not want to mess over people in the name of politics .
We believe in collective process and a nonhierarchical distribution of power within our own group and in our vision of a revolutionary society .
We are committed to a continual examination of our politics as they develop through criticism and self - criticism as an essential aspect of our practice .
In her introduction to Sisterhood is Powerful Robin Morgan writes :
I have n't the faintest notion what possible revolutionary role white heterosexual men could fulfill , since they are the very embodiment of reactionary - vested - interest - power .
As Black feminists and Lesbians we know that we have a very definite revolutionary task to perform and we are ready for the lifetime of work and struggle before us .

Every year we do a post about the Hottest Wives and Girlfriends ( WAG’s ) of NBA basketball players .
But generally the list is contained to the wives of currently active players .
So this year we decided that maybe we should open it up a bit , and talk about an all - time list .
So just in time for the 2010 NBA Playoffs , and without further delay , here is The Hoop Doctors Top 15 Hottest NBA WAG ’s of All - Time :

She was escorted down the aisle by stepfather Bruce Jenner .
Sisters Kim and Kourtney served as maids of honor .
On October 9 , she appeared on The View and announced she had changed her name to Khloé Kardashian Odom , dropping her original middle name and changing her maiden name to her new middle name .
You know those people who constantly sigh over how full their e-mail boxes are , simply as a way to demonstrate their immense importance ?
Well , now they can wear their inboxes on their sleeves — literally — with the e-mail counting T - shirt .
This snazzy little number was created by Chris Ball , a software developer and engineer who dreamed up the idea with his wife , Madeleine .
The shirt has a built - in counter that displays how many unread e-mails Chris has with the help of an LilyPad Arduino , a Bluetooth dongle and an Android phone .
( Check out the video below to see it in action . )
You can also yoink the source code that runs on the LilyPad and the Python script running on Bell 's Android here .
Thanks ,

News correspondent Harry Smith tells the story behind this stunning development , which has been called one of the great social experiments of the next century .
I spoke too soon .
Is there no combination beyond bounds in this election ?
The Financial Times ( unlinkable due to copyright warnings ) reports that David Cameron ’s campaign team is exploring the possibility of a deal with unionist politicians in Northern Ireland and Scottish and Welsh nationalist MPs in the event of a hung parliament , in an attempt to avoid giving in to Liberal Democrat demands for electoral reform .
This looks like a counsel of desperation for the party of the Union , which is also the party pledged to impose the most rigorous spending cuts .
Together the wee Celts will be lucky to elect 23 MPs in total , meaning the option of a motley “ Celtic bloc ” of rival unionist and nationalist parties could only come into play after a very particular election result – and even then it looks a very shakey proposition indeed .
How could an arrangment survive which supports cuts in England but exempts Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland from their full rigour ?
However at the very least it may feed Sir Reg ’s ambitions of “ a seat in a British government . ”
But in this new situation , why not Nigel Dodds ’- or even those of that fine man of government Mark Durkan ?
As they ’ve all made clear , the DUP the SNP and Plaid Cymru say the price of any support would be to protect their areas from the worst effects of any spending cuts – a tough demand on a government looking to reduce the £ 163bn deficit .
But Cameron ’s team believe it may be preferable to doing a deal with Nick Clegg ’s Lib Dems , who say that electoral reform would be the price of any post-election pact .
The FT puts a new interpretation on the Hatfield strategy which we were told at the time was designed to avert an Assembly collapse .
Now , a version of Hatfield might rescue Westminster from post-election turmoil .
SNP leader Alex Salmond has been coy about which of the two main parties the “ Celtic bloc ” of SNP and Plaid Cymru might support , telling Newsnight t that it was getting “ very very difficult to tell Labour and Tories apart . ”
Last month the Herald reported “ secret talks ” to create a Celtic bloc including all the NI parties .
But in public , our MPs have never been mentioned as part of the bloc .
Now it appears , it ’s the Conservatives , not the SNP who are putting them back in the frame – if the story has weight .
A wider Conservative courtship would affect the complexion of NI politics yet again .
Would Peter Robinson who would exceed Salmond in seniority and probable numbers , seek to take over the driving seat ?
And what after all that , would have been the point of Ucunf ?
Perhaps in a while I ’ll find it ’s I who ’ve been dreaming .

DRUG DELIVERY AND DEVELOPMENT :
Topical Vaccination : No More Needles
I 'm probably not the only person in the world who hates getting a shot .
I can't quite put my finger on it , but there 's something about being harpooned by a needle that I find unappealing .
Scientists have recently worked towards addressing this issue with insulin - deficient diabetics , developing an insulin delivery device that reduces the need for multiple daily injections .
The diabetic regulates insulin release within the body by drinking tonic water .
Perhaps more desirable is a simple , topical drug delivery method , i.e. one that can be rubbed onto the skin and absorbed .
Ignoring my needle - phobia , this would have many advantages in resource - limited nations , where there often are n't enough trained medical personnel for routine care .
The challenges of needleless vaccination .
The problem with this needlesless vaccination approach is that many water - soluble proteins ( under study as advanced drugs ) do n't penetrate through the skin .
Proteins are usually large molecules , skin cells are packed tightly together , and water - soluble proteins can't readily penetrate water - repelling cell membranes , all of which hinder the success of a topical drug delivery protocol .
This means that , for delivery inside the patient , many protein - based drugs require a shot ( harpooning ) or complicated delivery vehicles .
To date , these delivery vehicles have invariably been toxic , expensive , and / or partially destroy the function of the protein .
Scientists have previously reported polymer microparticles , silica nanoparticles , and carbon nanotubes as drug delivery vehicles .
While all of these protocols have their place ( especially the carbon nanotubes , which are specifically designed to combat late - stage cancer ) , none of these methods conclusively fulfills all three desired requirements of safety , low cost , and protein functional retention , without the use of needles .
Victor Yang ( University of Michigan Ann Arbor , United States ) and coworkers have worked towards topical , needleless vaccination , utilizing a protocol likely to meet the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration .
Many drugs meet the requirements for delivery through the skin ,
One example is an anti-HIV drug that can be mass - produced from genetically - modified Nicotiana benthamiana plants .
This research is complimentary to the 2007 report of a rice - based ( edible ) cholera vaccine specifically designed for resource - limited nations .
Needleless vaccination .
For delivery across the skin , Yang and coworkers affixed a cell - penetrating peptide to various water - soluble proteins .
The peptide enables the protein to penetrate through the skin .
Furthermore , the peptide they used is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration .
This approach is therefore likely to receive rapid regulatory approval .
The chemical bond between the peptide and the protein is a disulfide bond , which is readily cleaved within cells .
Therefore , the delivery vehicle readily dissociates from the protein once across the skin and in the cell , suggesting that the function of the protein will be retained .
The scientists found that the proteins lysozyme , ovalbumin , and bovine serum albumin could penetrate through the skin via this protocol .
Furthermore , the proteins were functional afterwards .
Mice which were topically adminsitered one of these proteins developed antibodies specific to the protein .
In other words , there was an immune response , the desired effect of a vaccine .
Specifically , 500 micrograms per milliliter of ovalbumin ellicited an immune response .
This response induced by needleless vaccination was statistically equivalent to standard injection with ovalbumin .
More impressively , targeting to the female reproductive tract was roughly 10 times as effective as standard injection .
This result emphasizes that their new needleless vaccination protocol can in some respects exceed the protective benefit imparted by injection .
Implications .
The needleless vaccination method of Yang and coworkers is nontoxic , cheap , and retains the function of the protein - based drug comprising the vaccine .
This approach is likely to speed its way through regulatory hurdles and , assuming trials in humans are successful , will be of much use in resource - limited nations .

From David Baker at the San Francisco Chronicle : State gas usage falls for 4th straight year
Driven lower by high prices and the recession , gasoline sales in California fell for the fourth year in a row during 2009 , state officials reported Tuesday .
...
Annual gas sales in California peaked at 15.9 billion gallons in 2005 and have tumbled 7 percent since then .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the percent change of taxable gallons of gasoline compared to the same quarter of the prior year .
In addition to gasoline usage being down for four straight years , driven by higher prices and then the recession , usage turned down again in Q4 2009 - probably because prices are up over $ 3 per gallon again .

Medical marijuana advocates upped the ante Tuesday in the legal battle over Los Angeles ’ pot dispensaries by suing the city , claiming the ordinance that takes effect later this month is so restrictive it will cause even law - abiding businesses to shut down .
Americans for Safe Access , the nation ’s main medical marijuana advocacy nonprofit , filed the lawsuit with the Venice Beach Care Center and the PureLife Alternative Wellness Center , two dispensaries that have operated in Los Angeles since 2006 -- before the city 's moratorium on the centers took effect .
The 11 - page suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court says the sweeping marijuana ordinance passed by the City Council in January and signed into law by the mayor Feb.
3 “ severely restricts access to medical marijuana by effectively forcing plaintiffs , as well as the vast majority of collectives in the City , to close their doors . ”
The suit alleges the city ordinance violates state law , and it seeks a court injunction and restraining order to stop the measure from being enforced .
In the suit , dispensary operators object to the “ onerous restrictions ” of the law that is scheduled to take effect March 14 , such as a rule that gives them only seven days to relocate to 1,000 feet away from schools , parks and places of worship but does not provide maps to show where they are allowed under the law .
" We want to work with the city to comply with its regulations , but such unreasonable requirements make compliance impossible , " Yamileth Bolanos , operator of the PureLife Alternative Wellness Center , said in a statement .
The city attorney ’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
[ Updated at 11:23 a.m. :
An official with the city attorney 's office said he had not reviewed the lawsuit and could not comment on specifics , but he noted its filing could be premature because the ordinance has not yet taken effect .
“ We 'll be prepared to respond in the court , ” said William Carter , the city attorney ’s chief deputy .
“ Regardless of this lawsuit , the city attorney 's office will continue to enforce existing local and state law .
This lawsuit does not affect our long - standing and ongoing enforcement efforts . " ]
The city prosecutor 's office filed three lawsuits last month seeking court injunctions to force Organica in the Venice area and two Holistic Caregivers stores in South Los Angeles to stop all sales .
Los Angeles City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich has said that state law authorizes collectives only to grow marijuana and recover their actual costs , not to sell it .
The German maker of a new tablet PC is setting out to rival Apple 's iPad with the promise of even more technology such as a bigger screen , a webcam and USB ports .
It is not , however , an " iPad killer " as it has been dubbed by some blogs but an alternative to its bigger rival , Neofonie GmbH 's founder and managing director Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen told reporters on Monday in Berlin .
Ankershoffen stressed the system 's openness :
Two USB ports allow users to connect all kinds of devices with the WePad , from external keyboards to data sticks .
People who want to put music on their WePad do not have to have any particular software , Ankershoffen said — a blow at Apple 's devices that require particular Apple software like iTunes .
The WePad 's basic version , which comes with Wi-Fi and 16 - gigabyte storage , is set to cost € 449 ( $ 600 ) , the larger 32 - gigabyte version with a fast 3G modem is €569 .
Ankershoffen claimed that given its technological superiority and greater openness , " that 's a bargain compared with the iPad . "
The iPad — which hit stores in the U.S. less than a month ago — is on sale there starting at $ 499 for the smallest version , coming with Wi -Fi and 16 GB storage .
The WePad , with its 11.6 - inch ( 29.5 - centimeter ) screen , is powered by an Intel chip and relies on a Linux software basis which is compatible with Google 's Android and all Flash applications , Ankershoffen said .
When it hits stores starting in late July , it will also boast a complete open source office package , he said .
Reporters could not test the device at the press conference .
Berlin - based Neofonie — a small company of some 180 employees — claims it already has some 20,000 people interested in signing up for a pre-order , even though orders wo n't be formally accepted before April 27 .
Ankershoffen declined to give a sales estimate .
" Not thousands , not tens of thousands but many more will be sold before the end of the year , " he said .
The WePad is to be assembled by a manufacturer in Asia — which Ankershoffen refused to name — that can ramp up production capacity according to demand , he said
Neofonie casts the WePad as helping the media industry find a way to market paid content and hopes to appeal to publishers , some of whom are disgruntled with Apple 's pricing policy and restrictions .
The device would allow publishers to sell their content on its platform without monopolizing the customer relationship , as Apple 's iTunes or Amazon 's Kindle do , the company said .
Gruner +
Jahr , one of Europe 's largest magazine publishers , already has a partnership with Neofonie , offering the company 's flagship magazine , Stern , on the platform .
" It will be the first magazine , but others will certainly follow , " Stern 's deputy chief Tobias Seikel said at the press conference .
Germany 's biggest publisher , Berlin - based Axel Springer AG , is in talks with Neofonie , but no cooperation is planned yet , spokesman Christian Garrels said .
" We want to offer our company 's brands on several platforms with a high range , " Garrels told The Associated Press .
The company 's flagship daily , Bild , previously had trouble with its iPhone application because Apple censors sexually explicit content , such as the paper 's daily nude photo .
Apple 's iPad will go on sale in Germany at the end of April , according to the company 's Web site .
This would give the iPad roughly a three month lead on its German competitor .
Neofonie seems determined to face its big California rival :
The company distributed tasty red apples boasting the WePad 's logo at the press conference .
However , both companies have to prove that the touch screen device will not only amaze the tech - savvy early users , but will also appeal to mainstream consumers at a time when people already have a lot of Internet - connected gadgets — smart phones , laptops , e-book readers , set - top boxes and home broadband connections .
Man - in - the - Middle Attacks Against SSL
Says Matt Blaze :
A decade ago , I observed that commercial certificate authorities protect you from anyone from whom they are unwilling to take money .
That turns out to be wrong ; they do n’t even do that much .
Scary research by Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm :
Abstract :
This paper introduces a new attack , the compelled certificate creation attack , in which government agencies compel a certificate authority to issue false SSL certificates that are then used by intelligence agencies to covertly intercept and hijack individuals ’ secure Web - based communications .
We reveal alarming evidence that suggests that this attack is in active use .
Finally , we introduce a lightweight browser add - on that detects and thwarts such attacks .
Even more scary , Soghoian and Stamm found that hardware to perform this attack is being produced and sold :
At a recent wiretapping convention , however , security researcher Chris Soghoian discovered that a small company was marketing internet spying boxes to the feds .
The boxes were designed to intercept those communications — without breaking the encryption — by using forged security certificates , instead of the real ones that websites use to verify secure connections .
To use the appliance , the government would need to acquire a forged certificate from any one of more than 100 trusted Certificate Authorities . [ … ]
The company in question is known as Packet Forensics … .
According to the flyer : “ Users have the ability to import a copy of any legitimate key they obtain ( potentially by court order ) or they can generate ‘ look - alike ’ keys designed to give the subject a false sense of confidence in its authenticity . ”
The product is recommended to government investigators , saying “ IP communication dictates the need to examine encrypted traffic at will . ”
And , “ Your investigative staff will collect its best evidence while users are lulled into a false sense of security afforded by web , e-mail or VOIP encryption . ”
Matt Blaze has the best analysis .
Read his whole commentary ; this is just the ending :
It ’s worth pointing out that , from the perspective of a law enforcement or intelligence agency , this sort of surveillance is far from ideal .
A central requirement for most government wiretapping ( mandated , for example , in the CALEA standards for telephone interception ) is that surveillance be undetectable .
But issuing a bogus web certificate carries with it the risk of detection by the target , either in real - time or after the fact , especially if it ’s for a web site already visited .
Although current browsers do n’t ordinarily detect unusual or suspiciously changed certificates , there ’s no fundamental reason they could n’t ( and the Soghoian / Stamm paper proposes a Firefox plugin to do just that ) .
In any case , there ’s no reliable way for the wiretapper to know in advance whether the target will be alerted by a browser that scrutinizes new certificates .
Also , it ’s not clear how web interception would be particularly useful for many of the most common law enforcement investigative scenarios .
If a suspect is buying books or making hotel reservations online , it ’s usually a simple ( and legally relatively uncomplicated ) matter to just ask the vendor about the transaction , no wiretapping required .
This suggests that these products may be aimed less at law enforcement than at national intelligence agencies , who might be reluctant ( or unable ) to obtain overt cooperation from web site operators ( who may be located abroad ) .

I spent last week attending the “ Formation and Evolution of Black Holes ” conference at the Aspen Center for Physics , organized by Andrea Ghez , Vicky Kalogera , Fred Rasio , and Steinn Sigurdsson ( who blogs over at the Dynamics of Cats ) .
It was a great mix of observers and theorists , and we covered the full range , from stellar - mass black holes in our galaxy to supermassive black holes on the far side of the Universe .
I was particularly interested in two topics : gravitational - wave recoil and black hole binary inspiral ( I ’ll blog about both soon enough ) .
And I made another pilgrimage to the Highlands bowl , this time with 15 ″ of virgin powder .
The Aspen Center runs a public lecture series in conjunction with each conference .
So last Wednesday Andrea Ghez gave a lecture on the black hole at the center of our galaxy .
It ’s our closest big black hole , roughly 25,000 light years ( 2×1017 kilometers ) away , and four million times the mass of our Sun.
Andrea has been leading a team studying the motion of stars orbiting around this black hole .
These orbits are one of the best ways ( short of the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers ) of confirming that black holes exist .
The orbits tell us the mass of the central object .
And the innermost passage of the closest orbit gives us an upper limit on the size of the central object .
Combining these numbers gives us a lower limit to the density of the “ dark object ” at the center of our galaxy .
At this point , a black hole is the only viable model for what we see .
There is no way to make sense of the orbits using a cluster of ( dark ) stars at the center , or a massive gas cloud , or anything else we can think of .
Gravity tells us that any normal stuff we put there ( including “ conventional ” dark matter ) will evaporate or collapse to a black hole .
We are not yet probing the horizon of the black hole ( in some sense , its surface ) , but we are getting closer and closer with each passing year .
But , more importantly , Andrea is responsible for one of the coolest movies in all of science :
This shows the orbits of stars around our galactic center .
This is n’t an artist ’s conception .
This is n’t some abstraction of other data .
This is a real movie of stars circling the black hole over the last 15 years .
In particular , watch S - 02 .
It loops around the black hole , and closes its orbit ; we have watched it over one full S - 02 “ year ” .
It is an incredible feat of observational astronomy to make these movies .
It requires adaptive optics on the largest telescopes in the world ( the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea ) .
We used to think of the heavens as eternal and unchanging .
Now we watch movies of stars orbiting black holes .
Recently , we took a trip to Dresden to talk with GlobalFoundries executives and visit the clean room facility known as Fab 1 Module 1 [ former Fab 36 from AMD days ] .
We ’ll publish a more in - depth coverage in the next day or two but there is one major thing we have to report – even though press relations folk wo n’t be pleased with us .
We spoke with Udo Nothelfer , VP of GlobalFoundries and General Manager of Fab 1 , Subramani Kengeri [ VP of Design Solutions ] as well as partners from AMTC and Open Silicon .
During our clean room tour , in which BSN * had privy to walk around the facility and see everything , including 32nm and 28nm wafers , we also took a good look onto the displays in the facility , looking around at wafers and the results of our somewhat limited inquiry were astonishing , to say the list .
We knew that AMD traditionally enjoyed higher yields than the rest of semiconductor industry , including the manufacturing giants such as Intel .
In fact , it was a sobering surprise hearing from well respected semiconductor journalists the lack of the yield information from companies in the foundry business , when that information is accessible through analyst firms .
Getting back on the subject , we were checking several things – 32nm SOI test pattern , 28nm Bulk test pattern and mass - produced quad - core and sexa - core dies .
Even though we only saw couple of hundred wafers , the number of defects was well , surprisingly low and in orders of magnitude better than some other clean room facilities we had privilege visiting .
Naturally , we do not have specific information about the overall yields on the parts , as we only saw few hundred out of 35,000 wafer starts per month .
For instance , on 28nm bulk CMOS test sample , we saw three wafers that had several dozen defects , but those defects would still result in a yield substantially higher than what TSMC is able to achieve with its 40nm process [ this sadly , confirms the tale of GlobalFoundries being ahead of its customers ] .
Overall , we saw low amount of discarded dies and several hundred “ good to go ” ones .
Naturally , just as if the silicon is perfect does not mean that 100 % of the chips from that wafer will come to life .
Yet , we were told that the number of working dies per wafer is “ industry leading ” .
What was interesting was noticing multiple “ zero - defect wafers “ , i.e. wafers that had 100 % yield .
We saw multiple 100 % yielding wafers with commercial products as well as wafers with less than 10 defects .
The term “ German precision ” definitely applies here .
In a world where a transistor is mere 3 - 7 atoms thick , seeing a zero - defect wafer is still very much surprising .
Seeing several hundred billion of perfect transistors , consisting only out of few Si atoms each , one cannot but marvel at the way how semiconductor industry developed .
We often take things for granted and discuss about millions and even billions of transistors , but even at what we can freely call the most advanced foundry in the world , defects do happen .
Yes , we did not expect to see a perfect wafer ever , and back at the day , engineers were telling us such thing is borderline impossible .
After all , Gene Amdahl ’s revolutionary company went bust with the ill - fated idea to put a mainframe processor on a single wafer .
Personally , I have the luck of owning a wafer from Trilogy Systems , serving as an everyday reminder that it is “ fucking hard ” to manufacture complex ASIC designs such as Fermi , as Ujesh Desai of n Vidia [ in ] famously stated during GPU Technology Conference .
Now that GlobalFoundries is decoupled from AMD , the technologies and procedures GlobalFoundries uses are available to its respectable customers and we ’re not surprised to see ARM , Qualcomm , STMicro and others coming to GlobalFoundries in droves .
After all , if GlobalFoundries can take yield levels of current 45 nm SOI process and achieve them on both SOI and Bulk CMOS silicon wafers , a very high bar will be placed for any discussion where high - end chips can safely be manufactured in the future .
Stay tuned .

Nvidia Optimus is a hardware and software technology that determines when applications require discrete graphics via software , supplying power to the GPU in response .
This is done automatically , without the need to manually switch between integrated and discrete graphics .
For notebook users , this is a particularly useful technology as the additional power requirements of the GPU are only called upon only when needed .
This should extend battery life , making all notebook users happy .
Nvidia has released a video showing Optimus in action that should help drive home how slick this new technology is .
Rather than just put the GPU into an idle or low - power state , the system completely powers down the graphics part .
With the GPU off , the system does n't even mind if the dedicated graphics part is completely removed even while running .
" Few people ever get to see this demo because it requires a completely open notebook system – no chassis – just the motherboard , CPU , GPU , Hard drive , and monitor , so it is not exactly portable .
This demo is really killer with engineering teams that design notebooks , " said Matt Wuebbling , senior product manager of notebooks at Nvidia .
" They practically fall out of their chairs when they see it , " he continued .
" Why ?
Because with Optimus when the GPU is not needed it is completely powered off automatically and seamlessly WHILE the rest of the system is up and running – the power to the PCI Express bus , the frame buffer memory , the GPU - everything .
This is in contrast to switching the GPU to a low - power state or to ‘ idle ’ , which would still draw power . "

Web application security flaws are , as always , a hot area in security research , and it is n't surprising that a company which derives much of its income from the web would be interested in helping to secure it .
Google has released several tools over the past couple of years — along with a Browser Security Handbook — many of which have been written by longtime security researcher Michal Zalewski .
His latest release , skipfish , is an automated web application scanner that actively probes to find vulnerabilities .
Skipfish is a high - performance tool that can do several hundred to several thousand requests per second .
Each of those requests tests a different kind of potential security flaw in an application .
It spiders a web application and tries its tests on each of the pages it finds .
For any complicated application , that will result in huge numbers of requests — and probably errors — but because of the post - processing it does to its results , it summarizes the reported problems in a fairly manageable way .
The code itself is 12,000 lines of C , which builds from a simple make as long as libidn is available to handle internationalized domain names .
The program is command - line driven with top - like , continuously updating output ( seen at right ) .
Zalewski made some odd choices for colors in that output , making it hard to find a terminal color - scheme where it was readable .
The recommended 100x35 terminal size is decidedly non-standard as well .
Those nits aside , it is quite easy to get started with skipfish .
Understanding what one should do with skipfish is another story entirely .
There is a large number of tests that are run , which are listed on the documentation page .
That page also provides some examples of using the tool .
As one might guess , there are a large number of options to handle different application needs like cookie values , HTTP authentication credentials , logout URLs to avoid , and so on .
Before getting to that point , though , one must choose a dictionary .
Dictionaries in skipfish provide a starting point for the scanner to find additional URLs , files , and parameters that are used by the web application .
There are four different dictionaries distributed with skipfish ( minimal , default , extensions - only , and complete ) , and the tool will add what it learns to the dictionary as it runs .
The dictionaries / README - FIRST file describes each dictionary as well as how the dictionaries are used .
The minimal .wl dictionary is suggested as a good , lightweight starting point for skipfish experimentation .
And one gets the sense that a lot of experimentation will be required before any kind of skipfish - mastery is achieved .
That said , a fairly short run of skipfish against a local development version of a reasonably complex web application turned up several obvious , though relatively minor , problems .
There is also quite a bit more to go through in the report , so there are likely more problems awaiting discovery in even a small sample of skipfish 's capabilities .
One note of warning for those that have their application email with significant errors : either disable that , or you may get a chance to stress your mail server and / or be subjected to an inbox denial - of - service .
The report that skipfish produces is a summary of the problems , or potential problems that it found .
It is in HTML format , that , somewhat amusingly , requires Javascript to be turned on to be useful .
In fact , the " known issues " page mentions that due to " important security improvements " in Safari and Chrome , neither of those browsers will display the report via the file : protocol — " put the report in a local WWW root and navigate to http://localhost/... instead ; or use Firefox " .
In the report , various categories of problems found are listed with color - coded icons to estimate the severity of the problem .
Categories can be clicked on which will expose a list of the pages that exhibited the problem .
For each of those , an HTTP trace can be examined ( example shown at left ) .
While some of the categories are fairly obvious , some are a bit more obscure and will require some investigation to determine whether there is truly a problem or not .
Like most , if not all , automated scanners , there will be plenty of false - positives reported , which means that the results will have to be sifted to find the real problems .
Skipfish is aimed at minimizing false - positives , but it will still require an iterative approach .
Limiting the search to the " interesting " parts of the application , without missing something important in the portions deemed " unimportant " will be somewhat tricky to get right .
Most web applications have vast numbers of pages that are governed by the same underlying code , so picking a truly representative sample of one of those pages is important .
Otherwise , skipfish will spend an awful lot of time repetitively testing the same kinds of things against " / ExampleContent / 1 " , " / ExampleContent / 2 " , and so on .
The same problem exists for any automated web scanner , of course .
As the documentation points out , there are other tools that do similar jobs ( Nikto and Nessus are given as examples ) , and skipfish is " not a silver bullet " .
But , clearly a lot of thought has gone into it , and Zalewski has an excellent track record as a finder of security vulnerabilities .
Skipfish is certainly a tool that is worth a long look .
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men A drug already used in men with enlarged prostates seems to cut the risk of prostate cancer developing , a large international study has shown .
A four - year trial in more than 6,500 men found those who took dutasteride had a 23 % lower risk of prostate cancer than those who took a dummy pill .
The men in the study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , were all at high risk of the disease .
UK experts welcomed the results but said longer - term research was needed .
It is not the first time that this class of drugs has been found to have potential effects on the prevention of prostate cancer .
In 2003 , researchers showed a similar drug , finasteride , cut the risk of prostate cancer by a quarter in healthy men but also found that the tumours that were detected were more aggressive .
Both drugs are prescribed in men who have an enlarged but benign prostate gland - an extremely common condition that happens with age and can cause symptoms such as frequent and painful urination .
High - risk patients
The latest trial , which was funded by GlaxoSmithKline which makes dutasteride , looked at men aged between 50 and 75 years who were high risk for prostate cancer because they had high PSA scores - a blood test which may indicate disease - but had been found not to have prostate cancer .
They were treated with a daily dose of dutasteride or a dummy pill .
Over the study , prostate cancer was found in 659 of the men taking the drug and 858 of the men taking a placebo .
Among men with a family history of prostate cancer , the drug reduced the relative risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis by 31.4 % .
It will be many years before we know if the drug can provide any long term benefit to men
Dr Helen Rippon , The Prostate Cancer Charity
The researchers believe that most of the tumours detected during the trial - which tended to be moderately aggressive - would have been present from the beginning but were too small to be detected .
They say this supports the idea that the drug shrinks early prostate tumours or prevents them from growing to a size at which they would be detected and need treatment .
Study leader Dr Gerald Andriole , chief of urologic surgery at Washington University School of Medicine , said the drug might potentially offer thousands of men a chance to reduce their risk of the disease .
" This means more men could avoid unnecessary treatment for prostate cancer along with the costs and harmful side effects that can occur with treatment . "
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) are already looking into whether dutasteride should be used for prostate cancer prevention and are due to report later this year .
Martin Ledwick , Cancer Research UK 's head information nurse , said the results in the high risk population were interesting .
But he added : " Further research to see if the effects are maintained in the longer term is an important next step . "
Dr Helen Rippon , head of research management at The Prostate Cancer Charity , agreed : " Of course , we do n't yet know what will happen to these men in the coming years and whether they will still go on to develop the disease and it will be many years before we know if the drug can provide any long - term benefit to men .

Other Our Country ads aggressively attacked Obama , sometimes using themes Palin ’s running mate , Republican presidential candidate John McCain , had declared out of bounds .
One reminded voters of “ hateful sermons from Obama 's pastor for over 20 years , ” while footage played featuring former Obama pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright preaching the words “ God damn America ! ”
Russo — who helped elect former Govs. George Deukmejian of California and George Pataki of New York , among other Republicans , and helped engineer the recall of Democratic California Gov. Gray Davis — said he was actually planning to shutter Our Country Deserves Better after the 2008 election , “ but so many people were telling us that somebody had to stay active and do something .
So we decided that we would do that , but we were n’t clear on exactly what we would do . ”
When the tea party movement picked up steam , Russo said , it made sense for the PAC to join in .
“ We had a good running start , ” he said .
Russo brought with him some of old tricks .
The bus tour , for example , mirrored the cross-country “ Stop Obama Tour ” in which a bus emblazoned with pictures of McCain and Palin flanking the Our Country Deserves Better PAC logo , stopped at 30 pro-McCain / Palin rallies during the final two weeks of October 2008 .
And then , as now , a substantial portion of the PAC ’s spending goes through Russo Marsh and , to a lesser extent , through King Media .
The PAC paid Russo Marsh $ 135,000 in consulting fees and commissions , $ 400,000 for e-mail and Web newsletters and at least $ 650,000 to produce and place television advertisements .
Though some of those sums reflect payments for e-mail address list rentals and television airtime that were passed along to list vendors and television stations , respectively , many of the blast e-mails and television ads served to drum up more attention and cash for the PAC , even as they also touted Republican candidates or attacked Democratic ones .
“ Go to OurCountryPAC.org and help us defeat Nancy Pelosi ’s Democrats , ” one pre-tea party PAC ad instructed viewers .
A more recent offering urged viewers to “ Join the Tea Party Express as we send Bart Stupak packing for an early retirement .
Log on to TeaPartyExpress.org as we fight to defeat Bart Stupak . ”
Kelly Eustis , who was fired from his job as the Our Country Deserves Better ’s political director in October , said the PAC — and particularly the Tea Party Express aspect of it — “ is keeping the firm afloat . ”
Eustis , who started his own PAC and also has been retained to do fundraising consulting for rival tea party groups , said that while he was at Our Country Deserves Better , his colleagues regarded the tea party as “ a brand name .
We stole the brand name to make money . ”
And he charged Russo and Wierzbicki with “ basically hijacking the movement for their personal and business gains without regard for real tea party activists . ”
Russo countered “ we ’re hardly making any money at all .
I ’m a cause - oriented person .
This is not a lucrative business proposition .
It ’s a cause for me .
I believe in what I ’m doing . ”
As for the bus tours , Russo said “ they work for us .
It ’s a great vehicle to go to a lot of places and get a lot of people involved and engaged .
I am proud of what we do .
Who else goes out there and motivates people and insinuates involvement and activity and actually is making a difference in what is going on ? ”
On 26 March 2010 WikiLeaks published the ' CIA report into shoring up Afghan war support in Western Europe ' .
It appears that the CIA Red Cell invited communication experts to look at " information approaches " to better link the Afghan war to the priorities of French , German and other Western European publics .
One chilling aspect of the report is the heading " Why Counting on Apathy Might Not be Enough " .
After expressing concern that the fall of the Dutch Government over its troop commitment to Afghanistan shows the fragility of European support for the NATO - led ISAF mission , the report goes onto say " ... The Afghanistan mission 's low public salience has allowed French and German leaders to disregard popular opposition and steadily increase their troop contributions to the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) ... "
Reading that made me wonder whether there is an Australian version of the report .
If not , why not ?
Does the CIA think they can safely count on public apathy here ?
They 'd certainly be forgiven for thinking so , given that the war has attracted few large - scale peaceful protests , little sustained and vocal opposition , and above all negligible in - depth media coverage and debate , notwithstanding the release of :
• the July 2009 United Nations report ' Silence is Violence End the Abuse of Women in Afghanistan ' ;
• the Afghanistan Millenium Development Goals Overview ;
• the response given to a Senate Standing Committee late last year about the use of depleted uranium munitions in Afghanistan ;
• the UNICEF 2010 Humanitarian Action Report ;
• the secret cables from the US Ambassador to Afghanistan , Karl Eikenberry ;
• the comments of US military commander General Stanley McChrystal ;
• the House of Commons report ' The legal basis for the invasion of Afghanistan ' ; or
• assessments of the war in Afghanistan made by the respected Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg , public intellectual Noam Chomsky and Phyllis Bennis , Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington .
[ Does n't this information lend the lie to Minister for Foreign Affairs Stephen Smith 's latest public assurance , made to justify blocking refugees , that in Afghanistan there was now better security as well as constitutional and legal reform ?
And you 'll notice that he seems to focus on changing circumstances for the Afghan Hazaras — who account for no more than 20 per cent of Afghanistan 's population — but is silent on the plight of others , like the Afghan Pashtuns , who come from the major conflict zones .
One wonders whether the move is really to block what is likely to be a mass exodus if civil war breaks out and Pashtuns become the target of the Tajik dominated Afghan National Army . ]
In any case , the continued apathy of a population that treats these revelations as part of the " watch and forget " 24 hour news cycle must be a pretty safe bet .
Yet I 'm optimistic that public opposition to the war in Afghanistan is widespread , that it will continue to grow and that eventually it will be galvanised .
Perhaps it 's misplaced optimism , but I agree with US Senator Morse who said in 1964 , in opposing the war in Vietnam , " ... I have complete faith in the American people to follow the facts if you give them ... "
Australians are n't any different , and the " facts " - like the US propaganda aimed at faking legitimacy and engineering popular support , and the gruesome realities of the war and its destructive consequences - are steadily leaking out .
We 're insulated from the realities of war when it is fought a long way away and when what we see and hear about it is so heavily censored and sanitised , first by our governments and then by our media , but truths eventually emerge and humanity eventually will then prevail .
The Stop the War Coalition ( SAWA ) , and other groups continue to mine away , voicing their opposition in the face of what must be disheartening political and media disinterest .
This week Business & Professional Women Australia issued a press release calling on the Government to withdraw Australian troops from Afghanistan and replace military spending by accountable expenditure on local institutional and social reconstruction .
Other organisations will no doubt follow when others realise that Afghanistan is a war without end and no benchmarks have been set for victory or defeat , and many more Australians will become active in their support in the face of incontrovertible facts like the harrowing video of US military personnel killing unarmed ( Iraqi ) civilians by raining down machine gun fire from a circling helicopter
What the final straw will be for the Australian public is anyone 's guess .
Perhaps the next , soon to be released Wikileaks video , which allegedly shows civilian killings in Afghanistan , will prove to be the catalyst .
Perhaps it will be the rising toll of young Australian soldiers being killed and wounded and otherwise traumatised .
Only time will tell .
But one thing is certain .
War in any form is an abomination .
It is not an act of kindness .
War rains death and destruction on civilian populations with devastating personal and social consequences .
It 's the duty of every citizen who opposes the war in Afghanistan to make their view known , whether in the press or at public gatherings , or by telling their elected representatives , or by discussing it with their friends and neighbours .
It 's time our politicians understood that we want our soldiers to be brought home to their families and the people of Afghanistan to be allowed to rebuild their lives .

A born - again Christian who said he killed a prominent US abortion doctor to save the lives of unborn babies was sentenced Thursday to life in prison with no chance of parole for 50 years .
Scott Roeder , 52 , was pulled out of the courtroom screaming “ you have the blood of babies on your hands ” after the sentence was handed down .
ADVERTISEMENT
Judge Warren Wilbert also sentenced Roeder to an additional two years in prison for threatening two ushers who tried to stop him as he fled after shooting Doctor George Tiller to death in the foyer of a Kansas church last May .
Tiller , 67 , was one of a handful of doctors in the United States to perform abortions into the third trimester of pregnancy and had been a lightning rod for anti-abortion foes , who nicknamed him “ Tiller the baby killer . ”
His murder made national headlines in a country deeply divided over whether women should continue to have legal access to abortion .
It also shut down one of the few clinics in the country capable of performing complex and controversial late - term abortions .
Public defender Mark Rudy insisted that there were no aggravating factors to warrant the “ Hard 50 ” for Roeder , who faced a minimum of 25 years in jail after being convicted of first degree murder .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rudy said that abortion providers are not granted extra protection under state law , and that the case was not supposed to put the issue of abortion on trial .
Roeder repeatedly interrupted witnesses with anti-abortion outbursts and the judge repeatedly admonished him .
In a 40 - minute statement before the sentence was handed down , Roeder railed against those who allowed abortion and attacked the judge for his handling of the case .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ George Tiller dismembered living children with a nod of approval from the state and he did this with the blessing of his church , ” Roeder declared .
“ You have to either obey man or obey God .
You have to choose . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In a move that critics feared could provide cover for acts of political violence , Roeder had sought to convince jurors he was only guilty of voluntary manslaughter .
Under Kansas law , voluntary manslaughter can apply when actions are taken based on an unreasonable but honest defense that he or she is preventing a greater harm .
But Wilbert ruled near the end of the trial that he would not allow jurors to consider the lesser offense .
ADVERTISEMENT
Prosecutor Nola Foulston welcomed the verdict and said she hoped it would serve as a warning against anyone else who thought they could take the law into their own hands .
“ This was an act of terrorism .
This was an act of brutality , ” she told reporters .
“ To others who may consider this course of conduct , remember there ’s a place for you too . ”
Tiller ’s family praised the sentence as appropriate for a “ hate crime committed against George , but also against all women and their constitutional rights . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Everything possible should be done by the prison system to ensure that this man does not continue to foment hatred and violence from his prison cell , ” Tiller ’s family said in a statement .

Through a combination of ineptitude , greed , and design , our “ representatives ” in Washington D.C. have put America on the fast track to economic ruin , and servitude to a Global Elite .
If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed ; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly ; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival .
There may even be a worse case .
You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory , because it is better to perish than to live as slaves .
— Sir Winston Churchill ( 1874-1965 )
“ We the people ” have finally had enough — more than enough .
You can see it clearly in Doug Hoffman ’s race in New York , where Republican party faithful are abandoning the candidate hand - picked for them , and endorsed by Michael Steele , the RNC , and Newt Gingrich .
Common sense , fiscal responsibility , and love for America trumps party loyalty .
Hoffman ’s popularity should not be misunderstood as a shift away from the Republican Party .
Hoffman is n’t winning simply because he ’s an Independent .
“ We the people ” are backing the most fiscally responsible , pro-American candidate available — Democratic , Republican , Independent — it does n’t matter .
The boneheads in Washington should take note — if they still care what “ we the people ” think .
America has been snookered , lied to , sold down the river
“ We the people ” are waking up to the fact that America has been snookered , lied to , sold down the river , by both political parties .
This is no joke , no conspiracy theory , no dress rehearsal .
This is the real deal .
The time is now , and we are the people .
America sinks or swims through us , and us alone .
The “ cavalry ” riding to America ’s rescue is us — we are the cavalry — and it ’s time to charge
The “ cavalry ” riding to America ’s rescue is us — we are the cavalry — and it ’s time to charge .
The radicals of the 1960s now hold the reins of power .
Unpatriotic , anti-American Globalists control the media , the entertainment industry , our schools , and the Executive , Legislative , and Judicial branches of government .
The erstwhile radical revolutionaries , are now the U.S. government ’s status quo .
They ARE the “ establishment . ”
Like Alice in some topsy - turvy “ Through the Looking - Glass ” world , conservative Americans ( the vast majority of the population ) are looking at a world that no longer reflects their reality , or their ideals .
Our government representatives , no longer represent us .
The counter - revolution has begun .
Old hippies know the drill , but for most of us , rebelling against the establishment is new and unfamiliar territory .
How do we fight out - of - control spending , Green Fascists , and the Nagging Nazi Nanny State ?
How do we take down “ the man , ” the power structure , the establishment ?
How do we stop the destruction of America ’s middle class , the devaluation of the U.S. dollar , the insane government spending , and the ceding of America ’s sovereignty to a Global Elite via the U.N. ?
How do we stop the indoctrination of our children , and the “ dumbing down ” of America ?
How do we get God back into our government , culture , and lives ?
Many of us have had “ tunnel vision ” regarding America ’s government .
We concentrated on “ keeping our own house in order , ” and left the running of the country to the politicians .
Well , we see where that has gotten us .
We need to educate ourselves about matters that we used to ignore — it ’s a matter of self - preservation .
If we fail , we ’re screwed , and so are our kids , and grand - kids , and so on for generations .
We need to do this on the fast track .
We need to know what we ’re fighting against , and we need to know what we ’re fighting for .
We need to get active .
“ We the people ” need to “ be informed , rather than opinionated . ”
We need to get off our butts — as many already have .
I give you as an example , Carmen Reynolds , Lt Col ( Ret ) USAF , who is most definitely active .
She has been diligently working to reform the Florida Republican Party from the inside out , and is suing the state of Florida to stop any forced vaccinations
In addition , she is active in local Tea Party rallies , and organizing support for Florida fishermen who have been forced out of work because of Agenda 21 .
She is constantly networking with other conservative causes and NGOs .
If you are motivated , committed , and active , then great — please continue your valuable work .
If you want to get active , but are n’t sure where to go ; I have drawn up a short list of web - sites ( with some help from Carmen ) .
This is hardly an exhaustive list , nor is it a “ best of ” list , but it should be enough to get you started .
My apologies to the numerous outstanding web - sites not mentioned .
I also have not mentioned any of the superb web - sites devoted mainly to disseminating the truth .

Disclaimer : I can not think of a real reason to fire Carlyle , nor do I think that Carlyle will be fired by Bob Murray .
Now that I 've said that , it will probably happen .
Still , until it does , I have no interest in firing Carlyle , so any analysis about signings , trades , or any other GM moves will be made in terms of Carlyle 's system .
Well , the off - season has officially started for the Ducks .
Playoffs are going well , and every team has a former Duck , encouraging .
Still , Bob Murray has a big task ahead of him .
If he does n't want to be run out of town with pitchforks and torches , he needs to sign Bobby Ryan immediately .
The OC Register 's Ducks Blog reveals that the impending CBA negotiations at the end of the 2010 - 11 season may be a a key factor affecting contract negotiations .
Before we get into how much I will be paying Bobby Ryan in my new role of Armchair GM , let 's take a look at what Bobby has accomplished this year and over his career .
I like reading , so no fancy graphs .
In 168 games , Bobby has 71 + 60 =131 , is +21 , and has 26 PP goals , meaning 37 % of his goals come on the PP .
That 's pretty baller .
It 's no secret that Bobby was a key contributor of the RPG line that dominated in the playoffs a year ago .
He was a stronger hitter then .
It seemed more and more that Bobby wanted to rely on that wrist shot from between the circles and was less willing to go into the corners and make power moves to the net .
The man can clearly find the back of the net .
His numbers are better than Perry 's were when he was gifted with that 5 - year contract .
Still , Bobby is n't as crazy as Perry .
I can count on Perry to stand in front of the net , and more importantly , be an agitator .
Bobby needs to play to his size and improve on some of those character demonstrations .
He was wonderful on that line with Koivu and Sexton , but down the stretch , he seemed to be waiting for chances to come to him instead of creating his own .
That should n't warrant top line money .
More importantly , if Bobby is going to continue to shoot from between the circles , he needs to do a better job of getting shots through and on net .
Bobby had the most missed shots , 80 , and blocked shots , 76 , of any Anaheim forward .
Those are only the even strength numbers .
Granted each of those only puts him in about the top 25 in the league , but in a system that is all about puck control and stopping the rush the other way , missed and blocked shots can be a serious problem for the Ducks .
It leads to the puck going the other way .
It can also thoroughly undermine the sustained pressure that Carlyle likes .
Let 's be real for a second .
Bobby is more than capable of dominating a game , but I do n't think he can take over a series like Getzlaf .
He 's not as disinterested in defense as Teemu Selanne , but he 's not as active in his own zone as a Chipchura or a Marchant .
Bobby is a very quiet goal scorer to me .
You know he 's going to score through the course of the season and a good amount of them will come in important situations .
Alexandre Burrows , Mikael Samuelsson , Patrick Hornqvist , Jussi Jokinen , and Dustin Penner , are all guys I would put in the same category as Bobby Ryan .
They are all 30 - goal scorers that teams do n't really gameplan to stop .
Bobby could potentially be good anywhere .
Placing him on multiple lines this year proved that .
But I think it is also that dynamic ability that has allowed him to transform into a chameleon of sorts .
He 'll score , but that 's it .
It 's difficult to gauge how impactful he really is .
As I 've said , the dominance shows up , but disappears as well .
It could be youthful inconsistency , but I expect more from a guy drafted after Sidney Crosby if he expects to be paid as one of our top scorers .
Despite all of this , I recognize Bobby 's potential .
He keeps scoring , and with Selanne still considering retirement , we 'll need PP production from somewhere .
Signing Bobby Ryan is the same as making a key free agent acquisition .
Especially since there are n't a lot of realistic options out there that will upgrade our scoring .
I 'm not going to offer Kovalchuk 10 million when I still need to sign a second line center , a Top 4 D-man , and a depth defenseman .
So here 's my proposal .
Bobby Ryan gets a 2 year $ 9 million deal that will pay him 4 million next year and 5 million in the second year .
I know Bobby wants to be UFA next contract , but that 's four years away and there 's no telling what the CBA will bring .
If there 's a major change to cap rules , or anything else , we still have Getzlaf , Perry , Sexton , Beleskey and other options , that will make trading Bobby a little easier to take .
He 'll get the extra money to make him feel better about being moved and then another shot at an RFA offer sheet .
The 4.5 cap hit is very manageable , and it's not like he 's being insulted .
He 'll be the third highest paid forward on the team , which is appropriate because he 's the third most valuable forward to us .
Ok , fourth , but Koivu is n't getting this kind of money .
His contract is next .
Bobby is going to get a raise .
My other option in this is to go for the 4 year deal he wants and bring down the cap hit , but until this rotation of veterans finally settles into some retirements , we need to keep a little bit of flexibility .
Bobby will take this money and play for more .
He still needs to prove he 's a franchise player who will do everything , not one of those invisible 30 goal scorers who is only about his production , and not about the intangibles that bring victory .
If he does , he 'll get a much longer and more expensive contract .
If he is n't interested in the two year , I 'll start trade discussions .
Then I 'll call Alexander Frolov 's agent .

I ’m getting bombarded with angry e-mails about the terrible assault on Louisiana GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal ’s campaign fundraising chief , Allee Bautsch , and her boyfriend in the French Quarter of New Orleans over the weekend .
A sample of the messages pouring in this afternoon :
“ Why have n’t you reported on it ? ! ”
“ Left Wing Media Causing Violence Against GOP Official & Boyfriend Savagely Beaten For Wearing Palin Pins ! ! ”
“ Why is Fox news not reporting on this ?
… Where ’s Michele ( sic ) Malkin and Ann Coulter ? ”
“ … you should be shouting from the rooftops about this assault on Palin supporters in New Orleans that is not even mentioned by LSM ”
Do n’t lose your heads , people .
This much is clear : Bautsch and her boyfriend were seriously beaten and injured after leaving a fund - raising event held during the Southern Republican Leadership Conference .
The New Orleans Times - Picayune said they were involved in an alteraction with a “ group of people ” on Friday night .
Louisiana blog
The Hayride has tracked all the developments since the incident took place and notes that the SRLC had attracted large groups of anarchists and other liberal grievance - mongers to protest the GOP gathering .
Now , there ’s a frenzy of rumors lighting up Twitter , my e-mail , and blogs alleging that the young pair were attacked because they were wearing Palin pins .
That is an allegation .
It is not a fact .
And I am not part of some nefarious MSM / LSM cover - up or anti-Palin conspiracy just because I ’m not hysterically “ shouting from the rooftops about this assault . ”
No one needs to remind me about the Left ’s propensity for violence .
But it looks like many of my readers need to be reminded of the dangers of recklessly jumping to conclusions before all the facts are in .
Something awful happened to Bautsch and her boyfriend .
Right now , they deserve prayers and well wishes — not a hysterical political circus — while the police investigation continues .
***
From Gov. Jindal ’s office , via The Baton Rouge Advocate :
“ While there were protestors around at that time , we are not aware of any evidence that the individuals involved in the altercation were protestors , ” Plotkin said in a statement .
Plotkin said the New Orleans Police Department is investigating .
“ We are refraining from further comment to allow them to fully investigate and ensure justice is done , ” [ Jindal press secretary Kyle ] Plotkin said .
Update 3:15 pm Eastern : I just heard from Mr. Plotkin that Bautsch and her boyfriend were NOT wearing Palin pins .
Allahpundit : “ What happened to Bautsch and her guy is no hoax — one of them has a broken leg , the other had a concussion and fractures to the nose and jaw — but whether there was politics involved or whether it was an old - fashioned New Orleans brawl remains to be seen …
Exit question :
If it turns out there was a political element to the beating , can we blame the NYT op - ed page for fostering a ‘ climate of hate ’ against conservatives ?
( Exit answer : Yes ! ) ”

Poison As Food , Poison As Antidote
[ 28 August 2008 ]
Those who see government power and corporate power as being in conflict , and those who seem them as being in cahoots , each have a point .
The alliance between government and the corporate elite is like the partnership between church and state in the Middle Ages : each one wants to be the dominant partner , so there s naturally some pushing and shoving from time to time ; but on the other hand the two parties have a common interest in holding down the rest of us , and so the conflict rarely goes too far .
The main difference between left - wing  and right - wing versions of statism , as I see it , is that the former generally seek to shift the balance a bit farther in favour of the state ( i.e. , toward state - socialism ) while the latter generally seek to shift the balance a bit farther in favour of corporatism and plutocracy .
( In the U.S. , the reigning versions of liberalism and conservatism are arguably both more corporatist than state - socialist ; but the liberals are still a few notches farther toward state - socialism than the conservatives are . )
But whether the special interests who are the primary beneficiaries of state power are mainly within the state apparatus or mainly outside it , the actual application of state power remains much the same .
Hence it is a mistake to suppose that the corporatist - plutocratic version of statism is in any interesting sense less statist than the state - socialist version .
But it is an all - too - common mistake  and this tendency to underestimate the chasm between free markets and corporatism is enormously beneficial to the state , enabling a slick bait - and - switch .
When free markets and government grants of privilege to business are conflated , those who are attracted to free markets are easily duped into supporting plutocracy , thus swelling the ranks of statisms right wing  while those who are turned off by plutocracy are likewise easily duped into opposing free markets , thereby swelling the ranks of statisms left wing .
( These are the two tendencies that Kevin Carson calls vulgar libertarianism  and vulgar liberalism ,  respectively . )
As one of the villains in The Fountainhead explains in a moment of frankness , talking about the choice Europe was then facing between communism and fascism :
 If you re sick of one version , we push you in the other .
Weve fixed the coin .
Heads  collectivism .
Tails  collectivism .
Give up your soul to a council  or give it up to a leader .
But give it up , give it up , give it up .
Offer poison as food and poison as antidote .
Go fancy on the trimmings , but hang on to the main objective .
The largely ( though not completely ) illusory conflict between state - oriented Palpatine and corporate - oriented Dooku in the Star Wars prequels is a nice dramatisation of the same principle .
This dynamic applies in particular to the debate over health care policy .
The contrast between , say , the Canadian and American approaches is frequently described  by both sides  as a contrast between a governmental  or socialised  system on the one hand , and a market - based  or free enterprise system on the other .
But the American health care system bears little resemblance to a free market ; instead it represents massive government intervention on behalf of private special interests , from insurance companies to the medical establishment .
The choice between the American and Canadian models is simply a choice between different two different flavours of statism  each with somewhat different vices , its true ( e.g. , do you prefer higher prices or longer waits ? ) , but ultimately coming down to a matter of the percentage to which control of your healthcare is exercised by people sitting in government offices as opposed to being exercised by people sitting in governmentally - privileged private offices  but in either case by ambitious , avaricious apparatchiks who arent you .
So what would a libertarian approach to health care policy look like ?
At a minimum it would have to include :
1. Repealing laws that have the effect of cartelising the medical industry ( e.g. , the licensure monopoly granted to the A.M.A. ) , thus artificially boosting the cost of medical care .
2 . Repealing laws that have the effect of rendering the labour market oligopsonistic , thus artificially lowering peoples ability to pay for ( and collectively negotiate for ) medical care .
3 . Repealing laws that shift healthcare funds from the 25 % - devoured - by - overhead voluntary sector to the 75 % - devoured - by - overhead coercive sector , thus decreasing the amount of healthcare that gets to needy recipients .
4 . Repealing laws that transfer the power to make medical decisions for individuals from those individuals to centralised bodies , thus increasing the impact and scope of fatally bad decisions and suppressing the competitive signals that allow the identification of better and worse policies .
5 . Repealing laws that wiped out the old mutual - insurance systems ( basically HMOs run by the patients instead of by corporations ) and empowered insurance companies at the expense of patients .
6 . Repealing laws that suppress innovation and distribution in the pharmaceutical industry in the name of intellectual property .
Until the unlikely day when the Republican Party embraces this program , lets hear no more of their favouring a free - market approach to health care .
Chomskys Augustinian Anarchism
[ 4 September 2008 ]
Noam Chomsky is perhaps the United States best - known anarchist .
Theres a certain irony to this , however ; for just as St. Augustine once prayed ,  Grant me chastity and continence , but not yet ,  Chomskys aim is in effect anarchy , but not yet .
Chomskys reason for the not yet is that a powerful central government is currently necessary as a bulwark against the power of the corporate elite ; thus it will not be safe to abolish or even scale back the state until we first use the state to break the power of the corporate elite :
In the long term , I think the centralized political power ought to be eliminated and dissolved and turned down ultimately to the local level , finally , with federalism and associations and so on .
On the other hand , right now , Id like to strengthen the federal government .
The reason is , we live in this world , not some other world .
And in this world there happen to be huge concentrations of private power that are as close to tyranny and as close to totalitarian as anything humans have devised .
Theres only one way of defending rights that have been attained , or of extending their scope in the face of these private powers , and thats to maintain the one form of illegitimate power that happens to be somewhat responsible to the public and which the public can indeed influence .
( You Say You Want a Devolution )
Now Chomskys notion of the state as a crucial bulwark against concentrations of private power might initially seem puzzling , given that  as Chomskys own research has confirmed time and again  the state has historically been the chief enabler of such concentrations .
But what Chomsky seems to mean is not so much that it generally acts as a bulwark now , but rather that it can be made to do so ; if you re facing a much stronger opponent ( private power ) who also has a sword ( government power ) , you re better off trying to grab the sword and use it against him than you would be simply destroying the sword .
The government is far from benign  that s true .
On the other hand , its at least partially accountable , and it can become as benign as we make it .
What s not benign ( what s extremely harmful , in fact ) is something you didnt mention  business power , which is highly concentrated and , by now , largely transnational .
Business power is very far from benign and its completely unaccountable .
It s a totalitarian system that has an enormous effect on our lives .
It s also the main reason why the government is nt benign .
( On Gun Control )
There are two assumptions here with which I want to take issue .
First , Chomsky assumes that the influence of private business on government is  the main reason why the government is nt benign . 
Why on earth does he believe this ?
Monopoly power tends to invite abuse , whether those who direct that power are mostly within or mostly outside the state apparatus .
If Chomsky thinks government would be so harmless without evil capitalists pulling the strings , why does he want to abolish it even in the long run ?
Second , Chomsky assumes that state power is partially accountable  while business power is completely unaccountable .
Now to begin with , I m not sure whether the accountability of state power is here being contrasted with that of actually existing , state - enabled business power or instead with the accountability of business power as it would be without governmental support .
But if its the former , then the contrast , even if correct , would provide no grounds for resisting the states abolition ; the fact that X + Y is more dangerous than X by itself is not a good reason to defend X .
The contrast is relevant to a defense of the state only if business , without state support , would still be less accountable than the state .
And here it seems obvious that the state  even a democratic state  is far less accountable than genuinely private business .
After all , a business can get your labour and / or possessions only if you agree to hand them over , while a government can extract these by force .
Of course you can try to vote your current representatives out of office , but only at multiple - year intervals , and only if you convince 51 % of your neighbours to do likewise ; whereas you can terminate your relationship with a business at any time , and without getting others to go along .
Moreover , each candidate offers a package - deal of policies , whereas with private enterprise I can choose , say , Grocery As vegetables and Grocery Bs meats .
David Friedman illuminates the contrast :
When a consumer buys a product on the market , he can compare alternative brands .
...
When you elect a politician , you buy nothing but promises .
...
You can compare 1968 Fords , Chryslers , and Volkswagens , but nobody will ever be able to compare the Nixon administration of 1968 with the Humphrey and Wallace administrations of the same year .
It is as if we had only Fords from 1920 to 1928 , Chryslers from 1928 to 1936 , and then had to decide what firm would make a better car for the next four years ....
Not only does a consumer have better information than a voter , it is of more use to him .
If I investigate alternative brands of cars .... decide which is best for me , and buy it , I get it .
If I investigate alternative politicians and vote accordingly , I get what the majority votes for .
...
Imagine buying cars the way we buy governments .
Ten thousand people would get together and agree to vote , each for the car he preferred .
Whichever car won , each of the ten thousand would have to buy it .
It would not pay any of us to make any serious effort to find out which car was best ; whatever I decide , my car is being picked for me by the other members of the group .
...
This is how I must buy products on the political marketplace .
I not only cannot compare the alternative products , it would not be worth my while to do so even if I could .
( The Machinery of Freedom )
The accountability  provided by democratic government seems laughable by comparison with the accountability provided by the market .
The chief function of the ballot , it would seem , is to make the populace more tractable by convincing them they re somehow in charge .
None of this should be news to Chomsky , who after all has himself pointed out :
As things now stand , the electoral process is a matter of the population being permitted every once in a while to choose among virtually identical representatives of business power .
That s better than having a dictator , but its a very limited form of democracy .
Most of the population realizes that and doesnt even participate .
...
And of course elections are almost completely purchased .
In the last congressional elections , 95 percent of the victors in the election outspent their opponents , and campaigns were overwhelmingly funded by corporations .
( Chomskys Other Revolution )
Well , yes , exactly .
So what is the basis of Chomskys faith in the democratic state ?
Chomsky might object that my defense of market accountability ignores the fact that such accountability  involves voting with dollars , so that the wealthy have more votes than the poor  whereas in a democratic state everyone has an equal vote .
But even if we leave aside the causal dependence of existing disparities of wealth on systematic state intervention  as well as the fact that government , by controlling the direction of resources it does not own , magnifies the power of the wealthy  it still remains the case that however few dollars one may have , when one votes with those dollars one gets something back , whereas when one votes with ballots one gets back nothing one was aiming for unless one happens to be voting with the majority .
Which is less democratic  a system in which the effectiveness of ones vote varies with ones resources , or one in which 49 % of the population has no effective vote at all ?
Chomsky is hardly unaware that what he calls business power depends crucially on government intervention  since he has done as much as anyone to document this relationship .
As he notes :
Any form of concentrated power , whatever it is , is not going to want to be subjected to popular democratic control or , for that matter , to market discipline .
Powerful sectors , including corporate wealth , are naturally opposed to functioning democracy , just as they re opposed to functioning markets , for themselves , at least .
( Reflections on Democracy ; emphasis added )
So if the corporate elite are so terrified of the free market , why is Chomsky so reluctant to hurl them into it ?
Perhaps Chomskys view is that although government is needed to create these concentrations of private power , its not needed to maintain them , so just suppressing the state at this point in the game would leave business power intact .
That s not a crazy view , but it needs argument .
After all , systematic government intervention on behalf of big business is nt just something that happened back in the Gilded Age or the Progressive Era or the New Deal ; it continues , massively and unceasingly .
I wouldnt claim ( indeed Ive denied ) that private power depends solely and uniquely on state support ; but its hard to believe that all that state support is simply superfluous , as it must be if removing such state support wouldnt appreciably weaken businesss power .
Chomsky has said ( in Answers to Eight Questions on Anarchism ) that although he finds himself in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho - capitalists on a whole range of issues ,  and also admire [s ] their commitment to rationality ,  he nevertheless regards the free - market version of anarchism as a doctrinal system which , if ever implemented , would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history .
Why ?
Because  the idea of free contract between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick joke . 
But this argument is blatantly question - begging .
Chomsky is assuming the very point thats in dispute  namely that without government intervention on behalf of the rich , the economy would be divided into potentates  and starving subjects .
Now its true that market anarchists ( for reasons explained elsewhere , I prefer to avoid the term  anarcho - capitalist ) themselves have sometimes  mistakenly , in my view  described their ideal economy as looking very much like the distribution of wealth and labour roles in our present economy , only minus the state .
But why should Chomsky take their word for it ?
If the state really is intervening massively and systematically on behalf of the potentate and against the starving subject  as Chomsky must admit that it is , since his research explicitly demonstrates just this  why on earth would he expect that power imbalance to remain unchanged once that intervention ceases ?
Not only does Chomsky underestimate the resources of anarchy , but he also appears to overestimate the serviceability of the state .
He writes as if , even though the state is doing lots of bad stuff now , this could all be changed if more people would vote correctly .
Now it s true enough that people voting differently can make a difference to just how bad the government is .
( If enough Germans had voted differently in 1932 , they could have gotten a less awful regime . )
Still , at the end of the day , what s wrong with a coercive monopoly is not that the wrong people are running it , but rather that  leaving aside its inherent injustice  such a monopoly brings with it incentival and informational perversities which there is no way to avoid ( except by removing the source of the problem , the monopoly , in which case what you have is no longer a state ) .
The Real Meaning of 9/11
[ 11 September 2008 ]
I first began blogging on the first anniversary of 9/11 , and over the succeeding years Ive blogged a fair bit about 9/11  how it shows both the power and the impotence of the state ; how it feeds the Higgs cycle of ratcheting intervention ; how the pre-9/11 mindset is the only realistic one ; how it illustrates Aristotles superiority to both Seneca and D. H. Lawrence ; and how both the 9/11 conspiracy theorists and their critics are confused .
On this latest anniversary I want to talk about how the state breeds war  both in the sense of provoking attacks like 9/11 , and in the sense of generating its own misguided responses , like the Iraq war .
Governments engage in war so frequently that people forget to be puzzled at the phenomenon .
Yet , given reputation effects , the choice of violence over cooperation tends to be a costly one , as even so pessimistic a thinker as Hobbes acknowledges :
He therefore that breaketh his covenant , and consequently declareth that he thinks he may with reason do so , cannot be received into any society , that unite themselves for peace and defence , but by the error of them that receive him ; nor when he is received , be retained in it , without seeing the danger of their error ; which errors a man cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security : and therefore if he be left , or cast out of society , he perisheth ; and if he live in society , it is by the errors of other men , which he could not foresee , nor reckon upon ; and consequently against the reason of his preservation ; and so , as all men that contribute not to his destruction , forbear him only out of ignorance of what is good for themselves .
If cooperation tends to be a stable equilibrium , why is interstate conflict so frequent ?
The answer , I suggest , is that the nature of the state ordinarily allows it to reap the benefits of warfare while socialising the costs .
Since the state acquires its war revenues by compulsion ( via taxation ) , and its soldiers too ( via indentured - servitude contracts at best and conscription at worst ) , while the electoral means for providing negative feedback are too occasional and indiscriminate to be terribly effective , the state is able to shift the costs of war onto its own populace .
( Thus Bentham well described war as a crime committed by the ruling few in the conquering nation , on the subject many in both nations . )
Wars are expensive , both in blood and in treasure ; if the taxpayers who provide the treasure were free to choose which governmental functions to fund ( as the customers of other service providers are , and as taxpayers have been in stateless or semi-stateless societies )  and if the soldiers who provide the blood had the same freedom to quit their jobs as other employees do  such socialisation of costs would be much harder to pull off ; but as things stand , those who bears the costs have no right of exit .
The benefits of war to the state , on the other hand , are usually enormous , even if it doesnt win ( so long as it is not actually conquered ) , inasmuch as wars and other national emergencies give it an excuse to expand its powers  expansions that , ratchet - like , rarely fall back to their original levels after the crisis has passed .
Not for nothing did Randolph Bourne declare war  the health of the state . 
Moreover , given its access to the means of education and propaganda , the state can convince its populace that they too benefit from the war ; witness the widespread belief in the U.S. that World War II helped the economy , despite all evidence to the contrary .
This isnt to say that nonstate actors never choose violent conflict ; of course they do .
Particularly in societies with macho mores , cultural factors that push toward violence can often prevail against the economic incentives that push toward peace .
In stateless and semi-stateless societies , however , at least the economic incentives push away from war ( whether they prevail or not ) , rather than toward it as they do under states ; and in time such incentives can actually overcome the macho mores .
As evidence , consider medieval Iceland and pre-Norman England , societies that began in cultural conditions that one might expect to be maximally uncongenial to peace , given the strong social support for a code of honour that included the obligation to participate in bloodfeud ; yet the institution of composition or wergild ( requiring the payment of hefty compensation to the victims family ) succeeded in undermining those mores , as the high monetary cost of restitution deterred homicide , while the tempting financial bonanza of accepting the restitution rather than pursuing vendetta gradually wore away the honour - based incentives that had sustained the bloodfeud .
More recently , Somalia during its stateless period has achieved a lower level of violence than either its ( economically and culturally comparable ) state - ridden neighbours or its former state - ridden self .
Theres a great scene in the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles when an African chief , hearing about the death toll of World War I , asks Indy how the European powers can possibly afford such a war  how can they afford to pay the massive restitution for all the thousands killed ?
Indy is shocked at the notion of restitution : is this chief so primitive that he actually puts a monetary price on human life ?
Indys mentor ( implausibly , Albert Schweitzer ) responds that its better than not valuing it at all .
The 9/11 attacks were a textbook example of the warfare state in operation .
As with Pearl Harbor six decades earlier , the U.S. governments arrogant interventions around the world had made such an attack a virtual inevitability .
( For every jihadi who joins the fight against the U.S. because  they hate our freedom ,  a hundred join because  they hate our bombs .)
And of course the primary victims of the blowback from such interventions are the innocent victims of terrorist reprisals .
( 9/11 was relatively unusual in that the state establishment got hit as well ; yet even so , the political class as a whole clearly benefited on balance through its expanded powers . )
Even leaving aside both moral considerations and the risk of blowback , the U.S. governments interventions all around the world are bloody expensive ; if you saw such costs itemised in a monthly bill , youd quickly cancel the premium service and stick with the basic .
If taxpayers had a choice about whether to fund military interventions , with the decision to go to war impacting the pocketbooks of the decisionmakers , those interventions wouldnt happen  and so blowback like 9/11 would be prevented as well .
And when the state responds to such attacks with a vaguely related war in Iraq , one that lasts far longer than the taxpayers  enthusiasm for it , that too is made possible by effective lack of exit ( as is its avoidance of mass customer defections in the wake of the phantom - WMD scandal ) .
As for the Iraqi civil war that the U.S. invasion sparked off , we can thank the institution of the state for that one too , since the chief factor that drives such conflict is the expectation that there will arise , or will continue to be , a state apparatus , and the corresponding fear that someone elses gang will end up in charge of it .
Getting better candidates into power instead of worse ones isnt completely hopeless as a strategy for furthering peace ; but its a band - aid at best .
It s a bit like kicking out James II and putting in William of Orange  it focuses on changing the personnel when what really needs changing is the system .
As long as our political institutions have a captive customer base and can acquire resources and labour by compulsion , they will be able to socialise the costs of going to war while reaping the benefits ; and so long as this is so , the choice to engage in violence will be less costly to them than it would be to an honest enterprise  and when the states costs of violence are lowered , the state will sooner or later buy more violence , be its president an Obama or a McCain .
Those Who Control the Past Control the Future
[ 18 September 2008 ]
Theres a popular historical legend that goes like this :
Once upon a time ( for this is how stories of this kind should begin ) , back in the 19th century , the United States economy was almost completely unregulated and laissez - faire .
But then there arose a movement to subject business to regulatory restraint in the interests of workers and consumers , a movement that culminated in the presidencies of Wilson and the two Roosevelts .
This story comes in both left - wing and right - wing versions , depending on whether the government is seen as heroically rescuing the poor and weak from the rapacious clutches of unrestrained corporate power , or as unfairly imposing burdensome socialistic fetters on peaceful and productive enterprise .
But both versions agree on the central narrative : a century of laissez - faire , followed by a flurry of anti-business legislation .
Every part of this story is false .
To begin with , there never was anything remotely like a period of laissez - faire in American history ( at least not if laissez - faire means let the market operate freely  as opposed to let the rich and powerful help themselves to other peoples property  ) .
The regulatory state was deeply involved from the start , particularly in the banking and currency industries and in the assignment of property titles to land .
( Even such land as was not stolen from the natives was seldom appropriated in accordance with any sort of Lockean homesteading principle ; instead , vast tracts of unimproved land were simply declared property by barbed wire or legislative fiat . )
The early republics two major political factions  to oversimplify a bit , call them the Jeffersonians ( as represented by the Democrats ) and the Hamiltonians ( as represented successively by the Federalists , Whigs , and Republicans )  disagreed primarily about which forms of governmental interference to emphasise .
To be sure , both side paid lip service ( and sometimes more than lip service ) to the  Principles of  76 ,  i.e. , the libertarian ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence ; but each side quickly deviated from those principles when doing so served its economic interest .
The Hamiltonians , whose chief base of support was in the urban financial centers of the northeast , called for mercantilist interventions such as subsidies , protectionist tariffs , and central banks ; the Jeffersonians , whose chief base of support was rural , including the plantations and the frontier , called for state assistance in extracting labour from slaves and land from Native Americans .
In each case the state ran roughshod over laissez - faire in the interests of a privileged elite .
To be sure , the Hamiltonians sometimes offered up good libertarian - sounding defenses of the rights of blacks and Indians , while the Jeffersonians offered up equally libertarian - sounding condemnations of mercantile privilege ; but its relatively costless to take a stand against those violations of liberty of which your political opponents , rather than yourselves , are the primary beneficiaries .
But while 19th - century America was no free market , it was still too free - market for the corporate elite , who accordingly campaigned for government relief against cut - throat competition . 
As Adam Smith famously pointed out ,  People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices ; hence the perpetual mercantile quest for monopoly privilege .
One especially useful service that the state can render the corporate elite is cartel enforcement .
Price - fixing agreements are unstable on a free market , since while all parties to the agreement have a collective interest in seeing the agreement generally hold , each has an individual interest in breaking the agreement by underselling the other parties in order to win away their customers ; and even if the cartel manages to maintain discipline over its own membership , the oligopolistic prices tend to attract new competitors into the market .
Hence the advantage to business of state - enforced cartelisation .
Often this is done directly , but there are indirect ways too , such as imposing uniform quality standards that relieve firms from having to compete in quality .
( And when the quality standards are high , lower - quality but cheaper competitors are priced out of the market . )
The ability of colossal firms to exploit economies of scale is also limited in a free market , since beyond a certain point the benefits of size ( e.g. , reduced transaction costs ) get outweighed by diseconomies of scale ( e.g. , calculational chaos stemming from absence of price feedback )  unless the state enables them to socialise these costs by immunising them from competition  e.g. , by imposing fees , licensure requirements , capitalisation requirements , and other regulatory burdens that disproportionately impact newer , poorer entrants as opposed to richer , more established firms .
The vast regulatory apparatus that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was thus specifically campaigned for by the business community .
( This is documented for the  Progressive era by James Weinsteins Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State , Gabriel Kolkos Railroads and Regulation and Triumph of Conservatism , and Murray Rothbard and Ronald Radoshs New History of Leviathan ; their findings are usefully summarised in Roy Childs  article  Big Business and the Rise of American Statism . 
Butler Shaffers
In Restraint of Trade extends the analysis through the New Deal . )
The supposedly pro-labour legislation that emerged from this area was also mostly bogus , a matter of co-opting labour leaders into a junior partnership with government and business in exchange for not rocking the boat .
That this should be so is not terribly surprising ; wealthy , concentrated interests are inevitably going to have a greater impact on the political process than poorer and more dispersed ones .
( Contrary to popular wisdom , which has the contrast going the other way , it is only on the market , where the price system aggregates the preferences of the poorer and more dispersed , that the latter can systematically trounce the influence of business power . )
What is more surprising is that such blatantly and thoroughgoingly pro-business legislation should have been perceived as anti-business .
But in the end this is not really all that surprising either .
Of course these pro-business reforms  had to be packaged as anti-business in order for the politicians and their corporate cronies to get away with them .
Moreover , many of the instigators appear to have sincerely believed , on ideological grounds , that control of the economy by a government - business partnership was in the best interests of the general populace ; and thanks to such partnerships  disproportionate control of the means of information ( media and public education ) , the rest of society could be brought to take a similar view .
In addition , because business and government each always want to be the dominant partner , there was inevitably some grumbling in the business community about the precise way in which , for example , FDR advanced their shared corporatist agenda , and this likewise contributed to the misperception of fundamental antagonism .
But the historical research cited above indicates that big business has been the chief architect and cheerleader for the regulations that are supposedly designed to restrain its power .
Liberals who advocate further such regulations in order to combat plutocracy , and libertarians who leap to the defense of the poor embattled corporation , are equally misguided .
History of an Idea
Or , How An Argument Against the Workability of Authoritarian Socialism
Became An Argument Against the Workability of Authoritarian Capitalism
[ 2 October 2008 ]
In 1920 , Ludwig von Mises published an argument against the workability of socialism  ( by which he meant state ownership of the means of production ) , an argument subsequently elaborated by himself and his student Friedrich Hayek .
The idea in a nutshell : the value of a producers  good depends on the value of the consumers  goods to which it contributes .
Hence in deciding among alternative production methods , the most efficient choice is the one that economises on those producers  goods that are needed for the most highly valued consumers goods .
But theres a difference between technical efficiency and economic efficiency .
( The following way of explaining the difference is indebted to David Ramsay Steeles From Marx to Mises . )
Suppose were comparing two ways of making widgets ; method A uses three grams of rubber per widget produced while method B uses four grams of rubber per widget produced ( with everything else being the same ) .
In that case method A is clearly more efficient than method B ; that s a case of technical efficiency , because we can figure out which is more efficient just by looking at quantities expended without concerning ourselves with any economic concepts like demand .
But now compare method C , which uses three grams of rubber and four grams of steel per widget , with method D , which uses four grams of rubber and three of steel ( with all else remaining the same ) .
In this case neither C nor D is more technically efficient than the other .
To figure out which is more economically efficient , we have to figure out the comparative value of rubber vs. steel  i.e. , which forgoes a more highly demanded alternative use , a gram of steel or a gram of rubber ?
As per Mises and Hayek , that s something theres no clear way to figure out except through market competition and a price system , whereby consumer valuations of first - order goods get translated , by means of prices , into varying demand for their factors of production ( as reflected in , say , a higher price for steel than for rubber , thus prompting producers to economise on steel ) .
State ownership of the means of production means no market in , and thus no prices for , producers  goods , and so no way to transmit this information .
But why couldnt a state - socialist central planner have access to this information ?
Well , first , most of the relevant information about preferences is local , inarticulate , and constantly changing ; it can be expressed through the actual consumer choices that embody it , but theres no easy way to collect it otherwise .
( This is the aspect of the problem stressed by Hayek  who also included other kinds of local , inarticulate , and constantly changing information  besides that concerning preferences  in his focus . )
Second , even if you could get this information , it would all be in the form of ordinal rankings , and without translation into cardinal prices theres no way to combine the ordinal rankings of different people .
( This is the aspect of the problem stressed by Mises . )
Finally , even if you could get the information into cardinal form , in order to use it to plan the economy youd have to solve millions of simultaneous equations at rapid speed .
( Critics of Mises and Hayek often write as though this third problem is supposed to be the main problem  and thus have supposed , for example , that fast enough computers could substitute for the price system  but from the Mises - Hayek perspective its a relatively minor afterthought . )
If central planning is as hopeless an endeavour as the calculation argument claims , then why havent state - socialist regimes like the Soviet Union been even less successful than their actual record ( which , while lousy , was not as completely chaotic as one might expect the Mises - Hayek argument to imply ) ?
The reply is that the Soviet state , like similar regimes , was never completely insulated from the price system , since it had access to international prices ( to say nothing of its own internal black market ) .
Hence the information transmission mechanism , while seriously hampered , was able to function to some extent .
( Most forms of governmental intervention merely distort the price system rather than suppressing it entirely .
Of course the effects of these distortions can be serious enough  as when , per the Austrian theory of the business cycle , state manipulation of the money supply artificially lowers interest rates , sending investors the signal that consumers are more willing to defer consumption than they actually are , thereby directing resources into longer - term projects ( boom ! ) that prove unsustainable ( bust ! ) , as in 1929  or 2008 .
But the application of Austrian price theory to the current financial crisis is a story for my next post . )
The Mises - Hayek account of the limits of state centralisation was subsequently extended , by Misess student Murray Rothbard , to cover the limits of private cartelisation as well .
In his 1962 work Man , Economy , and State ( see especially here and here ) :
In order to calculate the profits and losses of each branch , a firm must be able to refer its internal operations to external markets for each of the various factors and intermediate products .
When any of these external markets disappears , because all are absorbed within the province of a single firm , calculability disappears , and there is no way for the firm rationally to allocate factors to that specific area .
The more these limits are encroached upon , the greater and greater will be the sphere of irrationality , and the more difficult it will be to avoid losses .
... [ I ] f there were no market for a product , and all of its exchanges were internal , there would be no way for a firm or for anyone else to determine a price for the good .
A firm can estimate an implicit price when an external market exists ; but when a market is absent , the good can have no price , whether implicit or explicit .
Any figure could be only an arbitrary symbol .
Not being able to calculate a price , the firm could not rationally allocate factors and resources from one stage to another .
...
For every capital good , there must be a definite market in which firms buy and sell that good .
It is obvious that this economic law sets a definite maximum to the relative size of any particular firm on the free market .
Because of this law , firms cannot merge or cartelize for complete vertical integration of stages or products .
Because of this law , there can never be One Big Cartel over the whole economy or mergers until One Big Firm owns all the productive assets in the economy .
The force of this law multiplies as the area of the economy increases and as islands of noncalculable chaos swell to the proportions of masses and continents .
As the area of incalculability increases , the degrees of irrationality , misallocation , loss , impoverishment , etc. , become greater .
Under one owner or one cartel for the whole productive system , there would be no possible areas of calculation at all , and therefore complete economic chaos would prevail .
Everyone knows about economies of scale ; after all , thats why we have firms in the first place .
What Rothbards analysis shows is that there are also diseconomies of scale , and that these grow more severe as vertical integration increases .
What happens when a firm grows so large , its internal operations so insulated from the price system , that the diseconomies of scale begin to outweigh the economies ?
Well , that depends on the institutional context .
In a free market , if the firm doesnt catch wise and start scaling back , it will grow increasingly inefficient and so will lose customers to competitors ; markets thus serve as an automatic check on the size of the firm .
But what if friendly politicians rig the game so that favoured companies can reap the benefits associated with economies of scale while socialising the costs associated with diseconomies of scale ?
Then we might just possibly end up with an economy dominated by those bloated , bureaucratic , hierarchical corporate behemoths we all know and love .
( For some of the ways that state intervention contributes to the Dilbertesque nature of todays business world , see Kevin Carsons article  Economic Calculation in the Corporate Commonwealth  and for more detail , his online books Studies in Mutualist Political Economy and the still - in - progress [ as of that writing ] Studies in the Anarchist Theory of Organizational Behavior . )
The good news , then , is that the unlovely features of the economy that often get blamed on the free market ( or on something called capitalism ,  which means either the free market , or plutocracy , or somehow magically both ) are in fact the product of government intervention .
We can embrace the free market without embracing big business .
But its not just opponents of the free market that get markets and business interests mixed up .
All too many libertarians still rush to defend giant corporations like Microsoft and Wal - Mart ( two firms whose whole business model in fact depends heavily on government intervention  via , e.g. , IP protectionism for Microsoft , eminent domain plus socialised transportation costs for Wal - Mart , and general suppression of competition from the less affluent for both ) as though such a defense were part and parcel of a commitment to markets .
As libertarians we can hardly complain when were accused of being apologists for corporate plutocracy , so long as were actually contributing to that perception ourselves by allowing ourselves to lose track of the basic facts about the price system that we of all people should remember .
So long as the confusion between free markets and plutocracy persists  so long as libertarians allow their laudable attraction to free markets to fool them into defending plutocracy , and so long as those on the left allow their laudable opposition to plutocracy to fool them into opposing free markets  neither libertarians nor the left will achieve their goals , and the state - corporate partnership will continue to dominate the political scene .
That s why we need a left - libertarian alliance .
Next time : how government caused the current financial crisis and why government cannot cure it .
Comment from Kevin Carson , 3 October 2008 , 12:49 a.m. Brilliant again , Roderick !
And thanks for the links .
As I argue in the article you link , I think Rothbards application of the calculation argument to the corporation was extremely conservative .
For one thing , he seemed to assume that , even under state capitalism , getting too big and integrated to have access to outside market data for ones inputs was  if not an entirely theoretical possibility  at most a problem for a few outlying firms .
I think he neglected the question of how many intermediate goods involved in creating complex manufactured goods are product - specific , and thus have no reference to an outside market for pricing .
Back in the 50s , an article on transfer pricing ( whose author I m too lazy to look up ) presented data that the vast majority of intermediate goods in the auto industry were product - specific rather than generic , and that transfer prices were estimated on a cost - plus basis from the lowest - order component goods for which a price existed in the outside market .
If the link to outside prices were too tenuous , some advocates of market - based management  propose simply setting transfer prices by trial and error , and then adjusting them in response to experience  IOW , exactly what Lange proposed and Mises scoffed at .
If Rothbards stated standard is applied , then most large manufacturing corporations are islands of calculational chaos , or have at best extremely indirect recourse to market data for most of their intermediate goods .
In addition , Rothbard believed it didnt matter that much whether the outside market prices reflected spot conditions of supply and demand different from those prevailing inside the firm .
The fact that prices existed at all was sufficient ; they didnt have to be very thick in the information they conveyed .
But this situation is directly analogous to the state socialist expedient Mises discussed , of recourse to the market prices in some other country .
If GM can operate just fine based on imperfectly relevant outside prices , then the USSR ought to have operated just fine based on American prices .
But somehow I dont think Mises would have been willing to concede that such far - removed prices were good enough .
Comment from Kevin Carson , 3 October 2008 , 1:21 a.m. P.S. Your observation about government insulating corporations from the competitive ill effects of diseconomies of scale suggests the answer to Stephan Kinsellas earlier question  i.e. , how large corporations are able to function , if they are de facto branches of the state , without being crippled by calculational chaos .
The answer , of source , is that being crippled is relative .
The old economy of the USSR was able to function , in the sense that it created use - value .
State industry manufactured refrigerators , tractors , etc. , and people bought them ( or at least a considerable portion of them ) because they were , after all , better than nothing .
They cooled food , or hauled farm machinery , after a fashion .
The problem is that nobody knew if they were the best possible use of the inputs that were consumed creating them , or even if they were a net loss of value compared to the resources used up to make them .
The large corporation , similarly , allocates capital to different more or less productive activities , and designed products that are consumed because they re better than nothing .
But the corporation has little idea whether the allocation of capital was to its most efficient use , or whether the product design was the best use of available resources .
The prices of its production inputs are heavily distorted by subsidies , and likewise the prices of its products , its internal pricing system is at best tangentially related to any outside market , the skimming off of capital to support management self - dealing and consumption on the job is a feature of corporate life shared by all the major firms in the industry and therefore carries no competitive penalty , and the ability to enter the market and offer competing products is severely constrained .
In short , like the Soviet economy ( if to a lesser degree ) , the American corporate economy works better than nothing , but we have no way of knowing just how badly it functions compared to a free market .
Regulation : The Cause , Not the Cure , of the Financial Crisis
[ 9 October 2008 ]
In my previous post I explained how Austrian price theory renders both state - socialist central planning and free - market plutocracy unworkable ; in the present post , I explain how Austrian price theory applies to boom - bust cycles in general and the present financial crisis in particular , and why those who blame the crisis on the free market have things precisely backward .
Recall that market prices are the mechanism that allows consumer rankings of consumption goods to determine choices among production goods ; if consumers rank goods made from steel higher than goods made from rubber , steel prices will rise relative to those of rubber , thus encouraging economising of existing steel and increased production of new steel .
( This is incidentally why anti-gouging laws are such a bad idea ; they prolong the very shortages whose effects they re trying to mitigate , by suppressing the price signals that function to end the shortage .
When prices are legally prevented from rising during a shortage , that s like sending out a signal into the market saying hey everybody , no shortage here , no reason to economise on this item , no reason to increase production of this item , feel free to focus your investment elsewhere   which is obviously the worst possible message to send . )
Interest rates are a kind of price also ; they signal the extent to which consumers are willing and able to defer present satisfactions for the sake of greater future satisfactions .
To take the standard example , if Crusoe makes a net hell be able to catch far more fish than he can with his hands , but time making the net takes away from time catching fish ; if Crusoe can afford to defer some present fish - catching in order to make the net , then its rational for him to make it , but if instead hes on the edge of starvation and might not be able to survive on reduced rations long enough to finish the net , hed better stick to catching fish with his hands for the moment and save the net project for another day .
Whether it makes sense for him to divert time and effort from fish - catching to net - making thus depends on how urgently he needs fish now  in short , on his time - preference .
In a free market , low interest rates signal low time - preference and high interest rates , high time - preference .
If your time - preference ( i.e. the urgency of your preference for present over future satisfactions ) is low , then I would only have to offer you slightly more than X a year from now in order to induce you to part with X today ; if it is high , then I would have to offer you a lot more than X a year from now in exchange for X today .
The prevailing interest rate thus guides investors in their choice between short - term , less productive projects and those that are more productive but whose benefits will take longer to achieve .
But when central banks , through their manipulation of the money supply , artificially lower the interest rate , then the signals get distorted ; investors are led to act as though consumers have a lower time - preference than they actually do .
Thus investors are led to invest in longer - term projects that are unsustainable , since the deferred consumption on which such projects depend is not actually going to get deferred , so that the goods that the investors are counting on in order to complete their long - term projects are not all going to be there when the investors need them .
Such unsustainable investment is the boom or bubble ; the bust comes when the unsustainability is recognised and a costly process of liquidation ensues .
The Austrian theory of the business cycle is sometimes called an over - investment  theory , but that s misleading .
The problem is not that investors over - invest across the board , but that they over - invest in higher - yield longer - term projects and under - invest in lower - yield shorter - term .
That s why Austrians talk about malinvestment rather than over - investment .
The prevailing mainstream tendency to treat capital as homogeneous ignores the difference between higher and lower levels of production goods and thus fails to appreciate the costs of having to switch from the high to the low when the bubble bursts .
In additional to the general misallocation of investment between lower - order and higher - order inputs , monetary inflation produces further imbalances .
When the central bank creates money , the new money doesnt propagate throughout the economy instantaneously ; some sectors get the new money first , while they re still facing the old , lower prices , while other sectors get the new money last , after theyve already begun facing the higher prices .
The result of such  Cantillon effects  is not only a systematic redistribution of wealth from those less to those more favoured by the banking - government complex , but an artificial stimulation of certain sectors of the economy , making them look more inherently profitable than they are and so directing economically unjustified levels of investment toward them .
Does the Austrian account , as is often claimed , underestimate the ability of investors and entrepreneurs to recognise the effects of government policies and compensate for them ?
No .
Even if you know that a given price represents some mix of genuine market signals and governmental distortion , you may not know how much of the price represents which factor , so how can you compensate for the distorting factor ?
( Likewise , if you know there are magnetic anomalies in the area that are throwing off your compass , that s not terribly helpful information unless you know exactly where the anomalies are and how strong they are compared with earths magnetic field ; otherwise you have no way to correct for them .
And given that the direction of your compasss needle is at least partly responsive to true north , you re better off trusting it , despite its distortions , than simply abandoning your compass and proceeding by coin - flip . )
On the Austrian understanding , governmental inflation of the money supply , thereby artificially lowering interest rates , was the chief cause of the Great Depression .
( Mainstream economists dispute this , holding that the Feds policy could not have been genuinely inflationary , since prices were relatively stable during the period leading up to the crash .
But for Austrians the crucial question is not whether prices were higher than they had previously been , but whether they were higher than they would have been in the absence of monetary inflation . )
Likewise , for Austrians the housing bubble that precipitated the current crisis was the product of the Federal Reserves low - interest policies of recent years .
( An aside to address a frequent misunderstanding : on the Austrian view there is nothing wrong with low interest rates per se ; indeed , low interest rates are a symptom of a healthy economy , since the more prosperous people are , the likelier they are to be willing to defer present consumption .
But one cannot make an economy healthy by artificially inducing symptoms of health in the absence of their underlying cause .
By the same principle , absence of scabbing on ones skin is a sign of physical health , but if there is scabbing , one does not promote health by ripping the scabs away ; advocates of minimum wage laws , take note . )
In the 1920s , while mainstream economists were claiming that stock prices had reached a permanently high plateau ,  Mises and Hayek were predicting a crash ( as incidentally was my grandfather Charles Roderick McKay , who as Deputy Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago protested against the Feds policy of artificially lowered interest rates , kept the Chicago branch out of the easy - money policy until centrally overridden , foresaw the likely results , and got the hell out of the stock market well before the crash ) ; likewise , in recent years Austrians kept warning of a housing bubble while folks like Greenspan and Bernanke blithely insisted that the housing market was sound .
Now everyone these days is saying , quite sensibly , that in the present crisis we need to avoid the mistakes that lengthened the Great Depression ; the problem is that this advice is useless without an accurate understanding of what those mistakes were .
By Austrian standards , the current plan to inject more liquidity  into the economy is simply treating the disease with more of the poison that originally caused it .
Attempting to cure an illness by artificially simulating symptoms of health is , literally , voodoo economics .
Of course the Federal Reserve is not solely to blame ; there are still further government policies that encouraged riskier loans .
Theres been some media attention paid to Clinton - era changes in the Community Reinvestment Act , for example , that encouraged laxer lending standards in order to attract minority borrowers .
The claim that this explanation is racist is confusing the reason why a given loan is risky with the reason why the loan , despite its riskiness , gets made ; all the same , focusing on this narrow example misses the wider picture , which is that when the federal government sponsors massive credit corporations like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , it creates an expectation ( whether codified in law or not ) that the government is guaranteeing their solvency .
Just as with the S&L crisis of the 80s , the expectation of reimbursement in the case of failure encourages riskier loans because the risk is socialised .
( And beyond this are the still deeper factors that stifle affluence for the vast majority and so make it necessary for them to borrow money to buy a home in the first place ; taking that necessity for granted requires justification . )
Even George Bush , in his speech on the crisis , recognised ( or read words written by people who recognised ) that the expectation that a bailout would be forthcoming if needed had helped to encourage riskier loans  though he seemed to miss the further implication that by going on to urge a bailout he was confirming and reinforcing the very expectations that had helped fuel the crisis  thus setting the economy up for a repeat of the crisis in the future .
The grain of truth in the otherwise ludicrous statist mantra that the financial crisis was caused by lack of regulation is that when you pass regulation A granting a private or semi-private firm the right to play with other peoples money , but then repeal or fail to enact regulation B restricting the firms ability to take excessive risks with that money , the ensuing crisis is in a sense to be attributed in part to the absence of regulation B .
But the fatal factor is not the absence of regulation B per se but the absence of B when combined with the presence of A ; the absence of B would cause no problem if A were absent as well .
So , sure , there was insufficient regulation , if by insufficient regulation  you mean a failure on governments part to rein in , via further regulations , the problems created by its initial regulations .
So if the problem is caused by A without B , it might be objected , why must we adopt the libertarian solution of getting rid of A ?
Cant we solve the problem just as well by keeping A but adding regulation B alongside it ?
The answer is no , because central planning doesnt work ; when one responds to bad regulations by adding new regs to counteract the old ones , rather than simply repealing the old ones , one adds more and more layers between decisions and the market , increasingly muffling price - system feedback and courting calculational chaos .
But , the objector may continue , what if were in a situation where we have regulation A but no regulation B , and where , further , repealing A is not politically possible but adding regulation B is  in that case , shouldnt we push to add B ?
In some circumstances , depending on the details , maybe so ; but the more important question , to my mind , is to which should we devote more of our time and energy  tweaking the details of a fundamentally unsound system within the parameters of what is currently considered politically possible , or working to shift those parameters themselves ?
In Hayeks words :  Those who have concerned themselves exclusively with what seemed practicable in the existing state of opinion have constantly found that even this had rapidly become politically impossible as the result of changes in a public opinion which they have done nothing to guide . 
Okay , some will say , maybe it was government , not laissez - faire , that got us into the mess ; but now that were in it , dont we need government to get us out ?
My answer is that government doesnt have the ability to get us out .
Theres just not much the government can do that will help ( apart from repealing the laws , regulations , and subsidies that first created and then perpetuate the mess  but that would be less a doing than a ceasing - to - do , and anyway given the incentives acting on government decision - makers theres no realistic chance of that happening ) .
The bailout is just diverting resources from the productive poor and middle - class to the failed rich , which doesnt seem like a very good idea on either ethical or economic grounds .
The only good effect such a bailout could possibly have ( at least if you prefer costly boondoggles without piles of dead bodies to costly boondoggles with them ) is if it convinced the warmongers that they just cant afford a global war on terror right now  but theres no sign that they re being convinced of anything of the sort .
If the price system were allowed to function fully , the crisis would right itself  not instantly or painlessly , to be sure , but far more quickly and with less dislocation than any government could manage .
What the government should do is , in the final analysis , nothing .
But such a response would be politically impossible ?
Quite true ; but what makes it politically impossible ?
Is it some corporatist bias on the part of the American people ?
Did Congress pass the bailout because the voters were clamouring for it ?
On the contrary , most of the voters seem to have been decidedly against it .
The bailout passed because Congress is primarily accountable , not to the electorate , but to big business .
And that s a source of political impossibility that stems not from shiftable ideology but from the inherent nature of representative government .
A government that was genuinely responsible to the people would hardly be a paradise ( since the people are hardly free from ignorance and bias , and majority rule is all too often simply a mechanism for externalising the costs of majority preferences onto minorities )  but debating the merits of a government genuinely responsible to the people is purely academic , because such a government , whatever its merits or demerits , is impossible ; you cannot make a monopoly responsive to the people .
Other than the market itself , no political system has ever been devised or discovered that will subordinate the influence of concentrated interests to that of dispersed interests .
Monopoly cannot be reformed ; it has to be abolished .
Now that is of course not to say that some governments cant be less unresponsive than others , just as some forms of slavery can be less awful than others .
One of the striking features of slavery in the antebellum American south , for example , is how much worse it was , on average , than most other historical forms of slavery ; and if the abolitionists , despairing of the prospects of actually freeing the slaves , had focused their efforts on reforming American slavery to make it more like ancient Greco - Roman slavery or mediæval Scandinavian slavery , Im not going to say that wouldnt have been worth doing or wouldnt have made a lot of peoples lives significantly better  but is nt it setting on ones political sights a tad low ?

It was time for this fun subject to rear its head again , was n't it ?
A new study was just released , so reporters decided to find the most FLAGRANTLY MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS to draw from it possible , so as to make the report newsworthy .
Here 's CNN 's report : " Study : Lack of breastfeeding costs lives , billions of dollars "
Do you know what the reportshowed ?
It showed that almost 1000 babies die prematurely every year in the US from preventable diseases , and that breastfeeding has been shown to decrease the risk of these diseases .
( BY HOW MUCH , the report on CNN does not say . )
The babies who die prematurely cost billions of dollars .
So , the theory goes , if these 975 babies had been breastfed for the first few months of their lives , they MIGHT not have gotten sick and MIGHT not have died and then MIGHT not have cost so much money .
But of course , that 's not an interesting finding .
So you make it interesting by flipping stuff around and quoting out of context and making this about SCARING the bejeezus out of already terrified new mothers .
Let me restate my position on this .
I think that this country is totally and completely screwed up when it comes to the notion of pregnancy and birth and breastfeeding AND EVEN ( to some extent ) child - rearing , not to mention sexuality .
All this kid-related stuff is vital to our perpetuation as a species -- you know , kind of basic -- and yet it's all treated as silly , fluffy , too personal , gross , weird , bleh .
And we all know : Excessive cleavage on display is perfectly awesome , but god forbid you try to use boobs for the purpose of nourishing your baby in public .
Blogging about raising kids is fluff , but writing a review about how fast you can play games on the iPad is Serious Business .
Where was I ?
Oh , right .
This country is LOUSY at supporting new moms in general , and moms who want to breastfeed ?
Forget it .
Our companies do n't support us , our insurance companies do n't support us , and our friends / neighbors / family members who gawk at the very thought of seeing a baby on our boobs do n't really support us .
Let 's fight that fight .
Let 's change that .
Oh , but you know what ?
Let 's not fight that fight while ALSO screaming at moms who formula feed .
Just , please stop doing it .
You 're obfuscating the point and polarizing the issue .
It should NOT be about who 's doing it wrong or who 's doing it better .
The real fight is in finding ways to better support moms , period .
I humbly request that you to read my first rant on this issue , called OH MY GOD WITH THE BREASTFEEDING .
I think it 's maybe one of my most measured rants ever .
By Ron Vanderwell
I could never be an atheist .
I could n’t muster that much faith .
But I ’ve got to respect people who are committed to that faith .
It ’s inspiring to watch someone stake everything on something they can’t prove .
It ’s pretty ballsy , actually .
Most atheists would never brag about it , of course — which I respect — but theirs really is a gutsy kind of faith .
After all , how could anybody ever prove that God was n’t there ?
Throughout history , people have always bought into the idea that someone “ bigger ” was in charge .
Granted , we could never quite agree on just who or what that bigger - than - us entity was ( think of the Crusades , for instance ) .
But whatever brand name people might choose , everyone agreed that there was someone or something .
This works for me .
I look up at the night stars at Emigrant Gap , and those galaxies sure do n’t look like an accident .
Seems like it ’d be hard to be an atheist outdoors .
But that ’s why I have to salute folks who march to such a different nondrummer .
During recent centuries , some academics have concluded that those stars are really just accidents .
Evolution , it ’s called .
The idea is that we ’re all somehow mutants , morphed from the first seaweed glops that washed up on some beach .
I ’ve known a few mutants ( hey , I watch cartoons ! ) , and I have trouble seeing how mutants could accidentally produce something like the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
To me , bass - guitar licks like Flea ’s do n’t just happen .
Maybe I ’m too uptight about the whole science thing .
But think about it :
The best science of the day produced the flat Earth theory .
Then , later , the better science of the day produced the round Earth theory .
( Note : At press time , the Earth was still round . )
That whole big - bang theory ?
Something that big , somebody must have heard something !
Granted , any academic discipline can have a bad century periodically .
But I struggle with these leaps of faith .
Rumor has it some guy in Ohio dumped 10,000 dominoes off his roof and they accidentally formed a perfect Mona Lisa — even got the smile just right .
I do n’t buy that , either .
I do n’t want to sound judgmental .
Most atheists are good people who are sincere about their beliefs .
But I bristle when atheists get all fundamentalist on me .
Maybe I ’m not as smart as they are with all their fancy theories , but I still feel judged by their sympathy when I do n’t “ get it . ”
What I would love would be an open dialogue about our different kinds of faith .
Not an evangelistic shootout , just a chance to hear faith stories from some atheists who ’ve been at it a while .
How does it feel to be such a minority ?
How do you shore up your faith on the days when you suspect that maybe you were put here for a reason ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe I ’m missing something here .
But whenever I look for a reason to have faith in atheism , all I find is … nothing .
Over on Climate Audit , Jean S points out a curious anomaly in the March GISS Temperature data for Finland .
Maybe that ’s where all of Trenberth ’s “ missing heat ” went .
Note the deep red anomaly is in a sea of blue that surrounds it .
Jean writes of the data :
GISS station values are even more spectacular , the warmest March on record is set in every Finnish station GISS is following .
For instance , according to GISS , the mean March temperature in Sodankylä ( 61402836000 ) was a remarkable + 1.5 °C beating the old record ( - 2.2 °C ) from 1920 by 3.7 °C !
Well , according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute , March 2010 was colder than usual all over Finland , especially in the northern part .
For instance , the mean temperature in Sodankylä was - 10.3 °C , which is almost three degrees below the base period 1971 - 2000 average ( - 7.5 °C ) .
So the GISS March value for Sodankylä is off by amazing 11.8 °C !
Even more curious , when you look at the NASA data from another division .
NASA ’s Earth Observations ( NEO ) The GISS Finlandic Temperature anomaly disappears !
Here are the satellite derived daytime and nighttime temperature anomalies for the world .
Just like what the Finnish Meteorological Institute says , Finland was well below normal .
Here ’s the daytime temperature anomaly :
Here ’s the nighttime temperature anomaly :
The whole of Finland remains a cool blue in both images .
So we have NASA NEO saying Finland is “ below normal ” and we have the Finnish Meteorological Institute saying below normal , but GISS shows a hotspot .
Gosh , who to believe ?
I have a working theory as to why this happened , look for an update to this post if I ’m able to confirm it – Anthony
UPDATE : GISS has posted a correction on their website which reads –
2010 - 04 - 15 : The data shown between 4/13 and 4/15 were based on data downloaded on 4/12 and included some station reports from Finland in which the minus sign may have been dropped .
NOAA updated GHCN on 4/13 by removing those data and we updated our displays today .
The March 2010 global mean temperature was affected by about 2/100 of a degree Celsius , well below the margin of error ( about 15/100 of a degree for monthly global means ) .
Back in January , I was working on a minus sign issue in data , and GISS making mention of this confirms it to be a real problem .
I ’ll have more later today .

UPDATE2 : A commenter calls this “ fraud ” – folks please do n’t go there .
See below and wait for my next post .

even if Giss accidentally dropped the minus sign , - 1.5 ( C ) would still be 8.8 degrees warmer than the - 10.3 figure from the Finnish Meteorological Institute .
there is only one word for this – fraud .
REPLY : Actually , it ’s not fraud , but common human error .
Give me a couple of hours and I ’ll demonstrate how this happens .
GISS is a consumer of GHCN data , compiled by NOAA , and while their quality control may be nonexistent or slipshod , it ’s not fraud that they plotted this erroneously transmitted data .

Some say the Ford Mustang was named after the wild horse .
Some say it was named after the P - 51 fighter plane made famous in World War II .
But very few say the truth , the best kept secret in automotive history .
The Ford Mustang was actually named after a Canadian badminton team from Ontario , the Western Mustangs .
Carl Pluimbal was a creative marketing exec at Ford in the early ’ 60’s .
He grew up in Western Ontario , where he spent years honing his curling skills after not being accepted on the badminton team , the Mustangs .
Despite the racquet champs overlooking this young whipper - snapper , Carl always admired badminton , and the team that rejected him .
Faced with this humility , he vowed to work harder at everything he did .
His parents bought young Pluimbal a new badminton racquet , which at that point was about as useful as a fart in a spacesuit .
He persevered , practicing every day after school until he was confident in his abilities .
Carl tried out again and made the team .
The curling team .
He went on to get a PhD in Marketing , write 2 books , and get promoted to Vice President of Marketing .
He credits his success to his struggle with adolescent badminton and flurrying shuttlecocks .
Badminton can be very fast , like a Mustang , the car we all love .
“ Twas not a bird , nor a plane , nor a flying machine
‘ Twas Badminton to the Nth degree , what a dream ! ”

Enabling & Support Proba - 2 shows solar eruption that touched Earth 14/04/2010 2251 views 0 likes
Polar skies glowed with ghostly auroras last week during the biggest geomagnetic storm of 2010 .
The event owed its origin to a solar eruption a few days earlier – revealed here in high - speed detail by ESA ’s small Sun-watcher Proba - 2 .
Eruptions like this one have several components , most notably solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections ( CMEs ) .
Solar flares are caused by sudden impulsive releases of magnetic energy from the surface of the Sun .
The flare seen here took place at 11:54 CET on Saturday 3 April .
It was officially classed as ‘ weak ’ , though still involved temperatures of tens of millions of degrees and around the same energy the human race consumes on Earth per year .
Proba -2
Significantly , this eruption was lined up with Earth , sending a vast number of charged particles hurtling towards us .
Travelling at around 500 km per second , the front of this CME reached Earth the following Monday , 5 April .
The resulting geomagnetic storm was the most powerful in more than three years .
It provoked dazzling auroras but no damage was reported to potentially susceptible systems such as satellites and GPS , communications and electrical power infrastructure .
Solar flares are rarely visible in ordinary light , but are often spectacular at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths .
The ESA - NASA SOHO mission has been a solar flare ‘ watchdog ’ producing remarkable images for approaching 15 years , but last year a new ‘ pup ’ made it to Earth orbit : ESA ’s small satellite Proba - 2 .
Measuring only a cubic metre , the satellite is crammed with technology demonstrations but also carries science payloads : its SWAP ( Sun Watcher using APS detectors and imaging processing ) instrument is only the size of a large shoebox , but gathers images much more frequently than SOHO ’s equivalent sensor .
Close - up of eruption event “ SWAP acquired an image every 100 seconds during the flare while SOHO manages one around every 15 minutes , ” said David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium ( ROB ) , overseeing SWAP operations .
“ This means we have about 40 images compared to five to six for SOHO , allowing us to see clearly the full range of phenomena associated with such an event . ”
LYRA time series during solar eruption event Most notably , during the onset of the flare itself , a faint puff of material can be seen erupting in a downward direction from it – this is the CME beginning its journey Earthward .
It is followed by a spreading ‘ EIT wave ’ as the area around the flare goes dark then , finally , glowing loops of cooling plasma as the Sun ’s magnetic field knits itself back together again .
As well as SWAP , Proba - 2 also carries a second Sun-monitoring payload run contributed by ROB : LYRA ( Large Yield Radiometer ) is a solar radiometer measuring solar radiance at key ultraviolet wavelengths .
SWAP and LYRA observed the flare simultaneously , the latter instrument recording a dramatic four - fold radiation peak .
" LYRA adds an extra dimension to solar monitoring , " said Jean - François Hochedez of ROB , LYRA Principal Investigator .
" It records at high frequency the extreme ultraviolet brightness radiated by the relatively ' cool ' solar corona , seen by the SWAP imager , but also phenomena occurring at lower temperatures in the dense chromosphere just above the surface .
In addition it examines the rapid variability of the very hot corona - its two metallic filter channels sample extreme ultraviolet pass bands but also the soft X - ray range where the ten million degree corona expresses itself . "
Kirill Petrov invited to Islanders ’ rookie camp ( Photo © Richard Wolowicz / Getty Images )
Kirill Petrov of Ak Bars Kazan was invited to New York Islanders ‘ rookie camp .
The 20 years old player will most likely leave the KHL this summer and will report to North America , according to Petrov ’s agent Vyacheslav Makhrensky .
Petrov was U20 team Russia ’s top scorer at the latest WJC .
He ’s got little chances with Ak Bars this year and he has been demoted down to Kazan ’s affiliates in the Russian First League , Neftyanik Almetievsk .
In the KHL he played only eight regular season games , without getting any point .

( Newser ) – President Obama does n't get much political credit for it , but the numbers show his economic policies have been a resounding success .
Since he took office , the S&P 500 is up 41 % , credit spreads have narrowed , commodity prices have surged , and housing prices have stabilized , writes Mike Dorning of Bloomberg .
GDP grew 5.9 % in the fourth quarter , far more than analysts predicted , and job losses have slowed .
“ We ’ve had a phenomenal run in asset classes across the board , ” says one economist .
“ If he was a Republican , we would hear a never - ending drumbeat of news stories about markets voting in favor of the president . ”
So far Obama ’s performance has n’t helped him politically , but economists think that ’ll change once prospering companies start hiring .
“ Households will eventually benefit , ” says one economist , “ but they ’ll have to see it before they believe it . ” ( Read more Barack Obama stories . )
EVEN in a season when designers made no secret about reining in prices to appeal to the newly chastened luxury consumer , it is still possible to walk into a store and wonder what exactly they were thinking when a pair of khaki cotton pants — right there on the hanger , no special packaging or 3G plan or anything — can cost as much as an iPad .
Never mind that classic button - fly chinos at Abercrombie & Fitch cost $ 70 or that Gap sells “ original khakis ” for $ 44.50 .
The fact that luxury chinos exist — and in surprising numbers — is another story , one that illustrates the challenge faced by designers to justify the still sky - high prices of their clothes .
A distinctive design might strengthen the argument , but is $ 550 really a fair price for basic pants ?
How about $ 480 , for plain khakis from Michael Bastian ?
Or $ 495 for light cotton twill pants from Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen of The Row ?
Or $ 595 if they are by Giorgio Armani ?
Or $ 780 for ones with elasticized cuffs from Bottega Veneta ?
Or is $ 350 , as Thom Browne charges for chinos , the right price ?
The range suggests that since the luxury bubble burst , designers have no clue what customers are willing to pay .
Image HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY ?
There is a rationale for the price of Band of Outsiders khakis , but does it make sense ?

Questions for Orbit , Re : Its New Digital Short Fiction Program
First , for context , this press release , from Orbit ( US ) , the science fiction arm of publisher Hachette :
Orbit , the Science Fiction and Fantasy imprint of Hachette Book Group , announces a digital short fiction publishing program launching later this year .
Orbit ( US ) has offered to publish digital editions of all original short fiction written by its authors .
The digital editions will be distributed widely through major retail channels , for reading on a variety of devices .
Authors will be paid a royalty for each story sold , rather than the flat fee more common in the short story market .
If I were an Orbit author , or were otherwise approached about or interested in participating , here are the questions I would want answered before I would consider the program :
1 . Will there be an advance on the proposed royalty , equivalent to at least the minimum professional rate required by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America ( five cents a word ) , or will the proposed royalty be the only compensation offered ?
2 . What is the royalty ?
How does this royalty compare to what the author could receive if he or she worked directly with the major electronic text retailers to release the work , as is possible ?
3 . When will this royalty be paid ?
Will it be accessible on demand , or on the customary schedule of royalty disbursement for publishers ( i.e. , semiannually or annually , depending on contract ) , or on some other schedule ?
4. Aside from publication , what other services will Orbit / Hachette offer to the author ?
Will the author ’s work be edited and copy - edited by Orbit / Hachette prior to publication , or will the onus be on the author to provide such services ?
Would Orbit / Hachette exercise editorial judgment and refuse to publish work it found to be unsuitable and / or unprofessional ?
5 . Will these short stories be offered with DRM attached to them ?
If so , and if the author chooses , may the story be distributed without DRM ?
6 . What rights / holdbacks will Orbit / Hachette require of the author ?
Will this be a non-exclusive publication or will the author be enjoined from finding alternate and additional publication for some term of time ?
If so , what length of time would that be ?
7 . Will participation in this program be expected of Orbit authors ?
Will Orbit / Hachette in any way penalize authors who do not participate ?
8 . What sort of promotional program will Orbit / Hachette offer for this effort ?
Will it be ongoing or only an early push ?
There are the questions which come up off the top of my head when I think about this particular press release ; I ’m sure if I thought about it longer there would be others as well .
As I do n’t know the answers to any of these questions , I ’ll refrain from saying anything about this particular proposed program until I do .
However , in a very general sense I can say that proposing writers offer up work uncompensated save for rosy promises of back - end glory is something one should n’t tolerate in poorly - funded start - ups done in apartment living rooms .
If such a thing were proposed from , say , an arm of the second - largest publisher on the planet , itself an arm of a huge multinational corporation with roughly ten billion dollars in revenue and $ 180 million in profit in 2009 , it should be tolerated even less .
I ’d also say , in a very general sense , that most writers are in a position of needing to be paid for their work sooner than later , because most writers do n’t make a whole lot of money doing what they do .
Today is Tax Day here in the U.S. and even as you read this I suspect a fair number of writers are looking at the checks they have to write to Uncle Sam ( not to mention state and local authorities ) and wishing they had maybe a little more to get through the rest of the month .
I do n’t suspect any of them at the moment would be thrilled at the idea of taking no money now for an uncertain amount of money at some unspecified point in the future , were such a thing proposed to them regarding their work .
Basically , I ’m hoping that Orbit thought this idea through , and that the program will offer immediate benefits for writers , making them happy and paid , sooner than later .
I look forward to hearing more about it , and hopefully having those above questions answered .
Soon .
Update , 11:07 am : Tim Holman , Publisher of Orbit , responds in comments .
Update , 2:00 pm : Mr. Holman returns in comments with additional details about the program .
One significant point :
It ’s likely to be royalty - only payment .
This week ’s episode of Fringe has a special guest star , particularly in the sci - fi world .
Peter Weller , Robocop and Buckaroo Bonzai himself , is the subject of Thursday night ’s episode “ White Tulip , ” playing a time traveler who Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) and his Fringe team investigate .
“ The thing that really turned me on about it is , it ’s a romantic , ” Weller said in a conference call with the media .
“ It ’s a guy who is going back in time and he ’s making some serious sacrifices in terms of other people ’s livelihood and well being , to get back and save his wife from dying in a ridiculous moment , a mistake that he made .
He ’s trying to find redemption and go back to the only person that really means anything to him .
It ’s just tremendously romantic and very moving .
That alone was enough to make me want to jump in it . ”
Time travel is a popular concept in science fiction so it will be exciting for viewers to see how Fringe deals with it .
“ Also , particularly the way they ’re handling time travel , what the electrical field does around the person who ’s time traveling , it ’s sucking the energy out of the physical space where one lands so the energy gets rerouted , is just fabulous to me , ” Weller said .
“ I do n’t understand science that much but science fiction is an extraordinarily imaginative trope .
The great science fiction is sort of like an autobiography of the world .
If you follow history , you have a linear sort of record of the great events in the world .
Then you have intersecting it vertically or thematically science fiction , the what ifs .
What if we did this ?
The whole thing outside of our sort of linear experience , that ’s the great gift of science fiction .
It ’s fun .
If you have any kind of inventive mind at all , you go racing with it . ”
Fringe does n’t just take Weller back to his sci - fi roots though .
It also puts demands on his acting muscles like the best of his theater work .
“ There are scenes that are four pages of explanation and dialogue but really well written .
They ’re not just expository but they ’re dramatic scenes to justify love and need and family .
Those were challenges .
Those are challenges to make come alive .
The thing is predicated on losing the person you love so I come from the method .
I come from Elia Kazan and Uta Hagen .
You ’ve got to plug in your personal life to that stuff and it ’s upsetting stuff .
I have to imagine what it would be like if I lost my wife .
This guy lost his fiancé and that ’s hard stuff to tap into .
At 60 - years - old you want to sit by the sea and not take a look at those possible horrors .
That ’s the biggest challenge , how to access the sorrow of losing the dearest person in the world to you . ”
It did n’t really occur to Weller until talking to a bunch of sci- fi fans that his Fringe episode connected back to his previous work .
While he was making it , he was just focusing on the man he played .
“ When I was doing Odyssey 5 , in the midst of Odyssey 5 or the midst of ‘ White Tulip , ’ you ’ve got to make it real .
I do n’t have a propensity to stand outside and talk about it .
You ’re in the middle of it , you ’re in the foxhole of making the thing .
It ’s really hard to stand outside of it and be objective .
I never had a conversation with Manny Coto about sci-fi .
We only had conversations about the human relationships .
I ’ve never sat on a movie set talking about the genre of the film that I ’m in .
That ’s fascinating . ”
The Fringe team certainly supported Weller ’s acting techniques too .
Sharing scenes with Noble , you ’ll recognize the Peter Weller - isms he adds to his scenes .
“ John and I got to invent and John ’s a very inventive actor .
John is a workhorse .
John has been around the block .
He ’s done theater and everything .
John is so in tune to a physical space and movement within a room , so one of the things that I am good at is physically inventing in a room .
Some people say I ’m prop heavy but I do n’t call those things props .
I call them physical life .
The director really gave me a lot of leeway to work with stuff . ”
We have n’t seen Weller for a while because he ’s been busy working on a PhD in Italian Renaissance History .
Fringe called him while he was studying .
“ It ’s the usual stuff .
They called my agent and said , ‘ We ’d really like him to do this . ’
I ’d seen a little bit of the show .
My wife ’s a big fan of it so I said , ‘ Listen , honey , we ’ve got this offer .
What do you think ? ’
I have to tell you honestly I ’m very discerning about prime time television guest stars .
A lot of it is entertaining but hamstrung stuff .
Fringe is unique .
It ’s the best that science fiction can be .
It ’s fantastic and entertaining but has a humanist thing to it of people , places and things and relationships .
My wife said , ‘ I think this is brilliant . ’
So I read it and it was brilliant .
So I said , ‘ I ’m in .
I do n’t care what the money is , it ’s fantastic . ’ ”
Now that he ’s worked with the crew Weller is not only a fan of the show , but of the team that produces it .
“ One of the most fabulous crews , on the ball .
The cast is egoless which is sometimes and many times not the case .
I ’ve been in the movie business for many years and I ’m sure when I was a younger man I threw my own hissy fits .
After a while you just want to get the work done , particularly when it ’s a great part in a great show .
You really want to get the best work out and the way to get the best work out is everybody puts their ego on hold .
Even though a movie set is not a democracy , it ’s essentially an oligarchy .
If everyone ’s receptive to ideas then you really get something done .
That said , and I ’m not saying this just because I was on the show because after 60 - 70 pieces of work , that show has this fantastic egalitarian accessibility of everyone on it .
It ’s magic .
They say in the mafia , the fish stinks at the head , which means if you ’ve got a son of a bitch running the thing everyone feels like a son of a bitch .
That show is the antithesis of that .
The writers were available to me on the phone .
The directors were available night and day .
The crew was extraordinarily helpful .
The cast was gems , three gifted people .
I just had a ball . ”
Hollywood is getting ready to remake Weller ’s most famous role , Robocop , with Darren Aronofsky writing and directing .
Weller had some thoughts about that too .
“ I wish him well , he ’s a gifted director .
I was happy to do it and happy to leave it .
Like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis , they were happy to get together and happy to go on their way .
I was very grateful to everything that Robocop brought me , particularly a large listening amongst young people in terms of education and making some sort of contribution to education because young people will listen to me because of that film .
The movie is probably going to be good but I just have to say Robocop 1 is hard to beat .
You got that director Verhoeven and you got those writers Ed Neumeier and Michael Miner and the combination of action and myth and humanity and humor , all those things wrapped into one in a perfectly constructed script , I do n’t think they ’re going to do anything better but I certainly wish them well to do something as good . ”
For now , Weller is happy with the message his episode of Fringe imparts to the world .
“ Anything that can help somebody break bread instead of pick up a gun with somebody else is worthwhile .
Communicating a particular experience like in ‘ White Tulip ’ which is about love , that ’s all it is .
The whole episode is about love and the desire for love and the loss of people you love .
If I can communicate that , I get reinfused with it and I can be nicer to the people next to me . ”
Fringe airs Thursday nights on Fox .

Songbirds are not born with songs in their heads , but learn them from others .
And as in a game of telephone , it would seem natural that , over generations , the songs might change .
That is what happens with many species , some more dramatically than others .
The songs of indigo buntings change so much , for example , that songs that are five years apart are almost completely different .

But with other species , the songs are more stable .
Now , thanks to some old audio recordings , researchers have determined just how stable some songbirds ’ songs can be .
Luke Nuto , a former Art Director at the globally acclaimed Glue Society , has been designing and selling T - shirts for over 10 years .
In particular his current label , Young Lovers , is growing from strength to strength primarily through the online channel .
As my current travel buddy through South America , I thought it was time to convince Luke to put the Campari and Sprite down and share with us what he has learnt about building a clothing label .
What is the Young Lovers label all about ?
We create limited edition T - shirts for lovers , dreamers , heartbreakers , poets , jokers and thieves .
Who is it targeted at ?
Most of our customers are between 20 and 30 .
People who want to wear something that is limited edition without spending ridiculous amounts of cash .
Why T - shirts ?
They stop your nipples from showing .
How do people find out about your brand ?
What has proved your most successful form of marketing ?
We have let the brand grow almost 100 % organically .
Given that our tees are limited edition , the intention was to never get too big too quickly .
Blogs have really been the main way word of mouth has spread among the online community .
We ’ve been featured on sites like CoolHunting , and BoingBoing which has does wonders for awareness .
We ’re starting to do a bit of online advertising now , to reach new audiences , but it ’s really the bloggers out there that have sung about us and got us to where we are .
What has n’t worked ?
We ’ve done a small amount of magazine advertising which really has n’t delivered for us .
I think if you ’re trying to get people to visit a website – the best place to do it is online – when they are already sitting at their computers .
Make it easy for them …
Do you use mailing lists ?
If so , how ?
Yes , we ’re using Mailchimp to send out news of new tee shirt designs , special offers and other cool stuff .
We have a pretty solid list of fans who have opted in .
What has your experience been with Google Adwords , Facebook ads etc .
One benefit of Facebook ads over Adwords is that they allow images .
I feel this is particularly useful when the visual of the product is so important – such as T - shirts .
Of course Google also now offer image ads but this is something we are only starting to experiment with .
What does social media mean for Young Lovers ?
Social media is working for us in that we ’re seeing new fans coming to us through personal recommendations .
I think if we were to get too forceful pushing our wares through social media it could backfire .
We ’re actually getting a lot of people finding us through StumbleUpon , which is a good sign that people like what they see when they come to the site .
Clothing is quite a physical purchase .
How do you overcome the desire to try on clothes before buying online ?
After doing this for years , we ’ve listened to our customers and arrived at a T - shirt cut that looks great on pretty much everyone .
Some fashion items would be hard to buy online due to the sizing issues but T - shirts are pretty simple .
We have a very detailed and exact sizing chart and have taken the time to explain on each product page what size they should choose depending on how they like their T - shirt to fit .
Young Lovers is n’t your first T - shirt label , what are some of the things you have you learnt about making and marketing T - shirts over the years ?
Stay true .
Lots of people will try and tell you to change in certain ways .
To follow certain trends etc .
You should know where you want to take your brand and just keep on .
You also operate some other T - shirt brands , the Tee Factory where people can design their own shirts , and Marker Tees , where people can use erasable markers to constantly update their shirts .
Why operate these under separate brands instead of Young Lovers ?
They are very different beasts .
The Tee Factory came as a result of people asking for custom made t- shirts .
And MarkerTees was just an idea I had one day that I wanted to put into action to see how it went .
Have you found any offers that have worked to increase sales ?
We ’ve been offering free shipping on orders of 3 or more T - shirts .
We find our customers really appreciate that – even though our shipping rates are very reasonable anyway .
How does it feel when you see complete strangers wearing your shirts ?
It ’s always good but I ’m sort of used to it now .
When I see artists and bands that I dig wearing my stuff that ’s cool .
It ’s a mutual appreciation thing .
What do you like about running an online business ?
The freedom .
We have operations down pretty tight now to make sure everything gets to our fans quickly .
That allows me to spend a lot of time internationally .
I ’m not so concerned about making pools of Scrooge McDuck money .
I ’m more interested in a good lifestyle that allows me live well and to create .
What ’s next ?
More new designs and growing the brand in a way that feels natural for us .
Finally , what advice would you give to someone wanting to set up their own clothing label ?
You had want to be 100 % committed to it and have a strong vision .
It seems that every man and his dog wants to start a clothing label these days .
You really need to be prepared to put the hours in .
Lots of them .
Focus on good materials & printing and stay true to your vision .
If you ’re starting a label that ’s following fickle fashion trends ( eg. Ed Hardy eating glitter and vomiting on cotton ) , it is bound to die .
And finally , do n’t make anything you would n’t wear yourself .

Influence of the epicanthal fold on the perceived direction of gaze .
" Judged direction of gaze from straight and turned heads is known to be biased from its true direction .
We have tested the additional influence of epicanthal folds on the perceived direction of gaze .
Western observers ( U.S. residents of Western appearance ) and Eastern observers ( native Japanese ) judged the direction of gaze from cathode ray tube - imaged heads with and without epicanthal folds ( Japanese vs. Western models ) when the heads , both straight and turned , gazed in different lateral directions ...
When the gazers ' heads were straight and gave eye contact , both Western and Eastern observers judged the gaze to be giving eye contact .
However , with straight heads and gaze to the side , epicanthal folds produced significant differences in the judged direction of gaze .
Observers judged the right and left eyes to be gazing in nearly the same direction when the gazer had the eye appearance that the observers were used to viewing within their own country , but in very different directions when the gazer had eyes typical of the other country .
When the gazers ' heads were turned , the Western and Eastern observers judged the direction of gaze of the Western gazer 's right and left eyes similarly , but both judged large differences in direction of gaze between right and left eyes for the Eastern gazer .
CONCLUSION : Direction of gaze from eyes that have epicanthal folds is judged very differently than gaze from eyes that do not have epicanthal folds .

It may only be skin deep , but having only Barbie pink to color in the skin color in the drawings of people sure gets kind of annoying in today 's modern , multiethnic society .
Fear not !
Crayola has the solution : a set of " multicultural " crayons .
From Flickr user nathangibb's photo , the multicultural crayons are composed of black , sepia , burnt sienna , mahogany , tan , peach , apricot , and white .
The Los Angeles Times / USC College of Letters , Arts and Sciences poll was conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner in conjunction with American Viewpoint , both based in Washington , D.C .
The findings are based on a random sample survey of 1,515 registered voters in California conducted from March 23 to 30 , 2010 .
All interviews were done by telephone using live interviewers from the ISA Research facility in Van Nuys .
Voters were randomly selected from a list of registered voters statewide and reached on land line or cellphone , depending on the numbers they designated on their voter registration .
The percentage of cellphone respondents in this study matches the percentage of those who listed their cellphone on the voter file .
Bilingual dialers gave respondents the option of taking the survey in English or Spanish .
Up to five attempts were made to reach and interview each randomly selected voter .
In order to include a wider range of questions in this study , some batteries of related questions were split into random half - samples of 757 voters each for purposes of time .

Upon completion of the interviewing , the results were weighted slightly to more accurately reflect the total population of registered voters throughout the state .
Weighting was done to regional and demographic characteristics according to known Census Bureau estimates and voter file projections ; party registration was weighted to match the most recent 2010 report from the California secretary of state ’s office .
The maximum sampling error for results based on the overall sample of 1,515 registered voters is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points at the 95 % confidence level .
The margin of error for the findings from each random half - sample of 750 registered voters is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points .
There 's a Mary Whitehouse Experience sketch where the ubiquitous foursome are dressed up like EMF .
Having just come off stage , they pretend to have forgotten to play their one real hit .
I 'm paraphrasing , but their banter goes something like :
" What else can we play ? "
" We 've played everything we can . "
" Oooh there 's one more song , is n't there .
What 's it 's called again ? "
A sarcastic David Baddiel interjects with : " You 've been to see EMF .
They have n't played Unbelievable .
Do you think they 'll do an encore ? "
The sketch illustrates the faintly silly ceremony of the " encore " process , but imagine if they did n't reappear on stage and the house lights went up .
You 'd think " unbelievable , " right ?
This was exactly the situation I faced last week at MGMT 's comeback gig at Heaven .
" Kids ! Kids ! Kids ! " chanted the braying crowd , after the band departed stage left , in anticipation of one of their biggest songs .
But they were left booing after the lights went up , presumably still smarting from the fact that the band decided to play the new , 12 - minute psychedelic number Siberian Breaks , instead .
The band 's lighter material had been given short shrift in favour of a new transcendental , " no singles " direction .
Even when they played Time To Pretend and Electric Feel , they sounded robotic and a bit annoyed , as if they were being forced to recite a really , really long shopping list .
The same thing happened the week before , during Kate Nash 's show .
Promoting her second album My Best Friend is You ( Pam Ayers does Kathleen Hanna ) , the electrics blew , mid-set .
Forced to go acoustic , she announced " I was n't planning to play this song , " before reluctantly launching into her Number 2 hit Foundations .
Last month , the Drums , who have n't even released an album yet , unveiled their new direction during a gig .
New direction !
Already !
After giving a lot of interviews about their love of the Smiths , they played precious little from their spunky surf 'n ' fun times Summertime EP .
The bulk of their set was tracks from their forthcoming debut album .
Goodbye B - 52s - style silliness , hello Killers tribute band !
Not playing your biggest hits is hardly a new phenomenon .
But you usually expect it from seasoned bands who have less to lose , not bands barely into their careers .
In refusing to play the songs their fans have paid to hear , they 're in danger of appearing rather arrogant .

Advertisement Scientific discoveries have shaped the development of society and civilisation throughout history , yet many of those with the greatest impact were accidental .
NASA recently announced the discovery of five new exo-planets , planets that lie outside our solar system .
They were found using NASA 's Kepler space telescope , designed to find Earth - size planets orbiting sun-like stars .
If there is alien life out there , it will probably be living on an exo-planet .
I was particularly pleased to read about NASA 's discovery because the man that telescope is named after - Johannes Kepler - is one of those wonderful characters who has contributed so much to our understanding of the universe , yet is something of an unsung hero .
History shows that you can never know where a particular bit of research will take you or the questions it will raise
Son of a mercenary , Kepler was a 17th Century German astrologer and mathematician whose mother was tried as a witch .
It was Kepler , and not Nicholas Copernicus , who first proved that the sun is the centre of the solar system and that the planets ( including our own ) travel round it in giant ellipses .
It was Kepler 's findings that helped lead to Newton 's discovery of the laws of universal gravity , which changed our world .
Paranormal FIND OUT MORE Michael Mosley presents

Yet like many of those who feature in my new series , The Story of Science , Kepler 's discovery was an unexpected one , even to him .
Having spent the last year looking into the history of science , one of the things that really stands out is its glorious unpredictability .
History shows that you can never know where a particular bit of research will take you or the questions it will raise .
Researchers who start off looking for one thing often end up discovering something quite unexpected .
Like William Crookes , a 19th century British scientist with a passion for the paranormal .
He claimed to have seen acts of levitation , an accordion playing by itself and strange phantom figures , some of which he photographed .
He could be dismissed as a gullible fool , but the fact was that even in his own laboratory he was coming across things which were very hard to explain .
Crookes thought it [ radiation ] was a fourth state of matter , one that was perhaps linked to the spirit world .
His most startling discoveries were made using fairly basic equipment : a partially evacuated glass tube , a couple of electrodes and a fluorescent screen .
Crookes found that by passing a high voltage across the electrodes he could produce a green ray inside the tube .
This ray could be bent with a magnet , suggesting it was in some way electrical .
He then put a little paddle wheel into the tube and found that the green ray made it spin .
Crookes called this " radiant matter " and thought it was a fourth state of matter , one that was perhaps linked to the spirit world .
The physicist , Joseph John Thomson , came up with an equally outrageous , but ultimately more accurate , claim - that the green ray making the paddle wheel spin consisted of a stream of tiny charged particles , particles far smaller than atoms - the first sub-atomic particle to be discovered , later called electrons .
First X - ray image
And that was by no means all .
In 1895 , while experimenting with a Crookes tube , German physicist , Wilhelm Röntgen , discovered that as well as producing a green ray inside the tube , his equipment was also producing a mysterious ray that could be detected right across the room .
Rontgen 's picture of his wife 's hand was one of the first X - ray images
Not knowing what these rays were he called them " X - rays " .
One of the first pictures he took using these mysterious rays was of his wife 's hand .
When she saw it she apparently exclaimed " I have seen my death ! "
Hearing about Röntgen 's work encouraged Frechman Henri Becquerel to investigate some unusual rocks he had in his collection , which glowed in the dark .
His curiosity led to the discovery of radioactivity .
An equally unlikely sequence of world changing discoveries came from attempts made in 1856 by an 18 - year - old called William Perkin to find a treatment for one of the world 's greatest killers , malaria .
In his parents ' converted attic in the East End of London , he set to work .
But instead of a malaria cure he accidentally created an intense purple dye , which he called mauveine .
It became all the rage and led to the discovery of other new colours , and an industry to produce them .
Soon artificial dyes were being used not just to brighten clothes , but food and hair .
In time they were used to stain cells , leading to the discovery of chromosomes and ultimately DNA .
Dyes were the first chemicals to be made on a truly industrial scale and others , including fertilisers , soap and dynamite , quickly followed .
Faraday demonstrates the invisible force of electro - magnetism
The dye manufacturing process also produced large amounts of toxic chlorine gas , a gas which would later be used to terrifying effect in the First World War .
The true value of blue - sky research is almost impossible to predict , which sometimes makes it hard to justify on purely commercial grounds .
The story goes that Michael Faraday , the 19th century physicist who discovered the principles behind the electric generator and the electric motor , was asked by Gladstone , then Chancellor of the Exchequer , about the practical value of his discoveries .
To which Faraday is said to have replied , " one day , sir , you may tax it " .

To enable the robot 's speaking abilities , engineers at Japan 's Kagawa University used an air pump , artificial vocal chords , a resonance tube , a nasal cavity , and a microphone attached to a sound analyzer as substitutes for human vocal organs .
The robot not only talks , but it uses a learning algorithm to mimic the sounds of human speech .
By inputting the voices of both hearing - impaired and non-hearing - impaired people into the microphone , researchers were able to plot the differences in sound on a map .
During speech training , the robot " listens " to the subjects talk while comparing their pronunciation to that of subjects who are not hearing - impaired .
The robot then generates a personalized visualization that allows subjects to adjust their pronunciation according to the target points on the speech map .
Wisden 's Leading Cricketer in the World , 2009
Sehwag named Wisden 's Leading Cricketer
The Leading Cricketer in the World was instituted in Wisden 2004 .
The six previous winners have been Ricky Ponting , Shane Warne , Andrew Flintoff , Muttiah Muralitharan , Jacques Kallis and Virender Sehwag .
Players can be chosen more than once for this award .
Several strong candidates advanced their case to be the Leading Cricketer in the World in 2009 .
None , however , made such an impact as to displace the incumbent , Virender Sehwag , India 's 31 - year - old opening batsman , who extended the sport 's traditional boundaries further still .
He scored more quickly than any specialist batsman in Tests or one - day internationals .
Last year he broke
Test cricket 's sound barrier by scoring at more than a run a ball .
Australia 's former captain Ian Chappell , in as good a position to judge as anybody alive , directly compared Sehwag to Sir Donald Bradman : they have the fastest scoring - rate among players of their generation , and are the only men to have exceeded 290 three times in Tests .
Chappell called Sehwag " the greatest destroyer since the U - boat " , and dismissed the accusation that he prospered only in home conditions by pointing out that he averaged almost 50 abroad .
Sehwag raised the bar even higher than in 2008 , when he had scored at strike - rate of 85 runs per 100 balls in Tests , and 120 in one - day internationals .
In 2009 he did not play so much , after injuring his right shoulder during the second IPL , and for much of the year the giant rested .
It was no coincidence that , in his absence , India were knocked out in the early stages of both the World Twenty20 and the Champions Trophy .
He still played in all of India 's Test matches in 2009 - a three - Test series in New Zealand and another at home to Sri Lanka - and , in steering them to No. 1 in the Test rankings for the first time , Sehwag averaged 70 , with a strike - rate of 108.9 .
Adam Gilchrist had set a new standard with his strike - rate of 81.9 while averaging 47 in Tests , but he did so almost entirely from the relative comfort of No. 7 in one of the greatest Test teams of all .
Sehwag has taken on the opposition from the first ball of India 's innings , shredding their confidence with his strokeplay , demoralising them as no Test batsman has done since Bradman , who scored at 61.2 per 100 balls .
In one - day internationals in 2009 Sehwag had a strike - rate of 136.5 - again , far higher than any batsman of substance has achieved over a lengthy period - while averaging 45 .
" The feat of the year " , as Chappell called it , came when Test cricket returned to the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai last December .
Sri Lanka scored 366 for eight on the opening day as they attempted , in the last match of the series , to overturn India 's 1 - 0 lead .
Next morning they continued to 393 all out ; 79 overs remained in the day .
Few would have thought of winning the game from this position , rather than settling for a draw .
Sehwag did .
By the close of the second day he had scored 284 not out from 239 balls with 40 fours and seven sixes - and Sri Lanka are Asia 's best fielding side .
By dispiriting bowlers Sehwag has made batting so much easier for team - mates .
Rangana Herath made a fine comeback last year as Sri Lanka 's left - arm spinner , yet , when he came on to bowl , Sehwag went down the pitch to drive his second ball for six .
Herath 's fellow spinner was Muttiah Muralitharan , his captain Kumar Sangakkara - a candidate himself to be the Leading Cricketer in the World .
But Sehwag still surged to the second - fastest
Test double - hundred ever recorded , from only 168 balls .
Those of us who saw the fastest - Nathan Astle 's from 153 balls against England - would vouch that Christchurch 's drop - in pitch played as flawlessly as an artificial one .
Sehwag , not surprisingly , could not continue in the same vein next morning and was dismissed for 293 from 254 balls .
But by then India had taken a first innings lead , and Sehwag had given his team so much time that even though Sri Lanka made more than 300 in their second innings as well , India won by an innings early on the fifth day , and took the series 2 - 0 to claim top spot .
While Sehwag was batting at the Brabourne , South Africa and England were preparing for a one - day international in Durban , and a television in Kingsmead 's pavilion was switched on silently while the captains did their press conferences .
Both Graeme Smith and Andrew Strauss kept looking at the distant screen to watch Sehwag .
One definition of genius is doing what nobody else can : and in 2009 Sehwag batted like nobody else has ever done for any length of time .
Sehwag learned to bat on a driveway of smooth concrete beside his house on the outskirts of Delhi , with a younger brother and neighbours to bowl taped tennis balls quickly .
If he had an identical twin , who batted at the same rate as Viru in 2009 , India would score 600 in a day of 90 overs .
Test cricket has been threatened by the greater excitement that is perceived in 50 - over and 20 - over cricket ; it will not be if more batsmen emulate Sehwag , as he pushes back the parameters and scores at the same rate in Tests as others do in Twenty20 .
Strauss was nominated by several correspondents who were consulted about this award .
Besides leading England 's improvement in Test cricket to regain the Ashes , and squaring the four - Test series in South Africa , he also resurrected England 's 50 - over cricket .
But England under Strauss lost a Test series in the West Indies , which none of the main Test - playing countries had done for six years , although allowance has to be made for the fact that the captain had no say in his squad 's selection after his hurried appointment ; and , in one - day cricket , England were hammered 7 - 1 by Australia during the year .
Tillakaratne Dilshan was the other main nominee .
His case rests more on limited - overs than on Test cricket : if we deduct the Chittagong Test , in which he scored two hundreds , he averaged 52.80 last year , and did not make the Wisden Test XI as he gained only one of the three selectors ' votes .
Superb in his hand - eye co-ordination , Dilshan came ever closer to Sehwag in his approach as he was promoted to open the batting for Sri Lanka in all three formats , without ever surpassing the trendsetter .
He scored more runs in Twenty20 internationals than anybody else last year ( 471 ) , although none inthe World Twenty20 final at Lord's .
He can be credited with popularising the scoop on bended knee over the shoulder , but not its invention .
Sehwag has to be first on the team - sheet to represent the World , whatever the game 's format .
He would take on the Martians , however hostile and alien their attack , disrupting their lines and wavelengths ; and , if he succeeded , as he normally does , he would make life so much easier for those who followed .

Bei der Entfernung von Videos , Blogeinträgen und Suchtreffern landet Deutschland auf Platz zwei hinter Brasilien - die Gründe sind überraschend banal .
Every government lives in fear of its own citizens .
The fear waxes and wanes , as the tides of public opinion and economic ups and downs crest and wash over the political landscape .
In good times , the fear is somewhat subtle : discontent , albeit ever - present , is masked by prosperity and contained ; in bad times , the fear overflows into the everyday life of the citizenry , which is viewed with the utmost suspicion by the ruling elite .
In Washington , they ’re wondering : how long will they put up with it ?
Today , the answer to that question is : not much longer – and the fear is manifest in the latest campaign against " extremism , " which is being touted by the " mainstream " media , the authorities , and the professional " extremist " - hunters who work in tandem with both .
To give you the flavor of the witch - hunting atmosphere being whipped up by the media- FBI complex , get a load of Rachel Maddow , the " liberal " MSNBC commentator , last Thursday night .
After running a videotaped interview with anti-abortion militant Scott Roeder – recently sentenced to life in prison for the murder of an abortion doctor – in which Roeder expressed support for the " sovereignist " doctrine that the federal government has no right to institute drivers ’ licenses , she averred :
" So , yes , so you can see Roeder as an anti-abortion extremist .
You can also identify anti-abortion extremism as one branch of the broader movement of violent , militant , anti-government extremism in this country .
We associate that movement with the early and mid-’90s , which is when that tape of Scott Roeder that you just saw was filmed .
But just in the last 18 months since President Obama took office , a white supremacist shot and killed a security guard in an attack on the Holocaust Museum in Washington .
An anti-tax extremist flew a plane into a building in Texas that housed an IRS office .
He killed an IRS worker .
Nine suspected militia members [ were ] arrested for allegedly plotting an attack on police officers as part of a war they wanted to wage against the United States government .
A Tennessee white supremacist convicted of plotting to kill President Obama near the end of the presidential campaign in ’08 .
" And , of course , there ’s Scott Roeder killing Dr. George Tiller .
" And , of course , there ’s the wave of threats and property damage against members of Congress after the health reform bill passed .
" Is it helpful to find the connections between these disparate acts , to understand what American extremism is now ?
Or are these all individual crazy people with no connection to politics , no connection to each other , no connection to a broader movement or to the broader country at large ?
What ’s the better way to understand this and is this stuff going to stop ?
Joining us now is Eugene Robinson … "
One can easily guess Robinson ’s answer to Maddow ’s largely rhetorical question , but let ’s rewind just a bit , and note the smearing methodology employed here : the classic amalgam .
Grouped together in one intellectual package deal are :
" antigovernment " activists
white supremacists out to kill the President ,
antiabortion fanatics out to kill abortionists ,
and crazed anti-Semites out to attack the Holocaust Museum .
One of these things is not like the others , and Maddow – no dummy – knows it .
That ’s why the plaintive tone is taken – " Is it helpful ? " – when posing the question of whether this is a unitary movement that needs to be infiltrated by law enforcement and its members arrested and jailed .
The whole idea is to discredit " antigovernment " ( i.e. pro-liberty ) movements and politicians in the mainstream by associating them with hate and – most importantly – violence , or the threat of it .
How quickly these lefties forget .
Intoxicated by power and by the prospect of smashing their political enemies using the mailed fist of the State , modern " liberals " of the Maddowist persuasion either do n’t know or do n’t want to be reminded of how J. Edgar Hoover ’s FBI was used as a political weapon of mass destruction by the Nixon administration to crush political dissidents of the left during the 1960s and 70s .
White leftists and black nationalists were infiltrated , disrupted , set up , and jailed – the government used agents provocateurs to initiate violence , and then moved to repress these movements , jailing the leaders , and using massive force against antiwar demonstrators : remember Kent State ?
The FBI ’s massive campaign of disruption was known as " COINTELPRO , " and the revelations of how extensive were the government ’s efforts to infiltrate leftist and black groups are generally considered shocking in retrospect .
For example , at the height of the antiwar movement , at least a third of the members of the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) , at the time the main Trotskyist group in the US – and a key organizer of the mass protests – were police agents , either FBI or paid informants .
These agents actively encouraged violence , planted " evidence , " and set up radicals for government repression .
The same tactics , and worse , were used against the Black Panther Party , which , in a gesture unconsciously mimicked by today ’s right - wing populists , once showed up on the steps of a Sacramento courthouse armed with shotguns and posed for the cameras .
Paid informants spying on the legal activities of American citizens , agent provocateurs , and outright dirty tricks ( such as disseminating printed materials meant to cause division and provoke violence ) – it was an altogether shameful chapter in the history of American law enforcement , one that nearly everyone but the most unrepentant neocons agree should n’t be repeated – and yet here is Ms. Maddow , an alleged " liberal , " celebrating its rebirth .
The first time as tragedy , the second as farce – and the latter surely describes the legal and political circumstances surrounding the alleged " extremist " threat coming from the " far right . "
At least back in the sixties , the government tried to hide its extensive infiltration and disruption of far - left groups , probably due to the fact that these activities were of dubious legality .
These days , the Feds do n’t bother with such niceties : indeed , they openly proclaim the " right " to do it , as well as the " right " to eavesdrop on the private communications of American citizens .
In the post - 9/11 era , even " liberal " administrations uphold – and defend in court – those provisions in the " PATRIOT "
Act that give free rein to Big Brother ( or , in this case , Big Sis ) .
Although we do n’t know all the details yet , it looks like the members of the Hutaree " militia " – basically a single family and a few friends – had been infiltrated by an undercover FBI agent and a " cooperating witness , " as court documents put it , and targeted as part of the administration ’s new war on " domestic terrorism , " embodied by the supposedly rising tide of militia groups forming ( or re-forming ) across the country .
The politics of this campaign are simple : link the " fringe " to the more mainstream " tea party " movement , and , ultimately , the Republican party – and 2012 becomes a replay of 1964 , in which Lyndon Baines Johnson crushed Barry Goldwater amid a storm of publicity about the " threat " posed by the minuscule and easily ridiculed John Birch Society .
Johnson , you ’ll recall , was at the time engaged in two wars : the " war on poverty , " and the war in Vietnam .
Obama has launched a similar two - pronged effort , albeit on a much larger scale – and the scare campaign he , his Justice Department , and his media amen corner are whipping up is the weapon of choice in their war on " right - wing extremism . "
It ’s easy to dismiss the hysteria of the chattering classes over the " tea party " phenomenon as self - interested hyperbole : a few people show up to usually deserted congressional town hall meetings and raise their voices above a whisper and the sissified liberals are quaking in their boots , lisping that those awful bullies are about to beat them up .
However , there is a sinister aspect to all this violence - baiting , as well as a comic one .
For the central point of all the pro-FBI , pro-government , anti -" extremist " propaganda blaring from MSNBC and other news outlets is to convince us that speech leads to violence – and that , indeed , certain forms of political speech – " antigovernment " in nature – are inherently violent .
The irony of this is that these people are cheerleaders for the biggest most powerful purveyor of violence on earth , the US federal government .
All states are founded on violence , of course , and maintained in power by the continual threat of it , and yet the US government enjoys a special status in this regard , with more firepower at its command – and the inclination to use it – than any previous empire in human history .
We are talking about a government currently waging two open wars and one " secret " one , abroad – systematically murdering many thousands – and actively threatening yet another .
The tiny and powerless Hutaree " militia " has about as much chance of overthrowing this Leviathan as a flea .
Yet they are charged with " sedition . "
This would be a joke if it were n’t such a danger to what ’s left of our civil liberties .
We already know the FBI infiltrated the group , and the likelihood that they were set up gets stronger if one looks at the details of similar incidents , such as the recent " plot " to blow up New York City synagogues .
This scheme – which the FBI took credit for stopping – was cooked up entirely by a government infiltrator who convinced , cajoled , and practically intimidated his fellow conspirators into cooperating .
The Feds then stepped in to save the day .
This is a scenario that has played out in many of the recent incidents of " extremist " violence : the government and its agents are the source of the violence .
As in the heyday of the " New Left , " you can tell someone ’s a cop when they constantly talk about how cool it is to literally " smash the State . "
Governments , all governments everywhere , whether they be of the " left " or the " right , " hate populist movements , and do everything in their power to discredit and crush them , simply because they can’t control them – and because they hate and fear their own people .
Popular upsurges of outraged citizens are a symptom that the " good governance " practiced by our rulers is n’t so good after all – except for those who profit from the system , in pelf , power , and prestige .
As our rulers go about their business of plundering our pocketbooks at home and building an empire abroad , there ’s always that worrying image of peasants with pitchforks one day marching on the castle .
Every ruling elite lives in fear of it – because when those torches light up the night they know the jig is up .
The partisans of this administration , and those who consider themselves " liberals " of the old school , would do well to ask themselves if they really want a McCarthyite harpy like Rachel Maddow as their spokeswoman and exemplar .
Do they want to see the FBI infiltrating political groups and provoking violence ?
Do they think COINTELPRO was n’t wrong in principle – only that it was applied to the wrong groups ?
Do they really want the next Republican administration empowered to target and infiltrate left - wing organizations just as they did in a previous era ?
One does n’t have to agree with the views of the targeted groups and individuals to realize the danger posed by this campaign of political and legal intimidation .
The idea that the government has the right to infiltrate and disrupt the legal political activities of American citizens is outrageous , and needs to be fought tooth and nail by civil libertarians of all persuasions and ‘ isms .
In England , where political speech is not protected , we see the dark future planned for us by American " progressives " : expressions of opinion that are deemed a " threat to public order " are forbidden , and under this general rubric comes any speech that violates the fast - proliferating rules of political correctness .
The Brits , always a few years ahead of us in terms of the latest repressive measures , are pointing the way " forward " – and that ’s " progress " for you .
A particularly egregious case in which the government is trying to semi-criminalize " anti-government " speech is the announcement by something called the " Guardians of the Republics " that thirty US governors must resign or else face " removal . "
The Department of Homeland Security immediately leaped to the defense of these poor beleaguered governors , both Democrats and Republicans , and issued an " intelligence note " to local authorities warning “ law enforcement should be aware that this could be interpreted as a justification for violence or other criminal actions . "
Further steps in this road to revolution include “ establishing bogus courts , calling of ‘ de jure ’ grand juries , and issuing so - called ‘ legal orders ’ to gain control of the state , ” the note said .
Is a group of completely powerless and marginal characters , who believe the federal government has no legal authority , and who argue their case in endless " legal briefs " proving the income tax was never really passed , really giving DHS and thirty governors the frights ?
If so , that says more about the moral and political panic of our elites than it does about the alleged " threat " from these Walter Mittys - of - the - far - right .
In the post - 9/11 era , the temptation to brand your political opponents " terrorists " appears to be overwhelming : both the right and the left have succumbed to it , and shamelessly employed such rhetoric for political gain .
This is a deadly danger to democracy and must be repudiated and fought to the bitter end .
The Hutaree " militia " and the other alleged " extremists " are a pretext for a crackdown on political dissent , and the Richard Nixons of this world are not alone in their propensity for repression .
The ideological component of this anti-" extremist " campaign is a new form of McCarthyism , the McCarthyism of the left , which labels anything deemed " antigovernment " as close to seditious , and employs the same methods as J. Edgar Hoover and the " red squads " of the past .
I ’m surprised that Ms. Maddow , whose show I used to watch faithfully , has capitalized on this odious trend : she should rethink the whole concept of " extremism , " and this linkage of violence to " antigovernment " heresy , and cut out the witch - hunting .
“ They were n’t bad people .
They let me eat , they let me sleep , they gave me my life ” —
A hostage from Flight 847
One way of describing this site would be “ strange beliefs people have and how they got them . ”
A curious footnote that does n’t seem to fit in nicely on any of the other pages is a phenomenon known as the Stockholm Syndrome .
In the summer of 1973 , four hostages were taken in a botched bank robbery at Kreditbanken in Stockholm , Sweden .
At the end of their captivity , six days later , they actively resisted rescue .
They refused to testify against their captors , raised money for their legal defense , and according to some reports one of the hostages eventually became engaged to one of her jailed captors .
This struck some folks as weird , and as a way of coping with this uneasiness , as they started seeing more examples they named this class of strange behavior the “ Stockholm Syndrome . ”
Notorious in the United States is the case of Patty Hearst , who after being kidnapped and tortured by the Symbionese Liberation Army , took up arms and joined their cause , taking on the nom de guerre of “ Tania ” and helping the SLA rob banks .
The Stockholm Syndrome comes into play when a captive cannot escape and is isolated and threatened with death , but is shown token acts of kindness by the captor .
It typically takes about three or four days for the psychological shift to take hold .
A strategy of trying to keep your captor happy in order to stay alive becomes an obsessive identification with the likes and dislikes of the captor which has the result of warping your own psyche in such a way that you come to sympathize with your tormenter !
The syndrome explains what happens in hostage - taking situations , but can also be used to understand the behavior of battered spouses , members of religious cults , Holocaust victims , household pets , and perhaps even users of Internet Explorer .
I think it may also help explain the popularity of government and of the mass institutionalization of young people .
A reader responds ...
Upon reviewing the actual events , it seems that much of the confusion centers around Clark Olafsson ’s involvement .
What really happened ?
A mentally disturbed individual ( Olsson ) tries to hold - up a bank , fails , and ends up taking four hostages .
Olsson then tells the police that he wants his friend ( Olafsson ) to join him , and so , in the interest of a peaceful resolution , Clark agrees to become the second “ captor . ”
The original supposed victim of “ Stockholm Syndrome ” is Kristin Ehnemark , who appears to have kept her head while managing , with Olafsson ’s assistance , to keep Olsson and an army of trigger - happy police from an all - out fire fight .
Here lies the source of the “ syndrome . ”
Olafsson was initially arrested and convicted .
Ehnemark was said to be mentally disturbed for trying to defend him .
The idea that two calm , unarmed people were more effective than a highly trained and lethally outfitted police force was intolerable to 1970 ’s sensibilities .
Many people still have the event hopelessly confused with the terrorist kidnappings of the 1972 Munich Olympics ( source of the misnomer , “ Helsinki Syndrome ” ) .
The botched bank robbery is simply too mundane to be the source of such an exotic explanation , which really seems to have been more of an attack on the idea of peaceful resolution tactics , particularly when applied to mentally disturbed perpetrators ( as if murderers , rapists and armed robbers were not severely dysfunctional ) .
As to whether Stockholm Syndrome applies to customers of abusive service providers ( Microsoft , AOL , Blockbuster Video , etc. ) , I think this is much more akin to the behavior of a battered spouse .
In order to justfy bad choices , people will often rationalize and defend their tormentors , even to the extent of projecting the same aspects onto other people ’s spouses and providers :
“ Her husband really is mean to her , and her Mac crashes just as often as my PC . ”
I have noticed that people usually love their new cars for at least a year , no matter what kind of lemon they ’ve bought : “ Yeah , my Saturn ’s been in the shop a few times , but I still believe in the concept .
By the way , have you seen my new Gateway PC ? ” — MC

WEST ORANGE
-- Logan Svitzer was sitting in his U.S. history class here when his cell phone rang .
He answered , but did n’t understand the person on the other end and hung up .
He subsequently received a text message , which he ignored .
Then the phone rang two more times .
Annoyed by the disruption , Svitzer ’s teacher , Robbin Sweeney , grabbed the cell and called back the number .
On the other end was a man saying he was Lazarous Kapambwe , the Zambian ambassador to the United Nations .
Sweeney was certain it was a prank or a con .
But after 10 minutes on the phone , Sweeney became convinced Kapambwe was telling the truth .
Kapambwe was urgently trying to get a hold of a fellow diplomat from Sierra Leone to discuss a proposed reform of the UN Security Council .
But the phone number he had stored in his phone was one digit off .
" He was eloquent and apologetic , and he had a vast knowledge of Zambia , " Sweeney said .
" I made a deal with him .
I said , ‘ Since you ’ve taken up so much of my class time , why do n’t you come speak to my school ? ’ "
That was in the fall .
Today , Kapambwe went to the school to make amends .
He spoke to about 300 students , encouraging them to consider careers in diplomacy .
" I apologize for what happened , but nothing happens without a purpose , " he said .
" Many of you are about to graduate .
Today I hope I will recruit a few people into diplomatic service . "
Kapambwe spoke cheerfully about his home country of Zambia , which he described as a peaceful place that boasts 74 languages .
Zambia , which is landlocked by Tanzania , Zimbabwe and other larger countries , is about the size of Texas and has about 13 million residents , Kapambwe said .
Zambia is also home to the Victoria Falls , a renowned tourist spot .
Zambia has also had its share of internal strife .
" You remember how in your country you were fighting for your independence ?
Well , we had the same problems , " Kapambwe said .
" We were under colonial rule until 1964 , and for a poor , new country , diplomacy through the United Nations can mean life or death . "
As for the confusing phone call last year that eventually brought Kapambwe to West Orange , they can now laugh about it .
" I learned that anger and annoyance at a wrong phone call will never get you anywhere , " Sweeney said .
" Maybe a wrong call can make you a new friend . "
WASHINGTON — Sen .
John Cornyn , who is spearheading the Republicans ' campaign to take back the Senate , is on a roll .
The GOP snatched a seat in Massachusetts and polls favor Republicans in many key states .
But the genial Texas lawyer is facing an unusual challenge — from one of his own colleagues .
Firebrand conservative Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina , breaking with the Senate 's tradition of deference , is endorsing and funding conservative candidates to challenge the party establishment 's picks .

OpenTTD 1.0.0 2010-04-01
Posted by frosch
6 years .
What were you doing 6 years ago ?
In March 2004 OpenTTD 0.1 was released .
Hardly a month later in April 2004 OpenTTD 0.2 .
And today , six years later ...
OpenTTD 1.0.0 .
It was a lot of work , hundreds of thousands of translations , tens of thousands of commits , thousands of graphics , hundreds of patches , dozen of sounds and musics , and one goal .
How many people contributed ?
Dozen of artists , translators and developers , hundreds of testers and bug reporters , and also the thousands of players .
Looking at the readmes and credit sections only gives a small hint .
Some of those who were main contributors left long ago , and there are only a few who know them all and talked to them once via IRC or the forums .
But if you consider all contributors , including those of the used libraries , and the external artists of OpenSFX ...
Well , then most likely not every contributor actually knows OpenTTD :)
So in the end , what was most fun in the past 6 years of OpenTTD ?
Playing ?
Contributing ?
Modding ?
Talking ?
Or just taking part in a large crowed moving in one direction ?
One direction ?
Well , at least in bigger scope :)
But in more detail there were quite some parties involved in the process .
Sometimes pulling in the same direction , sometimes maybe pulling in slightly different ones .
Let 's just mention some of the projects around OpenTTD which influenced it in this or that direction :
The various integrated builds and patchpacks , first of all the MiniIN .
Then the first Town Growth Challenge , TTDPatch , #openttdcoop , Goal Servers and the big patches ( Subsidiaries , YAPF , YAPP , CargoDist , 32 bpp & ExtraZoom ) .
And not everything which made it into main trunk was happy sunshine , just to mention the first approach to Path Based Signalling , or the attempts around the AI .
But when looking back , most turned out fun .
Thank you !

The problem with messages is that you can't be sure who might pick them up at the other end .
But a new scheme for a quantum communications ensures only a recipient in exactly the right location can read their message .
Advertisement
If banks were to use the new scheme they could send messages that could not be read outside a certain room , confident that only an eavesdropper who had smuggled a quantum receiver inside that room could intercept it , says its inventor Robert Malaney at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia .
Malaney 's system builds on existing quantum communications technology , like that used in a Swiss election in 2007 , where a secure link is established by sharing a secret key encoded using entangled photons .
Advertisement
One of each photon pair is sent to the recipient through an optical fibre , and any attempt to intercept it would alter the behaviour of its quantum twin in a detectable way .
A conventional wireless transmission is then used to send the " key " needed to make sense of the quantum data and establish a secure communications channel .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Location , location , location
Malaney 's new approach becomes different after that wireless key is sent .
This time the originator of the link , Bank A , sends the key in three separate chunks , each via one of three radio masts in known locations surrounding the recipient , Bank B .
Advertisement
Bank A coordinates the transmission of each chunk so that they all reach Bank B at precisely the same time .
Bank B then uses the key to decode the photons and instantly bounce back confirmation via the same three masts to establish the secure link .
Bank A can then use triangulation to verify Bank B's location by measuring the time it took for them to send the confirmation , because signals travel at a known speed through the air .
Advertisement
Crime - proof
" It should be possible to know where Bank B is to within a few metres , " says Malaney , even ignoring the few hundred nanoseconds that photon - detecting equipment takes to decode qubits – bits of quantum data .
Advertisement
Any attempt to masquerade as Bank B while not at the right location is doomed , both because of simple geometry and the more complex intricacies of quantum entanglement .
Even if a lone eavesdropper has hijacked the original entangled photons , it is physically impossible for the miscreant to be closer to all three masts simultaneously than Bank B is .
So there will be a slight delay in receiving at least one chunk of the wireless key and a detectable hold - up in sending the confirmation back to Bank A .
Advertisement
Although a team of three attackers could take up positions between Bank B and each mast to intercept the signals , they still would n't respond promptly enough to fool Bank A .
That 's because the entangled photons cannot be copied .
At least two of the attackers would have to divert their chunk of the wireless key to a third location , containing the photons , to make sense of them , again adding a detectable delay .
Ready to go
Vadim Makarov at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim says it is exciting to hear about the discovery of a new facet to quantum communications , because " this does not happen very often " .
Advertisement
The new idea should be feasible using existing techniques , says Makorov , but the limitations of photon detectors and optical fibre might lead to errors in confirming a recipient 's location , he adds .
Malaney says such problems are not serious .
" It would only make the error a little bigger : instead of knowing where Bank B is to within 2 metres , it might be within 20 metres . "

President Obama is exercising his mojo and is on the move .
For a little more than a year now , Obama has been criticized by America for doing nothing .
The left says he ’s not doing enough and has compromised too much .
The right says he has taken over America on one hand with too much government control and power while on the other hand , claiming he is too weak to do anything , but Obama keeps moving forward .
Obama has accomplished in less than a year and a half into his presidency , actual historic policy changes .
The landmark healthcare bill that the GOP assumed they had finally stopped with the election of the GOP golden boy , Massachusetts Republican senator and former centerfold , Scott Brown .
Brown recently filled Ted Kennedy ’s seat and ended the Democratic majority in the US senate .
Well , the GOP was wrong and they underestimated Obama again .
He did what he had to do .
Health Care Reform had eluded decades of previous administrations .
Since the GOP could n’t stop or destroy Obama , they ’ve made healthcare reform their campaign mantra by using their control of the main media streams to denounce it .
So Obama , as usual , received about a moment of glory for his historic accomplishment that millions of children , women , college students , the elderly , small businesses and those with pre-existing conditions in the America will benefit from .
Advertisements
Soon after that landmark legislation was completed , Obama made a surprise secret trip to Afghanistan to talk with President Karzai and show his support for the American troops .
On the job front , job loss has leveled off and the economy that had fallen off the cliff is recovering .
This President has been criticized for taking on too much , but all these issues have been pressing and Obama has been willing and able to press on .
Recently , President Obama and Medvedev of Russia signed a new and also historic Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty in Prague .
The old one had expired and a new one needed to be established .
Barack Obama has always made it clear how he feels about nuclear weapons and the 21st century .
Contrary to popular opinion , after all he did receive the Nobel Peace Prize for a reason .
It does reduce both world powers ’ nuclear weapons .
This is part of a greater strategy .
How can we continue to expect other nations to be conscious without making adjustments ourselves ?
With this move , Obama continues to push for sanctions against Iran .
There ’s more than enough nuclear power to continue to protect the US if need be .
The goal is more to unite more of the world against Iran or other countries like North Korea who are determined to be rogues in the field of nuclear proliferation .
So after another few moments of historic glory for our new President , the GOP once again begin their never ending attack on Barack Obama , with all the media networks willing to give them more than enough air time to spread their lies , denouncements and fabrications .
How do we count the ways ?
Let ’s start with Newt Gingrich .
Newt says he ’s the most radical President the United States has ever had .
Really ?
The so - called Tea Party calls him Hitler .
The tea party may have some legitimate anger but most of it is leading to dangerous and extreme racial hatred .
Liz Cheney says he apologizes and appeases to other countries .
By the time Bush and Cheney left office , America was seen in a very negative light worldwide .
Obama is simply cleaning up their mess internationally .
Sarah Barracuda and “ media darling ” implies he ’s a kid on the playground who turns the other cheek .
You know how the media reports on everything Palin says as if her fabrications , attacks and rantings have some actual relevance to real governing and policy .
Her wicked one liners only stoke the hatred of the extreme right .
The media actually let her get away with marking a US map with rifle crossbars calling on the so called conservatives to target and reload on all Dems who supported the Health Care Reform Law .
So according to the GOP , is President Obama a powerful monster or a gentle Savior ?
Which is it going to be ?
What is the GOP selling ?
They ’re selling fear of Obama at all costs .
And let ’s look at the left wing liberals .
Their biggest claim is that he has not been liberal enough even though it is quite clear that the Good Ole Boys in the Senate on both sides of the aisle have devised everything in their power to try to stop every policy that Obama tries to get through the congress even when it ’s their own ideas .
So instead of establishing a united front to support the Democratic agenda , most Dems sit quietly while the GOP run wild with false claims and misleading information .
The GOP continues to win the media message with the huge support of all the major networks .
Their base is fired up and the Dems are not .
The Dems are too concerned about losing their positions .
That fact is understandable but they were elected to serve the people and that should be the primary focus , not themselves .
For the left , he has secured Health Care Reform into law , he ’s pushing to end Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell , he ’s helped on mortgages for American homeowners , college loans , a job ’s bill for the unemployed , appointed an extremely qualified Latina female to the Supreme Court , emergency aid for the Haiti earthquake disaster , the credit card accountability act , the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and lot ’s more .
It took a united front to get the Healthcare Bill into Law .
Let ’s come together to get the rest of the work done .
He also met recently with the Black Caucus to address the African American community who has the single highest level of unemployment in the United States .
Next on Obama ’s agenda is making his 2nd appointment to the Supreme Court with the recently announced retirement of the honorable John Paul Stevens who led the charge for the liberal unit of the Supreme Court .
His shoes will be very hard to fill .
The Republicans are already attacking Obama before he even announces a name for the appointment .
They are against whoever that choice may be .
So here comes the next major battle against the President …… the next Supreme Court Judge appointment .
And still he takes time to personally call the union head representing the 29 West Virginia coal miners who tragically lost their lives recently to see what this administration can do to prevent another tragedy such as this one from happening again .
President Obama is not afraid to tackle and address the big issues that face America .
He has to make some compromises because he is the President of the United States of America and not just the liberal wing .
The Democratic Party must unite and get energized behind our President so we can then accomplish more changes and progress for the benefit of this nation .
One of Ireland 's most notorious pedophile priests has been found dead at his home in Curracloe , County Wexford , and police are investigating .
Defrocked priest Donal Collins was picked out in a report on the Wexford diocese as one of the worst abusers of young children .
For a time he was head of St. Peter ’s College , one of the top schools in the country .
In 1966 , the diocese received a complaint of abuse against Collins and he was sent away to England to a London parish .
It was alleged back then he inspected and measured the penises of up to 20 boys in the dormitory of St Peter 's College under the pretext of checking their development .
It was treated then as a " moral failure , " and Collins was incredibly allowed to return to teaching and was later named principal .
In the following 23 years he continuously abused boys at the school .
He was one of 21 priests in the diocese who were eventually highlighted as pedophiles .
In a report on the diocese and the pedophile priests it harbored , Justice Frank Murphy was scathing of the bishop at the time that allowed Collins to return to teaching after he had been sent to England .
He also stated that the then bishop then Donal Herlihy had never informed British authorities of the nature of the offenses against Collins .
In March 1998 Collins was imprisoned for four years for his activities .
He was released after one year on grounds of health .

China overtook the United States for the first time last year in the race to invest in wind , solar and other sources of clean energy , according to a comprehensive new report that raises questions about American competitiveness in a booming global market .
U.S. clean energy investments hit $ 18.6 billion last year , a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts said , a little more than half the Chinese total of $ 34.6 billion .
Five years ago , China ’s investments in clean energy totaled just $ 2.5 billion .
The United States also slipped behind 10 other countries , including Canada and Mexico , in clean energy investments as a share of the national economy .
Although part of the U.S. investment decline last year can be attributed to the deep recession , the Pew report pointed to another factor constraining U.S. competitiveness : a lack of national mandates for renewable energy production or a surcharge on greenhouse gas emissions that would make fossil fuels more expensive .
The report warned that the current U.S. approach , in which states make varied efforts and the federal government ’s efforts have been sporadic , has produced a “ comparatively weak clean energy economy ” -- and that the nation risks losing out on economic growth and job creation .
“ It ’s certainly the case that the countries and areas with higher investment in clean energy will be able to produce more jobs , ” said Chris Lafakis , an economist at Moody ’s Economy.com , which is working with Pew in tracking the green economy and jobs .
Lafakis said investment was the No. 1 factor in green job growth .
Worldwide , the report found clean energy investment more than doubling since 2005 .
Investment levels have already rebounded from the financial crisis and are projected to grow 25 % this year , as nations increasingly seek energy sources that do not emit the heat - trapping gases produced by burning fossil fuels .
The study tallied public and private spending for clean energy equipment and generating capacity as well as venture capital funding of companies involved in green industries and related areas .
The figures are derived from a Bloomberg New Energy Finance database and do not include investments in basic research and development in clean energy .
President Obama has called for federal limits on carbon emissions and mandates for renewable power , promising they will unleash investment and create jobs .
But the faster pace of such investments in other countries is already producing jobs that might otherwise have been created on American soil .
Spain , Germany and Italy have leveraged private clean energy investment , in part , by supporting wind and solar power with sustained financial incentives .
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates , German subsidies from 2004 to 2008 amounted to about $ 74 billion .
In Spain , subsidies from 2006 to 2008 amounted to about $ 53 billion .
In Italy , subsidies from 2007 to 2008 amounted to about $ 9 billion .
Nowhere is the competition as strong as in China , with its globally dominant manufacturing base and wide - ranging government policies promoting clean energy technology .
That reality has drawn significant American corporate investment in China .
Applied Materials Inc. , the Silicon Valley equipment maker for industries including semiconductor firms , last fall opened a huge solar research and development center in the western Chinese city of Xian .
Mark Pinto , the company ’s chief technology officer who recently relocated to Beijing , said China ’s fast - growing solar energy market was the main draw .
China ’s advantages include hard - to - beat government incentives such as low - interest loans and subsidized land , but also a clear policy and strong demand from state - owned utilities that control energy capacity .
“ We have n’t seen this in high - tech manufacturing before , ” Pinto said in a recent interview .
Another home - grown company that is looking to take advantage of China ’s growing manufacturing capabilities in clean energy is Evergreen Solar Inc. , a publicly traded company in Marlboro , Mass. , that is shifting its final assembly of solar panels from its factory in Devens , Mass . , to Wuhan in central China .
“ We ’re going to China as quickly as we can , ” Rick Feldt , Evergreen ’s chief executive , told analysts last month .
Pew reported that the U.S. still leads the world in clean energy innovation and dominates venture capital funding in the sector .
Some analysts say that ’s just as important as investment -- particularly for the question of how to avert catastrophic climate change .
“ The global marathon to reduce greenhouse gas emissions requires a three - legged stool of policy , technology and capital , ” said Tracy Wolstencroft , global head of Environmental Markets at Goldman Sachs .
“ The U.S. is one runner , China is a runner , India is a runner , Europe is a runner , ” he said , adding : “ This is n’t just a competition against each other .
We ’re in a global race to solve the problem . ”

One thing they did n't mention - get a smaller backpack .
It sounds counterintuitive , right ?
Would n't I rather have all that extra space and not use it than need it and not have it ?
Trick question .
Your backpack never has empty space , trust me .
It will consistently be filled to the brim with useless knickknacks you think you might use but only really threw in because you had extra space .
The day I relegated my frame pack to long - term camping only is the day my gear got several pounds lighter and became able to fit into a school backpack .
You do n't realize how little you * need * until you artificially limit the amount of " stuff " you can bring .
Another semi-new device is the 7 - inch Looking Glass Pro Android tablet , which appears to be just the Looking Glass with an " HD screen " and digital TV tuner by default .
The dotted line around this variant 's roadmap window suggests its Q1 2011 release date is n't set in stone ( if it ever comes out , that is ) .
Regardless , we 're rather puzzled by a couple of spots here : the 800 x 600 resolution contradicts with the 800 x 480 in the slides we received , and likewise with the August - October launch window here rather than the November launch date that we were told .
Last but not least , it looks like the Streak will be released in at least three flavors -- the US ( T - Mobile ) and European ( Vodafone ) variants coming in the summer , and a Chinese version shipping in Q4 .
All three major carriers in China -- China Telecom , China Unicom , and China Mobile -- are abbreviated here , so maybe we 'll see three sub-variants to cater the three 3G radios .
Now , we 're not saying these dates are solid -- the previously - mentioned contradictions plus other bits and pieces here ( " Bender " is the old name for ASTRO the file management app ; " Windows Mobile " instead of " Windows Phone 7 " ; Moblin instead of MeeGo ) are tell - tale signs that this is an old roadmap , but hey , at least we get to have a glimpse at the two new netbooks .

Here we have Gaga entering the " Prison for Bitches , " accompanied by two butch - looking ladies , ready to serve her time for the crimes she committed in " Paparazzi . "
YouTube / Vevo
Stripping Gaga of her clothes , they also strip her of her persona , leaving her exposed and vulnerable — naked .
Her sexuality is on full display , but she 's helpless behind bars — a statement about the trappings of fame ( a theme continued from " Paparazzi " ) and society 's entitlement to comment so freely about the sexual identity of its celebrities .
As the guards are leaving , we hear one address the rumors of her gender , saying " I told you she did n't have a dick . "
YouTube / Vevo
Our heroine is then led into the prison yard of lesbians , covered in chains and glasses made of smoking cigarettes — imagery alert !
We also get an image of Gaga 's HeartBeats headphones , from Beats by Dre ( the first of many product placements ) , while someone is busting her song " Paper Gangsta " on the radio .
The song choice is , of course , deliberate ; it 's a song about girl power ( " A superwoman chick you know that I am / Some shit do n't fly by me in a man " ) , and a tirade against flaky men : " Do n't want no paper gangsta / Wo n't sign away my life to someone / Who 's got the flavor but do n't have no follow through . "
YouTube / Vevo
In the end , men are all talk and Gaga is ready for a change — which later prompts her decision to hop on the " Pussy Wagon " ( Tarantino himself suggested she use the iconic truck from Kill Bill ) .
Her smoking glasses are a cloudy veil that obstructs her view of reality , allowing her to base her feelings on senses alone , blurring the genders of the women around her .
YouTube / Vevo
Once chained down by her sexuality as defined by society , we see Gaga shed them and come out in the next scene in full badass - bitch garb .
She stands side - by - side with her true self ( Stefani Germanotta , played here by twin - like 17 year - old sister Natali ) , who eyes the Chanel - donning artist , in all her Diet - Coke - for - hair - rollers - glory .
( Coke ! How Andy Warhol !
And apparently also a nod to her mother 's beauty techniques . )
A chick - fight ensues as Gaga looks on ; she lives in a world where men make women end up in correctional facilities , where they end up turning on each other instead of joining together and embracing girl power .
She 's disgusted .
YouTube / Vevo
The first dance sequence is all about ... honestly , it 's about how skinny Lady Gaga has become .
While she was certainly slim at the start of her Gaga career , her weight was still in the realm of normal , and it was refreshing to see someone in the industry flaunting healthy - looking thighs with such reckless abandon .
That girl has been replaced with the Incredible Shrinking Woman , adhering to cookie - cutter expectations of what pop stars should look like .
How 's that for being a groundbreaking artist ?
Perhaps we need n't look much further to explain the strange accent she 's adopted and her ridiculously slow response time in interviews — this girl is HUNGRY .
It 's also a nod to David LaChapelle , who famously shot her for Rolling Stone and the special limited - edition copies of The Fame Monster . )
LEARN HOW TO START
This is an Asian century , and increasingly companies from across the world , are moving to the continent to be a part of the burgeoning economies of India , China , and other South - east Asian nations .
Here , Singapore , with its advantages of low corporate tax rates , no capital gains , and dividends taxes , high productivity , rule of law , availability of skilled man-power , and strict enforcement of intellectual property rights , provide the most conducive environment for such expansion and incorporation .
To add to the above , company formation in Singapore , gives you the benefits of excellent connectivity and a strategic location , as Singapore ’s Changi International Airport serves over 80 international airlines with connections to more than 330 cities .
Business registration in Singapore is so hassle - free that the country consistently tops the World Bank ’s ease of doing business report .
Singapore was also rated as offering the best IP protection , infrastructure , and incentives in Asia by World Economic Forum ’s Global Competitiveness Report 2015 - 16 .
As regards to the availability of funding after you register a company in Singapore , the country hosts over 128 commercial banks , 31 merchant banks , and 604 capital markets services license holders .
It is also the hub for wealth management and investments in Asia .
To facilitate business and trading across borders , as well as minimize tax barriers , the country has signed over 21 free trade agreements ( FTAs ) with 27 economies and 76 comprehensive avoidance of double tax agreements ( DTAs ) .
The Singapore Government has played its part too in propelling the nation towards a thriving company incorporation ecosystem , with its flagship initiative , Startup SG , which provides a launch pad to entrepreneurs and give them a platform to access local support initiatives as well as connect to the global entrepreneurial network .
If they had hoped the radically changed landscape of British politics would prove a mirage , then both Labour and the Conservatives will be disappointed .
Last night 's TV debate – with Nick Clegg repeating the accomplished performance of the week before – means the two largest parties now have to accept that they are in a new kind of contest from now till polling day .
Any hope that normal service would be resumed has gone .
For Labour , that should prompt a radical conclusion .
A government in power for 13 years cannot hope to win an election that is now all about change .
Instead its best hope surely has to be to maximise its core vote to prevent a collapse into the low 20s on percentage points , a defeat even more absolute than that of 1983 .
That could prompt a shift in message , one that is less about reassuring the one - time New Labour voters of middle England – too many of those are gone now – and more about bringing back home the Labour base .
It will mean an emphasis on those aspects of the manifesto that have so far barely got a mention , reminding lower - income voters of Labour 's promise to introduce a living wage or to cap the interest rates charged by credit card companies .
Such a campaign would be utterly different from the last three Labour has fought , but the game is different now .
It is , realistically , no longer about eking out a majority but losing as few seats as possible .
What few resources the party has – and they are few – should go to on - the - ground organisation , ensuring that Labour gets its voters to the polls .
This is one area where the two " old parties " have an advantage over the Lib Dems , who in many places lack the grassroots machinery to exploit their current surge in support .
The Tories might be tempted by a similar approach , giving up on winning over the golden , swing voters of middle England now seduced by Clegg and seeking to bring out their own core in the hope that it might just be enough .
But , given our electoral system , it wo n't be .
It would n't give the Conservatives anything like a majority .
Instead they have to aim for the same prize they sought before Cleggmania , winning enough new support to sweep to victory .
That means taking on the Lib Dems on the ground they have made their own in the last week , insisting that it is the Conservatives who offer change .
That may once have seemed straightforward for David Cameron , but Clegg has made it a whole lot more difficult .
For the next two weeks , Cameron has to convey the same freshness and urgency as Clegg , all the while suggesting he is the more substantial vehicle for change .
There are some signs of encouragement for him in the details of the post - debate polling .
Populus for the Times found that Clegg 's high scores of a week ago – for example on having the right ideas to take the country forward – fell by some 16 points yesterday .
Inevitably the Lib Dem 's novelty value is fading , allowing Cameron to reassert himself as the agent of change .
As for the Lib Dems themselves , they have to keep on doing what they 're doing , though Clegg has a challenge of his own .
He needs to show he has " another gear " , in the words of one seasoned strategist .
People have liked what they have seen so far , but he needs to show them there 's more .
He is in a wrestling match now with David Cameron , both trying to grab the mantle of change – a contest in which Gordon Brown can only look on .
Atheist Ireland welcomes the statement from Dermot Ahern , the Irish Justice Minister , that he is proposing a referendum this Autumn to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Irish Constitution , along with two other referendums that the government is already committed to .
The Minister has told the Sunday Times that “ I was only doing my duty ” in bringing in the new blasphemy law , and that “ there was an incredibly sophisticated campaign [ against me ] , mainly on the internet . ”
Atheist Ireland thanks everyone who has helped to make the campaign against this new law as effective as it has been to date .
It is now important we maintain the pressure on this issue to ensure that the referendum happens as proposed and , more importantly , that it is won .
We reiterate our position that this law is both silly and dangerous : silly because it is introducing medieval canon law offence into a modern plularist republic ; and dangerous because it incentives religious outrage and because its wording has already been adopted by Islamic States as part of their campaign to make blasphemy a crime internationally .
The following is the text of the article in today ’s Sunday Times :
A GIRL aged six was physically and sexually abused by 23 of her classmates at a British elementary school .
The victim was regularly assaulted by the group of children her own age , within the grounds of the school in Wales , The Sun reported .
The school and the local education authority - both of which cannot be named - said no action could be taken on the abuse because the children involved were below the age of criminal responsibility .
The girl 's mother recalled the terror on her daughter 's face as she revealed what was happening to her .
" She was telling me things that I think every mother dreads to hear from their daughter , " she said .
" It was horrendous what she 'd gone through .
Every day she was being stripped .
She was being physically and sexually abused every day .
And every day she cried out for help and nobody ever came . "
An investigation was launched in a bid to find out why the children allegedly involved in the abuse were free to remain at the school , despite the publication of a serious case review into the allegations .
The review , which began only after the girl moved school , was published a full two years after the allegations first emerged .
It confirmed the assaults took place .
" This is a shocking failure and the bottom line is the family will never know what happened to their child , " said Keith Towler , Children 's Commissioner for Wales .
" We are going to review the serious case review process in Wales to make sure they are much more timely published , within a year of incidents happening , so that we get really clear for everybody involved , what happened , why it happened and what we need to do to put things right . "

Lew Rockwell interviews Michael Boldin , founder and head of the Tenth Amendment Center .
What is the Tenth Amendment , and why should we care ?
( “ Amendment 10 – Powers of the States and People .
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” )
It ’s a linchpin of the states rights phenomenon that is lighting a prairie fire all across the country .
And it is not a “ right - wing movement , ” despite the MSM ’s claims .
Indeed , its most powerful component is the drive to legalize medical marijuana .
( The pro-gun and anti-REAL ID movements are important too , of course ) .
The feds ordered the states to crack down , but they ignored our overlords .
And here is a lesson for all of us .
Electoral politics , except Ron Paul , tends to be a corrupt sham .
Rather than write , call , or fax congressmen or senators , or work to exchange Bum B for Bum A , ignore the federal government as we peacefully resist .
That drains its power .
Like the Devil , it needs our consent .

A man convicted of murdering University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee film student Nathan Potter was wrestled to the ground , pepper - sprayed and taken under guard from a courtroom Friday after he was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole .
Seandell Jackson spat a string of obscenities at Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet as three deputies and Milwaukee police Detective James Hutchinson dragged Jackson to the floor of her courtroom .
Moments before , Jackson 's attorney , Patrick Earle , had asked Dallet to weigh into her sentence the 19 - year - old Jackson 's youth and , as Earle put it , his " lack of impulse control . "
As authorities struggled to subdue Jackson , members of his family stood in the back of the courtroom and taunted Potter 's family .
" I hate you ! " a woman yelled toward the Potters .
" I hate you all ! "
" God 's the judge , " another woman yelled toward Potter 's mother and father , who held each other and wept .
" God 's the judge . "
In February , a jury convicted Jackson , 19 , of being party to a crime of first - degree intentional homicide and attempted robbery in the shooting death of 21 - year - old Potter .
Assistant District Attorney Mark Williams showed Dallet videos of Jackson 's reaction when the jury delivered its verdict .
In the videos , Jackson turns to Potter 's family , mouths an obscenity and smirks .
The video also shows Jackson being led from the courtroom a few minutes after the verdict is announced .
As he reaches the courtroom door , he turns toward Potter 's family and laughs .
" Is there such a thing as pure evil ? " Nathan Potter 's father , John Potter , asked Dallet .
" There is the tape . "
Jackson shot Potter in the chest in July as Potter walked to his Riverwest apartment in the 2500 block of N. Dousman St .
Jackson and an accomplice , Derek J. Thomas , were attempting to rob Potter .
Potter had no money .
Dallet , her voice raspy from the fumes of the pepper spray , also sentenced Jackson to five years in prison for attempted robbery .
In addition , she sentenced Jackson to five years in prison for an unrelated non-fatal shooting that occurred the same day that Potter was killed .
No one was seriously injured in the courtroom melee , though Hutchinson , the chief detective in Jackson 's case , was hit in the eyes by the pepper spray .
Jackson was sentenced in the morning .
Hutchinson was back in Dallet 's court for Thomas ' sentencing in the afternoon .
So was Sarah Potter , Nathan Potter 's 13 - year - old sister .
She told her mother and father that she had been afraid someone was trying to kill them during the morning fracas .
Gulping back tears , Sarah told Dallet that she and her 11 - year - old brother , David - who has autism - cannot understand why anyone would even hurt her older brother , whom she called " a loving and caring man . "
" We can't sleep knowing he 's gone , " she said , sitting at the defense table beside her father .
John Potter said later that David wants him to keep all the lights on in their home all the time .
" He asked me to remove all the windows , " John Potter said .
Thomas , 20 , pleaded guilty in March to felony murder .
Williams told Dallet that Thomas played a limited role in the murder .
" Mr. Jackson was the shooter , " Williams said .
" Mr. Thomas was a follower . "
While Williams asked Dallet to sentence Thomas to 12 years in prison , Nathan Potter 's mother , Denise Potter , said he deserved to the maximum penalty for felony murder , which is 35 years .
" ' Help me ! ' ( were ) the last words he ever said , " Denise Potter said .
" Derek did nothing , " she said .
" They ran away . "
Dallet followed Williams ' recommendation , adding eight years of extended supervision .
People have been toking up in the Cow Palace parking lot for more than 50 years .
This was the first time it was legal .
The International Cannabis and Hemp Expo , the first trade show in the United States to allow on - site pot smoking , attracted an estimated 15,000 enthusiasts to Daly City over the weekend .
They talked bud , sold products ranging from a $ 500 water bong to a $ 19,500 mobile grow house , and discussed how efforts to legalize marijuana would impact their livelihoods .
" We 're exercising our rights as patients to peacefully gather , " said Bob Katzman , chief operating officer of the expo , as he stood near the designated puffing area .
" We 're here to talk about changing some of the existing laws , but we 're not here to break the law . "
Katzman said it took organizers four years to negotiate a permit with a venue that would allow marijuana consumption .
It was n't possible , he said , until a " massive change in the political climate . "
That climate is set to be tested in November , when an initiative that would legalize marijuana is to be decided by California voters .
Now , marijuana is available only to those with a medicinal use card .
Such cards were easy to attain at the exposition .
For $ 99 - cash only - attendees such as Shawna Spencer of San Jose received a temporary " recommendation " from doctors that allowed her to smoke at the event .
Spencer , who said she suffers from bipolar disorder , said she had waited for more than an hour .
" It 's worth the wait because I need it , " Spencer said .
Dr. Daniel Susott said he expected to sign off on 1,600 people by the end of the weekend .
He said a portion of the fees would go to charity .
" We 're making history today , " he said as his visitors complained of chronic pain , depression and insomnia , among other ailments .
" We 're operating within the guidelines of Prop. 215 and helping people get the medical marijuana they need . "
If marijuana becomes legal , Susott expects that his patients will self - prescribe .
" People will start growing their own medicine in their homes , " he said .
" And the big pharma companies are n't going to like it . "
For those concerned with the conspicuous equipment needed to grow plants inside the home , Tim Ellis of Orange County had the solution :
An 18 - foot trailer that can yield up to 6 pounds of pot every two months .
The Grow n' Mobile starts at $ 19,500 .
Ellis , a father of two , said he had the family grower in mind - a person who desires to cultivate outside the house , but in a secure location .
Showing off every detail of his invention , Ellis said he rigged the trailer 's hitch so thieves would need a blowtorch to hook the trailer to their own truck .
Fumes are routed through a charcoal filter .
And the roof has an infrared shield to thwart weed - hunting helicopters .
" Ca n't steal it , ca n't smell it , ca n't find it , " Ellis said , offering his sales pitch .
" Built by a grower for a grower .
Grow mobile ! "
The event hosted a panel discussion Saturday on how legalization would impact large California growers .
A contingent from Humboldt County argued against the ballot initiative , complaining it could devastate a key local industry .
" Radical " Russ Belville , the outreach coordinator for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , said that if California 's initiative passed , he expected home - growers to enter the market and drive prices down .
But he was unsympathetic to the group from Humboldt County .
" To that end , I would say , ' Tough , ' " Belville said .
" We should have to put people in prison so you can continue to make a living ? "
Badu stripped and re-enacted the shooting of John F Kennedy
US neo -soul singer Erykah Badu has been charged with disorderly conduct for stripping naked on a street among pedestrians for her music video shoot .
She ended by re-enacting receiving a fatal gunshot to the head at the spot in Dallas where President John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 .
Sergeant Warren Mitchell said Badu was charged after a witness offered a sworn statement to police on Thursday .
Badu 's spokeswoman had no immediate comment on Friday .
The singer , who was born in Dallas , performed a walking striptease in front of tourists and pedestrians during the shoot in Dealey Plaza on 13 March for her video for the song Window Seat .
Sgt Mitchell added that the police department has had " people calling from all across the country to express their concern " .
" Having a fact witness that was there , is what let us file the charges , " he said .
" After much discussion , we feel that these charges best fit her conduct .
She disrobed in a public place without regard to individuals and small children who were close by . "
He said Badu can either fight the charge or pay the fine .
Disorderly conduct is punishable by a fine of up to $ 500 ( £ 328 ) .
Witness Ida Espinosa , 32 , declined to comment to The Associated Press on Friday .
ROME —
In his most direct reference to the sexual abuse crisis that has reached the Vatican , Pope Benedict XVI said Thursday that it was necessary for Christians to “ repent ” in light of “ the attacks of the world , which speaks to us of our sins . ”
But in an approach typical of the tough - minded yet media - averse theologian , Benedict aimed his message directly at the church , offering his remarks in an off - the - cuff homily at a small , untelevised Mass at the Vatican .
“ I have to say that we Christians , even in recent times , have often avoided the word ‘ repentance , ’ which seems too harsh , ” Benedict said at a Mass later broadcast on Vatican Radio .
“ Now under the attacks of the world , which speaks to us of our sins , we see that the ability to repent is a grace , and we see how it is necessary to repent , that is , to recognize what is wrong in our life , ” he added .
This has always been an integral part of the sport ; you need look no further than the playoffs , when it is an accepted norm to grow facial hair , much to the chagrin of some younger players .
Playoff hockey is not only the most important time of the hockey season , but it often seems as if players have mysteriously elevated their play , when logically they should be most weary , following the onslaught of the regular season .
The only physical difference between playoff and regular season ?
Mandatory facial hair .
I know that many people find facial hair inconvenient , scratchy , or visually offensive , but what if hockey players kept just a little ... on the upper lip perhaps ?
Those looking for further evidence might examine the case of the Calgary Flames ’ Ian White .
Drafted by the Leafs in 2002 , this fresh - faced youngster played his way to the big team for the 2006 - 2007 season .
In his first season , he put up 26 points and was a +8 on the year , very respectable for a rookie defender on a team that missed the playoffs .
The next year however , his numbers dropped , a common effect of the sophomore slump , Ian had only 21 points , while playing 5 more games than the previous year , and was a - 9 for the season .
By the time the 2008 - 2009 season rolled around , White was looking to regain his form , and a big change came when White was part of a colon cancer campaign called Movember ( more on this later ) in which he grew a moustache for charity .
White ’s game elevated and the moustache never left .
The results , another 26 point season and this time a +9 rating on the year on a team that finished 12th in the Eastern Conference .
It might be tempting to argue that he was a 24 year - old who was maturing and coming into his own in the NHL .
Or you could just get lost in the epic lip growth that propelled him to his best season so far .
Fast forward to this season ,
White is on pace for 37 points and was just traded ( with some commoners ) for Dion Phaneuf , one of the best defenseman in the game .
Not convinced of the importance of the moustache to Ian ’s game ?
Just check out the way it blocks the puck from hitting his face in this game against the Rangers ( skip ahead to about the 1 minute mark ) .
Note :
White has recently reverted to bare - face , sorry Flames fans .
Speaking of Movember , this is a huge charity event each November , where participants ( Mo Bros ) start clean - shaven and grow moustaches through the month , gathering donations from their friends and families in exchange for being seen with these now extremelygood - looking gentlemen .
Quite a few hockey teams have supported this with large groups of Leafs , Oilers , Thrashers and Wild players growing one out for charity .
Although these are teams that are perhaps not the best in the standings , it does show an underlying desire of the players to grow moustaches , so there would be little resistance if the muzzy became mandatory ( although the creepiness of Olli Jokinen ’s stache might have to be banned ) .
For further support of the stache , just look at the NHL legends who have sported a soup strainer during their career , these have been men feared for their reckless and vicious nature .
Just look at Eddie “ The Entertainer ” Shack .
He was once ejected from a game for fighting with Larry Zeidel .
After his ejection he showered , and then sat in the crowd to watch the end of the game .
Apparently Zeidel wanted to watch from the stands too , but Shack was having none of that , and renewed the fight amongst the fans .
Another feared enforcer was the pushbroom - sporting Wendel Clark .
Wendel was just as feared for the shots from his stick as from his fists .
I mean , the man was drafted at the age of 18 with a moustache that made Tom Selleck openly weep !
( as this video should make you do as well )
Even today , the Ducks George Parros has made a name for himself , based solely on the fact that he is a moustachioed fighter .
The man has scored 11 goals in 277 career games but has stayed around the big club , based on 664 career penalty minutes ( that ’s 132 fights worth , so basically a fight every other game ) .
I mean , how would you like your chances if the man you ’re fighting has thicker hair on his lip than Matt Stajan ’s head ?!
Not good .
Gary Bettman is constantly explaining ( see : whining ) that the NHL needs to reach a broader market , and be more appealing to a wider demographic .
Well Gary , my suggestion would be to stop trying to put a team in every state that ’s never even experienced ice before , let alone hockey , and try my strategy out for size .
Mandatory season - long moustaches .
I guarantee people will tune in , and if the NHL cross-merchandises with a moustache comb company , their financial woes would be no more .
So I say , put down that razor , NHL superstars , and let your lip runneth over .
What ’s the worst that can happen ?! ...
Possibly lip -crabs .
Oh , also Lanny McDonald had a moustache , but the Leafs traded him for a bag of pretzels back in 1979 so we wo n’t go there ...

Brazil awards a domestic consortium the massive Belo Monte Amazon dam amid protests from environmental and indigenous rights activists Reuters
Indigenous leaders in Brazil are warning of imminent violence after a successful tender for the rights to construct a giant hydro-electric plant in the Brazilian Amazon which opponents claim will wreak havoc on the rainforest and its inhabitants .
The tender for the Belo Monte dam , on the Xingu river in the state of Pará , was won by a consortium of Brazilian companies on Tuesday , taking the government one step closer towards the construction of the £ 7bn dam , which would reputedly be the third biggest of its kind , with the capacity to produce some 11,000 MW of power .
One Brazilian minister told reporters that the president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , was pleased with the result .
But environmentalists , indigenous leaders and their supporters , including Avatar 's director , James Cameron , who has made two recent visits to the region , have vowed to fight to prevent construction .
The Kayapó leader Raoni Metuktire , who gained international exposure in the 1980s and 1990s touring the world with Sting , said indigenous men from the Xingu were preparing their bows and arrows in order to fight off the dam .
" I think that today the war is about to start once more and the Indians will be forced to kill the white men again so they leave our lands alone , " he said .
" I think the white man wants too much , our water , our land .
There will be a war so the white man cannot interfere in our lands again . "
Luis Xipaya , another of the region 's indigenous leaders , told Reuters : " There will be bloodshed and the government will be responsible for that . "
Plans to build a towering hydro-electric dam on the Xingu were conceived in the 1970s but have repeatedly stalled , partly as a result of international pressure .
However , renewed attempts to push ahead with the dam , part of a massive government drive to boost economic growth , have revived fears for thousands of indigenous people who live in the region .
" I do not accept the Belo Monte dam , " said the indigenous leader Mokuka Kayapó , who claimed the indigenous way of life would be destroyed .
" The forest is our butcher .
The river , with its fish , is our market .
This is how we survive . "
Many residents of Altamira , a sleepy Amazonian city on the banks of the Xingu near the site of the planned dam , also fear social chaos with the influx of thousands of impoverished workers .
Antonia Melo , a local human rights activist from the Xingu Para Sempre movement , described the dam as a human rights violation .
" We will all be affected by over 100,000 people who will arrive in the region as a result of Belo Monte .
There will be violence , a lack of food , of sewage , of health services , " she warned .
Local newspapers report that immigrants have already started arriving in the region from as far away as Rio de Janeiro and Brazil 's deep south in search of business opportunities and work .
Not all Brazilians oppose the dam .
Many argue that Belo Monte will create jobs as well as electricity , while one major newspaper suggested that the plant would help attract foreign tourists to the region .
" I'm in favour of it and if the government does what it promises , giving us new homes , people will have more opportunities .
It will be good for us because the city will develop more , " Claudionor Alves de Oliveira , an Altamira carpenter , told the G1 news site .
On Tuesday activists from Greenpeace dumped several tonnes of manure outside the National Electric Energy Agency in Brasilia , where the bidding took place .
Sheila Juruna , an indigenous activist leading the anti-Belo Monte campaign , contrasted Brazil 's attempts to restore order in Haiti , through its UN stabilisation force , with its treatment of the country 's indigenous peoples .
" Our government is helping other countries where disasters are happening .
But here in Brazil they are destroying us , " she said .
Speaking in Brazil last week , James Cameron called the dam an ecological disaster and said there were alternatives .

West Virginia Open to Homicide Prosecution for Massey Coal Mine Deaths
24 Corporate Crime Reporter 16 , April 16 , 2010
For years , the state of West Virginia was proud to say that it was “ open for business . ”
In a twist , now it might be open for a homicide prosecution in connection with the deaths of 29 miners at the Massey Energy mine in Raleigh County , West Virginia earlier this month .
“ If there is evidence to support a homicide prosecution , I would not hesitate to prosecute , ” Kristen Keller , the prosecuting attorney for Raleigh County told Corporate Crime Reporter last week .
Keller says she has been in touch with the West Virginia State Police on the matter .
And she says that any federal regulatory investigation would not preclude a state homicide investigation .
“ A federal regulatory investigation does not satisfy the need for a state criminal investigation , ” Keller said .
“ If there were a car accident where one or ten or 29 people were killed – a federal investigation would not preclude a state criminal investigation .
In fact , there would be a state criminal investigation . ”
Twenty - nine miners died at Massey ’s Upper Big Branch mine in Raleigh County as the result of an explosion on April 5 .
Since then , there have been calls for both federal and state criminal prosecution .
Bob Franken , wrote an article last week for The Hill titled “ Murder in the Coal Fields ? ”
“ Plain and simply , the police and prosecutors need to pursue this case , ” Franken wrote .
“ And if those who run Massey can be shown to be culpable beyond a reasonable doubt , they need to be thrown into prison .
The sentence for involuntary manslaughter , as just one possible charge , in West Virginia , is a year in prison .
For each case . ”
West Virginia has an involuntary manslaughter statute .
Here ’s the state ’s definition : “ Involuntary manslaughter involves the accidental causing of death of another person , although unintended , which death is the proximate result of negligence so gross , wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life . ”
Under West Virginia law , reckless disregard is something more than ordinary or simple negligence .
It is negligence that consciously ignores the safety of others .
And so the question is – do Massey ’s actions at the Upper Big Branch mine meet the standard for reckless disregard ?
The Charleston Gazette ’s Ken Ward Jr. reported last week that three months before last week 's deadly explosion , “ Massey Energy managers at the Upper Big Branch Mine told workers ‘ not to worry ’ that the flow of air in the mine – meant to control deadly gases and coal dust – was headed in the wrong direction . ”
The comment was made in January , when state and federal inspectors were battling Massey over what Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) and the state Office of Miners ' Health , Safety and Training said were major ventilation problems .
“ When questioned , Terry Moore , mine foreman , said he knew of [ the ] condition and that he asked Everett Hager , superintendent , about it and he was told not to worry about it , ” the MSHA inspector , whose name was not released , wrote in his official notebook , the Gazette reported .
“ When mine ventilation moves in the wrong direction , that ’s a big deal , ” Dan Heyman , a stringer for the New York Times based in Charleston told Corporate Crime Reporter last week .
“ The inspector was complaining to the foreman that the ventilation was moving in the wrong direction and it was not being fixed . ”
“ The foreman at the company went to the mine supervisor and was told not to worry about it , ” Heyman said .
“ That ’s really a smoking gun . ”
“ Inspectors have told me that it ’s a constant tug of war trying to get Massey to obey the rules , ” Heyman said .
Over the past two decades , there have been a number of criminal manslaughter prosecutions around the country for worker deaths
In the 1980s , every time a worker died on the job in Los Angeles County , the district attorney would send out a team to investigate the case for a possible manslaughter investigation .
And many successful homicide prosecutions were brought against companies and executives as a result .
We asked Heyman what impact he thought the 29 coal miner deaths have on public opinion in West Virginia .
“ I ’ve been surprised as to how these things will settle back down , ” Heyman said .
“ I thought the coal industry was in terrible trouble after the Sago mine accident that took 12 lives .
And for a time , it was .
But eventually , it begins to try to exercise the influence that it always had in the state . ”
“ This feels a bit different this time .
At least in the worlds of journalism and politics that I follow – inside the equivalent of the West Virginia beltway – I sense a willingness to get tough .
I do n’t know whether that will result in criminal charges .
But there have been a couple of op - eds in the states ’ largest newspapers calling for criminal prosecutions . ”
“ We have also seen people saying publically that the coal industry in general is bad for the state of West Virginia – which is tantamount to heresy .
Many have thought these things , but there has n’t been a willingness to voice it . ”
“ There was a lot more shock and dismay in 2006 , because it seemed like such a surprise .
This time , there is less rhetoric and more anger . ”
Heyman says that coal still has its supporters .
“ People who are tied into the economy – successful local business owners – will say – this is the only thing that brings money into our area , ” Heyman said .
“ I was making this point to another reporter – that there is a split – between people like car dealers , who are successful and tied into the American dream in a sense – and people who live on the margins .
I was saying the successful businessmen are much less likely to criticize Massey . ”
“ And he went and talked to a local prominent businessman in Raleigh County .
And that businessman refused to talk with him because he said – there is so much anger at the company , that if his customers heard him on the air saying good things about Massey and Blankenship , that it would blow back on him . ”
“ That ’s the reverse of what we would have seen in the past .
So , there ’s a power dynamic .
And there is a tipping point where the king loses control of the kingdom .
And then everything goes to hell for him .
I do n’t know if we are at that point . ”
“ Yes , coal is king in West Virginia .
But it ’s never been a peaceful kingdom .
There has been a long history of conflict and dispute and even violence between the coal industry and workers or environmentalists .
It ’s always a very restive situation . ”
Last week , an editorial in the Mountain Eagle newspaper of Whitesville , Kentucky asked the question – Why Do Miners Die ?
And the paper answered this way :
“ They die because of negligence .
They die because the company they work for cares more about running coal than making mines safe .
And they die because the federal agency that is charged with protecting them fails in its mission . ”
“ The mine was projected to earn $ 145.6 million for Massey this year , and nothing was going to get in the way of meeting that goal .
Massey CEO
Don Blankenship has dismissed any and all criticism as the work of ‘ the enemies of coal . ’
He ’s God , in short , and you ’re not . ”
In a now infamous 2005 memo , Blankenship wrote this to his workforce :
“ If any of you have been asked by your group presidents , your supervisors , engineers , or anyone else to do anything other than run coal ( i.e. build overcasts , do construction jobs , or whatever ) you need to ignore them and run coal . ”
The following year , a deadly fire broke out at another Massey mine , Aracoma , killing two men .

Nick Fry has defended Michael Schumacher after a slow start to the season has led to widespread criticism in the European press .
Schumacher has been outpaced by Mercedes team - mate Nico Rosberg at all three qualifying sessions and races this season , and Italy 's La Gazzetta dello Sport points out that the only other driver with a full 3 - 0 defeat in 2010 is the Renault 's rookie Vitaly Petrov .
The German daily Bild 's latest headline is ' Der Schumi - Absturz ' ( ' The Fall of Schumi ' ) , with the article adding that Rosberg is now Mercedes ' " new No. 1 " .
But Fry said Schumacher is working back up to full strength and said that his experience and input this year have been invaluable for the team .
" Every race he is learning a little bit more and it is all coming together slowly but surely , which is probably what you would expect , " the Briton is quoted as saying by the Press Association .
" I would not underestimate him .
Michael is , for me , quite remarkable .
The level of feedback he gives is something that I have never seen before , and is just not in the debriefs .
When you have the headphones on you hear amazing things .
In qualifying he was driving around almost giving a commentary .
The FIA , who also listen , was also very impressed a driver can do that . "
Late Thursday night the U.K. Parliament passed the controversial Digital Economy Bill , which grants the U.K. government sweeping new powers to control access to the Internet .
The Digital Economy Bill has been the subject of heavy entertainment industry lobbying and widespread concern amongst U.K. citizens and telecommunications companies because it included provisions that would allow the U.K. government to censor websites considered " likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright , " and disconnect the Internet connection of any household in the U.K. with an IP address alleged to have engaged in copyright infringement .
Despite the many concerns expressed with the Bill 's provisions , including questions by some Members of Parliament about whether these provisions could be used to block access to the Wikileaks website , the bill was rushed through Parliament -- apparently with several amendments that we 're still assessing -- after only two hours of debate in a special late - night " wash - up " session .
If you 're in the U.K. , we encourage you to join the Open Rights Group 's campaign and express your views to your MPs now .
You might also want to switch to an Internet Service Provider that understands the implications of the Digital Economy Bill and is willing to commit to protecting your civil liberties , like Talk Talk .
Lionel Messi celebrates scoring against Arsenal during the Champions League quarter - final
Cesc Fabregas , for example , is certainly made of the right stuff .
No second opinion required .
That is the good news .
The bad news for Arsenal fans as Barcelona are rumoured to be considering a £ 50 million bid in the summer is that Messi diagnoses a severe case of blue and scarlet blood .
“ Cesc has a place for Arsenal in his heart , but he has Barcelona in his blood , ” is his verdict .
“ He will want to win the biggest prizes in football , and I expect him to do that at Barcelona .
“ I do n’t exactly know when that will be , but I expect him to be my Barcelona team - mate again at some point .
“ I am sure that Arsene Wenger and Cesc have a father - son relationship and I know that he has a very special relationship with the Arsenal fans .
“ When you grow up at a club , it is more than just a club .
The coaches , the players , the people in the club will be like family .
“ But Barcelona is his city and it is the club of him and his family .
There are only a few players in the world who can improve this squad we have but Cesc is one of them . ”
Fabregas was 15 when he left the Nou Camp in 2003 but he was only allowed to go in the first place because his route to the first team was baulked by Xavi and Andres Iniesta – although even then he stood out , according to Messi , by not trying to .
“ Nobody would really know how to play against him , ” he said .
“ We played together and at that age you want to stay on the ball and do something special .
“ But Cesc would just calmly look up and see a pass that nobody else on the field could see .
It would completely split the defence .
You have to work hard in training to be the best , but to see what Cesc sees on a football pitch – you are born with it .
“ You can try to learn as much as you want , but you will never be taught how to see a pass the way he can . ”
The prospect of the pair of them being thrown together again in the future sends a shudder down the spine of European football .
Just how much better can Barcelona – the team who have shrugged off Manchester United , Arsenal and Chelsea in the last 12 months – get ?
“ We have proved just how strong the squad is , ” said Messi , 22 .
“ Last year was amazing for the players , the coach , the fans , and everybody involved with the club .
“ When you win everything , though , the only thing that can match it is winning everything again .
That is the aim of this football club .
“ I have already said this team can go down in the history books .
What we did last year was special , but to go down as the best ever we need to keep doing it and I believe we can .
“ I do n’t believe we will be remembered for just what we won , but how we won it .
I hope people enjoy watching us and I hope people in 50 years will talk about how this football team played the game .
“ This Barcelona team have a chance to go down in not just recent history , but in football history . ”
Trophies , trophies , trophies , Same old , same old , same old .
But is n’t the Premier League supposed to be the place to play ?
Messi , though , has a special reason to stay just where he is , one that marks him out far too easily from many of his peers in the money - obsessed game of 2010 .
The reason is loyalty .
Until rescued by Barcelona , he came within inches – quite literally – of being thrown on the football scrapheap as a young boy in Argentina .
A dozen inches , to be precise .
Now 5ft 7in in his socks , doctors in his home country predicted his hormone condition would never allowed him to stretch beyond 4ft 7in – far too small to be able to express himself in the professional game .
Even as a 10 - year - old in Newell ’s Old Boys junior side in his home town of Rosario , Messi looked at least two years younger than every one of his team - mates .
His father , Jorge , was able to cover two years ’ of growth hormone replacement treatment under the terms of his health insurance , but the policy refused to stump up after that .
The £ 500 - a- month bill was also beyond his club and it seemed Messi ’s career could have been over before it really started .
That is where Barcelona came in .
Time as well as money was spent over the next four years until he was considered ready to break into the first team .
So it is no surprise that this shy but warm and curiously likeable young man now has such a tight bond with his surrogate parents .
“ I will always be grateful to Frank Rijkaard because he gave me a chance in the first team when I was just 17 , ” said Messi .
“ At that point I know there were a lot of people telling him that I was never going to be big enough .
If he was proved wrong there would have have been a lot of people telling him he was wrong , so it ’s a big thank - you to him for giving me the chance he did .
One of Africa 's most eminent political figures has condemned Britain for taking a patronising " big brother " attitude to its former colonies .
Graça Machel , a founder member of the Elders group of world leaders and the wife of Nelson Mandela , warned British politicians to " keep quiet " about countries such as Zimbabwe and let African diplomacy take its course .
Machel , 64 , is a former first lady of Mozambique , where she served as education minister , and has won numerous international awards for her advocacy of women 's and children 's rights .
In an interview with the Guardian in Johannesburg , she indicated that the crisis in Zimbabwe has revealed the shortcomings of a persistent imperialist mindset .
" Can I be a little bit provocative ? "
Machel said .
" I think this should be an opportunity for Britain to re-examine its relationship with its colonies .
To acknowledge that with independence those nations will want to have a relationship with Britain which is of shoulder to shoulder , and they will not expect Britain to continue to be the big brother .
" When a nation is independent , there is no big brother .
They are partners .
Part of the reason why Britain finds it difficult to accept Zimbabwe is precisely because that relationship of a big brother is influencing [ efforts ] to try to understand . "
Britain , along with the EU and US , has imposed travel restrictions and asset freezes on Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe and his political and business allies .
It has defied calls from South Africa to end these measures for the sake of the power sharing agreement between Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Earlier this year David Miliband , the foreign secretary , said the UK would be " guided by what the MDC says to us about the conditions under which it is working and leading the country " .
Critics said this handed Zanu - PF a propaganda coup , allowing it to portray the MDC as a puppet of Britain and blame it for sanctions .
Machel added : " I 'm not saying things are OK , they 're all fine in Zimbabwe .
I 'm saying a different kind of dialogue , a different kind of bridge to try to understand the other side could have produced a different result from what it is .
" The more the British shout , the worse the situation will be in terms of relationship with Zimbabwe .
That 's why sometimes I really question , when something happens in Zimbabwe and Britain shouts immediately .
Ca n't they just keep quiet ?
Sometimes you need just to keep quiet .
Let them do their own things , let SADC ( Southern African Development Community ) deal with them , but keep quiet , because the more you shout , the worse [ it is ] . "
Asked if Britain 's attitude is patronising to its former colonies , Machel replied : " I 'm afraid so .
And what I 'm saying is they have expectations which do not always coincide with what are the aspirations and expectations of those who are their former colony .
" When you change the relationship , you just have to give yourself to take the humility to stop and listen .
And when you listen , then you take into account the other side .
You put your case , then you take the other side .
In a way , you harmonise interests of both sides . "
Zimbabwe will mark 30 years of independence this weekend .
Britain remains politically and economically influential and denies Mugabe 's claim that it reneged on promises to fund the redistribution of land to the black majority .
Mugabe 's response , the chaotic seizure of white - owned farms , has been blamed for the collapse of Zimbabwean agriculture .
Machel , whose first husband was the late Mozambique president Samora Machel , called on Britain to take a broader view of the African continent .
" That 's one of the issues , particularly with the British people : because of the emotional attachment they have with Zimbabwe , in many cases they define the continent in terms of Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe is one country among 53 countries , so you have all the rest of 52 countries .
Well , let us put aside Somalia also , which is a failed state .
But you have 50 countries who are running a relatively normal situation in the continent .
" I would like to raise with you the issue that yes , Zimbabwe has failed , and it is hurting British people directly , but there 's much , much more to Africa than Zimbabwe . "
Machel , who became Mandela 's third wife in 1998 , also accused developed countries of double standards on CO 2 emissions and climate change .
" This has been very clearly stated at the negotiations to Copenhagen .
They know – the developing world , including China – that Africa has very small responsibility in the impact of climate change , but Africa is the one paying the highest price . "
Britain 's intentions are still treated with scepticism in Zimbabwe , even among some members of the MDC .
Eddie Cross , policy co-ordinator general of the MDC , said : " Perfidious Albion .
I tell you , you Brits have a well - deserved reputation for perfidity in your colonial relations …
I think Britain 's always been very sophisticated in its relations with its former colonies – it's got more experience than any other state in the world – but it does n't necessarily make them right .
" Britain 's role in the last 10 years has often been difficult for us in the MDC to interpret and read .
Sometimes they 've backed certain initiatives in Zimbabwe which have not been helpful in terms of pursuing a principled transfer of power and I think sometimes the Brits regard us as being rather naïve in the MDC and they have a rather jaundiced view of Africa and African politics . "
But Cross , an economist and MP , added that other European powers probably behaved worse : " Samora Machel once said to me : ' If you were to choose to be colonised , you would never choose to be colonised by the Portuguese . '
The colonial record was pretty dismal .
For the British it was probably the best . "

MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow struck back on Thursday against the charge by Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) that she is “ demonizing ” him “ on the basis of emotion ” over his attempts to block an extension of unemployment benefits .
In defending himself against his critics on Wednesday , Coburn had singled out Maddow , saying , “ Look at Rachel Maddow .
She comes at me on the basis of emotion .
She demonizes me .
I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want conservatives to win on the basis of emotion .
If we lower ourselves to the level they operate on , we hurt ourselves and our arguments . ”

One typical reaction to Coburn ’s remarks came from blogger Julie Gulden at Daily Kos , who wrote , “ Can anyone here tell when Rachel has been emotional ?
I ’ve seen her frustrated with the Acorn reporting , yet she remained calm , cool and concise .
Have you ever seen her get red in the face and blubber incoherently ?
Is this just Republican speak for ‘ she ’s a woman ’ ? ”
Maddow , however , was more than capable of defending herself .
As Jake Simpson noted in his blog at the Atlantic , “ Evidently , Coburn missed the memo that attacking Maddow can lead to serious repercussions . …
The normally reserved Maddow turned pugilistic , mocking Coburn ’s claim that she attacked him on a emotional level .
With her voice ‘ catching ’ and her eyes ‘ tearing up , ’ Maddow turned in an emotional performance worthy of a satire . ”
“ I become so blindingly enraged , ” Maddow said on Wednesday , “ and then hysterically upset and then inconsolably morose and then hyperactively giddy and then happy and then mad and then happy again that I could n’t make sense of any of the facts I was gathering . ….
But I promise tomorrow I will gather myself and offer a full analysis of today ’s Tom Coburn news . ”
By Thursday , however , Maddow had shifted gears from simply parodying “ female ” hysteria and had marshaled her facts to portray Coburn as the real hysteric .
She began by disputing Coburn ’s claim that extending unemployment benefits is merely a matter of pity .
“ Paying unemployment benefits is n’t just a ‘ nice ’ thing to do , ” she explained calmly .
“ It ’s one of the single most economically stimulative things that government can spend money on .
…
Keeping unemployment benefits going is a no- brainer . ”

Maddow then turned to portraying Coburn as a hypocrite who “ has objected to the Senate passing an extension of unemployment benefits … on the ostensibly principled basis that these benefits are not explicitly paid for .
…
Which is neat , and which would be totally principled , were it not for Senator Coburn ’s history of voting for plenty of things that are n’t paid for . ”
“ Senator Coburn has now gone — out of the blue — after me , ” Maddow continued , “ gone after the way that I have talked about him and these problems on this show . ”
She quoted Coburn ’s attack , then commented sweetly , “ Maybe he does have a point . … I am notoriously histrionic .
And he is so calm , so cool , so tranquil . ”
Maddow immediately contradicted that statement with a series of clips of Coburn attempting to stir up hysterical fears over health care reform and even “ urging people to pray that a fellow senator might die , or at least be incapacitated , ahead of the health reform vote last December . ”
She also showed Coburn chocking up and fighting back tears when decrying “ mindless partisanship ” at the confirmation hearings for Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005

“ Senator , I understand you are an emotional guy , ” Maddow concluded sympathetically .
“ I do n’t begrudge you that .
…
But I think you might be projecting here .
I do n’t feel at all emotional about you .
…
It ’s not personal . …
I am reporting on your record — and this is what that feels like . ”

You can now get full - size reproductions of Doctor Who 's most famous mechanical nemesis - The Dalek .
This Planet Earth was able to get their hands on some of the BBC 's prized props and the result is a series of bang - on replicas .
I did n't realize that Daleks are a lot like cars - they came in a seemingly endless array of colors with a dazzling assortment of lumpy colored accessories .
The price ?
Around £ 2000 .
The manufacturer 's FAQ helpfully explains how you can convince your spouse to let one of these mechanical monsters through the door :
" You can either tell them before you receive the Dalek or surprise them when it arrives .
If you tell them before , explain that it is an investment .
No - one else has made them before , and that it 's not often that you treat yourself to something that you 've waited twenty or more years for .
If you decide on the surprise approach it may be preferable to show them the various parts making up the Dalek ' one at a time ' over a period of a few days .
The instant shock of seeing the full item in all it's glory may be too much for them . "
Oh , they also have Cybermen and a full - sized Tardis ( alas , I 've already purchased the one containing Billie Piper ) .

IN TRUCKS , boats and buses , protesters streamed into Bangkok for a non -stop rally that was billed as a “ people 's war against the elite ” .
By March 14th the crowd , all wearing bright red and brimming with elation , had passed 100,000 .
On the stage , speakers railed against the government and its royal and military enablers .
Banners read “ No Justice , No Peace ” .
Another bruising round in Thailand 's protracted power - struggle was under way , with no clear end in sight .
By mid-week the red shirts seemed no closer to their goal of forcing out the prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , and forcing new elections .
The army stands squarely behind Mr Abhisit , who took power 15 months ago by a parliamentary fix and remains the hero of Bangkok 's myopic monied classes , as well as the yellow - shirted protesters who support the status quo .
But in a one - man , one - vote democracy , the have - nots hold the key to success .
Thailand 's twice - elected and now fugitive former prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , understood this well .
He has refused to keep quiet since the army ousted him in 2006 .
A court ruling on February 26th to seize $ 1.4 billion of his fortune has only made him angrier .
Many red shirts consider Mr Thaksin to be the country 's true leader and , despite his enormous wealth and privileged life , make common cause with him .
Ruling - party politicians complain that the lowly red shirts are paid proxies and do not represent mainstream opinion .
They bat away the idea that an election may be the only way to prove their point , arguing that an orderly vote is impossible amid the tumult .
Most of all , they blame Mr Thaksin for the uproar .
But there is another figure in the political landscape to consider : King Bhumibol Adulyadej , at 82 the world 's longest - reigning monarch .
At the rally site , a giant spotlit portrait of him gazed down impassively on the red- shirted crowds .
To Thailand 's royalist movement the monarch is the nation 's father , and the “ fighting children ” on the streets are a source of distress to him .
Some fear that Thailand 's troubles may be thwarting King Bhumibol 's full recovery from the respiratory illness that has kept him in hospital since September .
But it is precisely because “ father ” is on his way out that his “ children ” are fighting .
The death of a monarch is always a moment of national drama and self - reflection .
Thais feel a dread of it .
Few have known any king other than Bhumibol , who ascended in 1946 to an institution that had slipped into irrelevance .
As military rule gave way to a semi-functional democracy , the palace served as a respected power - broker .
But its legitimacy depended on the charisma of King Bhumibol and the stealth of his courtiers .
The palace insists that the king is alert and active .
But Thais already fear a destabilising royal succession .
Investors are especially worried , and the more so because lèse - majesté laws discourage frank talk about it .
When a large Thai brokerage polled fund managers about political risk factors in 2010 , 42 % of respondents chose what the brokerage describes as “ a change that cannot be mentioned ” .
Rumours of King Bhumibol 's death last October sparked a two - day equities sell - off and a furious government witch - hunt for rumour - spreaders .
The real thing is likely to outdo that rout .
Thailand has already endured four years of turmoil .
The death toll has been low so far , but the rage unleashed last April , when red shirts fought the army in Bangkok , was a glimpse of how deep passions run .
Splits within the army itself are starting to appear .
Even if fears of all - out civil war seem overblown , it is reasonable to expect more years of political confrontation and paralysis .
The crown itself should pass smoothly .
The designated male heir is Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn , aged 57 , and there is not much scope for doubt about his claim .
A long mourning period , perhaps six months or more , will allow a pause in the political dogfight .
Some protagonists may come to their senses and seek a compromise .
The death of King Bhumibol would also signal a generational shift in Thailand : younger voices could start to be heard .
But this king will be a most difficult act to follow , and Prince Vajiralongkorn is already widely loathed and feared .
Most
Thais try not even to think about his accession .
“ This reign ends .
And then , nothing , ” says an academic .
The next ruler must fill the shoes of a beatified icon whose achievements have been swathed in a personality cult .
The role of a crown prince in an era of great longevity and public scrutiny is tough anywhere .
In Thailand it verges on the impossible .
“ How do you follow someone who walks on water ? ” asks a senior Western diplomat .
Doubts about the prince
This conundrum is a familiar one .
King Vajiravudh , Rama VI , who assumed the throne in 1910 , had a rough ride in the shadow of his father , King Chulalongkorn , a vigorous moderniser .
Even before he ascended to the throne he was tainted by palace gossip of alleged bad behaviour , according to Thongchai Winichakul , a Thai historian at the University of Wisconsin .
Vajiravudh was a “ fantastic poet and playwright ” but an also - ran monarch who was eclipsed by his exalted predecessor .
“ The royals shot themselves in the foot , ” Mr Thongchai told a recent public seminar .
His successor , Prajadhipok , Rama VII , fared worse .
A bloodless 1932 coup ended absolute rule and nudged the Thai monarchy towards the margins .
Prajadhipok fled to exile in London and abdicated in 1935 , deepening the drift .
He handed over to Rama VIII , King Bhumibol 's elder brother , who died in 1946 after a mysterious shot to the head .
Bhumibol was proclaimed king the same day , and promptly returned to Switzerland to complete his studies .
In 1926 Prajadhipok had written frankly about the shortcomings of dynastic rule .
In a letter , he wrestled with the clash between a society in flux and the law of hereditary kingship , a clash that seems to hang over Thailand today .
The king 's rule was one “ of great difficulty ” as public opinion had turned against absolute rule .
He fretted over who might be coming next .
“ Some sort of guarantee must be found against an unwise king , ” he wrote .
Nearly a century on , no such guarantee exists .
Instead ,
Thais are faced with the prospect of Prince Vajiralongkorn , a career army officer and fighter pilot , who has already assumed many ceremonial duties from his father .
Largely absent in recent years on jaunts around Europe , he is now back in Thailand and in the public eye .
The signals are loud and clear .
Two weeks after King Bhumibol 's birthday speech , the Bangkok Post ran a stiff , respectful profile of him under the headline : “ King in Waiting ” .
For Thais used to King Bhumibol 's virtues , which include monogamy , Buddhist piety and old - fashioned thrift , the crown prince is a poor substitute .
Salacious stories of his private life are daily gossip .
A video circulated widely in 2007 showed his third wife , known as the “ royal consort ” , at a formal dinner with the prince in a titillating state of undress .
Diplomats say Prince Vajiralongkorn is unpredictable to the point of eccentricity : lavishing attention on his pet poodle Fu Fu , for example , who has military rank and , on occasion , sits among guests at gala dinners .
In the 1980s his rumoured ties to the criminal underworld , which he denied in a newspaper interview , inspired the gangster nickname of “ Sia O ” .
In contrast , Princess Sirindhorn , his sister , enjoys a saintly image as a patron of charity .
Many
Thais are praying for an eleventh - hour change that installs her on the throne .
Some army and palace factions are said to favour the princess as the next ruler .
Other possibilities aired in recent years are a jump to Prince Vajiralongkorn 's children , such as his youngest , Prince Tipangkara , with a regent , perhaps Princess Sirindhorn .
The leaked video was presumably a bid to discredit the prince and push other options .
So far , however , King Bhumibol seems to have made up his mind that Prince Vajiralongkorn will succeed him .
Vajiralongkorn , meddling already
Paul Handley , the king 's unofficial biographer , whose book is banned in Thailand , thinks there is a tiny possibility that King Bhumibol could decide on his deathbed to disinherit Prince Vajiralongkorn .
That would require a written command .
Life in exile in Europe might suit the prince , who would not want for money or diversions .
Inevitably there are other , bloodier , predictions of how he might be removed from the succession .
This might explain why soldiers in his personal guard are not allowed to wear guns in his presence .
One reason why Prince Vajiralongkorn is distrusted in military circles is his past association with Mr Thaksin , who was ousted by a military coup in 2006 .
Mr Thaksin , a telecoms billionaire turned populist politician , was said to have lavished money on the prince .
That may have been the real reason for the coup , which appeared to have the blessing of Prem Tinsulanonda , the chairman of the Privy Council and thus the king 's chief adviser .
The fact that Mr Thaksin , who is living in exile in Dubai , is still in contact with the prince is deeply troubling for those same royalists .
In a recent interview with a British newspaper , the former prime minister lavishly praised the heir to the throne .
Nobody knows what kind of ruler Prince Vajiralongkorn would be .
Sulak Sivaraksa , a veteran royal observer and social activist , says that the prince has matured during his third marriage and is more respectful of others than in the past .
Others say that he is still easily bored by royal duties , unlike Princess Sirindhorn , who lives for them .
Above all , say royal watchers , he needs able courtiers to steer him through the political pitfalls ahead .
Many believe that Prince Vajiralongkorn will replace the Privy Council with his own men .
For senior courtiers who have served the king and look askance at his successor , an exit will be welcome .
But the new men “ will definitely not have the calibre ” of the current crop , says a foreign scholar .
Mighty but clumsy
A taste of this came last year when Mr Abhisit , the prime minister , tried to reshuffle the police force .
His choice for police chief was blocked by members of his own team , including Nipon Prompan , an aide to Prince Vajiralongkorn , who lobbied for another candidate .
A “ powerful and mighty ” backer was reported to be pushing the second man , a former head of national intelligence under Mr Thaksin .
Mr Nipon later resigned from the cabinet .
Mr Abhisit was unable to confirm his man , who is currently acting chief .
The row exposed Prince Vajiralongkorn 's clumsy meddling .
It also provoked apoplexy among King Bhumibol 's courtiers , says a palace source .
Prince Vajiralongkorn was told that “ we do n't do things like this , ” the source says .
In fact , the palace has long patronised loyalists in the army and bureaucracy .
This is how power operates in Thailand .
What made Mr Thaksin such a threat to the palace was his determination to exert similar control .
In turn , Prince Vajiralongkorn is itching to meddle in the annual autumnal shuffle of senior jobs in the armed forces and extend his support base , says a senior Asian diplomat .
How far he succeeds may determine how long he lasts .
Another possibility is a royal pardon for Mr Thaksin so that he can return to manage state affairs for the new king .
This would delight the red shirts .
But it would appal Bangkok 's elite and split the army .
As for courting public support , this seems far - fetched .
The prince knows he is unpopular , says a political acquaintance , but “ he does n't care . ”
One way out of this predicament would be to shrink the Thai monarchy back to its previous size .
Top - down reform of the institution is more palatable than a push from below with republican overtones .
Under King Bhumibol its stock has fallen already from its zenith in May 1992 , when he could order a military dictator to cease and desist .
Recent years have exposed the limits of his powers .
In 2008 the king was unable to stop the People 's Alliance for Democracy from sowing chaos in his name .
“ We expect too much of him , ” sighs a senior courtier .
Clearly Thailand needs a new equilibrium .
Some fear that the power vacuum left by an enfeebled monarchy will be filled by the army , which is already the steel behind the palace 's gilded façade .
But the generals who seized power in a coup in 2006 did a dismal job of running the country , and had to return power to the voters 15 months later .
Business families do not want a repeat performance , and would prefer to have politicians and professionals in charge .
Several banned MPs , some hoping to lead parties , will re-enter the field in 2012 .
But the rules of the game will need to be reset .
Some might argue that King Bhumibol shares the blame for the failure of democratic institutions to take root in Thailand .
Relying on “ a few good men ” and the army to steer the country has left it in the lurch , says Mr Handley .
It is a sad twilight for the monarch .
Thailand was once an outpost of freedom in a fairly repressive region .
Scrappy politics did not choke rapid economic growth , as the bureaucrats kept a steady hand on day - to - day management .
In the 1990s Western rights activists hoped that the dynamism of Thai civil society might spread to neighbouring countries .
Instead , some now see Thailand as a cautionary tale of a botched democracy .
That may be too harsh .
Thailand 's rival red and yellow mobs disagree about democracy , but both want a fair political system .
To measure tolerance , the California - based Asia Foundation last year surveyed Thais about their views .
It found that 79 % of respondents would allow unpopular political parties to meet in their area .
Only 6 % said that they would stop seeing a friend who had joined a rival party .
These are healthier figures than in other Asian democracies .
Almost everyone agreed that democracy was the best form of government , though 30 % would accept authoritarian rule in certain circumstances .
Thailand has not yet given up on democracy .
But taking stock of its troubled politics should include talking about the crown .
Of course , it is distasteful — and inauspicious , Thais believe — to speak of King Bhumibol 's death .
But it is unavoidable .
The stakes are too high .
Respect and fear have kept a lid on the debate .
Anyone who speaks out of turn in Thailand risks arrest under the lèse - majesté laws or a new , equally nasty computer - crimes law .
Several people have been prosecuted for defaming the king and his family , including an Australian jailed ( until freed by a royal pardon ) for writing a novel that contained an unflattering depiction of the crown prince .
Behind closed doors , a spirited debate goes on over the fate of the monarchy when the king dies .
An old prophecy holds that the Chakri dynasty will last only nine generations .
King Bhumibol is Rama IX .
Republican voices are rising to the surface — unreported in Thailand 's pliant media .
The Bangkok Post struck a typical tone of pride and menace in its birthday eulogy for the king in December : “ The Thai people 's love for his majesty is so ingrained in the national psyche that to declare otherwise is unthinkable . ”
Gagged and flagging
Within palace circles , however , there is a dawning realisation that change is coming .
Senior royalists know that King Bhumibol 's charisma and influence will not easily transfer to his successor .
This is the crux of Thailand 's royal impasse .
And King Bhumibol knows it , says Mr Sulak .
As he puts it , the king “ would like to see that the next reign will not be bloody . ”
To this end , King Bhumibol recently asked three trusted emissaries to present ideas for reforming the institution , according to Mr Sulak .
One emissary asked for Mr Sulak 's advice , explaining that the findings would be for the king 's eyes only .
Mr Sulak replied that the palace must be transparent about its finances , including some $ 35 billion in assets managed by the Crown Property Bureau , decouple itself from the army and open up to public criticism .
Only by becoming a European - style figurehead can a future monarch survive , he argues .
Preserving the tree
Mr Sulak has often been accused of lèse - majesté .
He insists that he is a monarchist at heart .
“ To pull down the tree is easy .
But I think it 's better to preserve it , ” he says .
Such steps just might rescue the Chakri dynasty .
But a radical rethink seems unlikely .
Allowing opponents to attack an insecure ruler could quickly escalate .
Under King Bhumibol the silencing of opponents has been controversial , but many tolerate it out of respect .
Prince Vajiralongkorn can expect no such leeway .
What might a diminished monarchy look like ?
Thailand may not be ready for such a thing .
In Spain , the palace 's annual household budget of € 9 m ( $ 12 m ) is audited by the government .
Norway puts its royal accounts on a website .
It is impossible to find out how much Thailand 's jet - setting royals spend .
Japan may be a better model , as a respectful national press keeps its distance .
It took defeat in the second world war and an American occupation to curtail the powers of Japan 's emperor .
Other royal houses were whittled down to size by assertive parliaments .
This happened in Thailand in 1932 , but was later reversed under King Bhumibol .
Clearly , some constitutional fixes would be needed to shrink the sovereign 's role .
But power in Thailand flows along patronage networks that start with the king .
That is why elected ministers who care about their careers are continually looking over their shoulders for signals from the palace .
Mr Abhisit attends so many royal ribbon - cuttings that it is hard to imagine how he finds time to govern , says a senior Western diplomat .
Royal censorship has kept much of this debate under wraps .
That is a pity .
King Bhumibol famously said in 2005 that he was not above criticism .
But not many are ready to test that .
Though the internet is humming with opinions , the taboo still stands .
And because the country has never had a chance to talk openly , people cannot prepare themselves for what may be a rough road ahead .

I ’ve added a new library to Incanter called incanter .latex that adds the ability to include LaTeX formatted equations as annotations and subtitles in charts .
The library is based on the fantastically useful JLaTeXMath library .
The following examples require Incanter version 1.2.2- SNAPSHOT or greater .
Add the following dependency to your project.clj file :
[ incanter " 1.2.2-SNAPSHOT " ]
Load the necessary libraries .
( use '( incanter core stats charts latex ) )
Define the latex - formatted equation ; I ’ll use the str function so I can break the equation across multiple lines .
Notice that I have to use two backslashes where I would only need one if I were were working directly in LaTeX ; this is because the backslash is an escape character in Clojure / Java strings .
( def eq ( str " f( x ) =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}} " " e^{\\frac{ - ( x - \\mu ) ^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} " ) )
The equation can be rendered as an image with the latex function .
The rendered equation can then be viewed in a window or saved as a png file with the view and save functions respectively .
( view ( latex eq ) ) ( save ( latex eq ) filename )
Use the add - latex function to add an annotation to a chart .
The following example adds the above equation to a function - plot of the Normal PDF .
( doto ( function - plot pdf- normal - 3 3 ) ( add - latex 0 0.1 eq ) view )
Use the add - latex - subtitle function to add a rendered LaTeX equation as a subtitle to the chart ( this particular chart does not have a main title ) .
( doto ( function - plot pdf- normal - 3 3 ) ( add - latex - subtitle eq ) view )

I have n’t done a top - ten list in a while .
I meant to post this last week around St. Paddy ’s day , but took me a while to finish it .
Well , as the green dye in the Chicago river has n’t completely washed out , I hope you do n’t mind reading another Irish - related post .
Here ’s my list of ten Irish actors that have done some buzz - worthy projects ( including TV work ) in the past decade , as well as those ‘ rising stars ’ that I really hope to see more of .
I ’m going to limit my list to just those born and bred in Ireland ( at least for most of their childhood ) , so not those of Irish - descent as it ’d take this entire blog to list them all .
Here they are in random order :
Colin Farrell –
Of all the vile things Joel Schumacher is known for as a director , you could say that he has an eye for talent .
He cast Farrell in Tigerland which got the Dublin native noticed .
I first saw him in the sci-fi action Minority Report alongside Tom Cruise , and then the Terrence Malick ’s The New World .
His foray into historical action hero in Alexander was ridiculed panned by critics , and he nearly became a Hollywood cliche with his womanizing ways and drug / alcohol abuse , but he manage to maneuver a career comeback with his Golden - Globe - winning turn in the Irish black comedy In Bruges ( 2008 ) .
He recently had a small - but - memorable role in Crazy Heart , and a lead role in the Irish drama Ondine .
…. Liam Neeson
Probably the most famous Irish actors of the bunch , Neeson is one of the hardest working actors right now .
His diverse resume is impressive by any thespian standard .
From historical figures ( Michael Collins , Rob Roy , Schindler ’s List ) , comic - book villain ( Batman Begins ) , to playing bad - ass action star hell - bent on revenge ( Taken ) , Neeson adds gravitas to any role he ’s in .
Ca n’t wait to see him as Zeus bellowing ‘ Release the Kraken !!!’ in Clash of the Titans .
…. Saoirse Ronan
She may be only sixteen , but Ronan ’s got that wise - beyond - her - years thing going for her , plus enormous talent to boot .
She was phenomenal in Atonement as the little girl who could n’t quite figure out how to channel her attraction to the opposite sex that led to disastrous consequences .
She pretty much comes out unscathed even when The Lovely Bones bombed artistically and financially .
She ’s currently re-teaming with her Atonement director Joe Wright in Hanna as a 14 - year old assassin , talk about range !
…. Cillian Murphy
Most people recognize him as Scarecrow in Batman Begins , but his memorable role is perhaps in the zombie flick 28 Days Later .
His impossibly chiseled cheekbones and dramatic eyes somehow make him the perfectly creepy yet sophisticated villain , as he displayed in the horror / thriller Red Eye .
Renowned directors such as Christopher Nolan and Danny Boyle obviously like working with him , as he ’s done two movies for Boyle ( Sunshine & 28 Days Later ) and Nolan also cast him in Inception .
…. Michael Fassbender
( Ed note :
Though he ’s born in Germany , Fassbender is half - Irish and was raised in southwest Ireland )
I ’ve mentioned this guy A LOT on my blog lately and for good reason , he ’s definitely eye - candy material but with acting chops to boot .
Thanks to Zach Snyder for casting such great actors in 300 even in smaller roles , as I definitely noticed Fassbender as the loyal and valiant Stelios .
He ’s then proved his amazing range in transformational role in Hunger , and another indie darling Fish Tank which won him several nods from various European Film Festivals .
He ’s currently starring in a Roman actioner Centurion where he again displays his versatility .
His next projects are definitely chat - worthy , there ’s that darker Jane Eyre adaptation where he ’ll play my favorite literary hero Rochester , and the historical drama The Talking Cure where he ’ll play psychoanalyst Carl Jung alongside Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud .
…. Gabriel Byrne
I first noticed Byrne in The Point of No Return as Bridget Fonda ’s sympathetic mentor .
He may not always get the lead roles , but you always remember him ( The Man in the Iron Mask , Little Women , The Usual Suspect )
The charismatic 60 - year - old actor definitely still got the looks and is currently starring in the well - received HBO drama
In Treatment as a psychotherapist where he won a Golden Globe last year .
I certainly hope he ’ll do more movies in the future !
…. Ciarán Hinds
You may not know his name , but you certainly recognize this tall , dark and handsome Belfast native .
His dark look makes him suitable to play people from different nationalities : English ( Phantom of the Opera , Amazing Grace ) , ( Israeli ( Munich ) , Roman ( as Julius Caesar in HBO ’s Rome ) , Russian ( The Sum of All Fears ) , and that ’s just a sampling .
His new indie flick set in his native homeland The Eclipse ( NOT Twilight 3 ) is to be released this weekend .
Glad to see him get the lead role for a change .
…. Kenneth Branagh
For all the Shakespearean work he ’s done ( Henry V , Much Ado About Nothing , Hamlet ) , I initially thought Branagh was an Englishman .
The RADA - educated actor had his start in theater when he joined The Royal Shakespeare Company at 23 .
Soon after he formed his own performance art company called The Renaissance Theatre Company , which counts Prince Charles as one of its royal patrons .
Surely he ’ll inject some of that artsy and sophisticated sensibilities to a comic book adaptation , Thor , that he ’s currently helming .
…. Pierce Brosnan
He may not be my favorite James Bond , but Brosnan has proven before and after his 007 role that he ’s not to be type - cast .
He balances the ‘ suave , elegant , sophisticated men in suits ’ roles ( Bond , Thomas Crown Affair ) with small indie dramas ( Evelyn , Married Life ) , quirky comedy ( The Matador ) , gritty Western ( Seraphim Falls ) , even musical ( Mama Mia ! ) .
He ’s currently starring as a British PM in Roman Polanski ’s latest The Ghost Writer , which was lauded by the critics .
…. Jonathan Rhys Meyers
I first noticed Meyers in the wholesome soccer flick Bend It Like Beckham as Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra ’s coach .
But he rose to fame as soon as he ’s cast as the ruthless , womanizing King Henry VIII in Showtime ’s The Tudors .
His confidence swagger and devilish charm makes him a perfect seducer and unabashed casanova ( Match Point ) .
His recent foray into blow - em - up action From Paris With Love bombed , but it ’s more of a reflection of John Travolta ’s box office clout than his .
His next project At Swim - Two - Birds is definitely an Irish production .
It ’s fellow Irishman Brendan Gleeson ’s writing / directing debut about a playwright who begins to mingle with the fictional characters he has created .
His co-stars all appear on this list : Cillian Murphy , Colin Farrell and Gabriel Byrne !
….
HONORABLE MENTIONS : Brendan Gleeson , Stephen Rea , Aidan Quinn , Michael Gambon
Again , with this kind of list , it ’s likely that I ’m forgetting someone , so please do clue me in , readers 🙂
VANCOUVER --
How do you like us now , Lawrence ?
The Vancouver Winter Games , which British golf writer Lawrence Donegan -- after only three days !
-- suggested might go down in history as the " worst ever , " put on their best face Saturday .
Under blue skies and a warming sun , thousands of people from around the world took to the city 's streets , clogging major thoroughfares like Robson and Granville that have been converted to pedestrian malls .
Street performers could scarcely believe their good fortune as people lined up five and six deep to watch the shows .
On every corner , two traffic cops struggled to control the rivers of people , never mind cars .
For those from Vancouver and the Lower Mainland , it was unlike anything they 'd ever seen before .
" Never , " said Kevin Neustaedter , 52 , from Coquitlam .
" I bought tickets to one event and I was only going to go for one event . "
But then people kept telling him how much fun it was downtown , so he showed up Saturday to soak up the carnival atmosphere and take in the evening fireworks .
" The hype is building on the hype , " he said .
" There 's no doubt about it . "
Over at the Royal Canadian Mint Pavilion , Shavi and Melissa Morsara and friends Megan Kennedy and Shannon Nichol expected to wait up to seven hours to see Olympic medals up close .
" Our city 's known to be not too exciting , " Shavi Morsara said .
" This is an indication if you bring the right venues to town how people come out .
It 's good to see .
It 's so positive , a good vibe and different types of culture . "
Tourists from other countries raved about the party atmosphere .
The orange - clad Van Denboom family from Holland -- mother , Fieny , in a traditional Dutch bonnet -- wandered Robson posing for pictures with Canadians in red hockey jerseys .
" It 's wonderful , " said Rob Van Denboom .
" Awesome , " added brother Bram .
" And the people are friendly as well , " said father Jos .
The British media , they said , have no idea what they 're talking about .
" It 's only the British , " said Jos .
" They were always separate . "
German tourist Torsten Danke , who got his picture taken with two Mounties in red serge at the corner of Granville and Hastings , said he was most taken with the friendly service and the number of people who stopped to ask where he was from .
" You do n't have it in Europe like this , " he said .
Even Olympic organizers and tourist officials have been surprised at the level of enthusiasm .
" The reaction of our city and I think the entire country has been overwhelming , " said Dave Cobb , deputy chief executive officer of the Vancouver Organizing Committee .
" I 've lived in this city my whole life and have never seen this type of excitement . "
The crowds have got so big , in fact , that Vancouver police have asked for reinforcements to deal with the numbers at night .
But Const .
Lindsey Houghton said that , except for a number of liquor - fueled incidents , there have been relatively few problems .
Crime , in fact , is down nearly 40 per cent over the same period last year .
" The attitude and vibe has been unbelievably positive , " he said .
Will it all be enough for Vancouver to shed the early criticism about a malfunctioning cauldron , early transportation glitches , and the lack of snow on Cypress Mountain ?
Tourism Vancouver president Rick Antonson believes it will .
He likens the Games to the performance by B.C. snowboarder Maelle Ricker .
" She came out of the gates on her first trial that morning and slipped and got up and by the end of the day , we saw what she was made of .
And she was gold .
" I think what we 're seeing , despite the early glitches with these Games , is what British Columbians are made of . "
Q : Will the IRS hire 16,500 new agents to enforce the health care law ?
A : No .
The law requires the IRS mostly to hand out tax credits , not collect penalties .
The claim of 16,500 new agents stems from a partisan analysis based on guesswork and false assumptions , and compounded by outright misrepresentation .
FULL QUESTION
Can you explain if … the IRS will hire 16,500 new agents and spend $ 10 billion / year to audit who has [ health care ] coverage .
I can not find any coverage that is not from the right on this … and I have been searching for a while .
Thank you .
Hello ,
I ’d like to request a fact check on Ron Paul ’s claim regarding the enforcement of the health insurance mandate , " 16,500 ARMED bureaucrats coming to make this program work . " at 3:53 of this video :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0lA6XCt3gM
I did a google search for " 16,500 " and there were a lot of hits on conservative websites stating something along the lines that the health care bill sets aside $ 10 billion for the IRS to hire up to 16,500 agents to enforce the mandate , but ARMED agents are another matter .
Anyway , I could n’t find anything about this from the national news outlets , so I ’m just curious if this is just a scare tactic .
FULL ANSWER
This wildly inaccurate claim started as an inflated , partisan assertion that 16,500 new IRS employees might be required to administer the new law .
That devolved quickly into a claim , made by some Republican lawmakers , that 16,500 IRS " agents " would be required .
Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas even claimed in a televised interview that all 16,500 would be carrying guns .
None of those claims is true .
The IRS ’ main job under the new law is n’t to enforce penalties .
Its first task is to inform many small - business owners of a new tax credit that the new law grants them — starting this year — which will pay up to 35 percent of the employer ’s contribution toward their workers ’ health insurance .
And in 2014 the IRS will also be administering additional subsidies — in the form of refundable tax credits — to help millions of low - and middle - income individuals buy health insurance .
The law does make individuals subject to a tax , starting in 2014 , if they fail to obtain health insurance coverage .
But IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman testified before a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee March 25 that the IRS wo n’t be auditing individuals to certify that they have obtained health insurance .
He said insurance companies will issue forms certifying that individuals have coverage that meets the federal mandate , similar to a form that lenders use to verify the amount of interest someone has paid on their home mortgage .
" We expect to get a simple form , that we wo n’t look behind , that says this person has acceptable health coverage , " Shulman said .
" So there ’s not going to be any discussions about health coverage with an IRS employee . "
In any case , the bill signed into law ( on page 131 ) specifically prohibits the IRS from using the liens and levies commonly used to collect money owed by delinquent taxpayers , and rules out any criminal penalties for individuals who refuse to pay the tax or those who do n’t obtain coverage .
That does n’t leave a lot for IRS enforcers to do .
So where does the claim of 16,500 new agents come from ?
Starting with a Soft Figure
This figure originated with a report put out by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee on March 18 .
It said :
GOP Analysis , March 18 : IRS may need to hire as many as 16,500 additional auditors , agents and other employees .
Notice the words " may " and " as many as . "
This is the highest figure the GOP analysts thought they could support .
Notice also the phrase " other employees , " which covers everyone down to file clerks and support staff .
The analysts based their 16,500 figure on an assumption that the IRS budget " could " require an additional $ 10 billion over the next 10 years as a result of the law , a figure they attribute to the Congressional Budget Office .
But what CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf actually said in a March 11 letter to congressional leaders is this ( with emphasis added ) :
CBO Director Elmendorf , March 11 : CBO has not completed an estimate of all of the discretionary costs that would be associated with H.R. 3590 . …
[ S ] uch costs would probably include an estimated $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion over 10 years for administrative costs of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .
Note the words " probably " and " could . "
And the figure — based on preliminary analysis — could as easily be $ 5 billion as the $ 10 billion number the GOP analysts used .
False Assumptions
The GOP analysts then inflated their estimate by making a couple of false assumptions .
No desks ?
First , they assume that all the new " administrative " spending projected by CBO would go for payroll and benefits — without any allowance for desks , computers , office rent , utilities , travel or other overhead costs necessary to run any government enterprise .
The partisan analysts simply divided the spending ( which they figured could be $ 1.5 billion per year once the law is fully effective ) by the current average payroll cost for the entire IRS workforce .
To their credit , the GOP analysts admitted this shortcoming , saying their figure " does not include other costs that would be incurred , including office overhead . "
In fact , they said : " There would be some additional overhead costs for the new employees , such as computers and telephone services . "
Adjusting for that , they said , the number of new workers implied by the CBO guesstimate would be 11,800 .
No pay raises ?
The second false assumption is that there will be no inflation or pay raises over the next decade .
They apply fiscal 2009 cost figures to budgets for 2014 through 2019 .
In fact , CBO currently projects that the Employment Cost Index will rise 1.4 percent next year and reach 3 percent per year in 2015 and thereafter .
Even if the partisan analysis is valid , that would further reduce the maximum number that could be hired by another 1,000 in 2014 , and by about 2,800 in 2019 , by our calculations .
The GOP analysts assume that the $ 10 billion would not be spread evenly over the decade , but would reach $ 1.5 billion annually in later years .
That ’s reasonable , given that major provisions of the new law do n’t take effect until 2014 .
But even accepting that , the peak figure could just as easily be $ 750 million a year , if the CBO ’s lower guess proves to be correct .
So the number of new IRS workers implied by the GOP ’s own logic could be closer to 5,000 than to 16,500 , after adjusting for overhead costs and inflation .
And the fact is , whatever the number of new employees turns out to be , relatively few would be " agents " or otherwise working in enforcement .
Employees vs. " Agents "
The GOP staff analysis projected only the number of new " employees , " but some Republican lawmakers immediately misrepresented the findings by claiming that all the new workers would be " agents . "
GOP Rep .
Dave Camp of Michigan stated in a press release that " Up to 16,500 New IRS Agents " would be required .
And he ’s not the only one making such a claim .
Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said on " Fox News Sunday " on March 21 that the IRS would get " 16,000 agents to police this new mandate . "
In a March 25 speech on the Senate floor , Republican Sen. John Ensign of Nevada said : " And 16,500 new IRS agents are going to be required to be hired because of the health care reform bill .
Do we want IRS agents showing up at people ’s houses , not only to audit them because of their taxes but because now they are not paying an individual mandate fine ? "
But there ’s a huge difference between an IRS revenue agent — who calls on taxpayers and conducts face - to - face audits — and the workers who make up the bulk of IRS employees .
Those who work at the IRS include clerks , accountants , computer programmers , telephone help line workers and other support staff .
In fact , IRS revenue agents make up only 15 percent of the IRS workforce , according to the official IRS personnel summary .
It shows that of the 93,337 employees the IRS had on board as of the end of the last fiscal year ( September 31 , 2009 ) only 14,264 were actually working as revenue agents .
Even adding in " revenue officers " ( who collect money owed ) and " special agents " ( who handle criminal cases and are law - enforcement officers ) the total working in the enforcement area comes to less than 25 percent of all IRS workers .
Rep .
Camp should know that — he ’s the senior Republican member of the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee , which oversees the IRS .
This misrepresentation of the inflated " employee " figure has since been picked up and repeated by countless conservative blogs and news sites .
But however often it is repeated , it is still false .
" Armed Bureaucrats " ?
Not content to turn all IRS " employees " into " agents , " one Republican lawmaker even claimed they all would have guns .
In a March 22 interview with Fox Business anchor David Asmam , Rep. Ron Paul said , " Just think about it — 16,500 armed bureaucrats coming to make this program work . "
Rep .
Paul ’s wildly false claim appears 3 minutes and 51 seconds into the interview , which Fox posted on YouTube .
In fact , the only IRS employees who are authorized to carry firearms are " special agents , " who are sworn law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases .
As of last year there were only 2,725 of those , making up just under 3 percent of all IRS employees .
So even if thousands of new IRS workers were actually hired , very few of them , if any , would be " armed bureaucrats . "
In fact , as previously mentioned , the bill signed into law specifically waives any criminal penalties for individuals who refuse to obtain coverage and also refuse to pay the tax .
It says ( on page 131 ) : " In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this section , such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure . "
Outreach vs. Enforcement
At his March 25 appearance , IRS Commissioner Shulman said that the bulk of the IRS ’ efforts would go to informing individuals and businesses of the various tax incentives available under the new law .
Under questioning from Democratic Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin , Shulman said : " What we ’re going to do is try to make sure people are educated , there ’s information , that we process payments quickly . "
He said the IRS had n’t yet figured out what staffing levels would be required , and he did n’t deny that some new agents might be hired .
" We also will make sure there ’s no fraud and abuse in the system as we always do , " he said .
" We will need resources to implement the tax provisions . "
But that scary claim of 16,500 new agents simply lacks any foundation in fact .
Update , Feb. 22 : The Treasury Department on Feb. 14 released the IRS budget request for fiscal year 2012 that shows the agency is seeking 1,269 full - time equivalent employees ( FTEs ) at a cost of $ 473 million to help implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act .
That includes 291 IRS agents , most of them ( 193 ) to " ensure accurate delivery of tax credits . "

What better way for an aluminum foundry to showcase its expertise than by creating a lightweight electric vehicle with a cast - aluminum frame ?
Enter the Zero , a two - passenger , lithium - battery - powered EV from Tazzari Group , an Italian company that specializes in manufacturing aluminum parts .
And with its proud national pedigree , this car could help recast electrics as eco-friendly alternatives to sports cars .
Or not .
The Specs
The Zero is not currently for sale in the United States , but Dale Long , CEO of EV Car Co. , a Texas - based electric - car retailer , says his company will begin importing it as soon as the little car clears a few regulatory hurdles .
" By mid to late summer , we 'll be selling the perfect urban commuter vehicle , " Long says .
Because the Zero has not yet been certified for use on U.S. highways , it 's currently classified as a neighborhood electric vehicle ( NEV ) , with a top speed limited to 35 mph .
Once certified , the Zero will be unrestricted to its natural top speed of 56 mph .
On paper , the Zero looks promising enough .
Although 20 hp and 111 lb- ft of torque may not sound all that powerful , it 's more than adequate to get 1195 pounds of aluminum and plastic up and running .
Extensive use of cast aluminum , including the frame , 15 - inch alloy wheels , pedals , and interior door handles , keeps weight to a minimum ( although you 'll want to be careful not to let the door - handle latches pinch your fingers ) .
Even the lithium - ion batteries are housed in a pair of aluminum cases under the leather bucket seats .
Those batteries will recharge in 9 or 10 hours with the 220 - volt cable , or in as little as an hour if you can find 380 volts .
Like an official on - sale date , pricing has yet to be announced for either the car or its options , but expect it to fall well beneath the price of an average car , or significantly less than $ 26,000 .
The three - phase electric motor is located just aft of the batteries , giving the Zero a balanced 50/50 front / rear weight distribution and sending power on a short path to the rear wheels .
The position of the batteries and motor also helps create a low center of gravity , which , combined with a wide track and relatively long wheelbase , results in rock - solid stability .
Despite SUV - like proportions , the Zero will spin out rather than tip over .
Front and rear luggage compartments combine to offer just over 6 cubic feet of storage space ; enough for two small soft - sided bags and not much else .
There 's not a lot of room , so minimalism is key , although Tazzari did n't skimp on the usual accessories — there are power windows , fog lights , electric mirrors , radio with MP3 , USB input , iPod accessibility , and a 12 - volt socket , to keep the external music source charged .
Inside the speedometer is an LED display that helps monitor the charge .
An electric heater is optional .
Four disc brakes with regenerative braking capability offset some of the charge - depleting extras .
Still , Tazzari claims a range of just less than 88 miles .
The company further estimates the average life span of its batteries to be 50,000 miles , which , based on our pothole - strewn test route , will likely be longer than the interval between visits to the chiropractor .
There are 12 body colors and three rim colors from which to choose .
Our test car arrived in taxicab yellow , which provoked more than a few quizzical expressions from local New Yorkers .

You may be able to find the same content in another format , or you may be able to find more information , at their web site .
The Drive
By far the most common reaction we received was : " What is that ?
A Smart ? "
It is indeed similar in appearance to a Smart , at least from the outside — with a length of less than 10 feet .
On the inside , however , the Tazzari is a small subcompact prototype , with unfinished black plastic composing much of the cabin .
To start , first turn the key , and select the up - or down - arrow buttons , for forward or reverse , respectively .
Then release the brake , and press the go pedal .
The Zero takes off like a golf cart , without so much as a whisper ( although reverse is accompanied by a warning beep for the benefit of unsuspecting pedestrians ) .
Tazzari touts its high - performance and handling as its top attributes .
Admittedly , the steering is sharp , and the car 's turning radius is ridiculously tight .
We easily executed a U - turn using only one and a half lanes .
The driver may toggle between four driving modes — race , economy , standard , and rain — by selecting among the four brightly illuminated buttons on the dashboard .
Each mode creates such markedly different throttle characteristics that Long describes them as providing " four cars in one . "
The red button , for race mode , provides full torque from a standstill .
Green , or economy mode , maximizes range but noticeably restricts power to the wheels .
Yellow - button standard mode balances between full torque and economy , and the blue button for rain mode cuts power for better traction in the wet .
Economy mode provides a range of up to 87 miles .
Race mode is the least efficient , but Tazzari claims it will get the Zero from zero to 30 mph in less than 5 seconds .
To our dismay , the various driving modes do not affect the suspension in the least , which telegraphs every road irregularity directly into the coccyx .
The Bottom Line
Unfortunately , the Zero lives down to its name ; it 's a quick NEV ; nothing more , nothing less , and getting highway certification for a vehicle that can't go 70 mph is like purchasing a hunting license for a trip to the video arcade .
But the Zero's unrefined suspension is its Achilles ' heel , relegating the car to electric - skateboard status .
The Mitsubishi i-MiEV may not be available in as wide a variety of pastels , but it feels a lot more like a car .
And by the time the Tazzari is certified for use on U.S. highways , the Nissan Leaf will likely render it obsolete .
Is n't obsolescence always the trouble with electronics ?

Torture porn provocateur and Peaches boyfriend Eli Roth wrote a letter chastising Meredith Bluett - Mills , " mother of ' thatcoolguyben ' . "
He calls Peaches a " bright , intelligent , incredibly creative young writer " and vows to use the " instantaneous connectivity of the internet " against the Bluett - Millses .
Apparently the best way to defend a girl famous for being a famous person 's daughter is to tattle to her enemy 's mother .
Eli's been at the fore of Peaches ' scandal since the get - go .
He emailed us within an hour of our post about Peaches and Ben to inform us it was " COMPLETE BULLSHIT . "
Eli posted his letter on MySpace complete with hyperlinks .
In it , he defends Peaches , impugns Ben , and demonstrates his talent for cyberstalking Ben 's next of kin .
Eli Roth : Gossip blogger .
A letter to Meredith Bluett - Mills , mother of " thatcoolguyben . "
April 2nd , 2010
To : Meredith Bluett - Mills
From : Eli Roth
Re : Your son Ben
Dear Meredith ,
You do n't know me , but my name is Eli Roth , and I am the boyfriend of a young woman named Peaches Geldof .
Her name might ring a bell , as your son Ben recently wrote a sick , hurtful story about her that is now causing tremendous damage .
If you do know Peaches , like many in America you probably know her from the gossip blogs as the daughter of Sir Bob Geldof .
However , in the United Kingdom people have been reading her newspaper columns and magazine articles since the time she began writing professionally at age 13 .
If you lived in England you 'd also know her as not just a television presenter and fashion model , but you might have seen one of her three documentaries that aired on British television , the first of which she produced when she was 15 years old .
I realize this might be difficult for you to comprehend , as your 23 year old son Ben wasexpelled from Drew University and so far as I can tell makes a living as an " artist " , but Peaches accomplished all of this before the age of 21 .
Perhaps a need for attention at any cost drove Ben to write such a destructive story , but upon closer examination , I believe there is something much darker at work with your son .....
Your son Ben appears to have a deeply troubled past with women , as internet searches show he was accused of holding a girl hostage at knifepoint in a dorm room , and was then later was accused of witness tampering in the ensuing trial .
Whether you choose to believe it or not , your son Ben is a liar .
There are photos of Ben drunk with Peaches , and he concocted a racy story which involved them using heroin .
I know you are quite familiar with how young adults can be irresponsible when alcohol is involved , as your son Jacob , who is the same age as Peaches , was once arrested for public drunkenness ( see # 3148 ) .
Ben posted his heroin - fueled sex story on a message board and then posted topless photos of them together as " proof , " and instantly his story was everywhere .
At first Peaches and I thought nothing of the posting - the story was simply too preposterous .
Your son's fairy tale culminates with him dazed and vomiting in a sauna at the Scientology Celebrity center , a place notoriously so high security that no non-member would ever be admitted and left alone , let alone a strung out one .
But look closely at the specifics of your son's story : he did not pick a drug associated with sex like ecstasy or cocaine , he chose heroin .
Why ?
Because not only has Peaches openly talked about drug use in her past , her mother tragically died from a heroin overdose when Peaches was young .
Ben 's story becomes much more salacious if he paints Peaches as heading down a similar path .
Peaches does not have a squeaky clean image by any means , in fact , she 's known for being brutally honest and open about her past mistakes in life .
But she has also worked hard to grow up and overcome her troubled past , and is now drug free .
Your son took details from Peaches teenage tabloid stories to make the story more believable , no matter how contrary they are to who she is today .
Ben used the most painful events from someone 's past to make himself famous , and it worked .
It 's sociopathic .
Imagine if I had a photo of Ben with a knife next to a girl and after some internet research posted a story that he had held yet another girl hostage at knifepoint ?
What if there were new photos of your son Jacob drunk and someone made up a story about how he was drunk in public again , and the press painted him as an alcoholic ?
Peaches has worked hard to put her mistakes behind her and show she has grown up , and was doing quite well until this insane story came along , and the British press spun it into front page news .
Peaches lawyer immediately came out with a statement categorically denying the heroin accusations , but it was too late , your son had already done the damage .
Your son did not just post a false drug story on a message board .
He took a bright , intelligent , incredibly creative young writer and damaged her ability to work until people forget about this or dismiss it as nonsense .
Not only has your son's horrible lies now painted Peaches as " dangerous " to many who would potentially hire her , but companies like Ultimo Underwear are using this " scandal " as a reason to fire Peaches by saying that she is not a role model for young girls .
And for what ?
Some psychotic story your son made up that people were all too ready to believe because it fell in line with stories from the past .
Stories your son clearly read before he made up that post .
He knew exactly what he was writing , the details were far too calculated .
And that made it all the more destructive .
These stories also send a dangerous message to anyone who has ever made a mistake , that no matter how you change someone can make up a sick story about you and everyone will revert to the worst image of your past .
The instantaneous connectivity of the internet spread this venom to newspapers all over the world , so now I am hoping this letter reaches you through the same medium .
The night Ben posted the photos a mutual acquaintance called him and asked him to take down the photos and the story , and Ben 's response was " Fuck off , " so clearly he was not bothered by what he did at the time .
Hopefully someone will notify you through by your Facebook page , your son Jacob 's Facebook page , through your daughter Gabriella at Tulane , your twitter page , Jacob 's twitter page , or one of your Twitter followers , and my words will ultimately reach you .
I would send a copy to your at your Palo Alto address that I got from Jacob 's arrest on the internet , but I do n't know if you reside at that residence anymore .
I would even ask the blogs and newspapers who were more than happy to run rampant with Ben 's insane story to reprint my letter in its entirety in the hopes you see it .
Maybe by examining the person your son hurt , he would attempt to be more like Peaches and become an artist beyond hanging himself from meat hooks .
Ben writes such creative fiction , he could ask Peaches how she got her book deal .
Or perhaps like Peaches he could write for newspapers and magazines published around the globe , although even that 's getting difficult for Peaches now that your son has painted her as trouble with a hurtful story fabricated around details from a painful past .
I hope you or your other children can help Ben realize the damage he has caused to ( yet another ? ) young woman , and teach him how to behave like a human being .
Although considering Ben 's past history and recent actions , your record as a mother appears spotty at best .
Perhaps you are the source of his anger , in which case I hope you both are able to find happiness without damaging other people 's lives .
Sincerely ,
Eli Roth

A CBS poll portrays the Tea Party movement as white , middle age , and Republican .
Not Libertarian , but Republican .
If we can believe the poll members of the Tea Party movement favor Sarah Palin , Glenn Beck , and even George Bush over Ron Paul .
Yes , George Bush , the man who presided over two wars .
Even John McCain did better than Ron Paul according to this poll .
If supporters of the Tea Party like George Bush , then they must like the fact he more than doubled the national debt .
They must like the idea of invading small defenseless countries and killing more than a million people .
If the Tea Partiers — as the corporate media calls them , which is better than the pornographic “ teabaggers ” term juvenile anchors on MSNBC and CNN insisted on calling them — love Sarah Palin , then apparently they love the globalist reptile Henry Kissinger .
Remember when Tea Party Sarah said you have to choose between Democrats and Republicans ?
She meant it .
Tea Party Sarah ( insert copyright symbol ) is sort of like a cowboy on the range .
It ’s her job to round up the doggies and corral them .
Get them safely back into the confines of the false right - left paradigm and the One Party system .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Tea Partiers apparently support the idea of bombing Iran .
Sarah Palin has given this up - coming venture her blessing and said if Obama was a real man he would commence hostilities immediately .
Glenn Beck ?
Well , this one is no big surprise .
Beck was appointed the unofficial leader of the hijacked and domesticated Tea Party movement in 2009 by Fox News .
It is interesting he is included on a list with a bunch of establishment politicos .
He is a corporate media disinformation operative , not a politician .
Maybe CBS is trying to tell us something ?
The November mid-terms should be interesting .
If there is any truth to this corporate media poll , supporters of the Tea Party will vote for Republicans .
If anything good comes out of this it will be gridlock in Congress .

For anyone who missed it , I gave a presentation on the new Python GIL , implemented by Antoine Pitrou , at the January 14 , 2010 meeting of Chipy .
The presentation slides can be found at http://www.dabeaz.com/python/NewGIL.pdf .
I do n't have any followup comments to put here at this time .
However , I think this is an exciting new development for Python 3 .
ACM News Swarms of Helicopter Robots Could Create Huge 3 - D Displays
MIT expects to synchronize numerous flying , lighted robots to create free - form , 3 - D displays .
Credit : SENSEable City Lab
Judging from the blockbuster success of Avatar , images that appear three dimensional are poised to transform movies .
But researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) hope to create huge displays in which the third dimension is no illusion .
The Flyfire project aims to create pixels that can move independently in space , by equipping tiny toy helicopters with light - emitting diodes .
So far the team has coordinated the motion of only about ten helicopters , and full - scale results are probably a few years away .
But their video simulations illustrate the dramatic results such a display would make possible .
Remote control of flying vehicles poses special challenges , says Emilio Frazzoli of MIT 's Aerospace Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory .
" On the ground , if you get in trouble , you can just shut down everything , " he notes .
" You do n't have that luxury in the air . "
In addition , different helicopters must not only avoid colliding but also steer clear of each others ' downwash .
Frazzoli and his colleagues have extensive experience getting robots to act on their own , for example in the " urban challenge " run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
" We know how to design a single autonomous object , " he says , but practical robots will need to function in a complicated environment that includes humans and other robotic agents .
So far , the team has worked in a controlled indoor environment to coordinate a few helicopters , which they equipped with microcontrollers and sensors for stabilization and hovering capability .
For overall positioning , they used an external computer , relying on a motion - capture system like that used to make Avatar to monitor the motion of the helicopters .
" This is not very scalable to a large number of vehicles " as envisioned in the display project , Frazzoli says .
" I expect that , as the project develops and scales up , the tradeoff between onboard and offboard intelligence will have to be skewed more towards onboard . "
The Flyfire project grew out of a conversation between Frazzoli and Carlo Ratti , who heads the SENSEable City Laboratory , based in the Urban Studies and Planning Department at MIT .
In general , the lab looks for ways in which " pervasive technologies can better inform the citizen that resides in the city , " says E Roon Kang , a research fellow working on Flyfire .
Other lab projects , for example , track trash electronically or use cell - phone data to study people 's movements .
The display idea builds on the vision of " smart dust , " in which small , smart sensors relay information about the environment , Kang says .
" If we have thousands of those small LEDs flying around , we can create a three dimensional display that will change its configuration in real time . "
Because it can take on a true three - dimensional shape , he says , " it 's almost like you have another channel of information streaming , that is delivering another dimension of information . "
At first , the researchers hope to capture people 's imagination by using the display for public art , but other uses may emerge as they learn more , Kang says .
" We 're just at the stage of envisioning this . "

The story of the financial debacle will end the way it began , with the super - hustlers from Goldman Sachs at the center of the action and profiting wildly .
Never in U.S. history has one company wielded such destructive power over our political economy , irrespective of whether a Republican or a Democrat happened to be president .
At least the robber barons of old built railroads and steel mills , whereas Goldman Sachs makes its money placing bets on people losing their homes .
On Tuesday , Goldman announced a 91 percent jump in profit to $ 3.46 billion for the quarter , while the dreams of millions of families continue to be foreclosed and unemployment hovers at 10 percent because of a crisis that that very company did much to cause .
It was Goldman - Vice - Chairman - turned - Treasury - Secretary Robert Rubin who pushed through the radical financial deregulation during the Clinton presidency that made the derivatives madness possible .
When Bill Clinton was asked on ABC ’s Sunday show “ This Week ” if he now regretted the advice he received back then from Rubin and his protégé Lawrence Summers , now a top Obama adviser , he responded : “ On derivatives , yeah , I think they were wrong and I was wrong to take it . … ”
Thanks to that bad advice , Clinton signed off on the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which categorically exempted those derivatives from any existing law or regulatory body .
It was that exemption that freed Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street to run wild in packaging collateralized debt obligations , and their attendant swaps , which turned people ’s home into nothing more than gambling chips .
The more suckers to be conned into those mortgage obligations , the better for the financial casino — until it had to be saved by taxpayers from spiraling completely out of control .
And it was Goldman - Chairman - turned - Treasury - Secretary Henry Paulson who engineered the Bush - era bailout that left Goldman holding the high cards .
The corporation was allowed to suddenly become a bank holding company , a privilege denied Lehman Brothers , and hence eligible for TARP funding and a sharp discount in the cost of borrowing money .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , then head of the New York Fed , worked with Paulson to give Goldman the federally protected status of a commercial bank and also worked on the deal that passed taxpayer money through AIG to Goldman .
It was n’t surprising , then , that last week Geithner formally opposed the section of a bill by Sen.
Blanche Lincoln that would ban banks from dealing in swaps and other derivatives .
Now that it is a bank , Goldman would have to drop that lucrative business or give up its right as a bank to borrow from the Federal Reserve as well as the protection of federal deposit insurance .
The test for serious financial reform could well be that if it ’s good for Goldman Sachs , it ’s bad for the country .
But with scores of Goldman alums as well placed in the Obama administration as they were under Clinton and George W. Bush , it is a test the government is likely to fail as far as taxpayers are concerned .
Or should we simply trust Mark Patterson , who is chief of staff to Geithner and a Goldman lobbyist for three years before he entered the Obama administration , to do the right thing for the rest of us ?
Maybe he will .
After all , Gary Gensler , a former Goldman partner who now heads the critically important Commodity Futures Trading Commission , does seem to have had a change of heart from his days in the Clinton administration , when he thought that bringing “ legal certainty ” to the trade in what turned out to be “ toxic derivatives ” was a great thing .
The SEC civil suit is also a sign of progress .
There are other positive stirrings , as in President Barack Obama ’s most recent speeches , but what is needed now is a profound populist commitment among those who elected Obama to demand he throw the money - changers out of the temple of democratic governance .
Instead they are crowding in .
The New York Times reported : “ With so much money at stake , it is not surprising that more than 1,500 lobbyists , executives , bankers and others have made their way to the Senate committee that on Wednesday will take up legislation to rein in derivatives . ”
That ’s the committee that Sen.
Lincoln heads , and she needs the president ’s support rather than Geithner ’s opposition to her plan to ban banks like Goldman from trading in derivatives .
It is insulting to the spirit of populist revolt , which has been fundamental to the success of America ’s grand experiment in democracy , that a fat - cat Republican - funded tea party revolt is now the vessel of popular anti-Wall Street discontent .
That vessel ought to be our president , who campaigned as a champion of the common people .
K - 1 was offering me $ 187,500 per fight - five times what the UFC was offering - and I was still willing to stay with them for one - third of that amount .
This was when the relationship took a turn for the worse , and my view of White changed drastically .
From that point on , I knew when it came to money , we could n't trust him to treat us right .
Did I like him at the dinner table ?
Sure .
But at the negotiating table ?
Not at all .
The pressure to perform and safeguard other people 's money had changed him , even though he was constantly bragging to anyone willing to listen about how ' big this thing was going to be . '
Things between us would never be the same .
When it was finally official I was going to fight in Japan , White called me up and told me his true feelings .
' You motherfucker !
You 're fucking done !
You 'll never fight in the UFC again !
You 're finished .
You 're scorched earth , motherfucker .
Scorched earth .
Do n't call me crying saying you want to come back because you 're fucking done !'
And on and on and on , like a true professional - even going so far as to tell me I would never see my face again in a UFC video , promotion , or anything else .
He also planned on removing my fight with Hughes from the UFC 46 DVD so no one would even know who I was .
' It does n't have to be this way , ' I told him .
' You know it would n't take that much to make this work . '
But he just kept yelling .
-- BJ Penn , discussing Dana White 's reaction to his decision to leave the UFC after defeating Matt Hughes at UFC 46 .
This is from BJ Penn 's new book .
While I have n't read the whole book , it 's very likely that White 's anger over Penn 's book stemmed from this section .
The biggest surprise to me is that Penn would come forward with a story like this while he is still an active UFC star .
It 's one thing to release a tell - all book after retirement , but one has to wonder what the motivation was to tell a story like this now .
As far as the veracity of the above story , I am strongly inclined to believe it is true .
I 've heard from enough agents and fighters about breakdowns in communication with the UFC to know what happens when they think someone is trying to screw them over .

Ever see those crazy guys in the park playing speed chess ?
They 're flying along at warp speed , trusting their instincts and trying to avoid one mistake that might get them checkmated .
That 's what doing an online chat is like .
Writing a column is like chess ; you have time to mull strategies and move pieces into the right places .
But an online chat ?
Speed chess .
My Friday chat on ESPN.com drew 42,000 questions .
The total transcript was 9,600 words , and because I probably typed two - thirds of them , that means I banged out about 6,400 words in three hours .
When I was n't typing , I was sifting through questions looking for a good one to post .
Did n't pee .
Did n't get a drink .
Did n't even stand up .
Just emptied my brain on a keyboard .
Now here 's why I rarely do chats anymore :
Under speed chess conditions , it becomes exceedingly possible that either ( A ) I might say something inappropriate , ( B ) I might infuriate my bosses in some way or ( C ) I might argue a point incorrectly without realizing it until later .
On Friday , I made a mistake comparing the 2010 Tiger Woods to the 1970 Muhammad Ali , saying Tiger 's comeback would be much tougher because " everyone under 35 was rooting for Ali . "
Total hyperbole that never would have happened had I spent more time thinking about it .
More importantly , I botched a quality point that could have made for an interesting column .
Let 's return to my admittedly rushed thesis
When Tiger Woods returns to golf , he will face a level of pressure that well surpasses anything any other transcendent athlete has faced in my lifetime .
Yeah .
Absolutely .
Let 's hop on the course and play nine holes ( in the form of points ) to bang home the point that , yes , Tiger 's presumed return to golf in 2010 will be significantly more difficult than Ali 's return to boxing in 1970 .
Hole No. 1 ( par 4 )
Tiger has n't played golf competitively in four months .
As far as we know , until this week he has n't played a single hole since mid-November .
Just Tuesday , there was a news article saying Tiger has returned home and is " trying to get back into a routine that includes golf and fitness . "
Trying to get back into a routine ?
That sounds ominous .
Hole No. 2 ( par 4 )
The man is coming off two significant derailments : Reconstructive knee surgery ( summer 2008 ) and a self - imposed exile ( winter of 2009 - 10 ) .
In a 41 - month stretch from 2005 through the 2008 U.S. Open , Tiger reeled off 25 PGA Tour titles ( six of them majors ) .
Is that guy gone ?
How many times have we seen an imposing golfer lose his way and never regain his mojo ?
Remember when Tom Watson stopped making big putts ?
Remember when Greg Norman lost his confidence after too many collapses ?
Golf is a mental sport .
You need a ton of self - confidence , you need an unwavering belief in your own talents and you need to be able to tune out any and all distractions .
Hell , Tiger could barely handle someone 's camera clicking during his backswing .
He 's going to be able to handle this ?
[+]
Enlarge AP Photo / Rob Carr Tiger would undoubtedly love to turn the clock back to 2006 , when he won the PGA Championship .
( Note : When Ali returned from his exile with rusty skills , he stopped dancing as much , absorbed more punishment and learned to pick his spots .
As his skills slipped even further later in his career , he absorbed insane amounts of punishment and banked on his innate will to prevail in the end .
That 's the main reason he can barely say a sentence right now .
If Tiger comes back with similar rust , I can't imagine him being able to change his style on the fly as Ali did .
Either it comes back or it does n't . )
Hole No. 3 ( par 3 )
Do n't discount Tiger 's advancing age ( 34 ) at this point .
Watson never won another major after he turned 34 ; neither did Arnold Palmer , Fred Couples , Seve Ballesteros or Curtis Strange .
Nick Faldo won only one major after 34 -- the 1996 Masters that Norman choked away .
Only Jack Nicklaus thrived from 34 to 40 ( 16 PGA Tour titles , three majors ) , although Norman ( eight Tour titles , one major ) and Lee Trevino ( six titles , one major ) also fared pretty well .
Tom Kite peaked after he turned 34 .
Nick Price won two majors at 37 ; Mark O'Meara won his only two at 41 .
And sure , Tiger was better than all of those guys .
But none of those guys had to keep winning while rebuilding his life after a DEFCON 1 public humiliation .
Hole No. 4 ( par 4 )
Winning his wife back will require significant effort -- certainly more than Tiger spent on his family pre-Thanksgiving .
Ali , Jordan , Tiger pre-2010 part of what made them great was that they were n't family men .
Families were just another thing they owned , no different from cars , houses or whatever .
Everything was compartmentalized , and nothing was allowed to affect the overall brand .
The brand came first .
Always .
Because Tiger appears to be serious about keeping his family intact , how could that not affect his golf routine to some degree ?
And what about dealing with the day - to - day stuff any philandering husband faces while trying to win back a wife battling trust issues ?
Why did n't you answer when I called ?
Why does your BlackBerry have a password again ?
Who 's going on this trip with you ?
When Ali's second marriage finally fell apart while he was training for the George Foreman fight in Zaire , he simply fell for someone else ( the beautiful Veronica Porsche , who later dumped him right around when the Parkinson 's started kicking in ) and dumped his dutiful wife , Belinda .
( Brutally , actually .
She heard about him squiring around with someone else , then flew across the world to confront him .
Did n't work . )
Ali ended up winning the two biggest fights of his career in succession : Foreman and the third Joe Frazier fight .
He did n't care about hurting his brand ; if anything , the media in Zaire covered up the love triangle .
Had he been more worried about his brand , losing everything he had , keeping his family together and rehabbing his public image , would n't that have affected his performances in the Foreman and Frazier fights at least a little ?
Hole No. 5 ( par 4 )
Once upon a time , everyone left Tiger alone , partly because the media did n't want to piss him off , partly because he crafted such a good buffer between himself and the outside world , and partly because there was n't anything sexy or interesting about him .
That 's how he lived from 1997 to 2009 .
Even named his boat " Privacy . "
And really , he had it .
Not anymore .
Tiger will spend the rest of his playing days as Jordan did in the latter half of his Chicago career -- trapped in hotel suites and charter planes , occasionally emerging to play sports , and if he needs to blow off steam , his options are " the nearest high - stakes gambling area , " and that 's about it .
I 'm not saying Tiger 's life was normal before Thanksgiving , but he did n't have paparazzi stalking him , tabloids making up things about him , bloggers chronicling his every move and people taping him with camera phones everywhere he goes .
Fish , meet bowl .
And he 's a big-ass fish .
How will he handle it ?
We do n't know .
[+]

Ali's court case received plenty of media attention , but it was nothing like today 's 24/7 news cycle .
Hole No. 6 ( par 5 )
Forget about Ali ; not even Jordan faced anything like the current sports / celebrity climate .
It ca n't even be called a 24/7 news cycle anymore .
It 's like 72/7 .
TMZ , Us Weekly , People , Star , gossip blogs , sports blogs , 24 - hour sports radio , ESPN talking heads , six mainstream sports
Web sites , camera phones , message boards , YouTube , flip cameras , Twitter are you kidding me ?
Would you want to be a famously shamed athlete striving to regain past success in 2010 ?
Plus , Jordan had the buffer of a basketball court .
Ali had the buffer of a boxing ring and just a few fights per year .
Golf ?
Does n't work that way .
You 're walking among fans for hole after hole .
They 're right there .
Always .
Studying every move you make from as close as five feet away .
And you can't come and go ; you need to be out there swinging your sticks week after week after week in city after city after city .
Which means this will be a traveling sideshow , at least for the first few months .
Hole No. 7 ( par 4 )
How will the fans react ?
Do we know ?
Do we have any inkling ?
I could see the turmoil eventually turning him into a sentimental underdog ; after all , we watched him go through the Celebrity F--- up Car Wash , dissected it , made our jokes , broke it down at cocktail parties , and now , selfishly , we 're ready to see him reclaim " best golfer ever " status .
That 's the most idealistic view of how it plays out .
But we do n't know .
And I guarantee you , neither does Tiger Woods .
Remember , everybody has been rooting for him since he was wowing Mike Douglas as a 2 - year - old .
Although we 've seen tournaments when another golfer swayed the gallery from him , Tiger always knew where he stood with fans .
But what about now ?
( On Wednesday , an ABC News / ESPN poll revealed that only 39 percent of the 1,000 respondents surveyed had a favorable impression of Tiger , compared with 85 percent in 2005 . )
Golf and tennis are the two worst possible sports for any elephant - in - the - room situation , thanks to dead silence nearly all the time .
Every heckle will feel like an uber - heckle .
Every cheer for a competing golfer will feel even more biting than usual .
Again , think of how he reacted on the golf course pre-Thanksgiving .
How will he handle it ?
( Note : The 2008 U.S. Open catapulted Tiger to a different level .
Winning it on one leg did for him what the Foreman fight did for Ali and the 72 - win season did for MJ :
It made everyone say , " We 're now at the point that I 'm going to be telling my great - grandkids that I watched this guy .
So let the winning continue ! "
As long as we do n't have a hometown favorite involved , we 're always going to root for greatness over anything else .
That 's the best place to be as an athlete -- people pulling for you , always , week after week , with the athlete feeding off their strength .
Can he win that back ? )
Hole No. 8 ( par 3 )
When Ali returned from his Vietnam - related exile , he had two massive groups of people pulling for him : Black America and the anti-war movement .
He was part of something bigger than he was ; that gave him additional motivation to persevere , and if anything , he fed off those two worlds .
Tiger is n't part of anything .
Where will he draw that extra strength from if the fans do n't come through for him ?
( Note : I thought about delving into the whole " women hate Tiger " angle here , but I 'm not sure it has anything to do with anything .
Just know that if he plays the 2010 Masters , my wife will be rooting for him to accidentally club himself in the head on every swing .
And I do n't think she 's alone . )
Hole No. 9 ( par 5 )
The biggest wrinkle nobody is mentioning :
What if this starts out badly ?
What if Tiger plays a couple of tournaments and just stinks ?
What if he can't get anything going ?
What if the dominant story becomes , " Will Tiger Woods ever get it back ? "
What if he 's dealing with that question constantly , day after day , week after week , city after city , over and over and over again , and that doubt seeps into his head ?
Ali fought only every few months and had the luxury of picking cream - puff opponents if need be .
Tiger will be competing against himself week after week -- not just his potential , but the ghost of what he could once do .
There 's no greater pressure in sports .
Now , there 's a chance golf will become something of a sanctuary for Tiger Woods -- a little like what basketball meant to Jordan in those final Chicago seasons .
Including playoffs , Jordan played 310 of a possible 310 games in three seasons from 1996 through 1998 .
Why ?
Because he was a hypercompetitive maniac , but also because a basketball court was one of the few places that made him happy .
I could see this happening with Tiger .
Potentially .
There 's also a chance Tiger could come roaring out of the gate in Eff You Mode and give us an exhilarating stretch of golf like we 've never seen in our lives .
Everything 's in play .
At gunpoint , if I could wager on any conceivable scenario , I would wager on Tiger coming back in severe Eff You Mode , like a seething MJ in Game 1 of the 1992 Finals .
The greatest ones have a way of channeling negativity and fueling it toward whatever makes them great .
Jordan made a habit of it .
So did Ali .
But they were also larger - than - life personalities , whereas Tiger was always just someone who was freakishly good at golf and that 's it .
So it remains to be seen whether Tiger has Severe Eff You DNA .
But if you were him , would you have rather had this saga happen in 1970 or 2010 ?
It 's no contest .
He 's being picked apart like a biology frog right now , and we wo n't know whether three months ( and counting ) of ridicule and shame permanently derailed his confidence in any way .
Only when he emerges from hiding and starts playing again will we have our answer .

Enlarge AP Photo / Joe Holloway Jr. By the time Ali returned to fight Jerry Quarry in 1970 , he had legions of supporters .
That brings us to Ali .
His exile lasted almost 43 months , with the former champ finally returning for an exhibition in Atlanta ( September 1970 ) , then his first official fight against Jerry Quarry a few weeks later .
Unlike Tiger ,
Ali loved the limelight and remains the greatest natural resource the sports media ever encountered .
He traveled to dozens of college campuses and spoke out about racial injustice and his stance against the war .
He had two enormous allies in Howard Cosell ( the most powerful sports broadcaster at the time ) and Sports Illustrated ( the most powerful sports magazine ) , as well as a phalanx of big - name writers ( George Plimpton , Dick Schaap , etc. ) who attached themselves to him and sang his praises .
He never had to deal with a 24/ 7 news cycle ; if anything , it was a once - a - week cycle .
Either way , it would n't have mattered .
Ali always loved being the center of attention .
You can't overstate how much Ali 's life changed from 1967 ( when he was considered a draft - dodging , uppity , outspoken negro who had the gall to adopt a Muslim name , and if that 's not enough , it seemed as though he was headed for jail ) to the fall of 1970 ( when he had been reinvented as something of a visionary in a country now obsessed with the Vietnam quagmire and equal rights ) .
Heading into the Quarry fight , he still had Old - School White America against him ( then again , so did Jim Brown , Bill Russell and Lew Alcindor ) , as well as pro-war zealots ( then again , so did countless celebrities and musicians who also spoke out against the war ) and even some prominent writers ( most notably Red Smith and Jim Murray ) still excoriating him .
His biggest issue was a suspension by Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad -- a rift that healed only because Ali became a cash cow postexile , so of course the Nation of Islam quickly made amends -- that briefly worried his camp about his safety .
But the pressures of Ali's exile ( especially in the first two years ) should n't be confused with the pressure of his actual comeback ( which was n't nearly as daunting as you would think ) .
By the fall of 1970 , Ali was n't getting hounded by paparazzi or picked apart by an obsessive media .
If anything , he lost a little fame as the exile dragged along , and he fell out of public consciousness to some degree .
Sports Illustrated put him on its cover in May 1969 , then deemed him unworthy of another until the month of the first Frazier fight nearly two years later .
In the weeks leading up to the Quarry fight , most of the anti-Ali stuff had died down or disappeared entirely .
He had evolved into a " political and social force , " as biographer Thomas Hauser described him .
In Hauser 's book , longtime boxing promoter Jim Jacobs described in detail how things had changed for Ali after getting stripped of his title :
" A substantial portion of the American public disliked him , and worse , they were getting tired of hearing what he was about .
But the exile turned that around .
It showed people that Ali was sincere .
It made him an underdog .
And traveling around the country , speaking on college campuses , Ali was able to bring his message to tens of thousands of young men and women .
In a way , it was like a Presidential candidate sowing the seeds for future caucuses and primaries .
And of course , people began to feel that whether or not they liked Ali , he should n't have been forced out for his beliefs ( when he came back against Quarry ) , Ali was paid more money for that fight than he'd ever been paid before . "
Here 's how Sports Illustrated 's Martin Kane described Ali 's first exhibition fight in Atlanta :
" The roof did not fall in .
No one threw a bomb .
Fire and brimstone did not rain down from heaven and no one was turned into a pillar of salt .
There was n't even a picket outside the Morehouse College gym in Atlanta -- just a pretty girl distributing election campaign pamphlets .
Not a peep of protest had been uttered -- in Atlanta or elsewhere -- during the few days of promotion that preceded the event . "
By that time , Ali had softened much of his pro-Islam rhetoric , picked his words more thoughtfully and started caring about the potentially unflattering actions of the people around him .
Sports Illustrated 's Mark Kram visited him before the Quarry fight and described him like so :
" The suspension by Elijah seems to have jolted him into extreme caution ; a need and desire for money so that he can ensure the future of his family seems to have made him conscious of the practical aspects of the world .
Where he was once one of the indefatigable consumers anywhere , a one - man war against recession , he now behaves like a careful prince of commerce .
Even his camp , once so virulent with contempt for others , is of a different character .
Cap'n Sam , Ali 's bodyguard and inspired white hater , is gone , and Ali 's craftily obedient brother is obviously absent .
Only Bundini , his phrasemaker and ' witch doctor , ' remains .
' All I think about now , ' says Ali , 'is providing for my family so they wo n't have it as difficult as I did .
So my three little darling girls can get a good education and learn from the beginning how to read and spell .
Not like me . ' "
When Ali finally returned to the ring for real , a considerable number of Americans were rooting for him -- not " everyone , " as I stupidly overstated in the chat , but a sizable chunk -- and the event itself captured the revolutionary spirit of that era .
Activist Julian Bond described the Quarry fight " like nothing I 've ever seen , the black elite of America was there " and decided it was " more than a fight because that night , Atlanta came into its own as the black political capital of America . "
Ali 's comeback tapped into something larger than just boxing .
And he knew it .
Within three years , Muhammad Ali would become America 's most popular athlete since Babe Ruth .
He changed some ; the world around him changed even more .
But I skimmed through my collection of Ali books , read the old Sports Illustrateds and even sifted through the New York Times articles from that year , and at no point in the fall of 1970 did anyone wonder whether Ali might fold from the pressure of that comeback .
He had come to peace with everything that had happened to him .
He just wanted to reclaim his career .
Sure , there were concerns for his safety in such a violent era -- in fact , policemen and security guards blanketed Atlanta for the exhibition and for the real fight -- but those concerns proved to be unfounded .
Nothing happened .
Forty years later , many people ( including me ) wonder whether Tiger Woods might fold under the pressure of his comeback .
It 's a fair concern .
The pressures are n't nearly as meaningful as the ones surrounding Ali -- one of the most important , courageous and influential athletes ever -- but they remain pressures nonetheless .
Add them together , and it's no contest .
When Ali actually returned in September 1970 , it was a cakewalk compared with what Tiger will face this month or next month or whenever he actually returns .
Regardless , I probably should n't do chats anymore -- not because I screwed up but because it 's dumb to waste points better served in a larger format such as this column .
The greatest golfer of his generation , and possibly ever , has to rebuild three things -- his family , career and brand -- while trying to win tournaments and recapture old glories .
The most private superstar athlete of his generation will live under unbearable public scrutiny for the next few months at the very least .
They are the same person .
And if you claim that you can predict exactly how that person will emerge from this twisted mess you are lying .

India 's copyright office website is " best viewed in 1024 x 768 true colors , Internet Explorer version 6.0 or above . "
That might sound a bit dated , but it has nothing on the country 's copyright law , which was last overhauled completely in 1957 .
Although it was updated five times in the 1980s and 1990s , the law does not comply with numerous international treaties such as the WIPO Internet Treaties of 1996 .
On April 19 , another major set of Copyright Act amendments ( PDF ) was introduced with the explicit goal of bringing India into compliance " with the provisions of the two WIPO Internet Treaties , to the extent considered necessary and desirable . "
( Note that final clause ; we 'll return to it in a bit . )
This legal update has been in the works for years — it goes back to at least 2005 .
It also contains several things that the big content industries would seem to want , such as a ban on circumventing DRM and threatening both fines and jail time for those who do so .
So why are the copyright industries so upset at India 's attempt to bring its copyright into the Internet era ?
Is n't that what they want ?
Sort of , but they want it done in one particular way .
Our way or the highway
India has long been one of the few countries on the US Special 301 " Priority Watch List " ( PDF ) as one of the world 's top offenders when it comes to piracy and copyright infringement .
While the inclusion of Canada ( yes , Canada ) on this list has always seemed patently bizarre to us , the case for India is more easily made .
Here 's how bad it is : " The piracy rate for music in the online space is estimated at 99 % ...
India was among the top 10 countries in the world for illegal filesharing ( P2P ) activities ...
In one case , pamphlets were being distributed with the morning newspaper offering pirated software and referring readers to the website www.cd75dvd150.20m.com to place orders ...
It is estimated that India 's cable companies declare only 20 % of their subscribers and that the piracy level in this market is at 80 % with significant losses ...
The sale of high - risk trade books at traffic junctions in New Delhi appears to be a lesson ; last year it was at epidemic proportions . "
All of those quotes come courtesy of the International Intellectual Property Alliance ( IIPA ) as part of its 2010 report to the US government ( PDF ) on the Special 301 list of IP offenders .
( The IIPA is made up of groups like the RIAA , MPAA , ESA , etc. )
Once again , the IIPA demands that India stay on the highest - profile " Priority Watch List , in part because the country 's law is not consistent with the WIPO Internet Treaties .
This reasoning sounds a bit odd , since India has n't even signed the WIPO treaties and so can't be considered in breach of them .
But doing things a " different " way is n't really an option for the IIPA , which wants to impose a single standard on most of the world .
That standard will sound familiar to US readers :
Add statutory damages in civil cases
Add an optical disc law
Comply with the WIPO Internet Treaties
Add an anti-camcording law
The US has these laws in place already , and these provisions are also being pushed as part of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , which hopes to bring the wonder of $ 1.92 million statutory judgments against individual file - sharers to the rest of the world .
Actually , none of these ideas is bad on its own ; statutory damages can serve a useful function when they are kept within appropriate bounds .
Similarly , the WIPO Internet treaties are not themselves objectionable ; even their DRM anti-circumvention provisions are flexible , and allow countries great freedom in lawmaking .
India 's new copyright amendments take advantage of this freedom .
The bill itself tells us that its anticircumvention provisions are meant to comply with the WIPO Internet Treaties , but they do so in a way that the US attempt to comply with WIPO — the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) — never did : it would be legal to bypass DRM if the intended use is a legal one .
As India 's proposed amendment puts it , bypassing DRM " with the intention of infringing " copyright is illegal , but if there 's no intent to infringe , it 's OK .
The bill also does not appear to address devices and software ( like DeCSS and other tools ) that make such bypassing possible .
Those would remain legal .
Commenting on a draft version of this proposal , the IIPA slammed it hard .
The bill " contains an exception which would appear to permit circumvention for any purpose that would not amount to infringement under the act , " says the group , " thereby almost completely eviscerating any protection . "
Rather than judging actions and intentions — was that DVD DRM bypassed in order to make a home backup , or was it bypassed to make and sell copies on the street ?— such a rule lays a far heavier burden on the copyright industries when it comes to policing the content .
It 's also arguably much fairer , since it preserves fair dealing and other exceptions and limitations to copyright that DRM can often override .
The law also does little to specifically address Internet piracy .
The big content companies have settled on a basic worldwide strategy of " graduated response , " preferably one that ends by booting people off the Internet .
Indeed , this year 's IIPA Special 301 report demands that , " before this phenomenon spins totally out of control , the Indian government should ensure that ISPs and rights holders cooperate in establishing a fair and workable ' graduated response ' system . "
India does not appear to agree .
When the US finalizes its 2010 Special 301 list soon , we expect India to top it once again .
The Special 301 process is a certainly an odd one : where else can big entertainment companies have entire countries put on a US government blacklist over issues like graduated response — something that the US does n't even have ?
Perhaps the strangeness of the whole process can best be summed up by the very last sentences in the IIPA 's 2010 report on India , where " open source software " comes in for a beating : " The industry is also concerned about moves by the government to consider mandating the use of open source software and software of only domestic origin .
Though such policies have not yet been implemented , IIPA and BSA urge that this area be carefully monitored . "
Open source is bad enough , but a " buy Indian " law ?
That would be an outrage and surely something the US government would not itself engage in as recently as last year .
Err , right ?

Runs batted in — RBIs — are n’t always a useful measure of an individual hitter ’s skill , because you can only drive runners in when they ’re already on base for you .
A great player on a bad team might not get as many RBIs as an okay player on a great team .
Did you find that statement almost insulting in its obviousness ?
You would n’t have seven years ago , before Michael Lewis ’s Moneyball was released , when such sabermetric notions — “ sabermetrics ” is the name for the science of studying baseball statistics — were the subject of hot debate around the game , their proponents pilloried as clueless , computer - addled nerds by tobacco - chewing , road - weary baseball lifers .
Now it seems silly that anyone ever found those ideas controversial .
But that does n’t mean that Moneyball no longer has anything to teach us .
Moneyball was n’t ever really about RBIs , or walks , or any other stat ; it was a business story about a small firm ( the Oakland A’s ) finding inefficiencies in the market for baseball players , inefficiencies that could allow it to compete with industry titans like the Yankees and Red Sox .
The A ’s realized that statistical analysis was underused — but soon , of course , the big firms caught on .
Young sabermetric general managers are everywhere now , from 36 - year - old Theo Epstein in Boston , who already has two World Series rings , to 32 - year - old Jon Daniels in Texas .
Yankees G.M. Brian Cashman has said he incorporates stathead insights into his decision - making .
The question of how to study baseball has been settled , although no one has tried to replace scouts with robots — every team now evaluates players with a combination of statistical analysis and firsthand observation .
But there is still much to be determined .
Can statistical analysis and video breakdown of throwing form help figure out which flamethrowing college pitchers are less likely to get injured after they ’re drafted ?
Can it tell you exactly which players on your team should hit and run in the seventh inning of a one - run game ?
What proportion of its budget should a mid-market team spend on minor - league coaching relative to high - school scouting in order to maximize profits ?
There are a million questions to choose from , but right now the most cutting - edge research is in the mysterious , ethereal , and , most maddeningly , subjective world of defense .
And that quest to objectify the subjective has opened a new front in the battle between the Yankees and their eternal enemies , the Red Sox .
John Dewan is the former president and CEO of Stats — the company that provides statistical services for every major American sports league , including Major League Baseball — who in 2002 founded Baseball Info Solutions , which “ specializes in collecting , interpreting , and disseminating in - depth baseball statistics . ”
Each season , the company pays fifteen to twenty video scouts whose lone job is to watch every single Major League Baseball game and notate everything that happens .
Every .
Single .
Thing .
“ Each of our video scouts has a computer screen with a replica of the field and about 50,000 pixels to choose from to determine the exact location of every batted ball , ” Dewan says .
“ We mark the exact location and velocity of everything . ”
Dewan ’s staff has to do this all by hand , of course ; finding ways to statistically measure fielding makes the Moneyball - chronicled process of rethinking hitting - and - pitching statistics look like a real cakewalk .
The old batting statistics were n’t perfect , but they were the building blocks of better measures .
The only commonly kept fielding stat , by contrast , was “ errors , ” which should have long ago gone the way of the bull - pen car .
Errors are merely a tally of blatantly noticeable mistakes , which are a minuscule part of what happens in the field .
A hitter ’s job is easy to quantify :
He succeeds in getting on base ( or hitting the ball out of the park ) or he does n’t .
But countless variables can affect whether a fielder even has a chance to make an error : where he ’s positioned , how quickly he reacts to the ball off the bat , what route he takes toward it , how quickly he gets the ball out of his glove , how hard he throws the ball to another fielder .
It ’s still important to catch the ball cleanly once you get to it , of course — but in the skilled world of professional baseball , almost everyone makes the easy play almost all the time .
It ’s how many of the hard plays they give themselves the chance to make that ’s much more important .
But how do you decide whether the left - fielder should have been in better position to catch a shallow , looping fly ball ?
For almost its entire history , baseball ’s simple answer was :
You do n’t .
You mark errors and leave everything else up to individual judgment .
But using improved technology ( most notably easy - to - access online video ) and clever reasoning , Dewan and his analysts have come closer to figuring out defense than ever before .

Dewan has long known “ errors ” were an insufficient defensive barometer , but he also thought other companies , including his old company Stats , were n’t even getting the more nuanced details right .
Dewan has each of his scouts note not only where the ball was hit but also its type ( grounder , fly ball , line drive , or “ fliner ” ) and an estimate of its speed ( on a scale of “ slow ” to “ hard ” ) .
He says he has quantified the exact lengths of time a ball that is hit to the gaps between the center - fielder and the right - and left - fielders needs to be in the air so that almost every outfielder will catch it ( six seconds ) and so that almost none will ( three seconds ) .
The goal is to figure out what balls certain players get to and others do n’t .
A fly ball hit to center in Citi Field might look something like this :
Vector 187 degrees. 290 feet .
Medium .
Fliner .
At the end of the season , Dewan has a complete log of every fliner hit in the major leagues to each of roughly 3,000 zones .
He can see which center - fielders caught the most and which caught the least .
And using that information for every tiny zone of the field , he can tell you how every player in baseball plays his position relative to everyone else .
It ’s an extremely structured method of collating subjective judgments .
Dewan and company published their results in a 2009 book called The Fielding Bible : Vol .
II , which features two proprietary statistics : Plus / Minus and Runs Saved .
Plus / Minus is the exact number , tabulated on a play - by - play basis , of plays a defender makes above or below the league average fielder at that position .
Thus , at shortstop , Jack Wilson has a Plus / Minus of +32 :
He made 32 more plays than the average shortstop .
That ’s transposed into the Runs Saved number , which is the number of actual runs prevented by the fielder ; for Wilson , it ’s 27 , the best in the game at his position .
( The process of converting Plus / Minus to Runs Saved is too complicated to explain here , but it ’s laid out in Dewan ’s book in not - incomprehensible language . )
And though no one will confirm it on the record , it is widely believed that Plus / Minus and Runs Saved — thanks to Dewan ’s professional connection to Bill James , who now works for the Red Sox — served as the foundation of the Sox ’ off - season moves .
The major free - agent acquisitions of everyday players by the Red Sox were not particularly major , at least by the nuclear terms to which we have grown accustomed .
The Sox added third - baseman Adrian Beltre , shortstop Marco Scutaro , and center - fielder Mike Cameron .
If you ’ve heard of all three of them , you ’re probably a pretty big baseball fan .
None is a regular All - Star or a major offensive force :
Beltre hit only eight homers last season , and Cameron is 37 years old and has hit over .270 only once in his career .
What they do well , though , better than almost anyone else in baseball , is play defense .
In 2009 , Beltre made 26 more plays than the average third - baseman , saving 21 runs , good for third best in baseball at the hot corner .
Last year ’s primary
Sox third - baseman , Mike Lowell , made 23 fewer plays than the average , costing his team eighteen runs .
Right there , at one position , that ’s a 49 - play - above - average improvement , with 39 more runs saved .
The generally accepted sabermetric formula is that ten runs saved ( with the glove ) or created ( with the bat ) equals one win .
With one position switch , the Red Sox might have made a four - game improvement before Beltre takes a single swing of the bat .
You can do the same math in center field : Cameron saved three runs last year with the Brewers , while Jacoby Ellsbury , who is moving from center to left this year , cost his team nine : a twelve - run difference , one win .
Ellsbury ’s shift to left ?
As a left - fielder two years ago , he saved his team five runs in only 36 games started ; 2009 left - fielder ( and new Met ) Jason Bay cost the Sox two last year .
There ’s at least another win right there .
At shortstop , Scutaro saved twelve runs for the Blue Jays last year ; the Sox ’ revolving shortstops cost their team nineteen .
Three more wins there .
The Red Sox have dramatically improved their team ’s chances of catching the Yankees without having to shell out nine - figure , decadelong contracts .
“ In the old days , and even some people today , you ’d look at the Red Sox off - season moves and say , ‘ They clearly lost more on offense than they gained on defense , ’ ” Dewan says .
“ Now we ’re able to measure it , and tell just how much more they gained . ”
The Yankees have the exact same idea about defense .
They actually made one huge improvement before last season : Mark Teixeira might have tied for the American League lead in homers last year , but just as crucially , he saved twelve more runs ( per Dewan ) than the lumbering Jason Giambi , which translates to a full win .
This off - season , the team decided not to bid for free - agent left - fielders Bay and Matt Holliday , choosing instead to use Brett Gardner to replace Johnny Damon in left field and acquiring the bargain contract of Curtis Granderson via trade to play center .
Damon was one run worse than the average left - fielder on defense last year , while Gardner saved nine runs in his limited time in center .
Left field is easier to play than center , so Gardner should be even better there , a vast improvement over Damon .
Meanwhile , Granderson will probably be substantially better than the Gardner–Melky Cabrera platoon in center .
Overall , the Yankees ’ outfield defense should be at least two wins better this year , while on offense Granderson will likely match if not exceed the offensive production lost by the departure of Damon .
What ’s more , he makes only $ 9 million a year , which is $ 7.5 million less than Bay and $ 8 million less than Holliday .
All told , using Gardner and Granderson is a way to keep up the defensive improvements of last year — Dewan says the Yanks improved by 41 runs in 2009 , amounting to four wins — without costing anything significant on offense or the bottom line .
The Yankees and Sox , baseball ’s titans of profligate spending — of $ 50 million bidding wars for players like Daisuke Matsuzaka — are now locked in an equally intense battle to see who can be more subtly ingenious and fiscally responsible .

Runs saved is n’t the only defensive metric out there : Ultimate Zone Rating , put together by a sabermetrician and former Cardinals consultant named Mitchel Lichtman , is more widely used than Runs Saved because it ’s publicly available on the FanGraphs site without a subscription .
( You must pay a monthly fee to Bill James ’s website to access Dewan ’s numbers . )
There are several more systems , but they ’re all based on the same concept , of dividing the field into zones and comparing each fielder to his peers ; they only occasionally disagree on a player ( Dewan is a slightly bigger fan of Mets outfielder Jeff Francoeur than Lichtman is ) .
If you want , you can go to the message board of Lichtman ’s website to see him and Dewan arguing over , for example , the ways their final rankings make sure not to punish outfielders who played in particularly large outfields .
In the end , as Baseball Prospectus co-founder Clay Davenport says , “ everyone ’s pursuing variations of the same idea , ” and the competition between metrics leads to greater accuracy for all .
That ’s a good thing , since the field is still young and subject to volatility .
Consider the example of Derek Jeter .
For the first part of his career , Jeter was regarded as one of the best fielders in the game , but the reputation was mostly based on the anecdotal observations of sportswriters , broadcasters , and managers impressed by his jump throws from the hole at shortstop and his famous “ flip play ” against the A’s in the 2001 American League Division Series .
( He won three Gold Gloves in a row , starting in 2004 . )
But defensive metrics like Dewan ’s showed him to be not only an overrated defender but in fact a wretched one .
His Runs Saved number was - 28 in 2005 , - 18 in 2006 , and - 23 in 2007 , making him one of the worst shortstops in baseball all three years .
( As far back as 2001 , Baseball Prospectus famously described Jeter ’s defense as “ yecch . ” )
But in the last two years , he has improved dramatically in Dewan ’s estimation , a highly unusual development for a player in his mid-thirties .
His Runs Saved number was - 9 in 2008 and actually + 2 last season .
Did Jeter get better , or did the numbers become more accurate ?
Probably both , but it ’s impossible to be too precise ; there are fielding - statistics innovations yet to be made .
( For example , none of the leading fielding metrics measures the defensive abilities of catchers , who are the most important defensive players on the field . )
The reason this data is so rare and so valued is that it ’s extremely labor - intensive : Not everyone — not even most teams — has a staff of people available to pore over 2,430 baseball games .
And even if they do , there are still a lot of human judgments — see Dewan ’s “ slow ” line drives — in between what happens on the field and what comes out in the numbers .
The “ zones ” concept is more advanced than any kind of fielding evaluation that had been done before , but it ’s still a relatively crude way to describe what happens on a two - acre baseball field to balls hit with infinitely varying levels of speed and spin and trajectory .
To that end , analysts and observers are eagerly awaiting the data from MLB Advanced Media ’s Hitf / x system , which tracks the actual trajectory of the ball when it comes off the bat , in a similar way that its Pitchf / x , introduced a few years ago as part of its MLB Gameday online function , tracks the curve , break , and velocity of pitches .
The two systems require special cameras installed at every ballpark , and Hitf / x is not online yet .
“ Once that information is out there , ” Davenport says , “ there will be a rush to get the best analysis , with lots of claims and counterclaims that will ultimately be sorted out .
How people extract the data will be an ongoing thing , but we know it will bring us closer to making defense as objectively quantifiable as offense .
Someday , the notion of watching these plays on video may seem archaic . ”
Fielding geeks will no longer have to manually figure out how many balls were hit on vector 187 and make a judgment about the left - fielder ’s play ; they ’ll be able to query a database of balls hit at a 30 - degree angle to the third - base line , with between 40 and 42 degrees trajectory upward and 90 and 100 miles per hour speed off the bat , and see exactly how many were turned into outs by which players .
By the time that happens , other teams will have caught up with the Yanks ’ and Sox ’ analysis — Dewan estimates that only ten or fewer teams do serious research into advanced defensive metrics — and Ultimate Zone Rating and Runs Saved will go the same way OBP and OPS went , to the mainstream , where everyone knows and accepts them .
And then there will inevitably be something else to study : Dave Cameron of FanGraphs suggests that older players like Damon and Jim Edmonds are undervalued ( advancements in kinesiology and physical therapy have changed the way players age in ways that have n’t been quantified yet ) , and some think that speed and base - stealing have gone too far out of style ( the last decade of mammoth home - run totals made one extra base seem almost piddly ; with home - run totals dropping — perhaps because of steroid testing — baserunning becomes relatively more important again ) .
“ As much as it might seem , sabermetrics is not rocket science , ” Lichtman says .
“ In the world of science and applied math , it is frighteningly simple , comparatively .
Defensive metrics are a little more complicated , but not much more .
They ’ll get it figured out , and they ’ll move on to the next thing . ”

3.5 g oral Mushrooms ( dried )
BODY WEIGHT : 125 lb
I always assumed that those legendary bad trips 
I heard about in anti-drug literature , and from my parents , didnt actually happen .
Well , they do happen , and the cause of mine was a combination of a familiar dose , with an unfamiliar batch , filtered through some philosophical misconceptions I had .
However , I will hold the experience as one of the most important , defining moments in my life .
It was the moment I came closest to both complete ego - death , as well as actual , physical death , and I offer my experience to anyone who is interested in psychedelics , to be warned and prepared for the type of tests you must sometimes face if you ever accidentally hit that ceiling of consciousness .
It was early July , and me and my true love , who will henceforth be referred to as V. , were going to again take a trip to that dazzling psychedelic mushroom - land in celebration of her birthday .
We had tripped several times before together , and we have a very loving fulfilling , relationship .
So I was expecting the best , and I was in a very happy , excited mood .
But first , some information about my drug history .
Ive taken probably more than 75 total DXM trips , which has created a continuum of mental activity , leading eventually into an unpleasant , cramped mental box .
DXM was my first outlet to different realms of consciousness , but it is a very small path , one without any real spiritual knowledge .
For me , DXM caused acne , depression , high blood pressure , and different pupil sizes for days after trips .
I had used Salvia probably 20 times , and never had a bad trip .
Once , a party was held by some mischievous entity , who informed me that I was  The most fucked up anyone has ever been , and so I got to see the truth .
Banners advertising  Reality Is An Illusion !  flew , streamers , confetti .
My friends got up and celebrated with kazoos .
Since this experience , I feel like any further experimentation with Salvia would be interpreted as insolence by that mysterious consciousness which inhabits the soul of the plant .
Ive done mushrooms and acid probably a combined 20 times , ( I lose track of which experiences belong to which drug , they are very similar to me ) and once even induced a bad trip by listening to Wolf Eyes , ( a horror - noise band ) as a test , and out of curiosity .
Every time Ive done mushrooms I have taken the same dose , ( 3.5 grams ) as I did this time , and it goes to show you that you should always take a preliminary dose with a new batch to ensure that you are prepared .
Indeed , the mushrooms we had were supposed to be very strong ; their stems were marked with purple and blue spirals , which I assume indicates a high presence of hallucinogenic potency .
A friend of ours , having taken the same dosage , had become lost in a Columbus park , mistaking his environment for Egypt .
I figured that it wouldnt be an issue for someone with the aforementioned Salvia experience under my belt , so I took the full 3.5 grams in one sitting , slathering them in peanut butter . ( + 0:30 ) Me and V. went outside , to the lot behind my apartment .
Both of us are artists connected to our inner child , so we were planning to go draw with sidewalk chalk .
I had taken a book on Michelangelo , and I was hoping to reproduce one of his drawings in chalk .
When we actually got out there however , I got lost in a haze of artistic anxiety and indecision .
I simply could not settle on anything .
Every line was hesitant , my spatial distortions were completely off and I had almost forgotten that it could be due to coming up on mushrooms , since I was not actually getting any other changes in perception .
I would second guess myself , and then judge each single line like a monument to some huge personal failure .
We were listening to The Fiery Furnaces , which made my mind jump around frantically .
There was a lyric which haunted me :  I thought I was thinking , but apparently not . 
I kept lingering on that line .
How can such a contradiction exist ?
It felt like I had forgotten how to think .
I told V. that we should go in , and she agreed .
She was not getting good work done due to similar mental circumstances .
Inside , I started to realize that I was might face something really big , and I wanted to have a full stomach so that the mushrooms alone werent the only thing in my stomach .
I prepared a sandwich , took one bite , and couldnt take another .
I wanted to drink something , but all the cups were dirty .
We decided to try to watch a movie , and within 10 seconds I realized I would be unable to follow it .
I put on a blanket because I was cold , then I realized I was hot .
All of this was adding up to a state of nervous contradiction and negation .
I started to become just really irritated , and borderline angry .
I decided I should just try to sleep , so I threw off my clothes , and took out my contacts which were itching badly .
I tried to induce vomiting because I felt sick , but couldnt .
I told V. to find and put on Godspeed You !
Black Emperor , but she was unable to find the CD .
( Later on I realized this might have been a subconscious desire to have an appropriate soundtrack for the end of the world )
At this point , my thoughts were racing :  Want To Draw , But feel blocked .
Want to eat , but not hungry .
Want to drink , but no clean cups .
Want to watch a movie , but cant follow it .
Feel like vomiting , but cant .
Want to listen to Godspeed , but cant find it .
Got ready for sleep , but cant because I m losing my fucking mind . 
I am in bed with my face into the pillow , pulling my hair .
V. Comes in and lies next to me .
Me :  This is awful .
V : I know .
Me : I need to forget all of this .  ( I start to cry ) V :  We poisoned ourselves , we just need to sleep , and when we wake up , itll be like nothing ever happened .
She goes to clean a cup , so I can have a drink of water .
With my eyes closed , I see what I can only describe as a slot machine , infinitely long and tall , that adjusts in perspective according to my heads actual position .
On the face of each is a picture of myself in a different emotion or physical state .
Whichever picture is located in the center of my range of vision is the emotion I feel fully , but the slot machine is cycling at such an alarming rate that I am feeling what I estimate to be 10 emotions every second .
My facial muscles work to accommodate each emotion , and I essentially lose control of my face .
I feel extreme pain , followed by extreme euphoria for a millisecond each .
I feel , essentially , everything at once .
Finally , the slot machine rests on a single face : Madness .
It is a picture of myself in green , clawing at my eyes .
I realize what is going to happen :
When the machine adds the sum total of all Ive been , I will be defined , and I will die .
Some scientists speculate that since the universe exploded from an infinitely powerful singularity , the gravitational field may one day become too weak to sustain this expansion , and the universe will start to gravitate inwards , and collide into another singularity , possibly to restart the entire process anew .
I see every human consciousness as analogous to the big bang .
Throughout our experience as humans , we become more and more complex and organized from our embryonic states , to the point that we grow up and start integrating concepts into patterns of thought , behavior , emotion , just as the universe organized into clusters of planets and stars , comets , black holes , etc. , As I am running from the bedroom to the living room to find V. , all the concepts and truths I accept , regarding nature , matter , humanity , sociology , biology , philosophy , art , start to rapidly compute into analogies , which physically connect to one another .
Everything subjective , everything regarding the self ( my emotions , dreams , etc. , ) become the earth , and all my perceptions regarding the external world are the stars .
And the entire universe is folding in on itself , and I am simply not ready for whatever happens after it .
I feel like I will have completed life , solved the puzzle .
It was as if I have seen every part , or almost every part , through my observations , and how they fit together , so I was worthy to view the gestalt , the whole form , one singularity .
And I thought :  No one would be allowed back from seeing that , because you must be outside of that form in order to view it .
I thought of what V. said ,  It would be like nothing ever happened . 
I thought I would die , for sure , but I also thought I might be reincarnated , ( maybe due to her statement  when you wake up ) or simply exhiled somewhere away from this world that I know and love .
I didnt think a living person is allowed to see whats on the other side of the end of the universe .
Near this time in my life , I was extremely immersed in Ayn Rands novels , and objectivism as a practical philosophy .
For those that dont know , her philosophy revolves around the love of the ego , and the virtue of selfishness , ( or at least rational self interest ) .
Being an artist , the Fountainhead greatly influenced my drive to work hard at learning my craft , rather than just sit around and wait for inspiration .
However , worshiping my ego , and reveling in the separation between me and my environment will not allow me to sit complacently as it dissolves .
I mistook my ego for my actual life , which I believe was not actually at risk .
I tell her :  I am going to die .
Call 911 , right now . 
She refuses on the grounds that I am just having a bad trip , so I run to my neighbors apartment right across the hall .
I am frantically trying to get them to call , but they demand to know the situation , and I dont think I can even take the time to explain without dying first .
I feel like I am being tested .
If I am able to go out , into the world , in my underwear , at the risk of public humiliation , legal trouble , hospital bills , potentially losing my job , ( I worked in a movie theater , located in the outdoor mall area right next to my apartment complex ) , having my parents and the world see me for what I was , exposed and scared and on drugs , then I would have earned my right to live .
As I attempt to run out of the building , V. and a neighbor attempt to stop me .
The neighbor is about twice my size , and both of them are grabbing me as hard as they can .
I am pulling on the door frame with all my might .
I feel their hands as a thousand corpses hands , trying to hold me into my coffin .
Gradually they let go , and I fly head first off the concrete steps , flat on my face , fracturing my nasal bone , bloodying my face .
I dont even register the pain , it feels like I just fell through a huge number of patterned - walls .
I take off running as fast as Ive ever run .
I dont have contacts or glasses on , and since I am legally blind without correction , I can barely discern forms from blurry blocks of color .
The sun is setting , and I run towards the exit of the apartment complex .
I get a car to stop , and tell the driver , as calmly as I can under the circumstances , that I have poisoned myself with mushrooms and need help .
He says  Nah man I got kids in here . 
I look and do not see kids .
I assume that he was basically the universes analogy for this cokehead idiot I know , who inexplicably always wanted to hang out , even though I made it consistently clear how little I respected him .
I always made these half - assed , transparent excuses not to hang out , and now there was some universal equity .
Next , I turn towards my place of employment .
I get to the back of the building , and successfully stop a car , with a man driving and a woman in the passengers seat .
I try to the best of my ability to explain to them that I am going to die , and I jump into the back of their car and demand that they take me to the hospital .
The guy gets out , comes to me , and starts hitting my legs and trying to pull me out of the car .
He is yelling : ' Get the fuck out ! '
I associate the door he is trying to drag me out of with death , and so the opposite door , the passengers side , must be my chance at life .
I scramble across the seats , onto the womans lap , and then out her door .
I run as fast as I can into the parking lot .
My brain is in a whirl , and I figure out that the Security Guard for the theater , who shall be referred to as X. , can help me .
Ive known him for several years and I figure he would understand I was on drugs and needed help , and I trusted him .
At this point he represented the concepts of security and life , a trusted friend and rational problem solver .
Once an hour , he will take a walk around the building on patrol , so I start to scream for X. , but he is not outside .
I get to the intersection that is formed by the street the movie theater is at , and another perpendicular street .
For some reason , probably a sense of embarrassment , I decide to take the perpendicular street .
I love my job , and I was glad to be able to keep it after this incident , but if I had simply obeyed the rules of the game , clearly internally defined at the outset , I wouldnt have faced the trouble I am about to explain to you .
As soon as I reach the other side , I am standing outside an ice cream store .
There are probably close to 20 people eating outside , and loitering around .
I cannot see , so everybody there appears as faceless , non-specific people .
I ask them all to help , and everyone keeps turning away from me .
Looking back and realizing how scared people must have been , I understand , but still wish someone had acknowledged me .
In this entire experience , all that it would have taken was one single person assuring me :  Calm down , I m going to call 911 right now .
So to try and get some attention for my cause , I attempt to run full speed into the glass door , with my head , to shatter it .
I had passed up my work , and without any real direction now , I was confused and grasping for straws .
I smash into the glass , fall backwards , hear a screamApparently I blacked out , got up , and ran another 2 blocks , because that s where my next memory starts .
Im staring diagonally into the intersection in front of the shopping center .
On one side is a security guard employed by the shopping center , and on the other , a police officer .
I think to myself that I can turn myself over to the security guard , but since its not X. , I dont want to settle .
And I could turn myself over to the cops , but I have a problem with authority , and he may take me straight to jail instead of the hospital .
So , I decide to take my chances by running between them , into the intersection I dont know what I was thinking at this point , because I seemed to forget my original intention of getting help , and almost be putting myself into the way of death .
I think perhaps this experience was a call - back to another mushrooms trip I had , where me and V. took a walk in the city at sunset , and life unfolded as a perfectly - created game , where everything we saw was conceptualized and represented conceptual trends , rather than just isolated events .
We almost followed a group of people into a crosswalk on a  Dont Walk sign .
The first people in the group almost got hit , and returned back to the side they came from .
I look at V. , and say  That represents group - think , and group - mistake .
I saw the intersection as a microcosm for life , and I think this time I was submitting myself to the mercy of life , to chance .
Or maybe it was just because the whole event felt like the last 5 minutes of a movie , and I needed a climax worthy of what preceded it .
Or maybe I was just confused and crazy , with a serious head injury .
Most likely , it was a combination of all 3 .
The cop grabs my arm , and I yank it away from him .
As I approach the geometrical center of the intersection , a millisecond - timer hits 0:00:00 , and then it starts into a positive counter .
That number , later , I think represented what could have been a timer for the end of my life , and when I got there , there was a coin - flip to see if I lived or died .
I get to the other side of the intersection and I feel my muscles lock up , and see everything fading to black
When I come to , I am in an ambulance .
I am told that I was tazed by the cop as soon as I got to the other side of the intersection .
At the hospital , I am diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage , a fractured nasal bone , a bruised rib , and tons of lacerations all over my feet and body .
For 2 days I am in the ICU , and spend another 4 altogether .
They were extremely close to having to drill into my head to relieve the pressure , but thankfully they never did , and I survive without any enduring injuries .
My stepdads military insurance thankfully covers the medical bills , so I have no expenses besides the court costs .
I get $ 700 in fees , 2 years probation , and 5 years where any alcohol or drug charges will cost me 7 months in jail .
And as I leave the courtroom I feel such an immense happiness and love for all things .
I am extremely fortunate for the way everything turned out .
I feel like Dostoevsky , facing the firing squad , only to be pardoned at the very last second .
This event gave him inspiration , ( most of his books reflect this theme of near - death experience ) , and it also gave him the drive to finish some of his greatest novels , being completely aware of the fact that he would one day die .
This event has effected me in very much the same way .
This will be one of the most defining moments in my life , and one I will revisit often in art .
During the first month or so after this experience , I had very little recollection of what it was that had caused this madness , and I was sure that I would never , ever take psychedelics again .
My mind blocked out a number of details that slowly , little by little , came back to me .
It seemed like everything that had happened in the peak of the trip was too much for my brain to comprehend , and so it buried them under waves of mental noise .
When , almost 3 months after the experience , I had decoded the last of the information , I started to realize that the trip is concurrent with a lot of Buddhist ideals , and with the concept of ego - death in general .
It was not , as I first assumed , that I had seen something as meaningless as a giant refrigerator monster chasing me down , trying to eat me .
I had viewed the truth at the end of all things : Everything is one .
As Phil Elverum sings :  The world is in me , and I am in the world . 
Altogether , it was not the trip that was bad , it was my attitude towards it , it was the worship of ego I had adopted .
I consider it a failing of myself , and not of psilocybin , which truly caused this experience .
I have been researching Terence Mckenna recently , and although I m too much of a rationalist to agree with all things hes said , it would appear based on my experience , that psilocybin lets me contact something which is pure information .
I like to call this thing the Logos , ( My definition lies somewhere between McKennas and Aristotles ) .
It is the entire logic and balance of the universe , the thing which binds matter together , and also the process of organization into hierarchies .
The Logos , at least , has complete knowledge of the individual which is communicating with it , perhaps of the entire history of genetic information , and even moreso , perhaps even over the entire history of the universe and beyond .
In the future , we will master these realms , to apply engineering and science to these inner worlds , which are truly the most mysterious thing we are capable of currently exploring , ( probably more so than the local areas of space which we can explore while still dependant on combustible fuel ) .
Will I ever do psychedelics again ?
Yes , and I do not answer this question lightly .
I genuinely feel , as someone receptive to these experiences , ( I usually trip roughly twice as hard as everyone I know under equivalent doses ) , and as someone with a rational , adventurous mind , I have almost an obligation to the future of mankind to report , through my art , those truths behind this world that we know .
I am taking a 5 - year break , ( enough to wear off that suspended jail - sentence ) , but after that , I eagerly await the worlds to find on the other side of ego - death .
A volcano under a glacier in Iceland erupted Wednesday , melting ice , shooting smoke and steam into the air and forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes .
The resulting ash plume has also halted air traffic over much of Europe .
Scientists said the eruption under the ice cap was 10 to 20 times more powerful than an eruption from the that happened from the Eyjafjallajokullin Volcano late last month .
“ This is a very much more violent eruption because it ’s interacting with ice and water , ” said Andy Russell , an expert in glacial flooding at the University of Newcastle in northern England , in an article on the CBC website .
The dramatic footage in the video here was released today , April 15 , and satellite images , below , show how far the ash plume has traveled .
[ / caption ]
The iceland volcano sent a plume of ash and steam across the North Atlantic prompting airspace closures in the United Kingdom , Ireland , France , and Scandinavia , which then had a ripple effect , disrupting flights to and from other countries as well .
Authorities could not say how long the airspace closure would last , and the ash ’s spread threatened to force closures of additional airspace over the coming days .
This natural - color satellite image shows the area of the eruption on April 1 , when a new vent opened up .
The image was acquired by the Advanced Land Imager ( ALI ) aboard NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 ( EO - 1 ) satellite .
The volcano , about 120 kilometres east of Reykjavik , erupted March 20 after almost 200 years of silence .
Watch an animation from ESA of how the plume traveled .
Pall Einarsson , a geophysicist at the University of Iceland , said magma was melting a hole in the thick ice covering the volcano ’s crater , sending water coursing down the glacier , and causing widespread flooding .
Iceland ’s main coastal ring road was closed near the volcano , and workers smashed a hole in the highway in a bid to give the rushing water a clear route to the coast and prevent a major bridge from being swept away .

The unusual step follows a double suicide bombing on the Moscow metro last month that left forty people dead .
The attack renewed fears of a fresh terror campaign in Russia 's big cities and triggered a massive security crackdown .
Interest in " black widow " suicide bombers has been intense ever since it was confirmed that the two women who struck the Moscow metro were indeed the the wives of deceased Islamist terrorists .
Both came from the southern largely Muslim Russian republic of Dagestan in the North Caucasus .

When I struggled with money during the 1990s , I had no clue what I was spending each month .
I made my financial decisions based on my checkbook balance :
If there were a few bucks left , I 'd find ways to spend the money ; if my balance was close to zero ( as in $ 10 or $ 20 ) , I 'd turn to my credit cards .
Where did this money go ?
If you 'd have asked me , I would n't have known .
As part of my financial turnaround , I learned to track my spending .
In fact , this was one of the most effective tools in getting me to change my spending habits .
Every week , I 'd sit down at the computer to enter my receipts into Quicken .
Once or twice a month , I 'd play with the graphs and reports , keeping an eye on the problem spots .
By tracking every penny that I earned and spent , I became more aware of my habits .
But something 's happened lately .
Last summer , I noticed that my discipline seemed to be lacking .
Instead of logging my spending every week , I 'd often go two or > gasp ! < three weeks without using Quicken .
At first , this made me fret .
“ Something 's wrong with me , ” I 'd think .
“ If I do n't track my spending , I 'll lose control . ”
You know what ?
I did n't lose control .
Even if I went an entire month without entering my info into Quicken , my spending stayed in check .
Last fall , as I was writing my book , things got even worse .
Sometimes I 'd go six weeks without remembering to enter data .
And then 2010 rolled around .
Here 's a shocker :
Since doing my year - end numbers in early January , I have n't logged my spending once .
And just last week , I stopped saving every little receipt .
( It 's been years since I tossed out a grocery receipt before coming home . )
Some of you may be alarmed by this .
A few years ago , I would have been concerned , too .
But I 've actually found that my scofflaw attitude is liberating .
Over the past few months , I 've seen that I 'm perfectly capable of practicing conscious spending without logging every penny I spend .
Although I no longer track my spending in detail , that does n't mean I 'm ignoring my finances entirely .
Hardly !
I still check my statements every month to be sure there 's nothing goofy .
Plus , I double - check to be sure my account balances are continuing to grow .
In a way , it 's as if I 've removed the training wheels and am now zipping around the driveway on only two wheels .
This reminds me a little of my return to credit cards .
In 1998 , I destroyed my credit cards because I could n't use them responsibly .
For nearly ten years , I lived without a personal credit card .
I was afraid to trust myself .
But about three years ago , I decided to take a chance .
I set some ground rules and signed up for a single card .
Since then , I 've not only used credit responsibly , but have actually learned that it can make life more convenient .
So maybe leaving Quicken is the next step .
Maybe part of the third stage of personal finance is recognizing that my financial discipline has become ingrained , that I no longer need certain redundant systems because the internal systems are working just fine .
Or maybe I 'm fooling myself .
I 'd love to hear from other GRS readers .
How many of you track your spending ?
What 's your financial situation like ?
Have you found that you 've “ outgrown ” Quicken and Mint and similar tracking programs ?
Also , I 'm dying to know :
As my mental relationship with money matures , will I find that I 've outgrown the need for other techniques that helped me get out of debt ?
Sidenote :
My wife has never kept detailed records .
When I told her about this post , I asked why she 's never kept a detailed spending log , but just made broad notes in her checkbook register .
She gave me a look : “ I do n't need to track my money , ” she told me .
“ I never spend more than I have . ”
( Plus , she pointed out that she “ pays herself first ” by saving nearly 30 % of her paycheck for retirement before the money reaches her checkbook . )
From Bulbapedia , the community - driven Pokémon encyclopedia .
Boxed Pokémon in the games Diamond and Pearl are stored in a 136 - byte structure .
All unencrypted values are stored in little - endian format .
The game encrypts the data when it is stored into save data .
In - party Pokémon have additional values appended to them to hold calculated stats .
The information below describes the boxed Pokémon data format .
Checksum
The checksum serves two purposes :
It validates the data after decryption , and It serves as the encryption key for the data .
The checksum is calculated in three steps :
Split the unencrypted data from offsets 0x08 to 0x87 into two - byte words ,
Take the sum of the words , and Truncate the sum to sixteen bits .
Block shuffling
The 128 bytes of Pokémon data are split into four 32 - byte blocks for shuffling .
The blocks are shuffled according to a shift value derived from the personality value .
Given the personality value pv , the expression yielding the shift value is :
( ( pv & 0x3E000 ) >>
0xD ) % 24
The right shifting ( >> 0xD ) is equivalent to a division of 8192 .
To shuffle the blocks , take the four blocks of unencrypted data , A , B , C , and D .
The blocks shall be rearranged in the encrypted data according to the Block Order column of the following table .
( To unshuffle , use the Inverse column . )
Shift Value ( decimal ) Block Order Inverse 00 ABCD ABCD 01 ABDC ABDC 02 ACBD ACBD 03 ACDB ADBC 04 ADBC ACDB 05 ADCB ADCB 06 BACD BACD 07 BADC BADC 08 BCAD CABD 09 BCDA DABC 10 BDAC CADB 11 BDCA DACB 12 CABD BCAD 13 CADB BDAC 14 CBAD CBAD 15 CBDA DBAC 16 CDAB CDAB 17 CDBA DCAB 18 DABC BCDA 19 DACB BDCA 20 DBAC CBDA 21 DBCA DBCA 22 DCAB CDBA 23 DCBA DCBA
Encryption
The encryption uses the pseudorandom number generator ( PRNG ) , a linear congruential generator .
Elements of the PRNG can be described with the recursive function :
X [ n+1 ] = ( 0x41C64E6D * X [ n ] + 0x6073 )
To decrypt the data , given a function rand ( ) which returns the upper 16 bits of consecutive results of the above given function :
Seed the PRNG with the checksum ( let X [ n ] be the checksum ) .
Sequentially , for each 2 - byte word Y from 0x08 to 0x87 , apply the transformation : unencrypted Byte = Y xor rand ( )
Unshuffle the blocks using the block shuffling algorithm above .
To encrypt the data :
Shuffle the blocks using the block shuffling algorithm above .
Seed the PRNG with the checksum ( let X [ n ] be the checksum ) , Sequentially , for each 2 - byte word Y from 0x08 to 0x87 , apply the transformation : unencrypted Byte = Y xor rand ( )

Oklahoma Abortion Law : No Exceptions , Even Rape Women seeking abortion will be forced to see fetal image , get unwanted speech .
April 29 , 2010  --
From the time she was 15 and repeatedly over the course of two years , Joelle Casteix -- a vulnerable teen with an alcoholic mother -- was sexually abused by her California high school music teacher .
At 17 , when Casteix discovered she was pregnant with her assailant 's child , she sought an abortion , one that she says was emotionally painful , but she does n't regret .
" For the first time in my life , I did something to take care of myself , " she said .
" I needed to ensure my safety and make sure he would n't hurt me .
For me it was an act of survival . "
At the abortion clinic , Casteix was given comfort and counseling then underwent a standard sonogram to determine the gestational age of the fetus .
Sheturned her eyes away from the screen .
But under a new law in Oklahoma , women like Casteix , who have been sexually assaulted , will be forced to undergo a second trauma .
The law requires them to undergo a sonogram , and depending on the state of pregnancy , it could be a transvaginal one , which involves insertion of a wand .
The doctor must then turn the screen towards her and describe fetal dimensions and details like the number of fingers and toes and heart activity .
There are no exemptions for victims of rape and incest .
" The law takes no account of the trauma of the victim , " said Casteix .
" I just can't imagine what that would have done to me .
It upsets me just thinking about being in that position .
If you are the victim of a violent crime , it 's absolutely devastating . "
The Oklahoma law was enacted immediately on Tuesday after both the state 's Republican - controlled House and Senate voted to override Democrat Gov. Brad Henry 's veto of two anti-abortion bills .
Already , one of the three abortion clinics in Oklahoma is reporting that women are so upset about the sonogram procedure , they are leaving the clinic crying .
" Not one patient would look at the screen and they all closed their eyes or turned their heads , " said Linda Meek , director at Reproductive Services in Tulsa , which does 3,000 abortions a year .
" But it 's hard to turn your ears off , " she said .
" Several of the patients were in tears afterwards .
No one changed their mind . "
The New York - based Center for Reproductive Rights has filed a legal challenge to the controversial law , arguing it violates both the patient 's and doctor 's freedom of speech and intrudes upon a patient 's privacy in her relationship with her doctor .
Oklahoma Abortion Law ' Manipulates ' Women
The Oklahoma legislature approved a second law that prohibits women from seeking damages if a physician withholds information or provides inaccurate information about a pregnancy .
" This is really a measure aimed at manipulating women , " said Stephanie Toti , staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights , said of the two laws .
" On the one hand , abortion providers are required to make women go through an unnecessary procedure and have an image thrust in their line of sight . "
" At the same time , doctors are authorized to withhold information from women and to control the flow of that information to pregnant women , " she said .
" It 's not about women making an informed decision , it 's about trying to coerce a woman to make the decision the state wants to make . "
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Nova Health Systems , which operates the Tulsa clinic and Dr. Larry Burns , who provides abortions in Norman .
It seeks a temporary restraining order to immediately block enforcement of the statute and an expedited hearing on the group 's request for an injunction .
Casteix , who is now 39 and married with a three - year - old , said the Oklahoma law would have " pushed me over the edge . "
" I was fragile enough at the time as a victim of sex abuse , " she said .
" I had horrible guilt and thought it was my fault .
I wanted to die . "
The law is among the nation 's strictest measures against abortion and one of 14 other states that have sonogram requirements , according to the Guttmacher Institute .
None are as restrictive as Oklahoma's , according to the Center for Reproductive Rights .
Some states require the procedure but do not force the patient to look at the image or hear a speech .
Just this spring an Oklahoma County court overturned another anti-abortion bill that would have created a Web site that gathered personal information on women seeking an abortion .
It was struck down on grounds that it violated the state constitution .
Lawmakers Want Abortion Curtailed
State Sen. Todd Lamb , a Republican who supported the new laws , said fellow lawmakers hoped it would curtail abortions in the state .
" Republicans have championed the sanctity of life for decades , and today we once again saw our efforts come to fruition with bipartisan support behind these critical measures , " he said in a prepared statement .
" As a former Secret Service agent , I had a calling to protect people and their rights , " he said .
" Our pro-life legislation protects not only the unborn child , but the mother as well , allowing her to have informed consent prior to an abortion . "
The bill 's sponsor , Republican Rep. Lisa Johnson - Billy , said women already undergo ultrasounds when seeking an abortion .
Under the new law , women would not be forced to look at the screen , she said .
" The abortion provider needs to see the position of the baby and make sure she 's pregnant and see the gestational age of the infant , " said Johnson - Billy .
" Unfortunately in Oklahoma , we have encountered a lot of women who , by the time the ultrasound is provided , they were already asleep and did n't know , " she said .
" The real purpose is to give patients all the information that is relevant before they make a life - altering decision . "
Johnson - Billy said the information is " empowering " for women .
" We are all sympathetic with victims of rape , " she said , but research shows " those seeking abortions is extremely low . "
The Oklahoma Medical Association ( OMA ) did not support the bill .
" Generally we do n't take a position on abortion , " said OMA spokesman Wes Glensman .
" We are opposed to any override of medical judgment of treating physicians . "
But abortion clinic director Meek said the law was " outrageous , " particularly for traumatized rape and incest survivors .
" It 's very painful for them , " she said .
" They are already a victim ... Forcing women against their will causes more pain and distress . "
Under Oklahoma law , they must be read a typewritten script over the phone 24 hours prior to the procedure , one that describes complications and risks and the gestational age .
The new law is " repetitive , " she said .
" The women who walk through our doors here have thought long and hard and have considered all their options , " said Meek .
" They have thought it through .
It 's not an easy decision and they do n't make it on the spur of the moment . "
' People think we drag someone off the street and bring them in to have an abortion , " she said .
" That 's not the way it is .
When a patient is unsure , we wo n't do it and we encourage them to go home and think it over . "
As for Joelle Casteix , she came to terms with both her molestation and her abortion after counseling and winning a $ 1.6 million lawsuit against the Catholic diocese .
She now volunteers for the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests ( SNAP ) .
Her abuser , who was not a priest , but a lay person , still teaches music at a college in Michigan .
" It took me until my late 20s and 30s until I was able to understand it was not my fault , " she said .
" I had to save myself and it was my right under the law .
I have guilt , but I do n't have regret . "
Step one : Look for the words ’ social justice ’ or ‘ economic justice ’ on your church Web site .
This is easily enough accomplished with the handy search function at LDS.org .
Among the results is this 1986 Ensign article by Elder James E. Faust of the Quorum of the Twelve .
It very clearly contains the words economic justice — and they are described in a good way , by an apostle — and it is indeed on the church ’s website :
It is unfortunate that it is taking so long to bring full economic justice to women .
The feminization of poverty is both real and tragic .
That is why you should work very hard to prepare for your future by gaining some marketable skills .
Step two , of course , is If you find it , run as fast as you can .
The end result is very clear :
Any LDS church members who decide to follow Glenn Beck ’s ( very clear ) instructions on this topic , will leave the church .

Senior Catholics across Europe today apologised for the way the church had dealt with paedophile priests and acknowledged the damage the scandal had caused to its moral authority .
In Easter sermons that revealed penitence , shame and shortcomings , archbishops in Armagh , Dublin , Edinburgh , Vienna and Westminster asked congregations for their forgiveness and urged them not to abandon the church because of past sins .
But there was no apology from Rome , as Benedict XVI maintained a steadfast silence about the crisis in his annual Urbi et Orbi – To the City and the World – address .
The only mention of the turmoil came from Cardinal Angelo Sodano , the dean of the College of Cardinals , who stood before the pope in a packed St Peter 's Square and lauded him as the " unfailing rock " of the Catholic church .
In a departure from protocol , he told the pontiff in a special tribute : " We are deeply grateful for your strength of spirit and the apostolic courage with which you proclaim Christ 's gospel . "
In an apparent reference to the crisis , and employing a term already used by the pope , Sodano said the church would not be intimidated by " idle chatter " .
His appearance was a gesture of defiance and indignation in the face of continued criticism aimed at the Vatican over its response to waves of allegations .
The Catholic hierarchy has insisted that the pope is beyond reproach and that the media are conducting a smear campaign against him by exaggerating the scale of the abuse and attempts to conceal it .
However , today saw an unprecedented outpouring of apologies by leading church members across Europe .
Cardinal Sean Brady , the primate of Ireland , admitted that the church failed to involve civil authorities to protect its reputation .
Brady , who is under pressure to resign because of his role in making two sex abuse victims sign an oath of silence , said : " I realise that , however unintentionally , however unknowingly , I too allowed myself to be influenced by that culture in our church , and our society .
" I pledge to you that , from now on , my overriding concern will always be the safety and protection of everyone in the church – but especially children and all those who are vulnerable . "
In his Easter homily the archbishop of Westminster , the Most Rev Vincent Nicholls , told the faithful that the " serious sins " committed within the Catholic community had been much talked about .
He added : " For our part , we have been reflecting on them deeply , acknowledging our guilt and our need for forgiveness . "
In Austria , Cardinal Christoph Schönborn apologised for the abuse at an emotional pre-Easter mass .
" For some of us , the Church 's immaculate appearance was more important than anything else , " Schönborn said .
" We confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as the church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly . "
Their penitence came hours after a contrite archbishop of Canterbury rang the archbishop of Dublin , Diarmuid Martin , to try to defuse widespread anger and disbelief after he said the church in Ireland had lost " all credibility " .
Rowan Williams made the comments in a BBC interview , explaining that an Irish friend had said it was " quite difficult in some parts of Ireland " to walk down the street wearing a dog collar .
Williams remarked that an institution " so deeply bound into the life of a society , suddenly becoming , suddenly losing all credibility – that 's not just a problem for the Church , it is a problem for everybody in Ireland . "
The backlash was almost immediate , with churchmen from Catholic and Protestant traditions condemning Williams as being thoughtless and unhelpful during one of the darkest periods for Irish Catholicism .
Caught aback by the level of outrage , Williams rang Martin , who later told churchgoers he appreciated the archbishop 's " sadness " regarding " some unfortunate words " .
Williams also upset members of the Church of England by playing down the significance of a papal initiative to tempt Anglicans to convert to Roman Catholicism .
He made no mention of his Catholic gaffe during his Easter sermon at Canterbury Cathedral .
The Pope has still to make any direct comment on the of scandals in continental Europe .
Last month he issued a letter to Irish Catholics , who are reeling from years of revelations over child sex abuse and cover-ups .
Papal aides said the letter , in which Benedict said he was " truly sorry " for the suffering of victims , should be read as applying to other countries .
The latest is Malta , which the pope is to visit this month .
It was reported last week that 45 priests stood accused of sexual offences since the creation of a church response team in 1999 .
None of the cases has been referred to the police and the retired judge who heads the project said that was the responsibility of victims and parents .
Millions of people are taking medication for problems
In the US , an increasing number of parents are turning to psychoactive medication to help them cope with the challenging behaviour of their children .
So is this an understandable path to take , or a worrying shortcut , asks Louis Theroux .
On a kitchen countertop in their suburban Pittsburgh home the Kelley family keep a small collection of pill bottles .
They jokingly refer to is as " Hugh 's personal pharmacy " .
FIND OUT MORE Louis Theroux : America 's Medicated Kids is on BBC Two on Sunday , 18 April , at 2100 BST Learn more at BBC Programmes Hugh , aged 10 , appears basically normal - a dark - haired kid who goes to a mainstream school and speaks and interacts well , albeit sometimes in a slightly aloof and off - hand way .
Yet he has been diagnosed with a range of mental disorders and put on a battery of medications .
' It 's very troubling '
He takes Adderall for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
Tenex for impulsiveness .
And for his bipolar disorder he is on a heavy dose of a powerful anti-psychotic called Seroquel - in an " off- label " prescription , meaning it has n't been tested on children .
" It 's very troubling , " Hugh 's mother Barbro told me when I asked about his reliance on the medication .
" The problem with it is , if you continue not to medicate with something for bipolar disorder in a child , the highs and the lows , the cycles get worse and worse . "
I was there for a documentary about the growing number of children who depend on psychoactive drugs to regulate their behaviour , basing myself at one of America 's top hospitals for children 's psychiatric issues , Pittsburgh 's Western Psychiatric Institute .
Barbro and her husband Bob had been kind enough to put me up for part of my stay , as a way of getting to know a family with a medicated child and experiencing some of his behaviour .
The entire Kelley family - even the dog - were on psychoactive medication , except for the young daughter , Maeve The family , judged by British standards , seemed surprisingly open to the concept of psychoactive medication .
Hugh 's mother was on an anti-depressant , Prozac .
Bob took something called Neurontin for a bipolar condition he says he " may or may not have " .
Even the dog was being fed Clomipramine , an anti-anxiety pill .
But Barbro said they had resisted medicating Hugh .
She said they came to the decision to put Hugh on drugs reluctantly and with reservations , and only because the alternative - allowing his emotions and behaviour to continue untreated - was too awful to contemplate .
Hugh 's younger sister , Maeve , was on no medication at all .
In many ways , the Kelleys embody one of the biggest and most controversial debates embroiling America right now - the question of children and whether they are being overmedicated .
Children who a few decades ago would have been written off as naughty , troubled , or delinquent are now being diagnosed instead : " ODD " for oppositional defiant disorder , " CD " for conduct disorder , " SAD " for social anxiety disorder , " GAD " for general anxiety disorder , and so on .
Rampant overmedication Critics of the phenomenon see it as rampant overmedication .
Some call it " cosmetic psychopharmacology " or " steroids for the soul " .
They say kids are being medicated in lieu of proper parenting - or that the diagnoses are being sought by " pushy parents " looking to give their kids a competitive edge - since some of the drugs have " performance enhancing " qualities .
The Kelleys view their " personal pharmacy " of drugs as a " godsend "
They also worry about the side effects of the drugs - and the long - term consequences of taking psychotropic medication .
Unlike the stimulants prescribed for ADHD ( Ritalin and so on ) , which have been around for more than 50 years and which studies suggest are basically safe , little is known about anti-psychotics and their effects on children 's still - growing brains .
But while it is easy to make fun of many of the diagnoses - and understandable that we should be wary of the medications - it is clear that for many of these families the medications have been a lifeline .
Hugh 's parents said they cannot contemplate life without the medication .
His behaviour was just too challenging .
He did n't get along with his peers .
He was slow to pick up social skills - was n't good at maintaining eye contact , for example .
He seemed to think he knew better than anyone else on most issues .
He was sarcastic and aloof in a way that belied his age .
He often seemed angry .
He also suffered from mood swings , going from giddy and silly to gloomy and self - hating .
He had bouts of not needing sleep and becoming grandiose - having an inflated sense of himself and his place in the world .
Highly intelligent
On one occasion , after being told off by his mother , aged eight or so , Hugh reacted by threatening to throw himself in front of a car on a road near their house .
Shortly after this incident , he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder .

During my stay with the Kelleys , it was clear that Hugh was n't your average 10 - year - old .
He could be moody and superior .
During one argument with his sister he made a ( not - too - serious ) threat about hurting her .
He then made the memorable pronouncement : " If the world is my nemesis , then I 'm their nemesis . "
When I attempted to interview him he was occasionally a little abrasive .
He had a habit of wandering off without explanation during my questions .
But it was hard to know to know how much of his anger was " pathological " and symptomatic of a real condition - and how much was simply a moody 10 - year - old acting up .
And it was also true that he was highly intelligent , creative and capable of great charm .
By the end of my stay , I 'd grown to like him a lot .
In the end , there are no easy answers to the medication debate .
I left the Kelleys more open to the idea of " drugging kids " than I 'd been when I arrived .
I could see that , for all the unknowns involved and the lack of long - term data , families like the Kelleys viewed the medication as a godsend .
But I also realised that doctors and families are still operating to a great extent in the dark .
Here is a selection of your comments .
Hugh sounds like he exhibits some classic ( and very strong ! ) signs of autism .
How much attention is paid to this in the US ?
I dread to think what the long - term effects could be on an autistic disorder of taking such a cocktail of pyschotropic medication in the early years .
Becky , Durham , UK
As a parent of a six - year - old son with Aspergers and ADHD , I watched Louis navigate his way through a world all too familiar .
I have immense respect for the parents featured on the programme .
Their commitment is equalled only by the personal price they pay in the pursuit of their child 's welfare .
Louis was sensitive both to the issues and the people he spoke to .
He demonstrated a heartfelt desire to understand .
Thank you Louis .
Stephen Proctor , Wakefield , UK Prescription drug use in America is pathetic .
In the first place , anyone who takes drugs for the least little thing just is n't thinking strait .
They 're only weakening their immune systems .
And the doctors are n't helping any .
They encourage people to run to them if they even get get so much as a sniffle , or minor pains .
Howard Chaney , L.A. California
Dealing with troublesome children is a difficult issue .
As a teacher I am constantly making decisions about how to best to cope with children who are preventing other children from learning or feeling safe .
But it seems to me that prescribing them drugs to change their personality is very dangerous .
For a child that does not understand their behaviour to have that behaviour changed by something else they do n't understand seems very dangerous to me .
It seems to me we have made a positive step in removing violence from education and childhood but to replace it with mind altering drugs is not the answer .
What are they trying to achieve in these children ?
Dan Playford , Braintree UK
Yes , it 's true .
When you have one of these difficult children and you 've tried everything , it is such a relief to find that the drugs do work .
If my son had n't had the option of medication to control his outbursts and hyperactivity , we would be divorced by now .
Anon , London Perhaps this is mostly down to a lack of disciplining children properly .
We , in the western world , now generally look down on smacking children .
We should perhaps look again , at whether it can be an effective part of a range of ways to discipline children when they behave badly .
I am not condoning physically injuring children and only suggest that it may be effective as a last resort to be used sparingly .
If people think it is cruel and outrageous to do so , consider what is better for the child .
Drugging them and telling them that they have mental problems ( when it may just be bad behaviour ) , or giving them the occasional smack on the backside as part of a wide range of discipline methods as a last resort ?
Ross Henderson , Glasgow , Scotland
When the cause of mental distress and suffering is biological , drugs have an important part to play .
In other situations , drugs might deny the horrendous impact that modern life can have on our mental health .
Treat the person or treat life ?
Martin Hewitt , Glasgow , Scotland
The BBC should look at the diagnosis of bipolar / mental health problems in Britain in teenagers / young people .
It 's horrific .
Unlike America British kids and their families have to fight for every inch of help the NHS do n't want to give .
Lauren , London
Has no - one thought of trying psychotherapy , family based therapy , cognitive behaviour therapy - there are loads of non-medication treatments available .
Children are often only reacting to toxic situations they find themselves placed in .
They are acting out their parents ' unconscious traumas and unfulfilled wishes .
Children benefit by being listened to and nurtured not abused and put in a chemical straitjacket .
children need love not drugs .
Polly , Birmingham Interesting program , but unfortunately we did not see these kids before they started medication , so it was difficult for the viewer to determine if some parents simply took the easy way out .
It was obvious that the change from the highly anxious or hyperactive , to mainly quiet , almost emotionless children through tablets as the end result did not suggest a complete success .
Doctorwhat ,
When I was in America on business one of the most disturbing things I heard was one of our clients going through the list of her son 's medication .
In pills we trust ...

‘ Push - polls ’ , for those unfamiliar with the term , are a political campaigning technique “ in which an individual or organization attempts to influence or alter the view of respondents under the guise of conducting a poll ” ( Wikipedia ) . *
And it looks like Rupert Murdoch ’s Sun newspaper someone [ EDIT 20/4/2010 – see Update below ) has been paying internet polling firm YouGov to undertake some ‘ push - polling ’ against the Lib Dems , following the surge in support for Nick Clegg ’s party after last week ’s televised debate .
Former British ambassador Craig Murray spotted the following comment on the PoliticalBetting .com website , and noticed its significance :
Just done a YouGov , Mostly about Clegg & LD
Here was one of the question “ Nick Cleggs says the other parties are to blame for the MP scandals , he has taken money from a criminal on the run , many of his MPs have been found guilty of breaking the rules and his own party issued guidance on how to fiddle the expenses system ? ”
I ’d say that was fairly direct !
There were some 17 other questions re the LD by sealo0 April 18th , 2010 at 10:33 am
This was seemingly confirmed by Anthony Wells , who works for YouGov and runs the respected UK Polling Report blog , who commented here – Anthony says the questions were asked towards the end of the survey and were not “ anything to do with polling for newspapers or publication ” .
So why were they asked , and who paid for them to be asked , if they were never supposed to see the light of day ?
As Craig Murray concludes :
The proposition above is , obviously to anyone , not really a question but a set of dubious propaganda statements designed to influence the interviewee .
Plainly this is a deliberate attempt to produce a poll which shows the Lib Dem surge as a blip , and thus discourages potential Lib Dems voters .
That the Murdoch press pull such a stunt should surprise nobody .
But even though they are getting huge money from Murdoch for these daily polls , YouGov must realise that this abrogates all professional methodology and breaches the ethics of the polling industry .
YouGov ’s reputation rests on its credibility for conducting impartial surveys – its board now has some serious questions to answer .
Update ( 20/4/2010 ) : Peter Kellner , President of YouGov , has categorically denied that any question resembling the one quoted here was any part of any poll the firm has conducted for the media .
This rules out the possibility that News International / The Sun would have asked this question .
However , YouGov has declined to confirm or deny whether this question was asked by a private client – which means we still do not know whether the question quoted above was posed in that form by YouGov .

* To quote from Wiki :
The champagne afterglow of Rear Window is the reverse image of the romantic desolation of Vertigo .
It ’s difficult to think of any director living or dead who could express either joy or abandonment with such a fine wallop , much less both .
( Brian De Palma , Hitchcock ’s most imaginative imitator , can sow devastation — see Blow Out and Casualties of War — but is too cynical a bystander to portray bliss .
He can work only one side of Love Street . )
Cool operator though he may have been , Hitchcock worked both extremes of the emotional spectrum .
Unlike field - commander directors , whose ambitions lure them like siren songs toward bigger budgets , wider canvases , all - star casts , and loftier themes ( Terrence Malick , for example , breaking his 20 - year sabbatical with the thick vegetation and poetic voice - overs of The Thin Red Line ) , Hitchcock was n’t afraid to divest himself of Hollywood pomp and start with a clean slate .
Psycho was the cinema - altering product of Hitchcock ’s experimental primitivism ; it ’s an exploitation film that turns into a threshing machine of Eisensteinian montage .
Inspired by the box - office payoff of American International ’s cheap quickies , Hitchcock decided to do a cut - price horror film of his own , based on a pulp novel by Robert Bloch about a homicidal mama ’s boy .
He and the screenwriter , Joseph Stefano , spent six weeks consulting about the film , piecing it together scene by scene , then Stefano went off and wrote .
Hitchcock shot the first draft ( something almost unheard of in second - guess Hollywood ) with the camera unit from his TV show .
The famous shower scene , which took seven days to shoot with 70 camera setups ( for 45 seconds of footage ! ) , was done with a nude body double for Janet Leigh , since nudity did n’t conform with Hitchcock ’s notions of proper use of a star .
The movie was shot in black and white “ to avoid a wash of Technicolor blood , ” according to Hitch .
( That is one reason among many why Gus Van Sant ’s recent color reproduction was a mistake .
Anne Heche ’s orange outfits were also an affront . )
Psycho is a half - movie which itself is divided neatly in two .
The opening sequences of Janet Leigh with her lover lounging in bed after enjoying a matinee , her embezzlement and flight , the rainy drive in the dark ( windshield wipers have never had such a threatening rhythm ) , have a classic noir propulsion .
Once Leigh steps into the shower of her room at the Bates Motel , the movie enters a different aesthetic dimension .
Shadows are banished in a white blare of hospital light .
The images are wrested from their social milieu into pure abstraction .
The slashing knife , which mimics the editing cuts , introduces a formal virtuosity for which the routine functionality of the embezzlement story has left the viewer totally unprepared .
The shower scene is n’t just a trap sprung on the unwary ; it ’s an art piece , the shower itself an art installation — an upright sacrificial altar .
The Zapruder clip of Hollywood horror , the shower scene is one of the most parodied sequences in cinema ( Mel Brooks took a limp stab at it in High Anxiety ) , yet copycat versions and 20 years of slasher films have not dulled its impact .
Critics were divided on the shock tactics of Psycho ( Dwight Macdonald called it the product of “ a mean , sly , sadistic little mind ” ) , but it was a popular smash .
One of the interesting finds in the otherwise verbatim tedium of Hitchcock ’s Notebooks is that after the humiliating failure of Torn Curtain , a clunker starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews ( a film in which Hitchcock also had a falling - out with Bernard Herrmann ) , Hitchcock considered another , even bolder return to basics .
In 1967 , Hitchcock and the screenwriter Benn W. Levy , with whom he had collaborated on his first sound film , Blackmail ( 1929 ) , began planning a film based on the true - life story of Neville Heath , a soft - spoken young man who seduced his victims before murdering them .
Suave knockoff artists were nothing new in Hitchcock — Joseph Cotten ’s “ Merry Widow ” killer in Shadow of a Doubt comes to mind .
What would make this treatment unique was Hitchcock ’s intention to shoot the film on New York City streets cinéma - vérité - style , using unknown actors in natural light and actual locales and showing bohemian nudity , like in them fancy Antonioni films .
The most remarkable item is that Hitchcock planned to shoot the film with a portable camera , a radical break from his cinematic principles .
As he told Bogdanovich , “ Hand - held [ camera ] is against all the rules of cinema — cinema is montage — it ’s pieces of film , three frames long if you want it , placed next to other pieces of film . ”
Hand - held camera took one into Cassavetes territory , where snapping , unruly heads go in and out of focus and frame .
Hitchcock hired the photographer Arthur Schatz to conduct film tests using faster color stocks by shooting a rough draft of the script .
“ This footage , shot without sound and , to this day , still unknown actors , is an incredible glimpse into what could have been , ” the author of Hitchcock ’s Notebooks writes .
Had this project , originally called Kaleidoscope , been produced , “ its brutality and cinema verité style would have been ahead of the films from this period that did break down the studios ’ stylized violence : Bonnie and Clyde , even Easy Rider .
Here was one of cinema ’s greatest directors ( perhaps the greatest ) proposing a groundbreaking film that would have eschewed the American studio style for the kind of filmmaking Hitchcock was seeing in France and Italy . ”
Colin Campbell , a leading peak oil theorist who is a retired geologist , has discovered the pricing mechanism .
After record prices and an economic downturn caused oil consumers to change their behavior , and oil demand in the developed world to fall , he 's now a believer in peak demand for the developed world .
We 're already past it even .
Reuters :
" I have changed my point of view about future prices , " said Campbell , who used to think the peak in conventional oil production , which he believes happened in 2005 , would lead to a relentless price surge .
Instead , the record rally led to a peak in demand in the developed world .
" Peak oil drives prices up in the first place .
It has its own mechanism .
We 're sort of at peak demand right now , " Campbell told Reuters from his home in the village of Ballydehob , West Cork .
" I think presently the price limit is about $ 100 . "
We frequently see peak oil believers who are highly accomplished scientists , but with little economics background .
It shows how peak oil theory would make total sense if we existed in a world without economic forces , such as behavioral responses to rising or falling prices .
The funny thing is that Mr. Campbell is now probably too bearish on oil prices with his $ 100 near - term limit .
With oil prices at $ 86 as it stands , it 's pretty feasible they could break $ 100 if the world economy keeps growing at a decent clip .
That 's only a 16 % move , which from the perspective of a market participant is nothing and definitely within the realm of possibilities .
Women have been serving admirably in warzones for the U.S. military for years .
But they 're absent from the ranks of modern video game armies .
A game developer offered Kotaku a justification of why we virtually fight as men .

The answer , offered by Gordon Van Dyke , producer of the new Electronic Arts modern warfare game Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , has to do with technology .
Or , more specifically , it has to do with technology needs trumping any sense of consumer demand for representation of both genders .
Programming women soldiers into a virtual war just might not be worth the costs to the game and the servers that connect the people playing it .

The topic came up on last week 's Kotaku podcast , when I asked Van Dyke if there were women in Bad Company 2 .
I 'd noticed that the games I 'd played set in modern or near - future settings were almost always fought by men and men only .
" There 's no girls in our game , " he said around the 33 - minute mark .

" It 's an interesting thing , though because … It 's fun that you bring that up because I can kind of give some insight into development and how games are made .
When you actually put in female characters , typically you have to put in an entire new skeleton model and that entire new skeleton model adds an entire new level of animation and an entire new level of rigging .
You basically double the amount of data and memory for soldiers that would need to go into your game .
" So it turns into one of those things that 's like :
How much will putting something like this in give us , whether the rewards of putting something like this in [ are worth it ] .
The reward has to match what you have to give up somewhere else .
Our games are pushing the edge of the system they 're on at such a high degree that it becomes more of a balancing act for implementing new things — how many vehicles you can have in a game or how many buildings with destruction — because every single one of those things needs to be calculated by the server and transmitted to every single play that 's playing the game .
Every time you shoot a building or wall , they [ need ] to see it when it happens or , if you go past that , at a later date , the server needs to remember that data and then transmit it to all those players . "

It does n't require much special programming to change a virtual soldier 's skin tone .
Heights and weights , though , usually stay fixed .
So too , Van Dyke explained , does gender for likely the same reasons — unless gamers would want their virtual female soldiers to run and move like men .
And what of the trade - off ?
The ability for the walls in a virtual battlefield to break and stay broken may sound trifling to non-gamers .
But within the context of games , it is a literal breakthrough .
Walls have been immutable in games since the days of Pac - Man , and while games have , from time to time , allowed barriers to be broken , it 's still a rare feat .
Advertisement
Imagine the gameplay implications of Pac - Man being able to bash through a wall to escape Inky , Blinky or Clyde .
It would certainly have had more profound impact on how Pac - Man played than adding a bow to Pac - Man 's " head " and calling him " Ms. Pac - Man , " right ?
Video games can sometimes be accused of being behind the times in regards to social issues and minority representation .
That women can't even fight in 2010 war games such as Bad Company 2 and MAG — even as real women reportedly serve admirably in the real military — would seem to be retrograde , but maybe the tech excuse is a good one .

Do female characters need to be put in virtual combat ?
Or , more to the point , are they more important than crumbling walls ?

GENEVA , September 29 , 2009 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) -
The sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church in the US and abroad was a matter of homosexuals preying on adolescent boys , not one of pedophilia , said the Vatican 's representative at the UN in Geneva , Switzerland .
It is " more correct , " said Archbishop Silvano Tomasi , to speak of ephebophilia , a homosexual attraction to adolescent males , than pedophilia , in relation to the scandals .
" Of all priests involved in the abuses , 80 to 90 per cent belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17 , " said Tomasi .
His statement is backed up by a report commissioned by the US bishops that found that in the overwhelming majority of cases the clergy involved were homosexuals , with 81 percent of victims being adolescent males .
Tomasi also responded to criticisms , saying that while the Catholic Church has been " busy cleaning its own house , it would be good if other institutions and authorities , where the major part of abuses are reported , could do the same and inform the media about it . "
According to information from various sources , the problem of sexual abuse of minors in religious organizations is widespread among Protestant churches and Jewish communities .
The statement comes in the wake of accusations at the UN Human Rights Council , which published a written statement by a secularist group , the International Humanist and Ethical Union ( IHEU ) , alleging that the Vatican was responsible for the proliferation of sexual abuse cases involving Catholic priests .
The IHEU accused the Church of a failure to honor obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
" The Holy See has been heavily implicated for decades in covering up cases of child abuse carried our by its clergy and religious orders , in obstructing justice , and in failing to deal appropriately with abusers , " said Roy Brown , IHEU Main Representative at the UN Geneva .
" Yet for too long it has been given a free ride by the international community because of its presumed moral leadership .
Our report is the first to bring the issue to the attention of the Council .
We shall be referring to our report in the plenary of the Human Rights Council next week . "
Tomasi , however , defended the Church 's record , saying that " available research " showed that only 1.5 to 5 per cent of Catholic clergy had been implicated in abuse allegations , and suggesting that some of the focus ought to be shifted to other organizations that are plagued by accusations of sex abuse .
The vast plurality of Protestant churches in the US , numbering more than 224,000 , including thousands of independent non-denominational groups , make the kind of organized tracking and recording of individual abuse cases as was done in the Catholic Church all but impossible .
Nevertheless , some of the sex abuse cases in other religious communities have been documented piecemeal .
In June 2007 , the Associated Press revealed that three companies that insure the majority of Protestant churches in the US said they receive upward of 260 reports each year of young people under 18 being sexually abused by clergy , church staff , volunteers or congregation members .
Church Mutual Insurance Co. , GuideOne Insurance Co. and Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Co. , which insure 165,495 churches for liability against child sex abuse , emphasized that their figures did not always specify which cases were against minors and added that not all allegations were followed by convictions or even investigations .
National surveys by Christian Ministry Resources ( CMR ) , a tax and legal - advice publisher serving more than 75,000 congregations and 1,000 denominational agencies , has also issued a report that found that child - abuse allegations against American Protestant churches averaged 70 per week since 1993 , with a slight downward trend starting in 1997 .
The same report also found that among Protestant churches , volunteers are more likely than clergy or paid staff to be abusers .
In 2002 , Rt. Rev. William Persell , Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago , said in a sermon on Good Friday , " We would be naëve and dishonest were we to say this is a Roman Catholic problem and has nothing to do with us because we have married and female priests in our church .
Sin and abusive behaviour know no ecclesial or other boundaries . "
The John Jay Report , commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and based on surveys completed by the Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States , found that between 1950 and 2002 , a total of 10,667 individuals had made allegations of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church .
Of these , the dioceses had been able to substantiate 6,700 accusations against 4,392 priests .
In 2002 , at the height of the media frenzy over Catholic sex abuse cases , James Cobble , executive director of CMR , said that although the Catholic Church had received the most media attention , " this problem is even greater with the Protestant churches simply because of their far larger numbers . "
Of the approximately 350,000 churches in the US , only 5 per cent are Catholic .
Moreover , the evidence showed that abuse cases in the Catholic Church had been linked to the surge of sexual license in society in general coinciding with the " sexual revolution " of the 1960s .
Alleged abuses increased dramatically in the 1960s , peaked in the 1970s , declined in the 1980s and by the 1990s had returned to the levels of the 1950s .

Ayguel Oezkan on Monday became Germany 's first Muslim woman minister .
The Hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of Lower Saxony .
This was part of a cabinet shuffle in which Christian Democrat Premier Christian Wulff replaced four of his ministers .
In addition to the 38 - year - old Oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , Johanna Wanka ( 59 ) of Brandenburg , became the first eastern German woman to enter the cabinet of a western German state .
Oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by Serkan Toeren , the liberal Free Democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
Only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said Toeren , who , like Oezkan has Turkish roots .
But now Germany has not only Oezkan , but also Philipp Roesler , Germany 's Vietnamese - born health minister .
" Who knows ?
maybe she could become chancellor , too , " Toeren told the Rheinische Post newspaper .
" I am aware that I 'll a role model , " Oezkan said , shortly after learning of her appointment .
Kenan Kolat , chairman of the TGD , the Turkish Community in Germany , said in a statement that he found it remarkable that the conservative Christian Democrats had taken this step .
He added that he hoped that other German parties would follow the CDU 's example .

Unregistered marriages , bride kidnappings and an outdated registration system that denies internal migrants access to basic services - these are all problems familiar to many women in Kyrgyzstan .
On International Women 's Day , five women , helped by the British Red Cross and the Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent , share their stories of hardship and hopes for equality .
Kalia ( not her real name ) , 20 , Osh region Kalia looks after her son with no financial support from her husband ( Claudia Janke / British Red Cross )
It is common practice in rural Kyrgyzstan for young couples to be married with a traditional " Nike " ceremony - a religious ritual carried out by the local mullah with no legal standing .
But this is one of the major factors contributing to the increasing vulnerability of young women in Kyrgyzstan , as the numbers of such unregistered marriages have dramatically increased since the fall of the Soviet Union when such marriages were illegal .
Kalia 's marriage lasted only two months .
" He beat me black and blue , not caring that I was pregnant " , she says .
She was 200 km ( 124 miles ) away from her home in her husband 's village with no - one to turn to .
She was afraid for her unborn child 's life and decided to call her parents to rescue her .
Kalia gave birth at her family home .
Her baby , Nurgeldy , is now eight months old .
She now lives with her elderly parents and five sisters and brothers .
The only income the family has is the parents ' pensions .
They heat their house with coal when they can afford it .
Kalia receives no financial support from her husband because they are not registered as married and her son does not even have a birth certificate as his father refuses to give him his name .
When asked about the future , Kalia says : " When my son grows up , I will educate him to treat women as equals .
When my sisters get married I hope they will be happier than me .
" Maybe I will get married again - who knows what the future holds ? "
" For the moment I do n't have time to think about these things .
I have to work hard to survive here , but at least no - one is constantly observing me or beating me for no reason . "
Salamat , 30 , Osh region
In pictures : Tackling vulnerability Salamat is raising her three - year - old daughter Baktygul alone because she left her husband following intense physical abuse .
She lost her second baby because of the beatings - it was born prematurely with a dented skull .
Salamat explains the reality of her marriage : " Everything started off badly .
My husband was unemployed , like many other villagers , and his family survived by subsistence farming .
" My new mother - in - law ruled the family with an iron fist - she was a tyrannical woman .
She was never satisfied with the work I did and often encouraged my husband to beat me .
" I had to work day and night in the family field , even when I had my newborn daughter in my arms .
He would never help me . "
Salamat now lives with her mother , brother and another sister , who also left her husband .
They survive through subsistence farming , trading produce with other villagers .
The only income for a family of 10 is their 57 - year - old mother 's pension , which is 1000 soms per month ( $ 21 , £ 14 ) .
Most of this money goes towards the electricity bills and buying clothes and shoes for the children .
The adults try not to spend anything themselves .
Salamat is not hopeful about the future : " I will not marry again because I have a child .
All my friends are married and they avoid me .
I do n't have any free time anyway .
Whenever I get a free minute , I want to sleep . "
Syrga , internal migrant , Bishkek
As a migrant , Syrga cannot access basic social services ( Claudia Janke / British Red Cross ) Syrga migrated to Bishkek with her husband and four children from a village high in the Tian Shan mountains .
She settled in the newly created migrant village of Nijnyaya Ala - Archa on the fringes of the capital .
As a migrant , she suffers under an outdated registration system - a remnant of Soviet times - which blocks access to vital services for migrants who are not able to register for benefits in the capital .
Syrga and her children cannot access basic social services , like schools and a doctor , without paying exorbitant fees they can not afford .
The system affects about 220,000 internal migrants living in Bishkek who have to rely on others for the most basic things .
Syrga 's neighbour Gulmira , for example , had to deliver her baby on her living room floor , because the medical services would not come to her assistance .
Faced with these daily struggles , Syrga , who has taken part in Red Cross educational projects , has decided to take action and mobilise her community .
" I want to motivate other women in the community to get together , take these training courses and learn about their rights .
But I have to work to earn money to make it through the winter and give my children food , so it is not easy to find the time . "
Gulmira , 35 , Suzak region Gulmira worries about the increasing number of bride kidnappings ( Claudia Janke / British Red Cross ) Gulmira was forced into a marriage at the age of 20 .
Her husband , who was also forced to marry , was in love with someone else .
Gulmira 's dreams of studying at university and eventually working with children were shattered in the space of days .
" I was forced to get engaged and soon afterwards a small religious ceremony was held .
The marriage was not officially registered .
Suddenly I was married .
I did n't even know my husband . "
Gulmira worked hard to support the family while her husband studied .
Shortly after moving to Bishkek , her husband began to drink and attack her violently .
Because of his attacks , Gulmira 's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage .
Gulmira managed to save her second pregnancy and gave birth to a daughter , Madina .
Shortly afterwards , the marriage ended .
Gulmira returned to her village , where she lives with her parents and her daughter , now 15 .
Her husband remarried .
He gives no financial support to Gulmira and Madina .
" I can't force him to help us financially because there is no legal proof that we were married .
If our marriage had been registered at least I could have got alimony and social benefits but I have nothing . "
She has been given a job teaching Russian in a kindergarten with the support of Red Crescent .
" One of my dreams has finally come true .
I am so happy to work with children because when you are busy with them for the whole day you forget about your problems , about men , about everything . "
Gulmira watches her daughter closely , as bride kidnappings - to avoid expensive wedding ceremonies or to satisfy undesirable husbands ' marriage needs - are increasingly common in rural Kyrgyzstan .
" Now I teach my daughter not to repeat my mistakes .
I am teaching her that we have equal rights with men . "
Jamilya , community activist , Osh region Jamilya has high ambitions for the women of Kyrgyzstan ( Claudia Janke / British Red Cross ) Jamilya knows her community inside out .
" Women in every village have the same problems : unregistered marriages , bride kidnappings and domestic violence , " she explains .
" The Soviet values have been destroyed but no other values have been created in their place .
There is a gap in education and morality of people of a certain age and this is the gap that the Red Crescent has to fill through awareness - raising and educational training . "
Jamilya has started a sewing workshop to teach vulnerable women a skill that can provide a vital income for their families .
Such savings make a huge difference to mothers with many children .
Jamilya's 10 - strong group has taken over an abandoned building and turned it into a bright and cheerful work space .
They are not able work in the winter however , with temperatures dropping well below freezing and no means of heating the room .
Jamilya 's ambitions are high , both for the sewing group and for the situation of women in Kyrgyzstan : " Our goal with the group is to grow the business so that we can eventually sell our items in Bishkek and maybe even abroad .
" At the same time , we are fighting to get the law changed , so that registered marriages are obligatory before any religious ceremony is held .
This will protect our women and therefore our whole community . "

The already strict requirements that must be met for an application to be published on Apple 's App Store are set to take a turn for the worse , as Apple 's NDA - protected license agreement has now updated an already annoying existing clause , Section 3.3.1 , to make it even more offensive .
The original clause stated :
3.3.1 — Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
This clause has already frustrated developers in the past because there are tasks that developers would like to perform that can only be achieved through private APIs ; though some have taken a risk and submitted applications that use such APIs , the result is often that the application is denied .
The new version of 3.3.1 reads :
3.3.1 — Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ , or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ , and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) .
Things just got a whole lot more restrictive for iPhone developers .
What this change means is that developers can no longer use software like Novell 's MonoTouch , Unity3D , or Ansca 's Corona to develop iPhone applications , and tools like Appcelerator 's Titanium and PhoneGap are looking questionable .
MonoTouch , Unity3D , and Corona allow developers to use the C# language and Lua scripting , respectively , to write iPhone applications .
Titanium and PhoneGap allow application development using JavaScript and HTML ; because they use WebKit behind the scenes to run that JavaScript , they might be OK .
The reasons that developers like and use these tools are many and varied .
Titanium , PhoneGap , and Corona , in particular , offer rapid iPhone development environments that are simpler than the Cocoa and Objective - C environments used for native development .
As such , they offer their users quicker , more responsive release cycles , and lower development costs .
Unity3D provides a range of features to game developers like a 3D engine , a physics processing engine , audio processing , and so on — features that would be prohibitively expensive for most developers to write from scratch .
MonoTouch more simply allows the use of a different programming language and different libraries , ones that certain developers might be more comfortable with .
A significant product that is soon to be added to this list of development tools is Adobe 's Flash CS5 .
The real enemy : Adobe
As is now well - known , Flash is n't supported on the iPhone ( the license conditions prohibit that kind of runtime application ) , so in response , Adobe has given Flash CS5 the ability to produce iPhone applications , in a broadly similar manner to how the other tools work .
As Adobe explains , Flash CS5 completely skips Objective - C , instead plumbing into the iPhone compiler to directly produce executable code .
Apple 's seething dislike for Adobe has become increasingly apparent in recent years .
It 's a dislike that in many ways makes no real sense : most of Adobe 's biggest products do n't compete with Apple 's ( and vice versa ) , and using Adobe 's applications has traditionally been one of the biggest reasons that people have chosen — and stuck with — Apple 's platform .
But that 's all in the past ; Apple has Flash in its sights and is doing its best to destroy it .
Adobe , for its part , has made some non-commital comments on the issue ; the company still plans to ship Flash CS5 , but its ability to create iPhone applications might turn out to be short - lived , to say the least .
Apple 's new 3.3.1 restrictions have been met with some disdain from the developer community , too , and it 's no surprise .
After all , if followed literally , they 'd prevent developers even from writing English language specifications for their programs — since such applications would not be originally written in one of the blessed languages !
A case could be made that the rule change prevents even thinking or talking about iPhone programs .
Of course , the App Store gatekeepers will not be quite so absurd , but there 's certainly ample scope for inconsistent application of the rules .
Nothing new there , unfortunately .
The other real enemy : Google
As well as hurting Adobe , and certainly tarnishing the company 's brand new product , this move hurts Android .
In fact , I think the harm done to Android could end up being even more substantial than the harm to Adobe .
Although I would say that the biggest virtues of these banned tools are faster , easier development , the fact is that they also often encourage cross-platform development .
Flash is perhaps the most obvious example of this , but MonoTouch , Unity3D , and Titanium all enable developers to write applications that are more easily ported to non-Apple platforms such as Windows and Android .
Such conversion is not necessarily automatic — applications will typically need some amount of tailoring to adapt them to the different environments — but it 's a big help .
Minority platforms are always going to be the biggest beneficiaries of cross-platform development .
It might be hard to justify developing an application for a minority platform from scratch .
But if I can take a program for the majority platform and then put in an extra 10 % development effort to cover the minority too , that 's a much more appealing prospect .
Though Apple does not dominate the smartphone market taken as a whole ( Symbian is the runaway leader , with RIM's BlackBerry in second place ) , I think it 's clear that in the narrower market of , shall we say , mobile phone - computers , Apple is the leader .
Symbian and BlackBerry devices are all too often relegated to being little more than phones with e-mail , and though applications can be developed for both , they have not inspired developers and users in the way that iPhone and Android have .
No real defense
Some observers strive to justify this decision by claiming it 's better for Apple 's users , because in their world all cross - platform apps are bad , so they 're better off without .
It 's true that cross - platform apps often buck platform UI conventions , and so end up feeling kind of alien — available on lots of platforms , but not really fitting properly on any of them ( as anyone who 's had the misfortune to use iTunes on Window will testify ) .
But it 's not as though being platform - specific is some guarantee of quality .
There are plenty of lousy natively - written iPhone applications out there , and these are often produced in a cookie - cutter fashion , so that they can be churned out en masse .
In contrast , there are also lots of good cross- platform programs out there .
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of gaming .
Games are in many ways a class of their own , because games generally offer unique user interfaces : interfaces that are tailored to the game , rather than leveraging the platform .
And there are certainly a lot of developers out there producing high quality , popular games using tools like Flash .
This idea that cross - platform applications will be bad , such that Apple 's users are better off without them , just is n't universally true .
Yes , some cross - platform applications will be bad .
Some native applications will be bad , too .
The reasonable , equitable solution is not to ban the use of tools that produce cross-platform applications .
It 's to say " applications must conform to all appropriate user - interface guidelines " and ban any application that does n't .
This is something the company is already doing anyway , and something that 's unlikely to be a big issue .
The existing development toolkits for iPhone make it easier to produce cross- platform applications , but certainly do n't enable the kind of Write Once Run Anywhere approach that Java once promised .
They just enable developers to migrate the " working parts " of their applications from one platform to another .
The all - important user interfaces will still need to be customized to the needs of the different mobile OSes .
No , this policy change can't be attributed to a desire to ensure the quality of the user experience .
It 's about control .
Developers must choose to target iPhone explicitly , or not at all .
Apple does n't want anyone to even consider writing applications for other platforms , and is going to stand in the way of anyone trying to do so .
Open hostility
Hostility towards competitors is , I suppose , all part of the game .
But this action is also hugely hostile towards developers themselves .
The banned development environments offer things that Apple 's Xcode does n't .
Sometimes it 's just a different choice of language , one that a particular deveoper might feel more comfortable in .
But often the advantage is simplification — the use of higher - level programming languages ( like Lua , or JavaScript , or C# ) and frameworks that take out a lot of the grunt - work of software development ( like writing a 3D engine ) .
In turn , developers get quicker development cycles , easier development , fewer bugs , and overall , superior applications .
Banning these tools does n't just hurt competitors .
It hurts developers on Apple 's platform , and in turn hurts the platform itself .
The absurdity of this is even more apparent if one thinks back to the initial announcemnt of the iPhone .
The iPhone was never going to have an SDK .
The mantra was " use web applications " .
Indeed , that was one of the driving forces behind Apple 's creation of a first - rate mobile browser .
Since the browser was going to be the application platform on iPhone , it had to be good .
And indeed it was .
The company was reluctant to produce an SDK ; this was not simply a case of managing expectations , and keeping quiet about the SDK until it was good and ready .
It was a sincere desire to use the web as the development platform .
The eventual decision to release an SDK caught many within the company by surprise .
Web apps are still an option , of course , for developers willing to live with their inherent restrictions .
For those who can stick with C and C++ for the majority of their development , some level of compatibility between iPhone and other platforms is still possible .
But both options still fail to give the considerable benefits that the third - party development platforms provide .
Apple 's current — and in our opinion , objectionable — position is now close to the complete opposite of its initial stance .
From promoting openness and standards , the company is now pushing for an ever more locked - down and restricted platform .
It 's bad for competition , it 's bad for developers , and it 's bad for consumers .
I hope that there will be enough of a backlash that the company is forced to reconsider , but with the draw of all those millions of iPhone ( and now , iPad ) customers , I fear that Apple 's developers will , perhaps with some reluctance , just accept the restriction and do whatever Cupertino demands .
Local government elected leaders are claiming we have no alternative to king - size budget cuts .
But their numbers do n’t add up .
By Sam Pizzigati
You wo n’t find many suburbs in the United States more affluent than the burbs that ring Washington , D.C.
In fact , six of the ten wealthiest counties in the entire United States sit just outside our nation ’s capital .
But those counties , these days , are n’t seeming so wealthy .
All this month local elected officials from these affluent jurisdictions have been announcing deep and unprecedented budget cuts — and hinting at more .
The most stunning of these announcements came last Monday when the top elected leader in Maryland ’s Montgomery County unveiled a budget plan that has the county spending fewer dollars than the year before , the first time that will have happened since the current county charter went into effect back in 1968 .
This cutback will cost most county workers ten days of pay — and hundreds of others their jobs .
The county ’s near 1 million residents , for their part , will be seeing fewer public services .
Libraries will be open fewer hours .
Roads will go unrepaired .
Classrooms will become more crowded .
Bus routes will be eliminated .
No mistake about it , the county ’s top elected official , Ike Leggett , confirmed last week , “ there is pain in this budget . ”
What ’s causing this unprecedented pain ?
County executive Leggett , a former chair of the Maryland Democratic Party , is blaming everything from the “ severity of the economic recession ” to the heavy cost of “ this winter ’s historic blizzards ” to “ out of control ” county spending before his election four years ago .
Left conveniently unmentioned : the core fiscal reality of our time .
Average Americans are suffering unprecedented budget pain because politicos like Ike Leggett have been doing their best to keep wealthy Americans pain - free .
If today ’s rich — in Montgomery County and out across the United States — were paying as much of their incomes in taxes as America ’s rich paid back in the middle of the 20th century , we would be witnessing no public sector meltdown .
Let ’s look at the numbers you wo n’t find in any of the artful charts and graphs Montgomery County officials presented last week to justify their cutback course .
The first number : $ 58,000 .
That ’s how much , calculates the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , the average Maryland taxpayer in the state ’s richest 1 percent will save this year in federal taxes , thanks to the George W. Bush tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 .
These top 1 percent taxpayers — average income , over $ 1.4 million — will have , all together , about $ 1.5 billion more in their pockets at the end of this year than they would if they were still paying federal taxes at year 2000 tax rates .
How many of these top 1 percent taxpayers will hail from Montgomery County ?
We can make a good estimate .
In 2008 , the most recent year with official stats available , 44.6 percent of Marylanders making over $ 500,000 lived in Montgomery County .
If that share stays steady this year , nearly $ 670 million of that $ 1.5 billion awesomely affluent Marylanders will save in 2010 from the Bush tax cuts will likely be sitting in the pockets of wealthy Montgomery County residents .
This $ 670 million equals well over three - quarters of the $ 779 million shortfall Montgomery County officials are projecting for the Montgomery County budget year that starts this July 1 , if the county does n’t swallow the massive budget cuts county executive Leggett has just proposed .
But tax cuts for America ’s wealthy , we need to keep in mind , did n’t start with George W. Bush .
Our wealthy have been enjoying massive tax breaks for over a generation .
What if we erased all these tax breaks for high - rollers ?
To be more specific , what if wealthy taxpayers in today ’s Montgomery County were paying taxes at the same rate as wealthy county residents a half century ago , back during the White House years of America ’s most famous political “ Ike , ” Dwight D. Eisenhower ?
In 2008 , the 6,538 Montgomery County taxpayers who made over $ 500,000 averaged $ 1,355,147 in income .
Back in 1955 , in the middle of those Eisenhower years , high - rollers who made , after adjusting for inflation , this same sum paid — after exploiting every loophole they could find — just over 44 percent of their incomes in federal income tax , according to IRS records .
We do n’t have figures yet on how much Montgomery County affluents paid in 2008 federal taxes .
But we do know that in 2007 , the year before , Americans who made about $ 1,355,147 paid just over 24 percent of their incomes in federal tax .
In other words , those deep pockets back in 1955 paid almost twice as much of their incomes in federal tax as their high - income counterparts today .
Let ’s get back to those 6,538 Montgomery County residents who averaged $ 1,355,147 in 2008 income .
They would have paid over $ 1.7 billion more in federal taxes that year if they had paid taxes at Dwight D. Eisenhower tax rates , a sum well over double the impending Montgomery County budget shortfall .
In short , thanks to tax breaks for the rich , staggering sums of extra dollars are now sloshing around inside the pockets of Montgomery County ’s wealthiest residents .
Local government politicos like Ike Leggett , if they so chose , could try to recapture those lost dollars at the local level .
Leggett chooses not to .
Indeed , three years ago , county executive Leggett helped lead the opposition to a modest state tax increase on millionaire incomes proposed by Maryland ’s governor .
The modest increase eventually did pass , but in a watered - down form .
“ Leadership , ” Ike Leggett pronounced last week , “ means making the hard choices now that address our current problems , without resorting to quick fixes . ”
For pols like Ike Leggett , axing jobs and cutting home care hours for low - income seniors apparently do n’t qualify as “ quick fixes . ”
Tax hikes on the rich ?
They do .

Buzz…buzz…buzz …
The Blackberry on my client ’s lap was signaling a message .
Usually , this client silences her phone and puts it away before our session , without any prompting from me .
This time , she glanced down at it , pushed a few buttons , and resumed our conversation .
I let it go .
Two minutes later : buzz… buzz …buzz …
My client looked down again and started pushing buttons .
I called her out .
“ What ’s up with the phone today ?
Usually you put it away .
Is something going on ? ”
“ It ’s just Facebook updates . ”
She pushed a few buttons again and put the phone in her pocket .
I did n’t hear it vibrate again during the rest of the session .
In my group theories class , we ’ve been discussing the concept of process commentary , which Irvin Yalom described in his book The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy as “ taboo social behavior ” among adults .
Process commentary can be defined as comments on here - and - now behavior and the immediate relationships between people .
It ’s associated mostly with group therapy , but therapists use it to bring attention and immediacy to individual sessions as well .
In therapy , process commentary is a powerful tool ; in the wider world , they are the type of comments that we sometimes attribute to people who are less socially adept : “ Can you believe he actually said that out loud ? ”
Adults often use process commentary with children , saying things such as , “ Look at me when I ’m talking to you ! ”
Using process commentary can also seriously get you in hot water with a significant other : “ Hmmm , honey , I ’m sensing resistance to my request to take the garbage out ” might be met with , “ Excuse me , counselor , but I am not your client ! ”
Yalom put forth his ideas about process commentary long before Facebook was an imaginable concept .
I ’d be curious to know if his ideas about process commentary have changed now that people are posting millions of status messages a day that answer the question , “ What ’s on your mind ? ”
That very question invites users to tell the world what is happening in the here - and - now .
In fact , “ Facebook friends ” might even get upset if you do n’t keep your status updated or you — gasp !— dare to let any significant amount of time pass before posting a status message about an important life event .
A friend posted — on his Facebook page , of course — a picture of a bride walking down the aisle , looking at her phone , with the caption : “ Facebook Status : Because it is n’t official until you update it . ”
Yalom ( 1995 ) gives four reasons why process commentary is taboo : socialization anxiety , social norms , fear of retaliation , and power maintenance ( p. 137 ) .
Facebook by its very construct has blown all of these fears out of the water , and process commentary has become front and center in our lives and the lives of our clients who use Facebook .
This powerful program has changed the face of “ social norms ” for communication and is increasingly harder to ignore , especially when what is said on a Facebook page can negatively affect clients and their relationships , self - concepts , and interactions with others and the world .
If you are on Facebook , you might have had the experience — as I have — of reading a string of comments about a friend ’s status that made you blush because of their boldness ( of the comments , but maybe the status itself as well ) .
While of course someone has to be a “ friend ” to comment on someone else ’s status , and your name and picture is posted with every comment ( assuming you are using your real name ) , there is still a sense of safety from being behind a computer and not face - to - face that allows people to feel as if they can say — literally — what ’s on their minds , without a lot of censoring or thought about interpretation .
I have been continually amazed at the depth of self - disclosure of status messages and the sometimes brash , rude , and cruel humor of ensuing comments .
In addition , I have witnessed awkward interactions among my classmates that are carried over from crude humor that was posted on Facebook pages .
Clients have come to me with stories of “ friends ” posting hurtful or embarrassing comments on their pages .
Anyone who has a Facebook page and “ friends ” linked to it is susceptible .
How long before this type of discourse finds its way into the counseling session , coming from the client ?
I can tell you that text messaging shorthand has already found its way into academic writing , everyday speech , and even memorial services ( yes , I experienced that firsthand . )
How many times have you heard “ WTF ? ” or “ TMI ! ” , stated just as I typed them ?
One of my clients described her sibling as “ Not my BFF , ” and expected that I would know what that meant .
( I did . )
Process commentary as a regular way of communication is probably not far behind .
Yalom ( 1995 ) stated , “ If individuals felt free to comment at all times on the behavior of others , social life would become intolerably self - conscious , complex , and conflicted ” ( p. 138 ) .
Well , that time is here .
And now .
Process commentary is no longer something that just happens in the therapist ’s office , delivered by the therapist for growth and awareness purposes .
Millions of people engage in it all day , every day .
It ’s not just changing how people interact with each other in the real world , but it ’s also sure to show up in your office , coming from the client , soon .

On Being a Student Therapist : Facebook and Process Commentary
MAY 15 , 2006
Okay , I am a TOTAL FREAK for having noticed this weird typographic pattern on 24 .
You have been warned .
My discovery of this bizarre typographic anomaly took place in a few steps over the course of several episodes , so bear with me as I explain .
I loved the first season of 24 , but I gave up on the show after the second season , because the pulled - out - of - thin - air plot twists , the hammy acting , and the fluid - as - water loyalties of the characters became increasingly maddening .
“ This show is ridiculous , ” I eventually said to myself , perhaps when drunk , because I do n’t usually talk to myself .
“ I refuse to watch it anymore . ”
But thanks to recommendations from a few enthusiastic friends , I returned to the show late in the fourth season , and now I ’m totally hooked again .
The fifth season has been fantastically entertaining .
The producers have worked out most of the kinks in the format and now know exactly what they ’re doing .
The show is still ridiculous sometimes , but that ’s part of the fun .
A few months ago I began to notice something unusual about the 24 clock — the timer that appears onscreen at regular intervals throughout each episode .
It ’s modeled on a standard LED clock , the kind you ’ll see on the radio next to your bed or the microwave in your kitchen or inside a ticking rogue nuclear weapon once you ’ve pulled off the face plate .
You know — the standard workaday places .
On a typical such clock , each number is rendered within a matrix of two vertical bars on either side and three horizontal bars in the middle .
At first glance , the 24 clock appears to be based around exactly that sort of matrix .
Here ’s a screenshot from last Monday ’s episode :
