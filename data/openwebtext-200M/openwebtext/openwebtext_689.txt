Texas has loomed large over Washington for much of the past century , but that will change on Jan. 20 .
Texas losing stature , clout
When President George W. Bush turns the Oval Office over to Barack Obama , he might as well dump the Lone Star of Texas into the bed of his pickup and haul it off with him .
The 28th state has loomed large over Washington for much of the past century — think the president , his father , Lyndon Johnson , Sam Rayburn , John Tower , Dick Armey and Tom DeLay .

But at noon on Jan. 20 , Texas becomes — please do n’t throw things — just another state .
“ I guess Washington can finally exhale , ” half - jokes former Bush counselor Dan Bartlett , a born - and - bred Texan who escaped to Austin last year .
The past 20 years — a dozen of them with a Texan in the White House — have seen the introduction of Shiner Bock beer to Washington grocery stores , the regular stocking of Dr Pepper at Congressional Liquor , plus the arrivals of both a Capitol Hill Tex - Mex establishment ( Tortilla Coast , in 1988 ) and a centrally located downtown barbecue joint ( Nick Fontana ’s Capitol Q , in 1997 ) .
Those may be here to stay , but other aspects of Texas ’ political and cultural influence are already on the wane .
From 1995 through 2005 , Armey and then DeLay held the office of House majority leader .
But Armey is now five years removed from power , and DeLay is entangled in a criminal case .
And while The Hammer ’s redistricting crusade in 2003 certainly helped Texas Republicans at the time , it has come back to haunt the state under Democratic rule .
If not for DeLay ’s machinations , three Texas Democrats would likely be sitting pretty these days as chairmen of powerful House committees : former Reps.
Jim Turner ( Homeland Security ) , Martin Frost ( Rules ) and Charlie Stenholm ( Agriculture ) .
Instead , they ’re all now exes , living in Texas , having lost their elections in 2004 .
“ I guess it ’s unrealistic for any state to continue to enjoy national influence dating back to the ’ 20s and ’ 30s , ” says Frost .
“ Texas has had this unbroken run .
And sooner or later , it had to come to an end . ”
That the end has come should be clear on the eve of Barack Obama ’s inauguration , when the Texas State Society hosts its Black Tie & Boots Inaugural Ball at the Gaylord hotel at National Harbor in Maryland .
The last such hoodang , in 2005 , drew 12,000 attendees , but there was a recently reelected Texan in the White House then .
By contrast , on the night before Bill Clinton ’s second inauguration , only about 7,000 people deigned to don their Tony Lamas .
Organizers are braced for another not -exactly - Texas - sized turnout in January .
Still , for those Democratic Texans who will remain in the nation ’s capital , there ’s a bright side to the changeover .
“ I happen to be Republican , ” says Jennifer Sarver , historian for the Texas State Society of Washington , D.C. “ But most of my social friends are Democrats , and they are sick and tired of everybody assuming that if you ’re Texan , you ’re a conservative or a Republican . ”
Democratic Rep. Gene Green says , “ Our influence ebbs and flows , and I think we might lose some influence now . ”
Nevertheless , Green notes that he recently became the first subcommittee chairman from Texas on the Energy and Commerce Committee .
Former Clinton adviser Paul Begala , who cultivated his twang while growing up in DeLay ’s old congressional district , crows about this marking the “ end of the Texas Republican . ”
“ When the majority of Texas Republicans voted against a Texas Republican president ’s economic package , ... then I do n’t know what it means to be a Texas Republican anymore , ” he said .
Since at least the 1960s , Texans have been simultaneously admired and loathed by the rest of Washington .
Their command , for the most part , has come on account of seniority .
Their home districts were so safe that they were able to stay in Washington more or less all of the time and invest wholeheartedly in committee work .
“ I think it played well back home .
You find a very significant pride in the state , and I think the state was proud of it .
I know in the case of my boss , [ former Rep . ]
Bill Archer , when he became chairman of the Committee [ on Ways and Means , in 1996 ] , I never got a single complaint about him not being home .
They were just happy he was chairman . ”
Don Carlson , who spent 35 years as a Hill staffer to Texas Republicans , said that his bosses “ left a legacy that the Texas delegation was a very powerful delegation , whether it was true in all the years after that or not .
Certainly they left their mark on Texas with what they were able to do in terms of funding . ”
Military bases and transportation structures and a space station in Texas stand as testimony to the legacy of might .
According to a Houston Chronicle analysis , Texas received $ 2.2 billion in federal earmarks last year , second only to California .
So who carries on the Lone Star tradition in a Democrat - dominated Congress ?
For the moment , the reins fall into the hands of Texas Republican Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn .
Both have been known to wear the boots , but neither attracts the cult of personality Washington has come to expect from denizens of the state that calls itself a republic .
Republicans think they have a rising star in Rep. Jeb Hensarling , the chairman of the Republican Study Committee .
Democrats think they have one in Rep. Chet Edwards , who chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction .
Currently , only two Texas Democrats chair committees in the House — Silvestre Reyes ( Intelligence ) and Gene Green ( Ethics ) — and neither of them is standing .
“ That ’s almost unheard of , ” says Carlson .
Without a Texan in the White House or in a top - level leadership spot , members from the state may have to work across the aisle if they hope to bring home the bacon like they did in days of yore .
“ If it could get its s--t together as a group of 32 , ” says one Texas - born Democratic Hill staffer , “ there are very few things it ca n’t get accomplished , even if most of them are in the minority . ”
The Bush administration and the Texas delegation have one last chance this year to deliver some love for the folks back home : a new federally funded agricultural biosecurity lab is considering five proposed sites , including one in San Antonio .
Texans or no Texans , real pork will still be served in Washington .
Nick Fontana says he ’s not too worried about his barbecue business .
He says Bush has never darkened his door , and that Washington is probably ready for a break from the stomp , stomp , stomping of big Texas boots , anyway .
“ People do n’t realize how big and diverse Texas is , ” he says .
“ Europeans and foreigners here think that every Texan is a crazy , redneck cowboy . ”
But Bartlett says even Washingtonians will eventually come around .
“ I wo n’t be surprised if there is a resurgence after this president rides off into the sunset and all those animosities and short - term issues around George W. Bush fade away , ” he says .
Dispossessed , or , How I Lost Most of My Music Collection — and Nearly My Mind
James Yamasaki
T his past August , I moved back to Seattle from Orange County .
An ordeal for anyone , moving for me means shipping about 2,500 pieces of vinyl and thrice as many CDs , which took about a week of long days to pack .
For this trip , I arranged for the Los Angeles moving company Eagle Express to haul my belongings up from Costa Mesa , a decision that ranks as my biggest regret of this — or maybe any — year .
Eagle Express 's supervisor , David Gomez , assured me that the delivery would take two weeks max .
In fact , it took almost a month , and when the slack mothertruckers finally arrived at my Capitol Hill storage facility , it was clear something had gone horribly awry : Expecting around 60 boxes full of my music collection , there were instead only 15 .
One of the movers , Adam — who , I later discovered , was actually an employee of West Coast Van Lines — initially expressed confusion about the missing boxes .
After much agitated questioning , he said he'd had to unload some of his cargo due to weight issues .
Incredulous , I demanded he call Eagle Express to find out where my goods were .
He made a call , speaking to Gomez in Spanish ; during the short conversation , Adam became increasingly angry and then he hung up .
Adam said something vague about a warehouse in the L.A. area .
I called Gomez but could n't get a straight answer from him .
Their stories were n't jibing , and my records were gone .
I cursed Gomez in a vicious tone I had n't used since George W. Bush became president in 2001 .
I felt as if I 'd gone in for a routine chiropractic visit and left the office with three of my limbs amputated .
T hat 's the thing about collectors , according to Seattle psychotherapist Gaelen Billingsley : " Many collectors feel synonymous with the objects they collect and use them to derive or define a sense of self .
Though they may not have any objective value , objects collected are seen as uniquely interesting or valuable to the individual collector .
Thus as collectors accumulate large numbers of valuable items , they construct the sense that they , too , are valuable by association , i.e. , ' The more of this great stuff I accumulate , the more I matter . ' "
Obsessive collecting , she explains , " tends to arise out of one ( or a combination ) of the following three basic human needs : the need for a personal self - definition of worth , the need for a sense of life purpose ( or meaning ) , and the desire for immortality . "
Damn , Ms. Billingsley .
It 's like you peered directly into my mind .
I 'm as guilty of this dubious behavior as anyone .
It 's neurotic .
But my excuses go far beyond the identity aggrandizing , the phallic substitution and surrogate dick - waving .
I actually do have legitimate reasons for accumulating so many records :
One is for DJing , which I 've done with some frequency on radio and in clubs since 1996 ( and I will always prefer to spin vinyl for such gigs ) .
In fact , I had to turn down a juicy DJ opportunity soon after I returned to Seattle because I lacked the crucial weapons from my vinyl arsenal .
Another reason is research / reference .
As a music journalist , I regularly relied on my extensive library to help me to write reviews and features .
My collection also served as a resource for friends looking to expand their knowledge .
As I 've told my friends many times , my collection and my knowledge are here to be used .
So , like Bill Withers sang , use me .
( Sadly , a huge music collection does not always work as an aphrodisiac . )
Fourthly , a megalomaniacal urge to know almost everything about almost every worthwhile musician can be a dangerous thing , I 've discovered — especially when it comes time to move .
Fifthly , almost every record and CD has a complicated network of memories and associations attached to it .
Losing as many items as I did feels like having several key scenes excised from my autobiography .
A s the weeks passed with no sighting of my precious cargo , I became increasingly ill with anger and toxic vengefulness every time I pondered Eagle Express 's botched job .
For a while , I was phoning Gomez every day , furious over my enormous loss ( fuck a 401 [ k ] ; those records were my pension ! ) .
When he did pick up , Gomez would profusely apologize in heavily accented English and vow to try to find out what happened to my stuff .
Rinse , repeat , rage .
Over the next four months and dozens of ( mostly unanswered ) calls and many empty promises later , I still can't get a satisfactory response from Gomez .
At one point , Gomez said that Adam had tried to escape into Canada to avoid the law on some charge , and that a truck with my boxes was somewhere near the border .
My calls to West Coast Van Lines went unreturned .
I 've pretty much resigned myself to never seeing those lost records and CDs ( and the dresser I 'd owned since I was 9 and some other less important items ) again .
Now I just want monetary compensation — and Gomez 's head on a pike .
Trouble is , I do n't know any lawyers in L.A. , and even if I did , I have no stomach for dealing with them .
And , foolishly , I did n't insure my belongings — after moving five times in as many years without incident , I 'd become complacent .
( This , too , ranks in the top five of my Regrets Hall of Shame . )
Y ou should have seen my friends '— especially fellow collectors '— responses to my situation .
Their faces would slacken with a mixture of disgust and disbelief , and they 'd gasp for a bit until they could utter words of pity and consolation .
It felt like I was witnessing my own funeral every time I broke the news to somebody .
After I told Jason Pettigrew , an ex– Alternative Press magazine coworker and fellow music obsessive , about my travails , he said , " I would be getting background checks on the individual movers and start brutally murdering their family members at random . "
Obviously , a loss of this magnitude prompts much reflection ( and many nights spent dreaming of flying to L.A. to seek revenge ) .
After the shock , disbelief , and the barely suppressible rage had ( mostly ) subsided , I began to ponder the significance of music — and its physical manifestations — in my life .
Maybe my obsession with it was n't that healthy .
Certainly , even after my moving disaster , I still possess more recorded music than , oh , 97 percent of the population .
I am definitely not wanting for things to listen to .
By any " normal " standard , I owned way too many CDs and LPs .
And yet the knowledge of all those rare records ( how will I ever find those Bernard Parmegiani and M. Frog Labat LPs ? ) and obscure , limited - edition CDs and boxed sets that I 'd gathered over the last 29 years and that are now dispersed to who knows where continues to gnaw at me — every hour , every day .
" Normal " is boring and mediocre .
I did n't get where I am today — for better or worse — through sensible moderation in my listening / collecting habits .
When music is your religion , as it is mine , losing reliquaries of it can damage your soul and threaten your sanity .
Among the items missing from my collection : my entire stash of hiphop vinyl and two - thirds of my hiphop CDs ; all of my world - music CDs ( including 16 Fela Kuti and all of my Sublime Frequencies discs ) ; all of my highbrow , 20th - century composer stuff ; my cherished Soul Jazz Records CDs ; my soundtracks ; rare psych - rock LPs by Friendsound ( the LSD - inspired side project by some Paul Revere and the Raiders members ) ; little - known Kraut - rock classics by Exmagma and Et Cetera ; Bernard Szajner 's imaginary soundtrack to Dune done under the moniker Zed ; Kraftwerk 's first three amazing albums , all of which they stubbornly , foolishly refuse to officially reissue ; TONTO 's Expanding Head Band 's Zero Time , with two separate covers ; that sweet 100 Proof ( Aged in Soul ) LP on the Motown composers Holland - Dozier - Holland 's Hot Wax label ....
Someone could open a decent music shop with those fugitive goods — and then promptly go out of business .
Yes , I can get back a lot of the AWOL titles , provided I devote considerable time and money to the endeavor .
Hell , I 've already begun to replenish my collection as thriftily as possible .
I 've been rifling through the used bins at Jive Time , Everyday Music , Wall of Sound , Sonic Boom , and Easy Street with the kind of diligence that would impress DJ Premier .
Also , friends have come through with loans , burns , MP3s , gifts , condolences , and sympathy .
Y ou'd think this would be the opportune time to switch to a more digital approach to music consumption .
It should be , but my analog por vida attitude dies hard .
I can't help thinking that vinyl is the ultimate musical format , with CDs second , and MP3s a distant third .
Daily , hourly , megabytes of great , obscure audio get uploaded to YouTube , the torrent sites , and blogs like Mutant Sounds ( mutant- sounds.blogspot.com ) .
And that 's great for everyone , except maybe for copyright holders .
But I 'm not clever enough to DJ with a YouTube video , and torrent sites often misidentify releases ( which often sound shitty , anyway ) , and , honestly , I do n't want to rip off musicians .
That and the whole physical - artifact factor : I do n't think I 'm alone in thinking that the gatefold double - LP version of Miles Davis 's Bitches Brew will always hold more allure and aesthetic value than that album reduced to 1s and 0s in an iPod .
That being said , I now have over 2,500 songs on my iTunes at work , but they do n't seem like they 're mine so much as my computer's .
And that somehow bothers me .
Were some benefactor to replace all of my missing songs on the planet 's biggest hard drive , I would be grateful , but still would not feel as fulfilled as if I could regain the actual releases .
I 'm firmly in the rearguard with regard to Serato / iPod " upgrading , " and my tragedy has n't nudged me into the 21st century .
Not yet , anyway .
Besides , I 've become addicted to the thrill of the hunt for music .
So much of my life 's been spent in record stores , digging through bins , swapping info with clerks and fellow music nerds ; to stop now would be as hard as a lifelong smoker ditching his cigs in middle age .
So I continue to obsess over musical products , compulsively .
While most people in my circle scheme about getting drunk , high , laid , or by with the least amount of effort , I spend my idle moments figuring out the most efficient way to rebuild my shelves - full of Acid Mothers Temple and Muslimgauze releases — and hundreds of other treasures without which my life seems terribly diminished .
Most ( straight ) guys in my circle try to score pussy ; I strive to re-score Pussy Galore 's Sugarshit Sharp 12 - inch ( okay , and some pussy ; I may be a geek , but I have other needs , too ) .
If anything , my obsession with record collecting has only intensified following this catastrophe .
It 's as if I need to be physically immersed not only in the sounds , but also in the vessels from which they emanate .
I crave the totems that announce to my visitors ( and the world ) that my taste is impeccable .
Sorry , but your thousands of MP3s on your hard drive can't compete with an entire room jammed floor to ceiling with wax .
Anybody can say he digs Nurse with Wound ; but if you show me a shelf in your pad groaning with their releases , you 've earned more respect in my eyes .
S cott Giampino — who books shows at Seattle supper club the Triple Door and DJs soul , funk , and R&B under the name Self - Administered Beatdown — also recently lost the bulk of his long - accruing collection .
In 2004 , his house burned to the ground , and he and his family lost almost everything they owned .
Giampino estimates 2,500 out of 3,000 records were damaged in the blaze .
( Although he notes , " Oddly , virtually all the CDs in the house survived .
Irony ! " )
Eventually , Giampino 's sense of loss diminished , so maybe there 's hope for me .
" I tried and still try to be rather ' Zen ' about the entire owning - objects thing now , " he says .
I dunno :
It 's hard to be Zen when I want to get all Bruce Lee on the mugs responsible for decimating my collection .
" My attitude has changed in the fact that I am much easier to let things go , " Giampino observes .
" I sell way more records now than I used to .
I used to hoard stuff , like any compulsive collector , but now I have a much mellower attitude toward it .
It 's twofold , with one part being , ' Hey , it 's just stuff , easy come easy go , ' and the other part is , ' Hey , if I really need this copy of " insert album title here , " I can pony up the dough and buy it . '
I 'll find it again , the philosophy being : Sure , I have to pay more , but it 's ( usually ) obtainable , somewhere . "
I f anything positive has resulted from my tragic loss , it 's that I 've become more appreciative of what I do have now .
While I will agonize for years over several vanished gems , others will not be mourned , as my memory 's not flawless .
Hell , I 've forgotten about more music than most people have heard or will hear .
That 's not braggadocio , but simply factual reportage of an obsessive - compulsive music critic 's life .
It 's a curse wrapped up in a blessing .
Like many of my ilk , maybe I do view my collection as a bulwark against mortality — or at least a tangible legacy of my existence on earth .
Forget leaving a good - looking corpse ; I want my survivors to gape in awe at shelf upon shelf , crate upon crate of my music stash — a monument to monomania .
It would be nice if they listened to the things , too .
I received this comment yesterday on my post about AIG taking $ 440 K of our bailout money and going to the spa :
Earlier today , AIG announced an important policy change – one that we wanted to be sure you knew about .
A short time ago , our Chairman and CEO Ed Liddy said that he has ordered the immediate cancellation of all outside meetings , conferences , and recognition events across AIG , except those that are required by law or that are deemed absolutely critical to sustain our ongoing business needs .
Given AIG ’s commitment to our customers , business partners , regulators , and American taxpayers , coupled with the new and very different challenges our company now faces , we take these responsibilities extremely seriously .
Their trust is critical to our success .
We recognize the need to be sensitive about all company expenditures .
As we move forward , we will continue to focus our efforts to pay back the $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as quickly as possible .
Yesterday I was talking to some McCain supporters about how they arrived at their preference .
We do n’t see many McCain supporters in my neighborhood , so I always take time to hear their views .
Admittedly my sample is not large , but of the dozen or so McCain supporters I have spoken with , there is a common thread : Obama gives them a vague feeling of discomfort that they can’t quite identify .
When I ask about this vague feeling of discomfort , the answer has something to do with how his views got formed , his past associations , how quickly he rose to prominence , and how charismatic ( slick ) he is .
The risk , as I understand it , is that once in office Obama would start sporting a turban and begin each speech with WAHLALALALALALAL !!!!
He would appoint Supreme Court justices who favor a redistribution of wealth to unborn gay babies , and he ’d legalize crack .
It would all be part of his master plan to destroy America .
I might have the details wrong , but it goes something like that .
It ’s hard to argue against someone ’s vague feeling of discomfort .
After all , studies have shown that people are actually quite good at determining character and intelligence from nothing more than photographs .
I just found it interesting that the people I spoke with described a vague feeling of discomfort in forming their preference .
That is not something I ever heard in other elections .

How to Write a Journal
“ What is a diary as a rule ?
A document useful to the person who keeps it .
Dull to the contemporary who reads it and invaluable to the student , centuries afterwards , who treasures it . ” — Walter Scott
Make a commitment to write journal regularly .
Set up a schedule that suits you and follow it .
Do n’t skip writing sessions if you do n’t know what to write about — just start with a rough paragraph and keep developing it ( see “ Write ” section below ) .
Choose tools that are convenient and inspiring .
For instance , Mémoires ( Mac ) and Journalite ( Windows ) , our journaling software , are simple and effective tools that keep you focused on your journal ’s content , not the application itself .
You ’d want to keep your journal on your computer , and here ’s why :
it ’s searchable ( easy to find everything your wrote about ) ;
secure ( no need to hide anything , just remember your password ) ;
editing and rewriting is easy .
However , you may need a small paper notebook when you ’re away from your computer — try tiny Moleskines or Field Notes .
Just remember to type entries back into your journaling software .
Just write .
Writing is hard , but it becomes easier as you write more .
“ The beginning is the most important part of the work . ” — Plato .
Open your journal , type in a few words — just your thoughts — and you ’ll get into the flow .
You do n’t have to keep your first paragraph — it ’s just for a warm up .
Add photos to your journal .
A picture is worth a thousand words .
We are lucky to live in the age of digital photography — you can take millions of photos at no cost .
Not everything can be described with words , keep some of your pictures in your journal .

Britain 's standards will fall to the lowest level of any major economy in 2009 as recession and the plunging pound take their toll , new research by consultancy Oxford Economics reveals .
As recently as 2007 , Britain was at the top of the heap , with GDP per capita - measured at market exchange rates - exceeding that of America for the first time since the Victorian era .
Consumers rode a decade - long wave of prosperity , snapping up holiday homes in the Dordogne and bargains at Bloomingdale 's store in New York .
But Oxford Economics predicts that in 2009 , with sterling expected to weaken further , and the credit crunch rippling out from the City into the real economy , the UK will slip right to the bottom of the league , with GDP per capita of $ 35,243 ( £ 23,913 ) , compared with $ 46,373 in the US , and $ 41,531 in Germany , and beaten too by Italy , Japan and France .
" The UK was at the centre of the global financial boom and this led to a dramatic improvement in its apparent living standards relative to its peers , but the subsequent bust in financial markets has taken a very heavy toll on the UK , " said Oxford 's director , Adrian Cooper .
Consumers would feel most exposed to the relative fall in their living standards when they travelled abroad , he said , adding " Britons will no longer be among the richest people on the beach " .
His gloomy prognosis comes amid mounting evidence that the credit crunch is taking a heavy toll on jobs and industries far beyond the Square Mile .
Almost half of small firms are drawing up plans to cut staff in the new year , according to an exclusive survey for the Observer carried out by mobile phone company Orange .
Of more than 300 small business owners and managers polled , 43 % said they were expected to lay off workers in the new year , while a third warned that they would ' struggle to cope ' with the downturn in 2009 .
The impact of the financial crisis on the car industry in the UK is also underlined today by figures released to the Observer by the Finance and Leasing Association , which estimates that , in November , the number of loans issued by the finance arms of car manufacturers or dealership slumped by a quarter compared with last year .
The number of loans in October fell by just over a fifth .
As recently as the third quarter of this year , the level of credit extended by car companies and dealerships to consumers had hit a four - year high due to the drying up of availability of other funds traditionally used by consumers to purchase a car - bank loans and savings .
The collapse in forecourt finance deals has exacerbated the slump in new car sales .
Analysts said the availability of credit to buy cars - which the car industry hopes a government rescue package will address - would remain scarce next year .
Richard Lambert , director general of business body the CBI , warned that UK plc must wait until 2010 to see the green shoots of recovery .
' There is no doubt that 2009 is going to be a very tough year for the economy , and for society as a whole , ' he said .
' But there are reasons to hope that by 2010 economic activity is more likely to be expanding than shrinking ...'
His sombre assessment reflects a growing consensus that Chancellor Alistair Darling 's hopes that his £ 20 bn economic rescue package would kick - start recovery by the middle of next year now look wildly optimistic .
After official figures last Thursday showed the economy contracting by a worse - than - expected 0.6 % in the third quarter , analysts have downgraded their forecasts , and postponed the start - date for recovery for two full years .
Bacon Salt was the invention of Dave Lefkow and Justin Esch , two former employees of Seattle startup Jobster .
The idea for Bacon Salt came over dinner one night .
This is how they tell it :
“ While on a business trip together , we had the chance to sit down for dinner and eventually , the conversation turned to our mutual love of bacon .
It was then that Justin told Dave and another coworker named Kara about his idea for Bacon Salt .
Kara , who is a vegetarian , loved the idea .
Dave , a card - carrying carnivore and Midwesterner , loved it even more .
Even the waiter at the fancy restaurant loved it .
” Working in a startup gave them a strong understanding of what was required to get a business off the ground , but venture capital for untried food products is n’t as easy to find as funding for a Facebook application .
Lefkow and Esch needed some seed capital to get the idea rolling , so they turned to the most unlikely source : Amercia ’s Funniest Home Video Show .
A video of Lefkow ’s daughter took home $ 5,000 in prize money , and this kick started the company .
Along with a traditional website and blog , Bacon Salt was promoted strongly across social networks .
Along with Lefkow ’s YouTube account , Bacon Salt created groups on Facebook and MySpace .
Thrown into the mix was a Twitter account and even a Zazzle store .
The aim was to build viral brand awareness while keeping costs low .
None of the accounts I visited had huge numbers , but from what I ’m told , they were enough to plant a viral seed .
Word of Bacon Salt grew , and within 3 months of launching the product Bacon Salt was popping up in the strangest of places .
WWE magazine ran a story on Bacon Salt , along with some mens magazines , PC Gamer and even The New Yorker .
Initially Bacon Salt did n’t have any distribution deals , offering their wares by online order only , but this soon changed as the press continued to build .
What started as a viral internet campaign turned into positive mainstream media coverage , and consumer demand for Bacon Salt in their local supermarkets .

Security correspondent , BBC News
The tribunals used for putting suspects on trial at Guantanamo Bay are a " stain on America 's military " , a former military prosecutor has told the BBC in his first interview since resigning .
For Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld , a devout Catholic , the twin responsibilities of religious faith and military duty led to a profound moral crisis .
His resignation has led to charges against six inmates being dropped , at least for now , and called into question the possibility of a fair legal process at Guantanamo .
" I know so many fighting men and women who are stained by the taint of Guantanamo , so I 'm here to tell the truth about Guantanamo and how a few people have sullied the American military and the constitution , " he told me during an interview in his home town of Erie , Pennsylvania .
It took me too long to recognise that we had abandoned our American values and defiled our constitution
Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld
A reservist , Darrel Vandeveld was called up as a military lawyer after 9/11 and served in Iraq , Bosnia and Africa .
In 2007 , he became a prosecutor for the military commissions which tried terrorist suspects held at Guantanamo Bay , a role he took enthusiastically .
" I went down there on a mission and my mission was to convict as many of these detainees as possible and put them in prison for as long as I possibly could , " he told the BBC .
" I had zero doubts .
I was a true believer . "
But his zeal did not last long .
When he arrived , he says he found the prosecutor 's office in chaos , with boxes scattered around the floor , files disorganised , evidence scattered in different places and no clear chain of command .
And more seriously , he soon discovered that defence lawyers were not receiving information which could help clear their clients , including evidence that suspects had been " mistreated " in order to secure confessions .
Accused of attack
It was one case in particular , that of a young Afghan called Mohammed Jawad , which caused most concern .
Mr Jawad was accused of throwing a grenade at a US military vehicle .
Col Vandeveld says that in a locker he found indisputable evidence that Mr Jawad had been mistreated .
After Mr Jawad had tried to commit suicide by banging his head against a wall at Guantanamo , Col Vandeveld says that psychologists who assisted interrogators advised taking advantage of Mr Jawad 's vulnerability by subjecting him to specialist interrogation techniques known as " fear up " .
He was also placed , Col Vandeveld says , into what was known as the " frequent flyer " programme in which he was moved from cell to cell every few hours , with the aim of preventing him sleeping properly , and securing a confession .
A devout Catholic , Col Vandeveld found himself deeply troubled by what he discovered .
But the classified nature of his work meant he was unable to share his growing doubts with friends and family .

As a result , he took the unusual step of emailing a Jesuit priest called Father John Dear , who is a well known peace activist .
In his email , Col Vandeveld talked of having " grave misgivings " .
Father Dear was initially unsure if the email was serious and fashioned a quick reply .
" I sort of did n't believe it .
But on the off chance he was a military prosecutor I wrote back and said ' quit ' . "
Col Vandeveld says his jaw dropped when he read the email , adding : " I lived in dread of that answer . "
But eventually he did resign and has chosen to speak out about what he saw , giving the BBC his first interview .
" I never suffered such anguish in my life about anything , " he says , looking back over the period .
" It took me too long to recognise that we had abandoned our American values and defiled our constitution . "
Cases dropped Col Vandeveld was prosecuting six cases , including that of Binyam Mohamed , the last British resident held at Guantanamo .
After his resignation , charges in these cases were dropped but with the possibility they may be re-filed at any point .
Col Vandeveld declined to discuss details of Mr Mohamed 's case and others which remain classified .
But Binyam Mohamed 's lawyers say he was tortured as part of the CIA 's extraordinary rendition programme and are hopeful that he may not be charged again , on the grounds that this might reveal too many details of the rendition programme .

Col Vandeveld was forced to undergo a mental status evaluation after expressing his concerns and his military career is over .
But he has returned to his community in Erie where local newspapers have praised the stand he took .
He has no regrets .
In response to his claims , a Pentagon spokesman told the BBC : " We dispute Darrel Vandeveld 's assertions and maintain the military commission process provides full and fair trials to accused unlawful enemy combatants who are charged with a variety of war crimes . "
President - elect Barack Obama has said he wants to shut Guantanamo but no - one thinks it will be easy .
Col Vandeveld believes that it is possible though .
" No justice will be obtained at Guantanamo , " he said .
" And if that entails moving them ( the suspects ) temporarily to the US for trial : so be it . "

Take a simple PHP trick and follow it on a huge tangent to the philosophy of good web architecture .
It 's an honor to be asked to share my ideas with the PHP community .
When Chris and Sean asked me to write an article for PHP Advent , I had to accept .
Like last year , this article will be quite long .
If you need something short and sweet like the other advent articles , you can just read the first section .
But , if you read it all , there might be a worthwhile concept buried in this logorrhea .
Funky caching
Funky caching is an obscure trick often attributed to Rasmus but actually invented by Stig .
It is also known as the ErrorDocument trick , Smarter Caching , and Rasmus 's Trick .
It was first presented by PHP creator Rasmus Lerdorf in his fun Tips and Tricks talk .
It entails the following :
First you create an ErrorDocument line in your httpd.conf :
ErrorDocument 404 /error.php
This tells the web server to redirect all missing files to error .
php in your directory root .
The following listing provides an example error.php :
<?php $ filepath = parse_url ($_SERVER [ ' REQUEST_URI ' ] , PHP_URL_PATH ) ; // or $ _SERVER [ ' REDIRECT_URL '] $ basepath = dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
DIR_SEP ; //
Test to see if you can work with it . if ( FALSE ) { // EDIT include ' 404.html ' ; // See http://alistapart.com/articles/perfect404 for tips .
return ; } // Generate the file .
// EDIT $ data = ' something ' ; //
Send a 200 instead of a 404 . header ( sprintf ( ' %s 200 ' , $ _SERVER [ ' SERVER_PROTOCOL ' ] ) ) ; echo $ data ; //
Store the page to avoid ErrorDocument on the next request .
Use a // temp file with a link trick to avoid race conditions .
$ tmpfile = tempnam ( $ basepath . ' tmp ' , ' fc ' ) ; $ fp = fopen ( $ tmpfile , 'w ' ) ; fputs ( $ fp , $ data ) ; fclose ( $ fp ) ; @link ( $ basepath .
$ filepath , $ tmpfile ) ; // Suppress errors caused by losing race .
unlink ( $ tmpfile ) ; ?>
Other than the two lines commented with EDIT , the code above is pretty canonical .
What does this trick do ?
Basically , when a file does n't exist , PHP can create the data and return it instead of a 404 .
This is when the magic happens .
It places the generated file in its proper location under document root .
Thus , the next request to the same resource does n't invoke the ErrorDocument handle ; the resource is served directly by the web server henceforth .
This is truly PHP without PHP .
Words have meaning through paradigm
The foundation of Steve McConnell 's seminal text , Code Complete , was that software development should be based around the paradigm of construction .
That was fundamentally flawed because of the mythical man-month — the man - month term itself originally comes from construction work .
We now know McConnell is wrong and software is n't construction , it 's engineering .
We 're called software engineers , not software workers .
My title at Tagged is currently software architect .
And I have a " radical " idea that maybe titles are that way because they mean something .
Meaning that if I 'm hired as a software architect , then I should think like an architect and find my inspiration from architecture .
Fallingwater
Nestled along a creek in the woods of southwestern Pennsylvania is a house with angular features that are cantilevered 40 feet above a waterfall .
This was the summer home of the Kaufmann family , owners of a Pittsburgh department store that 's now part of Macy's .
( I remember this store well , because I spent many days in a neighboring newsstand reading issues of MAD magazine and Cracked . )
When I was a kid , my dad took us to visit the place , and I became one of millions of visitors to Fallingwater , a home that was hailed by Time Magazine on its inception and became known as the quintessential example of the organic architecture of architect Frank Lloyd Wright .
Why is Fallingwater , a summer home for a Pittsburgh family , so obviously beautiful that hundreds of thousands make the trek ( 50 miles from the nearest city ) each year , it was voted best all - time work of American architecture in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects , and pictures of it are as instantly recognizable as any natural wonder ?
Maybe it'd be enlightening to consider how Frank Lloyd Wright built it .
Before he started , he commissioned a survey of the entire topography around the waterfall and had them include all trees and boulders .
He then came up with an idea of a cantilevered house that would stretch in a manner that would look like it floated in air above the waterfall .
Perhaps the following details are more important :
From details like these to the whole view taken in at once , one gets a feeling that , in spite of the sharp horizontal and vertical lines of the building , the whole lives in harmony with its environment " instead of lording above [ it ] in an isolated spot as a man-made imposition . "
Frank Lloyd Wright designed on the principles of " organic , democratic , plasticity , continuity . "
We can see how this example holds true to these values .
Could this building have been built anywhere else ?
Why is funky caching so prevalent in the PHP world ?
If you look at funky caching , it does n't need PHP to implement it .
This begs the question as to why it first appeared .
Why is this obscure design pattern so ubiquitous in the PHP world ?
In fact , you , as a PHP developer , use it every day when you visit PHP.
net and visit a page like http://php.net/strstr to figure out the order of the needle in the haystack .
A cynic would say , because PHP is so slow to execute , it needs solutions like this to perform well .
The problem with this argument is that no single web language outperforms the fastest static servers out there , or even come close to the slow ones .
There is no web language that would n't benefit from this trick .
But there is truth to the cynic 's statement .
The PHP world may have discovered this first because it trades off speed of execution with speed and ease of development .
As Andrei mentioned earlier , that is fundamental to its design .
In fact , all dynamically - typed scripting languages make this tradeoff .
The ubiquity of this trick in the PHP world is because it — like Frank Lloyd Wright 's Fallingwater — lives in harmony with its environment .
The environment is an Apache web server , persistent data store in the form of a relational database , and the demands of large - scale , consumer - facing web sites .
Would this solution exist without an ErrorDocument handler built into Apache ?
Would this solution exist if we did n't persist content on a ( relatively ) slow data store like a database ?
Would this solution exist if the consumer did n't demand millisecond response time for dynamic content ?
Funky caching in the PHP world lives in harmony with that environment .
It lives in harmony with PHP itself .
The architectural principles of PHP
PHP is a language that is designed to solve the web problem .
PHP is a component of web architecture as Maggie mentioned earlier .
Without Apache serving it , without a database backing it , without the demands of the Web behind it , without thousands of hosting sites installing it , without hundreds of open source packages written in it , it would be useless .
The language , like Fallingwater , is customized for the problem at hand and compliments the environment in which it lives .
Just like Wright 's design lives true to his principles , so does PHP and its solutions live true to its principles : " cheap , scalable , pragmatic . "
When using PHP , let us not forget PHP's three principles that attract us to the language in the first place :
Cheap ( developer time and resources ) : " A project done in Java will cost 5 times as much , take twice as long , and be harder to maintain than a project done in a scripting language such as PHP or Perl . "
— Phillip Greenspun Scalable ( shared - nothing architecture ) : " That a Java servlet performs better than a PHP script , under optimal conditions [ has ] nothing to do with scalability .
The point is can your application continue to deliver consistent performance as volume increases .
PHP delegates all the ' hard stuff ' to other systems . "
— Harry Fuecks Pragmatic ( designed to solve the web problem ) : " PHP is not about purity in CS principles or architecture ; it is about solving the ugly web problem with an admittedly ugly , but extremely functional and convenient solution .
If you are looking for purity , you are in the wrong boat .
Get out now before you get hit by a wet cat ! " — Rasmus Lerdorf
Could this " ugly , but extremely functional and convenient " web language have been built to solve anything other than the ugly web problem ?
Bellefield Tower
One block from where my mother used to work , on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Bellefield in Pittsburgh , stands a strange sight .
A very modern building wraps around in a Jobsian - loving rounded rectangle , narrowly avoiding a gothic Romanesque tower a century its senior .
An uglier and more out - of - place architectural juxtaposition I have never seen .
If you were n’t in Pittsburgh in the late 1980s , you would n't understand how his could have happened .
On this ground once stood the original Bellefield church , built in the 1880s .
Since its congregation had been moved farther down Fifth Avenue , the building was sold a century later to developers trying to exploit the new business attracted by the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and the joint CMU / Pitt software building .
They wanted to level it and build a new building , but were blocked when people mobilized to save the old tower .
The developer then proceeded to honor this by demolishing everything but the tower and building the ironically - named " Bellefield Towers " next to it .
You can see the current Bellefield Presbyterian Church as a common example of the gothic architecture of the area .
You can also note the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the Cathedral of Learning — both next door , both reflecting the gothic Romanesque architecture , and both figuring prominently in iconic photos of the most famous game in baseball .
Why is Bellefield Towers so obviously ugly ?
The old Bellefield Church tower stands next to Bellefield Towers with a sawed - off quality to it .
The curved , modern architecture of the latter serves only to emphasize how it was built with no consideration of the surrounding environment .
The Oakland and Shadyside areas of the city that the old Bellefield Church straddled contain many unique examples of Romanesque gothic architecture .
When faced with a gorgeous 100 year old example of the area 's architecture , instead of working with the environment like Frank Lloyd Wright did with Fallingwater — in the same area of Pennsylvania no less !
— the developer simply sawed it off !
I remember watching it happen , and this literal architectural lesson guides me to this day about the follies of architectural hubris in software .
What hubris ?
Have you ever seen developers write code without considering the environment in which the code will live ?
I guess my big beef with most frameworks is that they 're often written with no consideration of the environment — that is almost by definition .
The best frameworks are ones that are less frameworks than applications which force constraints of an environment .
As Paul mentioned earlier , even if you build it your way and customize the solution for your application , it 's still a framework .
But it 's a framework most likely to have at least one successful user .
You .
" I 'm a developer .
I can make the software conform to my needs . "
Oh really ?
That sounds a lot like trying to " lord over the environment with an isolated man-made imposition . "
" But what I mean is it 's all man -made in software .
There is no environment . "
You do n't develop in a community as Chris mentioned earlier ?
That ’s environment .
You never took over a project you did n't write or worked at a company with a pre-existing code base ?
That 's environment .
You never dealt with an installation problem because your host was configured differently than your development environment ?
That 's environment .
You never had business needs trump the little feature creature sitting on your shoulder ?
That 's environment .
You 've never listened to a user request , as Paul mentioned earlier ?
That 's environment .
" There is no danger of that environment being different . "
When I joined my current company , they had a couple of services written in Java , only Zend Accelerator could opcode cache their PHP 4 installation , Oracle RAC powered the back - end , and engineers developed while working in cubes with a relatively heavyweight waterfall development process .
Although I prefer Python to Java for services , we 've increased our Java development to almost half of our code base !
Although I prefer MySQL to Oracle , we still use Oracle as our back - end .
Even the transition to the open office occurred after it became apparent the company had outgrown cubes .
Why ?
Because your solutions have to work within the environment .
Anything else is architectural hubris .
" But that 's not an architecture decision . "
Let 's say it is the early days of social networking , and you join a company that is using Java / J2EE instead of PHP , or Oracle instead of MySQL , or they 're using Perl / Mason instead of your favorite ( PHP ) framework , as Marco mentioned earlier — there are so many to choose from that the number is second only to Java .
Do you go in and say your experience building a CMS or online store trumps their experience working on a nascent social network ?
Do you replace all the Java engineers with PHP ones ?
Do you replace MySQL with Oracle ?
Do you rewrite the site from scratch using your favorite framework ?
These things and more have happened .
" So you 're always right ? "
I 'm not saying that in all these instances these architects should n't have made the decisions they did .
I am not qualified to answer that .
What I do know is that in the vast majority of cases , people went in without considering the existing environment .
I do know the dynamics of a Facebook is different from the dynamics of GameSpot or Amazon .
I do know a social network is different from a CMS or online store .
And all these solutions are very different from ones in the enterprise .
Like building Fallingwater without getting an adequate survey done , every day people make the mistake of not looking before acting .
They try to make PHP look like Java with dollar signs , as Luke mentioned earlier .
They expected the environment to conform to their reality so they can lord over it with " some isolated man-made imposition . "
And in those cases , you 're more likely to build a Bellefield Towers than a Fallingwater .
The Golden Gate Bridge
I 've long since moved from the woods of Western Pennsylvania to the San Francisco Peninsula .
I am fortunate that my weekly run passes with a near - constant view of the most recognizable architecture in the American West :
What 's interesting is that there are much longer spans in the country and the world .
Even in the same city , there exists a beautiful bridge that is both longer and of more utility .
And yet this bridge represents the icon of San Francisco and the state as a whole .
Why ?
I ’m not sure , but consider these things :
The original design was for a hybrid cantilever and suspension structure .
But , it was replaced with a pure suspension design because the former was deemed too ugly .
A pure suspension of this length had never been attempted before .
Irving Morrow designed the bridge tower , lighting , and pedestrian walkways with an entirely Art Deco decorative influence .
The bridge was painted in a specially formulated anti-rust paint in International Orange on demand from locals .
Think a moment about any of those design decisions .
Each of them , along with the building of the structure in the first place , was fought as an uphill battle against economists , the rail lines , engineers , The War Department , and others .
The Navy alone originally demanded it be painted black with yellow stripes to assure visibility with passing ships .
Can you imagine that ?
I run by or cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge once a week at all times of day in all weather conditions , and , whether seen from the north side or the south , from the east or the west , I 'm struck by the salient fact that it is iconic because the rust - colored , suspension - only Art Deco structure is just right for the environment it is in .
The rust - colored paint evokes the hills of Marin to the north as well as the setting sun .
It is natural and visible enough to be safe .
It becomes an icon .
Every week , I pass by it and am inspired and thankful I can live in such a beautiful city .
The design pattern
To me , the most salient point of a design pattern comes from its original definition .
From Christopher Alexander 's book on architecture , The Timeless Way of Building :
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core of the solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice .
So , if funky caching is a design pattern , then it too can be used a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice .
How are we to know which way to do it , or even if it is the right pattern to be using in our situation ?
The answer is found in how both a house in Pennsylvania and a bridge in San Francisco represent ultimate expressions of architecture .
They are wholly appropriate for the environment in which they stand .
When choosing between a singleton and a global variable , which pattern to use is determined by the environment .
A cantilever is wholey appropriate to create the floating look of Fallingwater , but that same pattern would disrupted the naturalness of the Golden Gate Bridge .
So too must the solutions that use funky caching ( or PHP in general ) be wholly appropriate for the problem at hand .
In Rasmus 's original talk , he suggests that this solution can also be used to search for the closest matching valid URL and redirect , or use the attempted URL text as a DB lookup .
We can see PHP .
net 's solution outlined right there !
At Plaxo , we had the problem where images are stored in the database but need to be generated in multiple sizes and thumbnails and streamed fast to the user .
Databases are slow , lumbering stores .
The solution was funky caching :
Recently , Tagged has run across the very same performance ( size and number ) issues with JavaScript that Helgi mentioned earlier .
The solution : funky caching hooked up to a JavaScript compressor powered by a Java service back - end to dynamically catenate and compress JavaScript into a unique URL on demand .
We recently imported 1/64th of our production data over to the staging environment for testing , but the users ' images would take too much time and disk space to import .
We could just link the images , but then testers did n't know which ones they uploaded and which ones were proxied from the live website .
The solution was to spend an hour writing a funky caching proxy .
If the image was missing , the ErrorDocument handler would try to grab the image from the production web site and add a watermark .
Here is the complete code .
Since this is only for testing , there is no need to waste disk space by storing the created file .
The performance hit of real - time generation of redundant requests is unnoticeable to QA .
<?php $ watermark = ' 3129080702_c4e76f71d7_o.png ' ; $ dead_url = ' http://example.com/dead_image.png'; // {{{ start_image ( $ filename , &$ data ) /** * Creates a gd handle for a valid file * @param $ filename string the file to get * @param $ data array the imagesize * @return resource GD handle */ function start_image ( $ filename , &$ data ) { $ data = @getimagesize ( $ filename ) ; if ( empty ( $ data ) ) { return null ; } $ data [ ' ratio ' ] = $ data [ 0 ] / $ data [ 1 ] ; switch ( $ data [ 2 ] ) { case IMG_GIF : return imagecreatefromgif ( $ filename ) ; case 3 : // Problem where IMG_PNG is not bound correctly for my install .
:-( case IMG_PNG : return imagecreatefrompng ( $ filename ) ; case IMG_JPG : return imagecreatefromjpeg ( $ filename ) ; case IMG_WBMP : return imagecreatefromwbmp( $ filename ) ; case IMG_XPM : return imagecreatefromxbm ( $ filename ) ; } return null ; } // }}} $ requestimg = $ _SERVER [ ' REDIRECT_URL ' ] ; if (!$ _SERVER [ ' QUERY_STRING ' ] ) { //
Redirect user to invalid image .
tag_http::redirect($ dead_url ) ; return ''; } // Grab image to temp .
{{{ $ ch = curl_init( $_SERVER [ ' QUERY_STRING ' ] ) ; $ tempfile = tempnam ( ' / tmp ' , ' prod_remote_ ' ) ; $ fp = fopen ( $ tempfile , 'w ' ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_FILE , $ fp ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_HEADER , 0 ) ; curl_exec ( $ch ) ; curl_close ( $ch ) ; fclose ( $ fp ) ; // }}} // Configure image and dimensions .
{ {{ $ size_data = array ( ) ; $ im = start_image ( $ tempfile , $ size_data ) ; if ( ! $ im ) { unlink ( $ tempfile ) ; tag_http ::redirect( $ dead_url ) ; return ; } // }}} //
Get watermark information .
{ {{ $ wm_data = array ( ) ; $ wm = start_image ( $ watermark , $ wm_data ) ; if ( ! $ wm ) { unlink ( $ tempfile ) ; tag_http :: redirect ( $ dead_url ) ; return ; } // }}} //
Add watermark .
{{{ if ( $ size_data [ ' ratio ' ] > $ wm_data [ ' ratio ' ] ) { //
Image is wider than the watermark .
$ new_smaller_dim = $ wm_data [ 0 ] * ( $ size_data [ 1 ] / $wm_data [ 1 ] ) ; $ dst_x = ( $ size_data [ 0 ] - $ new_smaller_dim ) /2 ; $ dst_y = 0 ; $ dst_w = $ new_smaller_dim ; $ dst_h = $ size_data [ 1 ] ; } else { //
Image is taller than the watermark .
$ new_smaller_dim = $ wm_data [ 1 ] * ( $ size_data [0 ] / $wm_data [ 0 ] ) ; $ dst_x = 0 ; $ dst_y = ( $ size_data [ 1 ] - $ new_smaller_dim ) /2 ; $ dst_w = $ size_data [ 0 ] ; $ dst_h = $ new_smaller_dim ; ; } imagecopyresized ( $ im , $ wm , $ dst_x , $ dst_y , 0 , 0 , $ dst_w , $ dst_h , $ wm_data [ 0 ] , $ wm_data [ 1 ] ) ; header ( sprintf ( ' %s 200 ' , $ _SERVER [ ' SERVER_PROTOCOL ' ] ) ) ; header ( sprintf ( ' Content - Type : %s ' , $size_data [ ' mime ' ] ) ) ; // }}} switch ( $ size_data [ 2 ] ) { case IMG_GIF : imagegif ( $ im ) ; break ; case 3 : case IMG_PNG : imagepng ( $im ) ; break ; case IMG_JPG : imagejpeg ( $im ) ; break ; case IMG_WBMP : imagewbmp ( $im ) ; break ; case IMG_XPM : imagexbm ( $im ) ; break ; } imagedestroy ( $ wm ) ; imagedestroy ( $ im ) ; unlink ( $ tempfile ) ; ?>
With a bit of creativity , this concept can apply to modern applications where , instead of caching on the filesystem , you cache in memcache ; instead of bypassing the application server , you bypass the web servers themselves with a CDN ; instead of serving static content from the edge , you serve dynamic pages .
Whether to use it and how to use it is always determined by the environment .
Comments
I hope this tour helps you see software development in a different way — that finding solutions are about using the right solution in a manner that fits with the environment .
Even when we do , I do n't think we can architect structures that work as harmoniously together as a city such as San Francisco :
But one can always hope . :-)
Happy Holidays from me and the PHP community to you and yours .

" By Voiding Equal Protection , Prop 8 Could Threaten Rights of Minorities Nationwide "

... Helldigger said on 11/25/2008 @ 6:28 pm PT ...
“ In their outreach to blacks , Latino , Asians and other minority voters , the conservative operatives behind Proposition 8 neglected to mention a key aspect of the initiative that could contribute to rolling back minority rights for years to come . ”
I have heard some stupid things in my long lifetime , but that statement has to be in the bottom feeder hall of fame .
The California Constitutional change became necessary to curb exuberant fringe radical judges from creating laws pertaining to the definition of marriage which ignores DOMA law and the will of the voters .
The electorate had already mandated marriage be considered only when one man and one woman wed by majority vote .
The California Supreme Court whack jobs misinterpreted that to mean equal protection was ignored and proceeded to make their own law and allow SSM to occur .
The voters were forced to do what 30 other states have done and amend their State Constitution to solidify the definition of marriage by voting again and winning again .
The definition of marriage in the constitution strengthens equal protection for all by establishing a definition that can not be misconstrued .
This gives minorities and other groups a stronger constitution and greater protection in the future from groups like the gay agenda from taking their protections away and maligning marriage rights in the future .
Minorities and other groups are ecstatic about keeping judges from subverting long held historic rights such as the right for everyone to marry as man and wife , and their protections are much stronger now that Prop 8 has passed .
The radical left wing agenda has forgotten to mention that , now that prop 8 has passed , we are all better off .

Gay rights is a civil rights issue .
The same arguments being used by anti-gay civil rights activists were used against ' race mixing ' ; used against mixed race marriage , the integration of the armed forces and sports by blacks and women and well , you know , if you 've actually had the luxury of observing the last 50 years of civil rights struggles as your posting alluded to .
I have and you are just plain wrong in your view regarding gays .
Not mistaken , morally wrong .
You legitimize your bigotry using the flag of religion , same as the bigots that wanted blacks forever relegated to ' door sitting ' and women relegated to kitchens and bedrooms .
Even now , you would n't have the courage regarding marriage to say about black people or other minorities of color what you say about gays , though people like you used the same fairy tales to argue against inter-racial marriage .
Your arguments are old and as morally corrupt as they always were .
You 're just a bigot .
Different year + different target for your bigotry is all .
You and people like you are running out of targets as the world passes you by but still , shame on you .
The virtue of judges doing their job in applying the Constitution is that social Darwinism does n't have to come into play .
I recall cities burning on more than one occasion , the last one not so long ago .
When justice for specific groups is lacking , when equal protection under the law ( 14 Amendment I think ) is withheld the only recourse those minorities have is to demonstrate their ' legitimacy ' by exerting a threat against the discriminatory majority .
It gets their attention .
I do n't have a problem with that .
Never have .
I always came down on the side of the domestic insurgents .
If , as a posting of yours on a different thread alluded , you are disturbed by the rising militancy of gay people then maybe you need to get out of the path to their civil rights and respect the evolution of civil society .
Like the song says " if you can't lend a hand then get out of the way , ' cause the times they are a changing " .
Yea , just get out of the way and let judges do their job .
I 'm not debating you , I do n't want your input , wo n't read any replies by you , think you do n't have anything worth considering and think you 're part of the problem .
I do n't know why you 're here except to divert attention and be a troll .
I 'm just saying ...

I think that most intelligent people know that there is no such thing as a " gay agenda . "
It 's a myth that the rabid right - wing in our society like to keep trotting out there .
Equality for all is the only agenda for people of integrity and fairness .
In addition , those who were opposed to Prop H8 were not of a " radical left wing agenda " as the thick people who support Prop H8 like to lie and say .
The people opposed to Prop H8 were ( and are ) people who believe in equality and fairness and who are comfortable with their own sexuality .
I have a relative who has been a staunch Bush Republican the entire time that man has illegitimately occupied the White House due to " activist , radical right - wing whack - job " justices on the Supreme Court .
My relative told me that she voted against Prop H8 .
She is no " radical left winger " by any means .
Some of her rabid Bush friends voted for it .
She said she tried to educate them but they could n't see past the lies in the television commercials .
And from my experience , those who are comfortable with themselves and their own sexuality were / are opposed to Prop H8 .
They saw it for what it is : Hate .
Those who were / are vehemently for Prop H8 need to seriously examine themselves and their own sexuality .
I suspect some / many of its rabid supporters are trying to hide their own gay / lesbian feelings which is often the case in this context .
If one wants to protect the so - called " sanctity of marriage " there is one way to do it : BAN DIVORCE .
But of course the thick proponents of Prop H8 never say that and they even refuse to address it .
They also refuse to answer the question :
How to two gay men or two lesbians getting married destroy someone else 's marriage ?
They refuse to answer it because they can't .
The reality is no one --- regardless of one 's sexual orientation --- can destroy someone else 's marriage .
Only YOU can do that yourself to your own marriage by getting DIVORCED .
Period .

Without first recinding the equal protection clause of California 's Constitution on Equal protection , it still must stand as a more encompassing set of rights than the ban that was passed .
In that then these two conflict , I cannot imagine the torured logic necessay to allow the latest measure to be judged by the California Supreme Court to have any validity .

Interesting how these over worded legal speak , crap ass measures and propositions even get on the ballot in their current form .
If I proposition you to give me cocaine I 'd be arrested , If I proposition you to make cocaine illegal , I am blessed .
With all the money being stolen right now , loosing equal protection will be the least of our worries pretty soon .
( My personal opinion is the money never existed , and it 's time for indictments )
How is it that you or I can not transfer five freaking grand from our bank accounts without a FBI red flag thinking we are some kind of frigging terrorist and denying us until the FBI / Terrorist / Red flag is lifted ?
Yet trillions of dollars are being tossed around with absolutely zero oversight .
Any terrorist money there ?
You do n't know ?
You do n't need your security clearance anymore , or your job then !!!
The votes for prop 8 were validated ?
By who ?
Or whom , is it a machine ?
And Voted
On an electronic machine put there by who ? by who ?
Who put the machine there ?
Who validated the results ?
Or did Bowen outlaw electronics ?
As a citizen I do n't even know anymore .
I ( after drinking 3 beers ) can't find it on their website !!
And I am supposed to know how to search !!
I get the feeling that the electronic vote tabulation devices were quietly re-introduced since the " Big TEST ™ "
And then the marriage part .
You church do n't like marrying gays ?
Don't , Screwy your backwards ass church .
But Separate the CHURCH from the STATE .
" By the Powers Invested In Me By The State Of California " is different that " By The Powers Invested In Me By Satan , or GOD , or " IT " , or whatever your stupid religion is "
There are forces going on here hidden behind the scenes that need BRIGHT LIGHT on them .
HINT : Military Industrial Complex
Just boycotting them is n't enough .
We need indictments , and confiscation and jail .
My opinion is we are running out of time .
Do n't do nothing stupid .
Hear my words :
Do n't do nothing stupid .
But what are we going to do , we are cut off from the feedback .
Even I wrote Obama 's Change.gov , and I am willing to give him time to change things , I do n't know where my head will be at if things get much worse .
Yet at the same time KNOWING THAT 65 Trillion bucks are stolen , things MUST GET WORSE .
I like to step back away from the planet .
Kinda like the International Space Station .
Look at the Big Picture .
There 's the SAME PEOPLE that are stealing , go after them .
They are the true financial terrorists .
I hope Obama Reads this and then tracks down my feedback .
More and more people are starting to get the truth : " The FED " is unlawful .
And not Federal "
How is it someone can get busted with meth and show an ID card and the COPS go away ?
Answer that , and I think we have the beginning of the answer of why we are where we are now .

Well , I read your comments and I understood what you said and where you 're coming from .
However , I would n't put too much stock in the Pope of Hope / Chairman of Change that he even cares what you ( or I ) think because day - by - day it looks like Obama 's " change we can believe in " marketing ploy was just that , as some of us suggested at the time .
It was intended to fool those who were willing to allow themselves to be duped / fooled , once again , mind you .
I studied the Pope of Hope 's Bush - accomplice voting record and neocon rhetoric so none of his appointments so far surprise me .
I voted for Nader / Gonzalez because I wanted / want real , true change .
From a realistic perspective ( versus a wishful - thinking / false hope perspective ) I find it difficult to comprehend that much legitimate , substantive " change " will occur with these " establishment " people he 's stacking the place with .
As the World Socialists write : " Barack Obama ’s vague campaign promises of “ change ” are rapidly evaporating as the key positions in the next administration are filled with veterans of the US political establishment .
Far from ending war abroad and social reaction at home , Obama ’s choices underline the essential continuity with the policies of the Bush administration . "

To put it all in perspective , especially those who believe EVERY ( translated ) word in the bible , read this open letter to Dr Laura ( Who says homosexuality is an abomination , according to Leviticus 18:22 , and cannot be condoned under any circumstance ) asking for advice regarding gods laws .

I do n't agree .
Can you settle this ?
Are there ' degrees ' of abomination ?
Questions
We have had SSM in Ontario , supported by ON Catholic Bishops no less , since 03 and legal across Canada since 2005 .
Married , heterosexuals , are still getting divorced , ( 50 % ) still abusing , abandoning their children ... same as it ever was .
I have asked the question , how does SSM hurt " marriage " ?
How would / did it affect Britney 's two day marriage ?
Never get an answer .
Just some reply like , " Oh next they will be allowing you to marry your pet .

Rights retained by the people such as the right to keep marriage between and man and a woman shall not be denied .
If Prop 8 had failed , the 9th amendment would have trumped it , and marriage would still be the union of bride and groom and only that union .
“ Gay rights is a civil rights issue . ”
There are no gay rights or straight rights .
Under our constitution we are afforded the same rights regardless of sexual preference .
Rights based on sexual preference would be “ SPECIAL RIGHTS ” .
Civil rights : “ Those rights which are considered to be unquestionable ; deserved by all people under all circumstances , especially without regard to race , creed , color or gender ”
We all deserve to keep marriage the union of one man and one woman , under all circumstances without regard to race creed color or gender .
Civil rights :
“ The privileges allowed by law to individuals that include free speech , the guarantee of equality and the power to vote . ”

Er ... 99 ... you do understand , do n't you , that it was never this persons intent to engage in " reason " ... or even " trolling " ?
Their purpose was and is to constantly inject wingnut talking points on this issue into a web venue where they think they can get away with it .
Inflaming the outrage of their opponents is a welcome side - effect , but the real game is listing and re-listing the propagandized talking points in a public venue regardless of facts or logic ... or anything else .

I do indeed realize that , zap .
I have tried to take it up with Brad a few times , but he has this mania for free speech ... which is , I 'm certain , really a form of lexical machismo , wanting to show his ability to stand up against the vilest assaults .
But ... dammit ...
I 'm the one who ends up having to stand up against them , even when I do n't chime in .
I gotta read this stuff to make sure things do n't go off the rails , and I have become an authority on the different varieties of trolls , some of whom , this one , might as easily be called a " wingnut believer " or a " talking points bot " and we 're lousy with them around here .
If Brad were not always on fire and could pay some sustained attention , I 'm sure he'd begin to get the drift , but ... well ... he 's a little weird ....
So , my way of dealing with it is that I put up with it until I feel myself on the verge of going postal and then my foot goes all the way down .
It seems to work okay .
So far .
It 's actually instructive to see where the talking points bots show up .
Mention Bobby Junior and bip bam ... also Al Gore , of course , and other items .
You can see the stuff they fear the very most , and you can see when the word comes down that they fear it the very most ... unerringly the talking points bots pop up .
With this issue , it 's got to stop .
It 's NOT an issue .
I do n't give a fuck how many people have issues with it .
It could not be clearer and the polemic is only prolonging the agony and the political advantage of PIGS .

It is imperative that we recognize that the separation of Church and state is vital to protecting the beliefs of everyone .
The moment we as a society try to prevent a certain group from excercising their beliefs is the moment we all lose freedom .
If two , or even several , people want to declare their commitment to each other in a way which suits their beliefs , who are we to dictate to them whether they can do that or not ?

For years , California voters have been taking away State constitutional rights through simple - majority initiatives .
That was fine with these city attorney 's offices , because the rights were criminal procedural rights , like protections against search and seizure .
Now that the issue is same - sex marriage , these folks are complaining that this will allow the majority to persecute minorities .

The deal is a reminder of how business was done before the credit crunch
The biggest takeover in Canada 's history has collapsed on the day it was supposed to have been completed .
A group led by Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board had agreed to buy BCE , owner of Bell Canada , for Canadian $ 34.8 bn ( $ 27.8bn ; £ 18.6 bn ) in June 2007 .
But the accountants KPMG said last night the company would fail solvency tests because it had too much debt .
It is good news for the banks that had agreed to provide the $ 35 bn ( £ 23 bn ) of debt to finance the deal .
One of the conditions for closing the deal was receiving an independent solvency opinion .
The buy - out deal was done just before the credit crunch made such agreements all but impossible , because banks that were struggling with their own liquidity problems were reluctant to loan the huge amounts of cash needed .
Citigroup was due to provide $ 11bn of the funding , with Royal Bank of Scotland , Deutsche Bank and Toronto - Dominion Bank funding the rest .
No termination fee will be paid by either side .
BCE has more than 54,000 staff and is Canada 's largest communications company .
As well as telephone and internet business , it has an interest in CTVglobemedia , Canada 's premier media company , which owns the Globe and Mail newspaper .

Nothing really substantive to talk about so I 'll spur the speculation .
Remember the 2004 Presidential debate between John Kerry and George Bush where an image of a purported audio device could vaguely be seen under Bush 's suit .
There appears to be a similar image , but this time with Sarah Palin at the recent VP debate .
In a few screenshots a wire - ish looking device can be seen protruding over her right shoulder .
I tend to disbelieve these claims but two pseudo looking audio devices in two consecutive presidential elections makes me question my first and probably correct notion .
I ’m about to share with you the most humiliating moment of my life .
This morning something deeply disturbing happened to my 13 year - old nephew , Christopher .
He got a text message , which had been forwarded around from person to person , from one of his best friends , a girl we ’ll call Ashley .
It went something like this :
America has elected a nigger .
Today in school show your support for the KKK by refusinshookg to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance .
Christopher lives in Alabama , where this kind of ignorance is n’t terribly hard to find , and he ’s a bit more advanced than some of his classmates where racial issues are concerned .
He grew up in Charlotte ( and NC urban areas are a lot more progressive than the outback ) , has always had black and biracial friends , and like so many kids of his generation he simply does n’t see race as a big deal .
He ’s not blind to the fact that racism exists , of course , but it ’s never been a factor in his personal life .
A couple years ago , though , my sister and her family moved to Huntsville , and she reports that things are very different on the cultural front .
Christopher was beside himself .
When he saw the message he told his mother that he thought he was going to be sick , and when I talked to him a few minutes later he was obviously shaken .
He could n’t believe that Ashley , someone that his whole family really likes ( my sister says she ’s almost become family ) , would pass something like that on .
He was going to talk to her , when he got to school , to see if she even had any idea about what she had done .
You know kids , you know school , you know what it was to be that age .
We all did appalling things , and maybe this is a case where a fundamentally good girl did something simply because she did n’t grasp what it meant .
Christopher wants to make sure she understands some things about the Klan – he does n’t think the kids in his school really know what it is – and he wants her to understand the group ’s history , to understand things like church bombings and the struggle for civil rights .
Christopher understands how remarkable last night was : a black man elected president , when not very long ago – during his parents ’ lives , in fact – a black man had to drink from a separate water fountain , sit in the back of a bus , and so on .
Those who know me and read me realize that I not only write about racism in America , I go after it with an almost feral passion .
In fact , some have n’t fully understood my methods – not that they do n’t get why I think it ’s important , but they have perceived in my writing something they could n’t quite explain .
Maybe it ’s the language I use , maybe it ’s my tone , maybe it ’s a vehemence that seems a little more than they can explain , I ca n’t really say .
But I have been questioned about it , and before this moment I ’ve never provided the real answer .
There is a story , though , and it ’s a painful one that I ’ve been carrying around for 30 years .
I attended Ledford High School in Thomasville , NC .
We were located in a very white corner of Davidson County , which yesterday voted 2 - 1 for McCain .
Ledford had around 900 students .
We were very white , very Protestant , and very prejudiced in just about every way possible .
LHS had no Jews that I knew of and only a couple kids who ’d admit to being Catholic .
Maybe five of my fellow students were black .
It was the late ’70s and enlightenment had not yet established much of a foothold in northern Davidson County .
Everybody was racist because that ’s just how it was .
I was a typically insecure kid who had no damned clue who I was or how I fit in .
Even though I was smart and comparatively well actualized compared to a lot of my classmates , I was still a product of and captive of the place , the time , the culture .
( Before I go any further , let me make something clear .
I ’m explaining what I was and why , but I am not excusing myself . )
One afternoon a group of us were standing on the corner of the school by the parking lot , talking , carrying on , joking – in other words , being high school kids .
The jokes were , predictably , racist .
And here , let me take it a step further , because I think the term “ racist joke ” is too polite and euphemistic to convey the ugliness of what was really going on , so what we were doing was telling nigger jokes .
A small group of redneck kids , telling nigger jokes .
And I was one of them .
About halfway through my joke I see the face of the guy across from me clinch up in that “ shhh , here he comes ” kind of way .
I glanced over my shoulder , to see Louis Banks – one of our five black students – walking up .
He ’d heard me , he ’d heard what I had said .
Louis was a year older than me , I think , and was a pretty good guy .
I ’d been on various sports teams with him , liked him , had never had any problems with him , and so on .
Louis looked at me .
It was a look I will never forget , no matter how long I live .
He turned his head to the side just a bit , so as to regard me out of the corner of his eye , and then shook his head slightly .
“ Ohhhh , Norris … ” ( That was the name I went by back then – my middle name , appropriately enough my father ’s name . )
He shook his head again as he walked off .
It was very quiet for a few moments .
I was humiliated .
And if you have n’t caught on yet , I ’m still humiliated .
I will be until the day I die .
Louis did n’t deserve that .
Nobody deserves that , especially from a guy like me .
There ’s little doubt that Louis could have stomped me bloody on the spot , and there ’s less doubt that I ’d have deserved it .
But the look on his face was n’t anger – it was hurt .
Hurt , maybe surprise , maybe betrayal , and certainly disappointment .
I do n’t know what Louis Banks expected out of me , but the look in his eyes told me that I ’d failed .
A few minutes ago I told this story to my wife , and before that I ’d never spoken of it to anyone .
I doubt the guys who were with me that day would remember , and who knows if Louis does or not .
I ’m guessing that what I did to him that day was n’t a lot different than what he put up with most days , so who knows .
But tonight I needed to confess .
Last night America hit a milestone .
We have n’t extinguished racism for good , but something happened that Martin Luther King may have dreamed of .
And this morning my nephew , who has grown up far less prejudiced than his uncle , got smacked in the face with the kind of ignorance that his uncle was once capable of .
Christopher , though , reacted with deep humanity , an ingrained sense of the wrongness and injustice of it .
I ’ve never traded in a lot of your stereotypical white guilt .
In the grand scheme of things I was just one more ignorant redneck behaving the way that ignorant rednecks behave , but this has nonetheless been one of the most powerful moments of my life .
When I see racism , when I encounter ignorance masquerading as faux - fairness , when I ’m confronted with the injustice of people being denied a fair shake because of their skin color , my mind always takes me back to the day when I was the cracker , when I was the guy putting a minority in his place , when I was the guy with the fire hose .
I ’ve tried to be a better man , tried to learn and grow and use my abilities and my passion to right some of the wrongs facing those born on the wrong side of the class barrier in America .
But I have n’t seen Louis Banks in 30 years and I do n’t know that I ’ll ever be truly whole unless I can stand before him and apologize .
Tonight I ’m happy that America has taken a small step down the road toward a place where race really does n’t matter anymore .
I ’m incredibly proud of my nephew for undertsanding something I did n’t quite get when I was his age .
And while I do n’t say this often , I ’m proud of my little sister , because kids do n’t grasp those lessons on their own .
But mostly , I want to say I ’m sorry to Louis Banks , although I do n’t know where he is , what he ’s doing , or if he ’s even alive .
Louis , I hope that last night you watched Barack Obama speak and that you were proud .
If I ever get the chance to say this to your face , to ask forgiveness in the same way I incurred the debt , I promise that I ’ll do all in my power to make it happen .
" Apparent Evolution "
By : John Caruso of The Distant Ocean
Here 's Jeremy Scahill writing about late - breaking mainstream media recognition of Obama 's " nuanced " position on withdrawal of US forces from Iraq :
The New York Times is reporting about an " apparent evolution " in president - elect Barack Obama 's thinking on Iraq , citing his recent statements about his plan to keep a " residual force " in the country and his pledge to " listen to the recommendations of my commanders " as Obama prepares to assume actual command of US forces .
" At the Pentagon and the military headquarters in Iraq , the response to the statements this week from Mr. Obama and his national security team has been akin to the senior officer corps ' letting out its collective breath , " the Times reported .
" The words sounded to them like the new president would take a measured approach on the question of troop levels . "
The reality is there is no " evolution . "
Anyone who took the time to cut past Barack Obama 's campaign rhetoric of " change " and bringing an " end " to the Iraq war realized early on that the now - president - elect had a plan that boiled down to a down - sizing and rebranding of the occupation .
I particularly appreciate the Times ' choice of headline : " Campaign Promises on Ending the War in Iraq Now Muted by Reality . "
This is an extremely useful principle I 'm sure we'd all like to employ at one time or another : " Unfortunately , Tom , my promise to pay back that money you loaned me has now been muted by reality — namely , the reality that I never had any intention to .
Sucker ! "
For anyone who actually wanted to know how Obama would govern , the single most important thing he said during the campaign was this : " Sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified .
...
Politicians are always guilty of that , and I do n't exempt myself . "
AND ALSO : I 'm sad to see that FAIR is handling this same story with the new favorite strategy of Obama backers : to point to his official campaign policy positions and pretend that he never said anything different then from what he 's saying now — and if anyone foolishly thought so , they just were n't paying attention .
This is a particularly disingenuous tactic since it studiously ignores the " overheated rhetoric " Obama used on the campaign trail that contradicted those official positions and convinced so many of his supporters that he intended to bring the Iraq war to a complete close .
Oddly , FAIR never felt the need to make such fine distinctions when they were cataloging Bush 's attempts to link Iraq to 9/11 , even though those also took the form of insinuation and implication rather than outright assertions .
I wonder what the difference could be ?

“ The pharmaceutical industry ganged up and attacked , discredited the findings , ” Dr. Furberg said .
He eventually resigned in frustration as chairman of the study ’s steering committee , the expert group that continues to oversee analysis of data from the trial .
One member of that committee received more than $ 200,000 from Pfizer , largely in speaking fees , the year after the Allhat results were released .
There was another factor : medicine moves on .
Even before Allhat was finished , and certainly since then , new drugs appeared .
Others , meanwhile , became available as generics , reducing the cost advantage of the diuretics .
And many doctors have shifted to using two or more drugs together , helped by pharmaceutical companies that offer combination pills containing two medicines .
So Allhat ’s main query  which drug to use first  became “ an outdated question that does n’t have huge relevance to the majority of people ’s clinical practices , ” said Dr. John M. Flack , the chairman of medicine at Wayne State University , who was not involved in the study and has consulted for some drug makers .
Dr. Sean Tunis , a former chief medical officer for Medicare , remains an advocate for comparative - effectiveness studies .
But , as Allhat showed , “ they are hard to do , expensive to do and provoke a lot of political pushback , ” said Dr. Tunis , who now runs the nonprofit Center for Medical Technology Policy , which tries to arrange such trials .
“ There ’s a lot of magical thinking , ” he said , “ that it will all be science and wo n’t be politics . ”
Expensive Pills
Promising better ways to treat high blood pressure , drug companies in the 1980s introduced a variety of medications , including ones known as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors .
Although there was no real evidence the newer pills were better , diuretics fell to 27 percent of hypertension prescriptions in 1992 , from 56 percent in 1982 .
Use of the more expensive pills added an estimated $ 3.1 billion to the nation ’s medical bill over that period .
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) -- U.S. stocks slumped Monday morning , joining the global market selloff as investors continued to retreat amid bets of a far - reaching recession .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) , the Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) all lost at least 1 % in the early going .
Stocks have gotten hammered over the last 2 months as the financial markets crisis has accelerated and the credit market has seized up , choking off access to much - needed capital .
Efforts on the part of governments around the world have helped loosen up lending somewhat , but not enough to reassure investors .
The Dow has not closed below the 8,000 mark in five years , but another bad day could take the closely watched measure below that benchmark .
It has only fallen below 8,000 once , during intra-day trading on Oct. 10 , in the recent market upheaval .
Sometimes investors will use an arbitrary market level to trigger automatic buying or selling programs , which can put a floor under stocks during a selloff .
But many market analysts said they can't count on the 8,000 mark being such a floor at this point .
" I do n't know that anyone can legitimately forecast what the bottom is going to be or where the market starts to turn , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
He said it 's not clear when major investors , such as hedge funds , will be willing to return to buying .
" You do n't go out in a hurricane , you wait until it blows away , " he said .
Global markets : Global stock indexes continued to slide Monday .
Losses piled up in Asia , where Japan 's Nikkei tumbled 6.4 % to close at a 26 - year low , while Hong Kong 's Hang Seng plunged 13 % .
In Europe , major markets fell in morning trading , with major markets there off between 3 % and 6 % in early trading .
David Kelly , chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds , said that it 's fear about the selloff in overseas markets , more than any economic or company news driving futures lower early Monday .
He also is reluctant to predict when investors will put a floor under the recent downward plunge .
" The market is in a manic phase , " Kelly said .
" It 's like a kid throwing a tantrum .
At some point you have to let them cry themselves out because there 's no reasoning with them .
Eventually , the market will respond more to fundamentals . "
In currency markets , the dollar continued its recent rise against the euro , but the yen gained on both currencies once again .
The relative strength of the dollar briefly pushed oil futures below the $ 62 a barrel mark .
The price rebounded slightly after hitting that low but was still off $ 2.15 to $ 62 for a barrel of light crude for December delivery .
The group of the world 's seven major economies , the G - 7 , issued a statement early Monday voicing concern about " recent excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen and its possible adverse implications for economic and financial stability . "
The statement was seen as a green light for the Bank of Japan to intervene in currency markets to stop the currency from gaining too much strength .
A stronger yen can hurt the competitiveness of Japanese exports by driving up the price of that country 's goods .
Stocks have suffered heavy losses amid growing concerns of a deep and prolonged global economic slump .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.6 % on Friday .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index fell 3.5 % and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.2 % .
Economy : A report on September new home sales was on tap at 10 a.m. ET .
Economists are again forecasting that new home sales fell to a new 17 - year low .
The release is the first of several due out this week .
Readings on consumer confidence , gross domestic product and personal income and spending are all due later in the week .
Corporate news :
Ten regional banks , including Key Corp ( KEY , Fortune 500 ) . , Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB , Fortune 500 ) and Capital One Financial ( COF , Fortune 500 ) , announced they would be getting their own infusion of capital from the Treasury Department as part of the federal government 's $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout .
Those three will receive a total of $ 9.5 billion .
The announcements follow the original investment of $ 125 billion of taxpayer money in nine of the nation 's largest banks earlier this month .
In another move to try to help frozen credit markets unfreeze , the Federal Reserve is set to open its commercial paper funding facility .
Commercial paper is the primary source of short - term borrowing major companies and banks to fund their daily operations running .
The credit crunch has caused major sources of that funding , such as money market funds , pull out of that market in the last six weeks , causing the amount of borrowing to tumble 20 % during that time .
The hope is that by the Fed starting to lend directly to companies by its purchases of commercial paper , there will be a significant improvement in frozen credit markets .
Dow component Verizon Communications ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) posted slightly improved earnings that met the forecasts of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters .
are forecasting a narrow gain in earnings and revenue , but the company 's outlook will probably be of greater interest to investors .
Just as I begin to work on a series of posts on the need for non-partisanship , along comes an event , the likes of which many have never witnessed in the Canadian Parliament before .
And it was a doozy .
A Prime Minister , promising in a throne speech a few days previous to work with the other parties to tackle a quickly descending economic situation , unleashes a fiscal update that all but blisters the paint off of any goodwill that might indeed have remained in the House .
His brazen attack on all three opposition parties completely changed the dynamic of the Chamber in seconds – perhaps forever .
It ’s not what we expected .
To be sure , certain portions of the update had been leaked a day earlier , but the sheer scope of the Prime Minister ’s statement suddenly laid bare everything that we had all feared might dwell beneath the veneer of the government ’s civility .
In that moment at least , we stared into a kind of abyss and did n’t like its depth .
What fascinated me were the faces of the Conservative MPs during the reading of the statement itself .
They appeared on edge , worried , and more than a little apprehensive , as if they knew danger was ahead .
No sooner was the speech ended than the Prime Minister and his Finance Minister left the House , along with half of the Conservative caucus .
The faces on those that remained told the story in vivid detail .
Listening to the response from the three opposition parties , you could tell from their countenance some kind of line had been crossed .
In the Opposition Lobby , I saw things I had never witnessed in my two years here .
Bloc members were “ high - fiving ” NDP caucus members , and some women from the Bloc were embracing their counterparts in the Liberal caucus .
It was incredible to watch .
There ’s no need to say more about such events because they are playing out in real time in the media and could well result in the overthrow of the present Conservative government .
And I do n’t want to get “ off - track ” from my ruminations on non-partisanship .
In fact , I ca n’t think of a better introduction for the need for such an outlook than what has just been recounted above .
What we saw this week was rank hyper - partisanship vividly displayed in brilliant parliamentary technicolor .
This kind of extreme partisanship has characterized Parliament for a few years now and its price has been a paralyzing inability to confront the most difficult problems facing the nation – healthcare , the environment , Afghanistan , and of course , the deteriorating economy .
On the controversial issues , meaningful progress is all but impossible without a true spirit of common purpose , of non-partisan cooperation .
With the kick - off of this new parliament just a few weeks ago , Stephen Harper started out with over half the country alienated from him .
And when he set about to undermine the parties representing that majority of voters in opposition , he sealed his own fate .
By starting the session this way , he compounded his problems with his own unique style of polarizing the country , making it almost impossible to put Humpty Dumpty back together again .
With that now behind us , let ’s get back to our focus : the need to recapture the kind of effective governance over the long term that only a spirit of non-partisanship can bring .
Prime ministers who divide rarely conquer .
Let ’s consider how we might bring the country back together in a meaningful way .
Despite the popular fearmongering , GMO technologies promise a boon to agriculture and humanity .

Today we 're going to look at one of the most divisive issues in global food production : genetically modified organisms .
Supporters point to vastly improved crop yields and reduced need for fertilizers and pesticides ; opponents claim that such products are inadequately tested and may result in unknown dangers .
Some poor developing countries , like the Philippines and some African nations , have become battlegrounds between the environmentalists and the farmers .
Let 's find out what both sides are claiming .
So what exactly are genetically modified organisms , and how does genetic engineering differ from the type of artificial crop development that man has been practicing for thousands of years ?
Nature 's method of genetically hybridizing plants is cross pollination , and for most of human history , this is how farmers and scientists have created new and improved species of crops .
Plants can be hybridized quite readily , more so than animals , but there 's still a limit to how far apart the species can be .
The principal differentiator of direct genetic manipulation is that you can move individual genes from one species to virtually any other species , no matter how different they are .
But more to the point , you can select specific genes that carry specifically desirable traits , and accomplish far more significant improvements with much greater control in much less time .
The first commercially available genetically modified organisms were in medicine .
The first widely produced GMO was synthetic insulin , which was approved by the FDA in 1982 , and is how all medical insulin is now produced .
Human growth hormone used to have to be taken from cadavers , but through GMO it 's now produced synthetically .
The vaccine for Hepatitis B was developed through GMO in 1987 .
Genetic engineering is also responsible for the oil - eating bacteria used in industrial applications .
When designing improved food crops through traditional hybridization , one of the principle barriers is that the new offspring are often sterile , particularly when the species being cross pollinated are too far apart .
Through GMO hybridization , this barrier can often be overcome .
When it comes to food crops , the idea is to take the strengths of one plant strain , such as an immunity to a certain disease or a hardiness to certain adverse conditions , and transfer that strength to another plant strain that needs it .
One example that researchers are working on now is immunity to the " rust fungus " , a fungus that affects all cereals but for some reason rice is immune to it .
If that immunity can be given to other cereals like wheat and barley , then we have a better crop that is resistant to one more disease .
Yields go up , and the need for chemicals to eradicate the fungus goes down .
Everyone wins .
In 1943 , what became known as the Green Revolution began when Mexico , unable to feed its growing population , shouted for help .
Within a few years , the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations founded the International Rice Research Institute in Asia , and by 1962 , a new strain of rice called IR8 was feeding people all over the world .
IR8 was the first really big modified crop to make a real impact on world hunger .
In 1962 the technology did not yet exist to directly manipulate the genes of plants , and so IR8 was created by carefully crossing existing varieties : selecting the best from each generation , further modifying them , and finally finding the best .
Here is the power of modified crops : IR8 , with no fertilizer , straight out of the box , produced five times the yield of traditional rice varieties .
In optimal conditions with nitrogen , it produced ten times the yield of traditional varieties .
By 1980 , IR36 resisted pests and grew fast enough to allow two crops a year instead of just one , doubling the yield .
And by 1990 , using more advanced genetic manipulation techniques , IR72 was outperforming even IR36 .
The Green Revolution saw worldwide crop yields explode from 1960 through 2000 .
No discussion of GMO is complete without a mention of Norman Borlaug , the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner , 1977 US Presidential Medal of Freedom winner , 2006 Congressional Gold Medal winner , and best known as the father of the Green Revolution .
The unanimous act of Congress states " Dr. Borlaug has saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived , and likely has saved more lives in the Islamic world than any other human being in history . "
The Nobel committee put a number on this , estimating that he was personally and directly responsible for saving over one billion human beings in the Third World from starvation .
Dr. Borlaug did it by pioneering the use of hybrid and genetically modified crops , designing new strains that could thrive in arid conditions where pesticides or herbicides were not available .
He 's also known for " Borlaug 's Hypothesis " which proposes that the best way to reduce deforestation is to reduce demand for new farmland by using our best existing farmland to its maximum potential .
GMO crops also give seed manufacturers capabilities with potential to be less benevolent .
By employing what are called " Terminator " genes , manufacturers can theoretically exercise patent enforcement techniques not too different from software activation .
You can grow the plants fine , but the engineered traits require chemical activation , thus enforcing annual license fees from farmers .
However , terminator features can also be used to address the concerns of anti-GMO activists worried about cross pollination and contamination .
Crops can be engineered to produce sterile seeds , or to produce only sterile offspring should cross pollination with conventional crops occur .
When we turn our skeptical eye toward the Philippines , we see Greenpeace activists wearing full biohazard spacesuits cutting down GMO crops and disposing of them in sealed containers .
By inviting reporters and photographers to document these demonstrations , they very effectively spread terror among the undereducated poor Filipino public .
Now , I think any reasonable person agrees that you would n't do such a drastic thing without very good reason ; so there must indeed be very good evidence that GMO crops are only safely handled by hazmat disposal teams — would n't you think ?
Let 's look at Greenpeace 's website and see what frightening information they 've uncovered .
The production of unexpected toxins and allergens .
Because genetic engineering is a very imprecise technology , the insertion of foreign genes can stimulate the production of unexpected proteins , which may prove toxic or allergenic .
First of all , it 's hardly a " very imprecise technology " ; gene manipulation requires great precision , and produces far more precisely designed results than can be hoped for with simple cross pollination .
The very purpose of the research is to avoid toxic or allergenic results .
When these results are found in GMOs , those products are not sent to the market .
Duh .
A large part of science involves learning how to make things better .
Do we stop all scientific research in every field because learning how to make things better also teaches us what makes them worse ?
What a ridiculous objection .
Antibiotic resistance .
Scientists add genes that confer resistance to common antibiotics .
What they meant to say is that some GMO research seeks to find ways to make crops resistant to harmful bacteria , by incorporating the right toxins into the crop , thus eliminating the need to apply that toxin separately in the form of synthetic or organic pesticides ( yes , people , organic pesticides contain the same toxins found in synthetic pesticides — they have to , otherwise they would n't function ) .
Finding ways to manage this process to avoid creating resistant pests has been a major area of study in farming science for centuries .
This is a farming problem that exists independently of GMO .
GMO neither creates nor exacerbates this issue .
Effects on the Environment .
Genetically engineered crops represent new and potentially invasive forms of life .
All plant species are potentially invasive , and that 's why farmers use good management techniques .
There 's no reason you should be expected to do this any more or any less with GMO crops as you have always had to do with all crops .
This criticism says nothing about GMO .
Contamination of seeds and crops .
People are still increasingly finding even non-GE stocks contaminated .
This is due to cross pollination where contaminated pollen is carried by wind or as seeds spread out in the environment or are mixed up during handling .
This has always been true of all plants .
Cross pollination has nothing to do with GMO .
It is responsible for all the biodiversity of plant life on the planet .
Calling it " contamination " is simply using a weasel word to raise alarm about a perfectly natural , normal process .
GE foods remove consumer choice .
Because of the widespread contamination caused by GE crops and the fact that many GE crops are not kept separate in the food system , consumers in the Philippines have been denied the right to choose not to eat genetically engineered food .
Again , this has always been true of all food crops .
Virtually all modern food crops — cereals , corn , rice — are the result of human hybridization .
Is Greenpeace applying this criticism to all food crops , or only to those developed by for - profit companies ?
Is this a scientific objection , or an ideological objection ?
Biopiracy .
In order to achieve the desired traits chemical companies often use genes acquired from plants , animals and bacteria found in poorer countries .
In effect these genes are being stolen from the poor to feed corporate profits .
And what is Greenpeace 's most frequent argument in favor of maintaining Brazilian rain forest ?
The forest , says Greenpeace , acts " as a crucial medicine chest for pharmaceutical advance . "
When it serves their purposes , Greenpeace is all in favor of using substances from plants in poor countries .
But when someone else does it to feed people , suddenly it's " biopiracy " .
This is the height of hypocrisy .
Increasing knowledge by studying genetics in a different country is good for everyone .
Is this really the best Greenpeace can do ?
Loss of Farmers Rights .
Because genetically engineered seeds are patented , the seed company can maintain strict control over how the seeds are used .
This is true of all patented products in the world .
Even Greenpeace retains strict control over their legally protected properties , profiting from T - shirt and bumper sticker sales , and prosecuting those who violate their copyrights .
This is yet another hypocritical and irrelevant argument that has nothing to do with the science or safety of GMO .
Genetic engineering is unnatural .
Because genetic engineering creates new living organisms that would never naturally occur , many people hold moral and spiritual objections to it .
Finally , an honest and factual objection .
There 's nothing at all wrong with having moral and spiritual opinions .
What is wrong is calling them science , and using them to deny food to poor people to whom your spiritual notions may not be as important as feeding their starving children .
And yet , these are the best reasons Greenpeace can come up with to defend the act of terrorizing Filipinos by raiding their farms wearing hazmat suits .
I 'll conclude my discussion of GMO with a quote from Norman Borlaug , who says it better than I could :
" Some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth , but many of them are elitists .
They 've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger .
They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels .
If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world , as I have for fifty years , they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things . "
Well said .

HOLLYWOOD , Florida ( CNN ) --
A deceased drifter long suspected in the abduction , murder and beheading of 6 - year - old Adam Walsh committed the crime that put missing children on the national agenda , police said Tuesday .
Adam Walsh 6 , disappeared from a mall in August , 1981 .
His head was found two weeks later , 120 miles away .
" If Ottis Toole was alive today , he would be arrested for the abduction and murder of Adam Walsh on July 27 , 1981 , " Hollywood Police Chief Chad Wagner said at an afternoon news conference announcing the end of the 27 - year investigation .
The chief apologized to the boy 's parents , John and Reve Walsh , for what he called " lapses " in the initial investigation .
He added that there was no " magic " piece of evidence that led investigators to officially name a suspect now .
" This case could have been closed , and should have been closed years ago , " Wagner said .
When he took over last year as police chief , Wagner vowed to close the Walsh case .
He reviewed the entire case file and assigned a retired detective , Joe Matthews , to conduct an independent review .
Watch Wagner make his announcement »
John Walsh 's voice shook and his eyes brimmed with tears as he thanked the chief for closing the case .
Walsh is best known as host of the television show " America 's Most Wanted . "
Watch Walsh 's reaction »
" For 27 years , we have been asking ourselves , ' Who would take a 6 - year - old boy and murder him and decapitate him ?
Who ? ' " Walsh said .
" We needed to know .
Today we know .
The not knowing has been a torture but now that journey is over .
It is only fitting that it ends here at this police department . "
Watch Reve Walsh thank her children »
Toole , a convicted pedophile and killer who associated with notorious serial killer Henry Lee Lucas , died in prison in 1996 .
Wagner said investigators were able to place Toole in Hollywood at the time Adam disappeared .
Toole twice confessed to killing the boy -- and twice recanted his story , saying he made it up .
It could not be learned what , if any , new evidence exists .
Adam disappeared from a Sears store across from the Hollywood police station in July 1981 .
Two weeks later , his severed head was found in a canal 120 miles away .
The boy 's body was never recovered , and no one was ever charged in the case .
Walsh turned his grief into action , becoming an early advocate for missing children and crime victims .
Three presidents -- Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton -- have honored Walsh for his efforts to safeguard children .
His efforts led to the passage of the federal Missing Children 's Assistance Act of 1984 , which established the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
His fierce loathing of fugitives , convicts and predators launched a new career as host of the television show " America 's Most Wanted . "
Walsh has long believed Toole killed Adam , and on Tuesday , Wagner said there never was any other suspect .
Toole died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence on unrelated charges .
Toole 's confessions in the Walsh case were questioned by police because Toole confessed to other murders that police knew he did not commit .
Although the details of his story changed , Toole did lead police to the Sears store and pointed out the spot where Adam was last seen .
He also led police to the canal where the boy 's head was found .
But investigators could not find Adam 's body where Toole said he left it .
A bloody piece of carpet removed from Toole 's car was lost by police many years ago , before DNA testing became available .
Police believe a 17 - year - old security guard asked a handful of rowdy kids who were playing video games in the toy department to leave the store .
Investigators believe Adam was grouped in with those kids , who left him alone outside the store .
That was the last time he was seen .

A Greek television show has revealed how Greek police posed as anarchists and destroyed property .
Inciting violence and blaming it on legitimate activists is a favorite tactic of the state in order to crack down on protest and dismiss genuine grievances .
A Greek television show documenting police acting as anarchists and engaging in property damage .
In 2007 , agents provocateurs attempted to incite violence in Montebello , Canada , during a peaceful protest against a Prosperity Partnership summit .
A video and photographs later revealed the so - called anarchists were wearing the same military boots as the police .
“ Neither the RCMP nor the Surete du Quebec would comment on the video or even discuss generally whether they ever use the tactic of employing agents provocateurs , however it has been common practice at previous protests for authorities to employ police or special forces to intentionally infiltrate peaceful protests and cause violence , ” Steve Watson wrote on August 22 , 2007 .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Other documented instances of agents provocateurs used against peaceful protests occurred in Seattle in 1999 at the World Trade Organization meeting , at the WTO protests in Genoa , Italy , and during protests in Miami in late November 2003 .
The United Steelworkers of America called for a congressional investigation in the latter case and stated that the police intentionally caused violence and arrested and charged hundreds of peaceful protesters .
Earlier this year , MP George Galloway accused the London Metropolitan Police of engaging in “ a deliberate conspiracy to bring about scenes of violent disorder ” during President George W. Bush ’s visit to the UK .
Police have gone to great lengths to subvert antiwar organizations .
In 2003 , two Oakland police officers working undercover at an anti-war protest were elected to leadership positions in an effort to influence the demonstration , according to the San Franciso Chronicle .
“ The ACLU said the Oakland case was one of several instances in which police agencies had spied on legitimate political activity since 2001 . ”
From COINTELPRO : The Untold American Story :
Over the years , FBI provocateurs have repeatedly urged and initiated violent acts , including forceful disruptions of meetings and demonstrations , attacks on police , bombings , and so on , following an old strategy of Tsarist police director TC Zubatov : “ We shall provoke you to acts of terror and then crush you . ”
In October , former Italian President Francesco Cossiga suggested the police be used as agents provocateurs to start riots and then have the police “ beat the shit out of the protesters ” .
Cossiga was one of the founders of Operation Gladio , the CIA and NATO “ stay behind army ” that engaged in terrorist bombings and assassinations that were subsequently blamed on leftist organizations .
“ Cossiga is essentially describing the problem - reaction - solution dialectic that he exploited when he was in government .
Under the banner of Operation GLADIO , which was unveiled after parliamentary investigations in Italy , Switzerland and Belgium , NATO sponsored secret armies committed acts of violence and terrorism and blamed the attacks on left - wing political movements , allowing far - right governments to seize power in numerous European countries , ” explains Paul Joseph Watson .
The Greek people now have evidence of a similar campaign as they attempt to mobilize against the neoliberal dominated Greek state and its bankster stooges who have brought economic misery to the country .
As a matter of course , this vital information will not be brought out in the corporate media as it attempts to discredit peaceful political organizations .

Pictured : British ex-MOD boss , 70 , becomes first transsexual geisha in Japan
The figure of the geisha is one steeped in mystery , tradition and intrigue .
And , until now , becoming a geisha in Japan has been a strictly female - only affair .
But now 70 - year - old Mary Murdoch , formerly Malcolm Murdoch and an ex-Ministry of Defence boss , has broken with tradition to become the first ever transsexual allowed to dress as a geisha .
Malcolm Murdoch , on his graduation in 1975 ( left ) , is now transsexual Mary Murdoch ( right ) , wearing a traditional geisha in Japan , complete with kimono and elaborate hairstyle
Until now , the Japanese tourist office been adamant that only biological females are allowed to dress as geisha in the historic city of Kyoto , the art - form 's traditional home .
Mary , from south - east London , said : ' My ambition was to dress up as a geisha and at first they were reluctant .
' But in the end I convinced them .
I was the first person to actually do this .
They were very welcoming and put aside the normal rules for foreign tourists .
' Since then the Japanese government has a policy which says if there ’s a female name on the passport then you may dress up as a geisha . '
Mary , who has never married or had children , now plans to organise special tours so other transsexuals can experience the elegance and beauty of geisha culture .
" I felt so beautiful in the geisha outfit , " she said .
" I know it 's something a lot of ladies in the transsexual community would enjoy . "
Mary Murdoch poses with a more traditional geisha on a trip to Japan this year
Mary started having therapy to become a woman at Charing Cross Hospital in London four years ago .
She said : ' The situation in the 60s was dreadful - it was hardly understood .
People used to be given electro - shock therapy .
' Things have moved on a considerable amount since then . '
Her new look would certainly have raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Defence where she used to work .
She worked as a cartographer in the MOD , eventually becoming a manager .
With fan , elaborate hairdo and traditional kimono , Mary 's transformation into a geisha is complete
" My job involved mapping military aircraft routes with the Civil Aviation Authority , " said Mary .
" It was a very masculine job and a lot of responsibility .
" Lives were at stake , so we could not afford to make any mistakes . "
But she added : " I always felt feminine underneath and loved pretty , girly things .
" As I got older my feelings grew stronger and stronger until I could n't ignore them .
" Once I was in the car with my university lecturer and I saw a gorgeous dress in a shop window .
I almost shouted ' Oh look at that lovely dress ' but I just stopped myself in time .
Mary Murdoch ( pictured centre with long white hair ) at an MOD reunion
" I also had urges to kiss men but I never did . "
Mary is far happier living as a woman and is accepted by most people in her community .
" Sometimes people shout horrible things in the street , " she said .
" But generally when I go out in a pretty dress people do n't look twice at me . "
Mary said : ' You wanted to dress as a girl but you could n’t and that made life very awkward so you had to do it in secret .
' It ’s only recently people have started to understand transsexual people .
They used to mix them up with a type of perversion .
“ We now accept that it ’s a biological thing . '
Mary is now on an NHS waiting list for an operation to finally sever her ties with her life as a male .
Mary explains : ' It costs about £ 11,000 to have a sex change operation .
' I 've given up smoking and lost nearly five stone in preparation for the op .
I could get funding from the NHS any day now .
My heart leaps every time the phone rings . '
Mary pictured at her home and in her incarnation as a geisha , complete with traditional kimono and umbrella
Geisha have long fascinated the western world .
Contrary to common belief the art of the geisha has nothing to do with prostitution .
Trained geisha entertain men with their witty banter and dancing .
Even in today 's modern Japan , geisha ply their trade in the narrow wooden streets of Gion in the heart of the ancient city of Kyoto .
Most geisha seen out and about with their white faces are often ' maiko ' or trainees , or tourists like Mary who dress up for a few hours make - believe .
The US will face more competition at the top of a multi-polar global system US economic , military and political dominance is likely to decline over the next two decades , according to a new US intelligence report on global trends .
The National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) predicts China , India and Russia will increasingly challenge US influence .
It also says the dollar may no longer be the world 's major currency , and food and water shortages will fuel conflict .
However , the report concedes that these outcomes are not inevitable and will depend on the actions of world leaders .
It will make sombre reading for President - elect Barack Obama , the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says , as it paints a bleak picture of the future of US influence and power .
The US will remain the single most important actor but will be less dominant

" The next 20 years of transition to a new system are fraught with risks , " says Global Trends 2025 , the latest of the reports that the NIC prepares every four years in time for the next presidential term .
Washington will retain its considerable military advantages , but scientific and technological advances ; the use of " irregular warfare tactics " ; the proliferation of long - range precision weapons ; and the growing use of cyber warfare " increasingly will constrict US freedom of action " , it adds .
Nevertheless , the report concludes : " The US will remain the single most important actor but will be less dominant . "
Nuclear weapons use
The NIC 's 2004 study painted a rosier picture of America 's global position , with US dominance expected to continue .
But the latest Global Trends report says that rising economies such as China , India , Russia and Brazil will offer the US more competition at the top of a multi-polar international system .

The EU is meanwhile predicted to become a " hobbled giant " , unable to turn its economic power into diplomatic or military muscle .
A world with more power centres will be less stable than one with one or two superpowers , it says , offering more potential for conflict .
Global warming , along with rising populations and economic growth will put additional strains on natural resources , it warns , fuelling conflict around the globe as countries compete for them .
" Strategic rivalries are most likely to revolve around trade , investments and technological innovation and acquisition , but we cannot rule out a 19th Century - like scenario of arms races , territorial expansion and military rivalries , " the report says .
" Types of conflict we have not seen for a while - such as over resources - could re-emerge . "
There will be greater potential for conflict in the future , the NIC says Such conflicts and resource shortages could lead to the collapse of governments in Africa and South Asia , and the rise of organised crime in Eastern and Central Europe , it adds .
And the use of nuclear weapons will grow increasingly likely , the report says , as " rogue states " and militant groups gain greater access to them .
But al - Qaeda could decay " sooner than people think " , it adds , citing the group 's growing unpopularity in the Muslim world .
" The prospect that al - Qaeda will be among the small number of groups able to transcend the generational timeline is not high , given its harsh ideology , unachievable strategic objectives and inability to become a mass movement , " it says .
The NIC does , however , give some scope for leaders to take action to prevent the emergence of new conflicts .
" It is not beyond the mind of human beings , or political systems , [ or ] in some cases [ the ] working of market mechanisms to address and alleviate if not solve these problems , " said Thomas Fingar , chairman of the NIC .
And , our correspondent adds , it is worth noting that US intelligence has been wrong before .

Article # 0377

As we move toward the completion of REBOL 3.0 and it's related components , it is time to say a bit more about our progress and plans .
For the last few months , the main focus has been on the graphical user interface ( GUI ) , with the objective of creating a GUI system that was powerful , flexible , but remained lean and lightweight .
This was no small requirement and has consumed a great deal of my time .
In fact , more than any other aspect of the GUI project , reduction of the number of concepts and simplification of each separate concept has taken more time than I had anticipated .
As a result of that mind voyage , I have concluded a general rule that : Simplicity is a delicate thing ;
; it must be recognized as an objective worth achieving and maintaining , and
, and simplicity can easily be destroyed , so
, so therefore , it must be guarded with great care .
Said another way : simplicity is n't free .
In fact , it 's more work at the start .
Sidenote
The merits of that rule apply to more than just software .
Look at the last few months of financial market meltdown mainly due to years of using financial instruments that were so complex that no one , not even head executives , understood their true value ( or lack thereof ) or could properly weigh their associated risks .
Now multiply that by ten and you have most modern software systems .
Now multiply that by ten and you have the US federal government .
In any system , when you build layers upon layers of complexity , the system will ultimately fail , in a huge way , to do the most damage possible .
Avoiding that , to whatever degree is possible within our human capabilities , is what drives me .
Anyway , regarding the project , good progress was made so that by the end of September , we started a new private group for testing , discussing , improving the GUI .
( I did not want a lot of voices at this point , so I intentionally kept the group very small .
It will be expanding soon . )
During October During the month of October , the project objectives were :
To review the basic GUI design / concepts and provide feedback .
To contribute improvements , especially focusing on providing a modern graphical appearance and a standard set of styles ( widgets ) .
To track and fix bugs as necessary .
To increase developer awareness of the project in advance of the next stage .
Also included for October was to build a documentation strategy :
To produce a new organization of documents based on the new design , for the purposes of educating new developers .
To provide clear and easy - to - understand examples and how - to articles .
To begin explaining the finer points , to enable developers to build more complex types of styles , but within the bounds of the design .
And finally , to write a few example reblets , from the GUI point of view and in order to help evaluate the design and to serve as examples :
The GUI test control panel ( with numerous subpanels , as needed )
A simple submission form , such as that used for contact information .
A super simple REBOL source file browser .
A mini draw program , along the same lines as Sievertsen did in R2 , including a few shapes , and controls , as well as undo .
A first pass at a color selector / requestor .
An analog clock as a resizable , setable , getable style .
More important than the specific features of any of these reblets is that they provide the opportunity to explore the methodology of the GUI and evaluate its current level of capability .
In other words , you cannot complete a good GUI system without using it to do real things .
So , we achieved those objectives for October .
For November For November , our main goals are :
To expand the GUI group to include more developers .
Discover and resolve various bugs or problems with the GUI or the SVG draw system that it 's built on .
Wrap up the first skin that has an acceptable appearance for R3 , its developers and their initial reblets .
Finish off the required base GUI styles ( widgets ) , including more of the compound styles ( e.g. combo box ) , standard requestors and the popup mechanism .
To determine documentation priorities , make a list of what 's missing , and get those written and published in DocBase .
To add several more example reblets , with increasing features and capabilities .
To get a real reblet running , such as DevBase itself , which will allow us ...
To get the source distribution back online and available to interested developers .
And , as you may guess , these last two items that are important because not only do they help move R3 toward completion , but they also help us build and improve the tools we need to do so .

A married man attached a dirty picture of himself to an email , and then sent it to another woman .
When his wife found it , he blamed an iPhone glitch !
Here are some or the more lively responses to the poor woman ’s question :
“ Its a glitch , but only happens if the pic is sufficiently raunchy . ”
“ Your husband is lying to you .
I use the iPhone with work and and needless to say we have all sorts of private documents that get sent .
The iPhone has fairly reasonable security measures and would not do such a thing .
Not only is your husband cheating on you , he LIED .
TO .
YOU .
AS . WELL . “
“ I think your marriage has a glitch “
” as a former mac genius myself , my professional opinion is that YOUR HUSBAND IS HAVING AN AFFAIR .
The iPhone does n’t do that .
period !
he ’s totally having you on . ”
“ The glitch claimed is too far - fetched .
Opening the e-mail app on its own .
Plucking an e-mail address at random .
Attaching a pic .
Sending it , but only to the inbox .
And let ’s not overlook that the “ iPhone ” sent a sexual picture to another woman .
Too coincidental .
Any one of the four might pass , but when combined together , it ’s too far - fetched . ”
And what kind of picture did this guy send ?
Well , take a look below , but be warned , it ’s a bit graphic .
Google has covered quite a lot of turf during the march toward its goal of making every last bit of the world 's information searchable .
But considering all the ground that has yet to be covered — especially in the realms of offline data and paper documents — we were n't surprised when Google began dabbling with OCR technologies over the last couple of years .
Now , the search giant has officially launched its next attempt to handle some of this previously unsearchable content .
As announced on the Official Google Blog , the company is now performing optical character recognition ( OCR ) on documents that it indexes and identifies as scanned as PDFs .
Google has indexed documents that were saved as text - based PDFs for quite some time .
But many documents wind up being made into PDFs through scans , which store the text as images .
Google has now decided that its open - source OCRopus technology , based on software called " Tesseract " that HP developed , is up to the task of indexing scanned documents that can contain any mixture of text , images , and coffee stains .
Google 's servers no longer need to
be afraid of these warnings
We went hands - on with the first alpha of OCRopus in October 2007 , and found it to be hit and miss .
At the time of our hands - on , we found that OCRopus had trouble with non-sans - serif fonts and type set in smaller sizes .
But Google has since set a few engineers on the task of updating Tesseract for the 21st century .
The company is obviously confident that OCRopus now has the ability to index a whole new library of texts , papers , and medical journals that previously were locked tomes as far as Google 's servers were concerned .
Google did n't return our request for comment in time for publication , so we do n't know what percentage of Google 's massive index OCRopus has already crawled through .
Google provides a few examples of the benefits of indexing scanned PDFs , though , such as this search for " repairing aluminum wiring . "
The first result is a PDF from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission with that exact title ; the scan has all the quintessential blurry and blotchy text that makes OCR a nightmare .
Google 's " View as HTML " feature is quite useful for these documents , especially if you need to copy portions of them for notes .
Notably missing from Google 's native text views of scanned PDFs , however , are any of the images or diagrams included in the original document .
Amusingly , though , any text that Google is able to parse out of images embedded in PDFs , such as diagrams or graphs , is also indexed and available in the HTML view .
While adding OCR to Google 's indexing engine will certainly make more information searchable and accessible , Google may run into opposition from organizations or universities with scanned PDFs that were placed online specifically for humans , not machines .
Google has undoubtedly stumbled across PDFs that include copyrighted material and personal information ; it has now made those things much easier to find .

A new study of college freshman suggests that African Americans may obtain higher grades if they live with a white roommate .
A detailed study of students at a large , predominantly - white university revealed that while living with a white roommate may be more challenging than living with someone of the same race , many Black students appear to benefit from the experience .
For African American students , this could translate into as much as 0.30 - point increase in their GPA in their first quarter of college .
White students , on the other hand , were affected more by the academic ability of their roommate than by their race .
While the study results may seem one - sided , earlier studies by these researchers and others reinforces the value of students ' experience with members of different races and ethnic groups .
Researchers from Ohio State University and Virginia Commonwealth University found that nearly one in every six interracial roommate relationships failed , meaning at least one roommate moved out , by the end of the first quarter .
But African American students who were paired with a white roommate performed better academically than did those with a same - race roommate .
These African American students may be better adjusted to college because they live with someone who can help them learn about the challenges and norms of a different environment , said Natalie Shook , lead author of the study , who started the work as a graduate student at Ohio State .
" It 's already known that interracial roommate relationships are more difficult than same - race relationships .
But despite the problems , we 've shown that there are benefits in how well Black students perform academically , " said Shook , who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University .
She conducted the study with Russell Fazio , a professor of psychology at Ohio State , who has been studying interracial attitudes and relationships for the past 15 years .
The pair published the results in the October 2008 issue of the journal Group Processes and Intergroup Relations .
The pair collected data on college freshman in more than 2,700 dorm rooms at a large , predominately white university .
They studied how successful relationships were for students who specifically requested to live with someone , as well those who were randomly assigned to a roommate .
Room assignments were studied alongside the students ' SAT or ACT scores , autumn quarter GPA in the fall of 2001 and 2002 , and their ethnic background to test for significant differences between students in all room types .
The results showed that randomly assigned roommates were more likely to move to another room , regardless of the students ' race .
Fifteen percent of randomly paired interracial relationships dissolved , compared to the 8.1 percent and 6.4 percent of randomly assigned same - race white rooms and same - race African American rooms , respectively .
But the researchers point out that the number of interracial room dissolutions was much lower than they expected .
" The university in the study was experiencing a housing crunch that year , so more students probably may not have been able to change rooms for the first quarter .
Some of the previous work showed much higher rates than did our work here .
But of the 85 percent of those that did try to work things out , we see real , tangible benefits , " Fazio said .
The researchers found that African American students who scored higher on their ACT ( 24 and above ) and SAT ( 1040 and above ) were more likely to be successful in college if they were randomly paired with a white student .
Black students who scored lower on their ACT and SAT did not see any improvement in their GPA if they roomed with a white student .
The findings suggest that the interaction between a white and an African American student may help orient these minority students to a predominantly white university , Shook said .
By living with their white counterparts , the African American students are finding someone with whom they can study and learn from in ways other African American students cannot offer .
" Particularly for minority students , there is a lot of added stress to belong and succeed at a predominately white university .
This intergroup contact and exposure to diversity may help minority students adjust in ways same - race relationships cannot , " Shook said .
" And if we can help them adjust more quickly to find their university identity , then hopefully that can also translate into more academic success . "
However , white students ' grades were virtually unaffected by the race of their roommate .
White students earned higher GPAs when assigned to someone who was more successful academically .
" It 's a predominately white institution , so their roommate is not a means by which they can get integrated into the community .
So the race of the roommate proves irrelevant and the day - to - day environment becomes more important .
If their roommate is very competent and studious , or less competent , more of a partygoer , that has a larger impact on their success , " Fazio said .
Even though the race of their roommate did not affect them academically , the researchers believe that living with an African American benefits whites in another way .
Fazio said previous research suggests that many of the automatically activated stereotypes that whites may harbor about African Americans , consciously or subconsciously , dissolve when they interact extensively with someone of another race .
This interaction not only helps white students get over their initial fears and prejudices , it also affects comfort level with other minorities in the future .
" It is definitely not easy for students at first ; it is more stressful and more difficult to live in an interracial situation than in same race situations .
But if people stick with it , their racial attitudes improve and it definitely outweighs any initial difficulty .
This is just one way we can overcome our misconceptions and biases and learn to appreciate our differences earlier on in life , " Shook said .

Bullies DO enjoy seeing other people in pain , scientists say
Harsh : Brain scans of teens who have bullied show they feel pleasure from seeing others in pain ( file picture )
Brain scans of teens with a history of aggressive bullying behavior suggest that they may actually get pleasure out of seeing someone else in pain , U.S. researchers said .
While this may come as little surprise to those who have been victimised by bullies , it is not what the researchers expected , Benjamin Lahey of the University of Chicago , who worked on the study , said .
' The reason we were surprised is the prevailing view is these kids are cold and unemotional in their aggression , ' said Lahey , whose study appears in the journal Biological Psychology .
' This is looking like maybe they care very much , ' said Lahey , who worked on the study with Jean Decety , also of the University of Chicago .
The researchers compared eight boys aged 16 to 18 with aggressive conduct disorder to a group of eight adolescent boys with no unusual signs of aggression .
The boys with the conduct disorder had exhibited disruptive behavior such as starting a fight , using a weapon and stealing after confronting a victim .
They showed both groups video clips of someone inflicting pain on another person and tracked brain activity with a type of imaging called functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI .
In the aggressive teens , areas of the brain linked with feeling rewarded - the amygdala and ventral striatum - became very active when they observed pain being inflicted on others .
But they showed little activity in an area of the brain involved in self - regulation - the medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction - as was seen in the control group .
' It is entirely possible their brains are lighting in the way they are because they experience seeing pain in others as exciting and fun and pleasurable , ' Lahey said .
' We need to test that hypothesis more , but that is what it looks like , ' he said .
Lahey said the differences between the two groups were strong and striking , but cautioned that the study was small and needs to be confirmed by a larger study .
Matt Taibbi , a few years ago , discussing Tom Friedman ’s The World is Flat :
This would be a small thing were it not for the overall pattern .
Thomas Friedman does not get these things right even by accident .
It ’s not that he occasionally screws up and fails to make his metaphors and images agree .
It ’s that he always screws it up .
He has an anti-ear , and it ’s absolutely infallible ; he is a Joyce or a Flaubert in reverse , incapable of rendering even the smallest details without genius .
The difference between Friedman and an ordinary bad writer is that an ordinary bad writer will , say , call some businessman a shark and have him say some tired , uninspired piece of dialogue : Friedman will have him spout it .
And that ’s guaranteed , every single time .
He never misses .
On an ideological level , Friedman ’s new book is the worst , most boring kind of middlebrow horseshit .
If its literary peculiarities could somehow be removed from the equation , The World Is Flat would appear as no more than an unusually long pamphlet replete with the kind of plug - filled , free - trader leg - humping that passes for thought in this country .
It is a tale of a man who walks 10 feet in front of his house armed with a late - model Blackberry and comes back home five minutes later to gush to his wife that hospitals now use the internet to outsource the reading of CAT scans .
Man flies on planes , observes the wonders of capitalism , says we ’re not in Kansas anymore .
( He actually says we ’re not in Kansas anymore . )
That ’s the whole plot right there .
If the underlying message is all that interests you , read no further , because that ’s all there is .
A MAN who fraudulently claimed more than £ 12,000 in benefits after claiming he could only walk 20 yards was caught out . . . after he was spotted completing a 10 k run .
Brian Rawsthorne , 50 , took part in the Bupa Great Manchester run in May 2007 and crossed the finishing line after two hours and eight minutes .
He even appeared in the Manchester Evening News boasting how he had lost two - and - a - half stone as he trained for the race .
But at the same time he was receiving Disability Living Allowance and was paid £ 12,300 between November 2004 and September 2007 .
He denied failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in circumstances but was found guilty by a district judge after Manchester Magistrates '
Court was shown M.E.N. articles about him taking part in the run .
The court was also shown a documentary by our sister TV company , Channel M , which showed him setting off on the big race .
Rawsthorne , a father - of - two , could be seen clapping his arms in the air in a warm - up session before running off .
Paul Darnborough , prosecuting for the DWP , said : " The department would say that his ability to cope with his disability is a change in circumstances .
" His health is improving , his fitness is improving and his diet is improving - meaning he could take part in sporting activities . "
The court was told the former miner , of William Lister Close , Newton Heath , had been the sole survivor of a horrific explosion that killed 10 men at Golborne Colliery , near Wigan , in 1979 .
It left him with severe burns and damaged lungs .
He began claiming Disability Living Allowance in 1997 - insisting he sometimes had to walk on crutches , climb the stairs on his bottom and could not walk about in hot weather .
Officials at the DWP began an investigation after they received an anonymous tip - off that he was refereeing football matches and umpiring cricket games .
Investigator Steven Orwin told the court Rawsthorne admitted this in interview .
He claimed he ' rarely left the centre circle ' while refereeing five - a- side and 11 - a - side football matches .
Rawsthorne added : " On hindsight , on reflection , I 've been dishonest .
But , I 've not done it deceitfully .
I 've not done it maliciously . "
He told the court that taking part in the race had been ' absolute agony ' and had left him unable to walk for five weeks .
Deputy district judge Duncan Birrell suggested to Rawsthorne , who raised £ 1000 in the race , he had done a ' fair old stretch ' in a ' reasonable time ' and asked if this meant there had been a change in his circumstances .
But Rawsthorne replied : " I understand what you 're saying , but there 's been no change at all .
I cannot walk 20 yards without being in pain . "
" When I filled those forms in , hand on heart , that 's the way I was .
If I was to fill it in again , I would n't change it very much .
My worse days are worse now than in 1997 . "
He said he had wanted to take part in the race because he wanted to take his wife abroad for their 25th wedding anniversary and did not want ' two seats on the plane ' .
Rawsthorne said he had walked the entire race , apart from a ' jog ' at the beginning , and had stopped several times before being in tears at the end .
His wife Jane , a registered nurse , said he had difficulty getting out of the bath and was unable to peel vegetables .
Neil Grunfeld , defending , said : " I do n't think you can look at an isolated incident and say that , because he did that walk , his condition had changed . "
Deputy district judge Birrell , sentenced Rawsthorne to a six month conditional discharge .
There was no application for costs .
He accepted that he had not set out to be ' deliberately dishonest ' and said he could feel `proud ' having overcoming his pain to complete the race .
But he added : " Your physical improvement was manifested by the fact that , in 2007 , you could complete that 10 k walk , which was something you should have properly notified to the DWP . "
Roy Paul , North West Fraud Manager at the DWP , said after the hearing that the department would be seeking full repayment of the money .

Will Nuclear Fusion Solve the Energy Crisis ?
November 13th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I remember seeing the movie Chain Reaction back in 1996 and praying that nuclear fusion would become a reality in my lifetime .
And according to researchers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory ( LLNL ) in California , it just might .
At the facility ’s National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) , researchers are gearing up to test the potentially unlimited power source .
The NIF has almost finished construction on the world ’s largest laser .
After its completion in March 2009 , researchers will start to prepare for fusion ignition .
The first attempt is scheduled for 2010 , with nuclear fusion expected to occur in 2011 .
Once fusion is reached , researchers speculate that a pilot power generation plant could be ready as soon as 2020 , with commercialization following soon after .
Nuclear fusion — limitless , clean nuclear energy produced by combining atoms — has been a pipe dream for scientists and sci - fi geeks for decades .
Now it ’s no longer out of reach — just as long as we survive our immediate energy crisis intact .

Variety reports that the movie ’s score has been disqualified by the Academy .
It is now no longer eligible to be nominated .
It seems the Academy thinks too many people were involved in making Batman 's music .
Why that matters is a mystery , but apparently 5 names were listed as composers on the documentation they received from the studio .
Those three names are Hans Zimmer , James Newton Howard , Alex Gibson , Mel Wesson , and Lorne Balfe .
The last three people in that list have signed an affidavit stating that the score was primarily the work of Zimmer and Howard , but the Academy is n’t buying it .

Ever since TiVo came around , I was eager to jump on the time shifting bandwagon .
After all , nothing makes a productivity junkie happier than turning an hour - long show into forty minutes .
But for all its loyal fan base , TiVo never seemed like the right fit for me .
Advertisement
For my money , time , and , let 's be honest , the gratification of a solid DIY project , I 'm a big proponent of building your own digital video recorder ( DVR ) .
TiVo is pretty good at what TiVo does , but imagine a world where you can also tweak your TiVo to do anything you can do with any other computer .
With all the potential controversy and uncertainty surrounding TiVo firmware upgrades , the time to build your own DVR has never been better .
With your own DVR , you can get all the benefits of a TiVo and more without the recurring cost for subscription .
This week , I 'm going to show you how simple it is to turn your computer into a DVR .
After that , I 'll show you a few ways that I use my DVR to take it beyond TiVo .
Advertisement
Whether you 're using your current PC , repurposing an old one , or going all out on a dedicated DVR to put under your TV , you can get so much more out of your own DVR than you could ever get out of a TiVo .
NOTE : Keep in mind that the setup I used here is far from the only way to go .
After struggling for a while with how to put together an article that would work for everyone , I decided that I would just go ahead and describe how I do things .
The main purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to the world of DIY DVRs , hopefully planting the seed for the possibility of a world beyond TiVo .
On the other hand , if you do choose to take a route similar to the route I 've chosen , this should provide you with a good starting point .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
What you need
In order to put together your own DVR , you really only need to add two things to any given computer :
A TV capture card DVR software
Add the preceding two components to any PC and you 've got yourself a solid , fully - functional DVR ; it does n't get much more simple than that .

Choosing a capture card
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here

First things first .
If you 're going turn your TV into a DVR , you need a capture card .
A capture card is a USB or PCI device that you install on your computer that allows you to plug your TV cable into your computer the same way you would your TV .
There are plenty of cards available , but I 've had great experience with the Hauppauge PVR - 150 , the entry card in the Hauppauge line of cards .
To ease the load on your CPU , the Hauppauge PCI cards do the video encoding on the card , meaning TV recording will take up very few CPU cycles ( perfect for an older PC ) .
After you 've bought it , you are of course going to have to install your PCI card ( the Hauppauge PVR - 150 is the card I installed in this feature ) , which is easy enough to do .

Finding the right software
There are a lot of great software options for homebrew PVRs , like SageTV ( Windows and Linux , $ 80 ) , MythTV ( Linux , free ) , GB - PVR ( Windows , free ) , BeyondTV ( Windows , $ 70 ) , and Freevo ( Linux , free ) , to name a few of the most popular .

This image was lost some time after publication .
Although MythTV is probably the most powerful of these programs ( and it 's free ) , when all was said and done I chose SageTV for its feature set , stability , and Windows / Linux support .
Aside from its very active support forums , you can also get support directly from a real company , which is always a nice option .
Out of the box , SageTV installs as easily as any Windows program , and configuring your capture card with SageTV is a breeze .

Basically , if you 're looking for a quick and easy , no hassle PVR software , SageTV fits the bill .
In short , your PVR will be up and running in no time . [ 1 ]
However , keep in mind that one of the great parts about building a homebrew PVR is that you do have the option to tweak and fiddle to your heart 's content .
If that 's the case , there 's a lot more you can do with SageTV .
Extending SageTV
The following are all tweaks I 've made to my DVR .
Some are specific to SageTV , while others ( Remote control tweaking and Commercial skipping ) can be used with nearly any DVR software .

Customize your SageTV :
If you 're not happy with the default UI of SageTV , there are some beautiful user - designed packages that are easy to install .
The best one I 've found is called SageMC16x9 .

Commercial skipping : Automatic commercial detection and skipping is another great feature that 's pretty easy to get up and running , but there are a few different routes you can take .
The easiest option is to use the ComSkip program , but you may also want to try Show Analyzer .

Remote control tweaking : SageTV gives you a lot of flexibility for tweaking how your remote control works with SageTV , but there 's a lot you can do to tweak your IR remote to work with any program on your computer by editing the irrremote .ini file .
After all , it would n't be much of a DVR if you had to head for your mouse and keyboard every time you want to use a different program .
Since virtually every Windows program has keyboard shortcuts that allow for mouseless navigation , you can easily setup your remote to control them .
For example , the Hauppauge remote can handle pretty much any keyboard combination .

Launch external programs : With SageMC16x9 , you 've got an added menu option to launch external programs
The cool part about putting together your own DVR is that you 're only limited by your imagination , so with a little tweaking you can put together a DVR that perfectly fits your needs .
If you 've already built your own DVR , let us in on your setup .
TiVo users , fight back !
What can your TiVo do that my DVR can't ?

EU officials have agreed to a bill requiring twenty percent of Europe ’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020 .
The European Parliament reached a landmark deal on Tuesday by agreeing to meet 20 percent of Europe ’s energy needs with renewable sources by 2020 .
Meeting in Brussels in advance of the EU climate summit later this week in Poznan , Poland , representatives of 27 EU member states hammered out the bold agreement , despite it being almost derailed by two substantial challenges .
>> More on European energy policy
[ social_buttons ]
The renewables directive is part of a broader EU climate change strategy which aims to slash greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020 and make 20 percent cuts in energy use .
Having a meaningful piece of the energy puzzle in place before the climate talks later this week creates a strong policy foundation , making those difficult negotiations that much easier .
Greenpeace , traditionally at odds with the bulk of EU climate and energy policy , praised the agreement , all except for the biofuels portion of it .
And it was the biofuels portion of the directive that almost kept it from passing .
European Greens were strongly opposed to the biofuel mandate for transportation fuels , yet their opposition could not muster the kind of support needed to take it out of the bill .
“ We give the EU eight out of ten for its renewables deal .
This agreement is a new dawn for a clean energy future that will benefit the climate and the economy , ” said Frauke Thies , Greenpeace EU renewables policy campaigner in a statement .
“ The only drawback is that EU politicians are insisting on the large - scale promotion of biofuels .
They are not sufficiently protecting the planet from the ravages that can be caused by unsustainable biofuels , ” said Thies .
Other opposition to the renewables bill came from a coalition led by the Italians arguing that the feasibility of the targets should be reanalyzed in 2014 .
The Italian - led challenge was also defeated .
Part of reaching the aggressive climate targets will undoubtedly be to reduce energy demand and the EU also made progress in that area as environment ministers recently agreed to ban the use of incandescent light bulbs .

André Tchaikowsky on UK Royal Mail Postage Stamp - April 2011
From the Royal Mail website : " On 12 April [ 2011 ]
Royal Mail marks the 50th Anniversary of the Royal Shakespeare Company , with Stamps and a Miniature Sheet .
Working with the RSC , Royal Mail selected six RSC productions of Shakespeares plays from the last half century for the Stamps and created a Miniature Sheet which comprises four stamps showing the theatres where the RSC has performed in Stratford - upon - Avon through the years . "
As suggested above , one of these six stamps includes David Tennant ( Hamlet ) holding the skull of André Tchaikowsky and , thus , André now appears on a UK Royal Mail First Class Postage stamp !

Skull " Hamlet " Update - January 2010
From July to November , 2008 , the skull used in the graveyard scene in the Stratford Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) production of Hamlet was that of André Tchaikowsky , but the use of the skull was a secret .
When the production moved to London in December , 2008 , the secret got out and the RSC announced they would not use the skull for the London run .
However , this was not the case and the RSC continued to use André 's skull right through to the last performance on January 10 , 2009 .
Thus , André had his time on stage and was returned to a box in the RSC prop room , but for only for a short while because the BBC decided to make a TV dramatisation of the RSC production with David Tennant , and to once again use André 's skull .

David Tennant and the " skull "
' This is our Yorick .
He was a Polish composer and pianist called André Tchaikowsky .
And when he died , in the early eighties , he bequeathed his head to be used in a production of Hamlet with the Royal Shakepeare Company .
He wanted to play Yorick .
So here he is .
This is André .
He was introduced to us by our director Greg on the first day of rehearsals , as the final member of the company .
There was a variety of reactions to having a real human head in the production .
Some people find it quite difficult .
I must say , personally , I was rather excited by it .
It 's one of the clichés of the play now , an actor holding a skull .
And I suppose the trouble with the cliché is that it loses meaning .
But if you are presented with an actual person 's skull , a real bit of human , then Hamlet 's speech about Yorick and about staring at the skull of a man he knew well it becomes all the more potent when you are aware that you are holding somebody 's head quite literally in your hands .
There he is .
André was there .
I feel very pleased to have helped him fulfil his ambition . '

Story of the Skull - From the Biography
The following text is from the book , The Other Tchaikowsky - A Biographical Sketch of André Tchaikowsky , and describes what is known about the André 's donation of his skull to be used in Shakespeare theatrical productions of Hamlet .
The Skull Bequest
After André 's death , Terry and Eve Harrison went to André 's home to advise his neighbors of the unhappy news .
They found a will , written on October 10 , 1979 .
It seemed a standard document , except for the end of Clause 13 : 13 .
I HEREBY REQUEST that my body or any part thereof may be used for therapeutic purposes including corneal grafting and organ transplantation or for the purposes of medical education or research in accordance with the provisions of the Human Tissue Act 1961 and in due course the institution receiving it shall have my body cremated with the exception of my skull , which shall be offered by the institution receiving my body to the Royal Shakespeare Company for use in theatrical performance .
The bequest of André 's skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company was a surprise , but Terry and Eve were determined that André 's last wishes be honored .
Terry telephoned playwright Christopher Hampton ( " Les Liaisons Dangereuses " ) .
Hampton lived in Oxford and they had become friendly when André decided to undertake an opera based on Hampton 's play , " Total Eclipse . "
Hampton called a friend at the RSC , joint artistic director Terry Hands .
Terry Hands : " I was informed of the bequest immediately after André 's death and asked Christopher Hampton how seriously felt was the request .
It did seem serious .
André was passionate about Shakespeare and had attended many performances at the RSC .
We were honoured and we accepted .
It was agreed that when next we played Hamlet , it would be used . "
The funeral directors at Reeves and Pain who were handling the cremation refused to remove André 's head , and further , they believed such a bequest was illegal .
Terry contacted his legal advisors who in turn contacted the British Home Office .
The Home Office decided the bequest was not illegal and the RSC could accept the gift .
Reeves and Pain asked that the head be removed by a medical staff member at the hospital before they picked up the body .
This was done .
At virtually the last minute , Reeves and Pain was able to obtain André 's remains from the hospital , sans cranium , in time to prepare his ashes for the memorial service on July 2 .
The head was turned over to a museum for processing .
The memorial service for André Tchaikowsky was announced in a letter from Terry Harrison : André Tchaikowsky will be cremated at the Oxford Crematorium , Bayswater Road , Oxford , at 11 a.m. on Friday , July 2 .
We are following André 's wish that the service not be religious .
The cremation will be conducted by Chad Varah , the founder of The Samaritans and a very close friend of André's .
At the beginning of the ceremony we shall have a performance of André's Trio Notturno which will receive its world premiere at the Cheltenham Festival on the evening of July 4 .
It was recorded for André by the trio he wrote it for Peter Frankl , Gyorgy Pauk , and Ralph Kirshbaum -- three days before he died , and it was the last piece of music he heard .
At the end of the ceremony we shall playa recording of the adagio from Schubert 's Quintet in C major for Strings , Opus 163 , which André particularly loved .
The genesis of the skull bequest comes from a conversation between André and his manager , Terry Harrison .
André suggested to Terry that he would leave his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company so that they might have a real skull for Hamlet productions .
As Pascale Aebischer relates in her book , Shakespeare 's Violated Bodies , André 's skull might not be used in Hamlet because the actors always saw André instead of Yorick :
The extend of the skulls capacity for extrafictional reference and its concomitant potential to substantially influence the interpretation of the scene first became apparent to me when I began my research on Ron Danielss second RSC production [ in 1989 ] .
In the middle of a stack of archival material about the production , I found a memorandum , dated 9 May 1989 , that read :  If André Tchaikovsky isnt actually playing Yorick this year , please can we have his skull back in the Collection for future reference , or whatever you do with skulls of dead pianists .
The story I managed to piece together from this point of departure is the following .
In 1980 , André Tchaikovsky , an Oxford - based classical musician , saw Michael Penningtons performance of the role of Hamlet in Stratford - upon - Avon .
He was so taken by the macabre dialogue in the graveyard scene that on his way home to told his companion [ Terry Harrison ] of his intention to bequeath his skull to the RSC so that he - or at least a part of him - might appear as Yorick in a future production of Hamlet .
A few years later , the property department manager for the RSC , William Lockwood , received a call from an undertaker [ M. J. Duckworth for Reeves & Pain , Funeral Directors , Oxford ] who asked whether the RSC might be interested in the cranium of a deceased client .
Horrified , Mr. Lockwood passed the question on to Terry Hands ( at the time the RSCs artistic director ) , who promptly accepted the bequest .
A mere ten days later , to Lockwoods discomfiture and evident delight of the departments dog , Mr. Lockwood received a cardboard parcel containing the freshly processed golden - toothed skull of André Tchaikovsky .
After extensive airing [ two years on the roof of an RSC building ] , if found a provisional resting place on a shelf in the property department .
He briefly left the shelf for a photo- session with Roger Rees for the poster of Danielss 1984 production , but was immediately sent back to rest , a Fiberglas cast of his cranium taking his place in the theatre .
André Tchaikovskys first genuine chance to star as Yorick came only in 1989 , when Mark Rylance started to rehearse the title role of Hamlet in Danielss production .
A rehearsal note dated 13 February 1989 records :  Mark Rylance has asked whether it would be possible to use the real skull that was donated to the RSC as Yoricks skull ?
The property department complied , and Tchaikovsky appears to have spent one month in the rehearsal room preparing the role of Yorick .
On 23 March 1989 , however , the first indication of trouble is casually mentioned in a rehearsal note : we will be using the real skull for Yorick but will need a standby in case of accident .
What accident ?
Although Tchaikovsky must have been aware that playing Yorick would entail being knocked about the mazard with a sextons spade ( 5.1.85 -6 ) , Rylances desire to grant Tchaikovskys wish seems thus to have been paradoxically checked by a simultaneous desire to honour the dead .
Eventually , squeamishness about the rough handling of real human remains seems to have triumphed .
Claire van Kampen , the productions musical director and later Mark Rylances wife , remembers that :  As a company , we all felt most privileged to be able to work the gravedigger scene with a real skull ...
However , collectively as a group we agreed that as the real power of theatre lies in the complicity of illusion between actor and audience , it would be inappropriate to use a real skull during the performances , in the same way that we would not be using real blood , etc .
It is possible that some of us felt a certain primitive taboo about the skull , although the gravedigger , as I recall , was all for it !
On 7 April 1989 , a last rehearsal note records how Tchaikovsky was finally defeated in his quest for on - stage remembrance , although touchingly , the understudy to replace him was to be an exact look - alike :  We are no longer using the real skull as Yorick but would like to use a cast of it ( complete with teeth ) . 
In spite of his early retirement to the shelf in the property department , Tchaikovskys presence in the rehearsal room left a deep mark on the productions interpretation of the tragedys concluding moments .
The graveyard scene opened with the gravedigger ( played by Jimmy Gardner , the actor implicitly accused by van Dampen of having an inappropriate attitude towards Tchaikovskys remains ) using the skull as a pawn with which to illustrate the legal intricacies of Ophelias inquest , Rylances accusatory tone when his Hamlet commented that ,  That skull had a tongue in it , and could sing once ( 5.1.74 ) , while ostensibly referring to the ( at that point anonymous ) fictional owner of the skull within the world of the play , was charged with an additional , reproachful meaning in its reference to the two actors disagreement over the proper treatment of Tchaikovskys head .
When quizzing the gravedigger about the decomposition of bodies , Hamlet jumped into the grave to get a closer look at it all .
It was thus in the grave that was shortly to be Ophelias that he was handed Yoricks skull atop the Gravediggers spade , when as eleven years later in Lesters hands , it became a puppet that was mused over by a wistful Hamlet who strained to hear Yoricks silent answers to his question , making the skull come back to life as his chopfallen interlocutor .
The aimless existential despair of Rylances Hamlet was here converted into focused , intense mourning and tenderness for the skull .
Yorick seemed to have taken over the roles of the Ghost and Polonius as the old mole / perturbed spirit / foolish prating knave in the grave hovering on the brink between life and death , remembrance and oblivion .
Hamlets composure in his confrontation with Laertes in the graveyard seemed to spring out of this encounter with death and memory in the shape of Yorick , whom he lovingly carried into the next scene , his cradling of the cranium mirroring Laertess mournful rocking of Ophelias body in the grave .
Yorick was casually tucked under Hamlets arm during his dialogue with Osric , deposited on the floor for Hamlets handshake with Laertes and finally carefully set down on a mantelpiece , where Hamlet  turn[ed ] it so that its eyeless sockets faced the action , as a talisman during his duel with Laertes . 
How closely this performance choice was linked to Tchaikovskys presence in the rehearsal room is clear from van Kampens comment that  Probably it was this very realness [ of the skull ] that fired Mark [ Rylance ] s imagination to believe that the power of Hamlets fathers old jester was so great that , as a kind of talisman , or fetish , Hamlet takes him through Act V to his , Hamlets own death . 
The skull of Tchaikovsky and / or Yorick thus had the effect of doubling Hamlets quest for revenge and confrontation with death with Mark Rylances desire to honour the last will of Tchaikovsky , who became the companys own uncomfortable memento mori and its
Ghost clamouring for posthumous remembrance .
Because the property disturbingly kept its extrafictional and extratheatrical identity as the property ( in the sense of ownership ) of André Tchaikovsky the pianist , it resisted the companys attempted to appropriate it as an accessory .
Instead , it became an improper property  that defied theatrical decorum .
In a company such as the RSC that generally uses non-Grotowskian techniques , decorum dictates that theatrical signs which pertain to the human body ( by they objects such as bones or blood or physical expression such as pain or orgasm ) should stay at a distance from their referent , a distance which , as Claire van Kampen put it , is bridged by  the complicity of illusion between actor and audience .
Only when the real skull , with its real identity as André Tchaikovskys head , was replaced by an identical - looking fake was the company able to adopt the property as an iconic sign that could stand primarily for Yorick rather than Tchaikovsky .
Aebischer 's guess that it was the 1980 RSC Hamlet production that stirred André skull bequest could not be correct because the Will was signed in October , 1979 .
A better guess would be the 1979 production at the Old Vic Theatre in London , with Derek Jacobi as Hamlet .
Hamlet retained Yorick 's skull throughout subsequent scenes in the 1989 poduction , and it was eventually placed on a mantelpiece as a " talisman " during Hamlet 's final duel with Laertes .
Typical of the André Tchaikowsky obituary notices is one by Alan Blyth of The Daily Telegraph , which appeared on June 30 .
( All of the obituary notices contained errors , the most common of which were that both of his parents were killed during the war and that he was smuggled out of Poland to Paris . )
André Tchaikowsky , pianist and composer , died on the weekend in Oxford .
He was 46 , and although ill since the beginning of the year , he recovered sufficiently to resume playing in May .
He also managed to complete an opera based on " The Merchant of Venice . "
He was born in Warsaw on November 1 , 1935 .
Both his parents were killed under the Nazi occupation , but he was smuggled out to Paris .
After the War he studied there and also in his homeland before winning the coveted Chopin Prize in the Polish capital in 1955 , completing his studies with the Polish pianist , Stefan Askenase .
His British debut was in 1958 .
He decided to make his home in Britain while continuing to build an international career as a pianist with a wide - ranging repertory .
His particular loves were Bach and Mozart .
Over the past 20 years , he devoted about half his time to composing .
His list of works included the Piano Concerto written for Radu Lupu and given its first performance by him 10 years ago .
Apart from his opera , Tchaikowsky had also completed a Trio Notturno for piano trio .
It will be given its premiere at the Cheltenham Festival on Monday .
His playing tended to be ebullient and full of an instinctive feeling for the style of the composer .
He was an inveterate follower of his fellow pianists and until his last illness could be seen at practically every recital of note in London .
In Germany , a Frankfurt newspaper reported : Composer and Pianist -- The Death of André Tchaikowsky
The well - known and highly regarded pianist André Tchaikowsky died from cancer on June 26 at the age of 46 , near his home in Oxford .
He was one of the most talented pianists of his generation , and a Mozart player of the first rank , with individual and subjective interpretations in comparison to the " classic " interpretations .
Tchaikowsky gave to his performances a rare feeling of color and contour .
His Chopin playing was witty , often with strong rubato and changes in tempi -- sometimes a bit over the top -- but always revealing the structure of the composition .
To summarize , André Tchaikowsky thought musically first , and pianistically second .
In Poland , André 's passing was memorialized with a series of seven radio programs of two hours each .
The programs , organized by Jan Weber of Polish Radio , included André as pianist , and André as composer , interspersed with interviews of his friends , in particular , with Halina Wahlmann - Janowska , who read portions of the letters she had received over the many years of their correspondence .
Although André never returned to Poland after 1956 , he remained well - known there , and interest in both his piano playing and composing has remained high .
The museum entrusted with André 's skull returned it , processed , to Reeves and Pain on July 18 .
Reeves and Pain then reported to Terry Harrison on July 22 , " André 's skull was delivered to the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford - Upon - Avon on Tuesday , 20th July . "
Up to this point , the bequest had remained private .
Mr. Duckworth , funeral director at Reeves and Pain , was interested in publishing the story of André 's skull in a funeral directors ' professional magazine and asked Terry Harrison for his opinion .
Terry responded on August 4 : Eve and I have no objections to your reporting the bequest of André 's skull in your professional magazine .
However , could you let me know whether you would particularly want to use his name , or were you thinking the deceased would be nameless ?
My present thought is that we would not mind his name being used , but I would just like to think about that point a little more .
Terry was n't permitted the luxury of further thinking .
Someone informed the press about the strange bequest and the story hit , first , the London papers , then the international news services , in particular the Associated Press .
The news of André 's skull quickly spread worldwide , from the US to Australia and beyond .
Mr. Duckworth wrote an immediate letter to Terry Harrison assuring him that Reeves and Pain was not responsible for the news leak .
Terry responded on August 24 : I was away for two weeks so missed the news escaping about André 's skull .
My secretary Claire heard the broadcast of this news item on Independent Radio and she told me she did n't think it was offensive .
I would have preferred that the news had not come out , but quite honestly I do n't think it is particularly bad that people know , as André was rather an extraordinary person and it would have touched his sense of whimsy to know that he caused some consternation .
So do n't worry about the matter .
I presume it must have been leaked by somebody connected with the hospital .
A sampling of the newspaper articles suggests the stir caused by Andrés final eccentricity .
From The Times in London on August 14 : Pianists Skull Waits in Wings Mr. André Tchaikowsky , the Polish - born concert pianist , asked in his will that his skull be given to the Royal Shakespeare Company for use in future productions of Hamlet .
Mr. Michael Duckworth , a partner in Reeves and Pain , an Oxford firm of undertakers , said Mr. Tchaikowsky , who died at his home near Oxford in June , apparently had a lifelong ambition to be an actor .
The RSC said the skull had been delivered and would be stored .
The company does not have plans to stage " Hamlet " in the immediate future .
From The Daily Telegraph in London on August 14 by Anthony Hopkins : Hamlet Gets a Skull in Bequest " This same skull , sir , was Yorick 's skull , the King 's jester . "
" Alas , poor Yorick .
I knew him , Horatio : a fellow of infinite jest . " --
Hamlet A man who nursed a lifelong ambition to go on the stage has bequeathed his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company for use in productions of " Hamlet . "
Mr. André Tchaikowsky , a concert pianist and composer , died at his home at Cumnor , near Oxford , in June , aged 46 .
Now his skull has been delivered in a box to the RSC .
A spokesman for Mr. Terry Hands , the RSC 's joint artistic director , said that Mr. Tchaikowsky had been an avid Shakespeare enthusiast with a love of the stage .
" We were staggered when the executors of the Will asked if we wanted the skull . "
Mr. Michael Duckworth , a partner in the undertaking firm of Reeves and Pain , said : " Mr. Tchaikowsky 's friends and executors desperately wanted to fulfill his wishes and we are here to do what we can for our clients . "
The RSC has no immediate plans for a production of " Hamlet . "
" But when we stage it again we hope to use Mr. Tchaikowsky 's skull , " said a spokesman .
Meanwhile , the skull , still in its box , is in store at the RSC 's headquarters in Stratford - upon - Avon .
In 1984 , the Royal Shakespeare Company did produce " Hamlet . "
Actor Roger Rees ( Hamlet ) remembers the situation : '' I 'm afraid André 's skull was not used directly on stage for the actual production of ' Hamlet . '
We found long ago that a real head is too fragile to be used in the rather rough - handling gravedigger scene , so we use plastic skulls which hold up better .
However , the RSC was delighted to have a real skull for their various needs .
When they first got the skull , they put it outdoors for a few months , in the sunlight , to dry it out completely and to bleach it bone white .
" The skull was used as part of the ' Hamlet ' poster for the 1984 production in Stratford and the 1985 production in London .
I had to pose for this poster , two hours a day , for three days running .
In my hands , I hold a skull , and that 's André 's skull .
The artist was Phillip Core and he remarked that it must be a real skull because it still had bits of gristle around the ear ports , and various places .
So indirectly , André 's skull was used for Hamlet . "
André , of course , had never wanted to be an actor on the stage .
He was , instead , a great enthusiast of theater and loved the works of Shakespeare .
But what was the real reason for the bequest ?
When his friends heard about the skull , no one seemed surprised .
" Typical André , " was the comment most often heard .
Michael Menaugh remembers : " Unfortunately , the fact of the skull will not go away for any of us .
It is something that ultimately we have all to come to terms with , to reconcile with the André we knew and loved .
I do n't think André realized the effect such a bequest would have , both on his friends and on his own reputation .
André did n't always understand that the world of ideas and the world of real people , real reactions and real events just did not coincide .
" He had spoken to me of leaving his skull for the RSC to use in Hamlet back in 1966 when he wrote the music for my Oxford Hamlet .
In my undergraduate way , I thought the idea wonderfully entertaining .
When a great actor may hold the skull of a real man , a real man who ' set the table on a roar , ' a wonderful man who had his ' gibes and gambols and songs , ' when that great actor says , ' A fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy , ' might not that electrifying flash of truth ( transmitted by the actor ) light up the play ?
André would have liked that idea , I think . "
November 2008 to January 2009 Update
After more than 25 years in the wings , André 's wish to appear in Shakespeare 's play Hamlet as the skull of Yorick was realized at last .
The Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) 2008 production of Hamlet used André 's skull from July to November in Stratford , but then declined to use it when the production moved to London in December , 2008 , because the secret use of the skull had been revealed .
From the Telegraph newspaper ( London ) , November 22 , 2008 , an ( abridged ) article by Vicki Reid : David Tennant : from Doctor Who to Hamlet
There is one intriguing story about the production that among all the mayhem has managed to remain untold .
During the run , the company has played each performance with an extra member .
On the first day of rehearsals the cast was introduced to a real skull - that of André Tchaikowsky , a Polish composer who settled in Oxford , where he continued to compose and visited Stratford often .
He died of cancer in 1982 at the age of 46 , and bequeathed his skull to the RSC , where it sat in a box in the props department , before Doran decided he was going to use it .
He hoped it might bring the cast closer to the text : ' This play has to touch something in us - we have to face our own mortality , and Hamlet has to face that .
It was sort of a little shock tactic , though , of course , to some extent that wears off and it's just André , in his box . '
Doran did n't want the story to get out before Hamlet opened .
' I thought it would topple the play and it would be all about David acting with a real skull .
' Tennant was delighted to be fulfilling Tchaikowsky 's wishes .
' When I heard he had done this , ' he says , ' I thought , that 's brilliant , that 's what I 'm going to do , but apparently you can't any more , the law 's been changed . '
David Smith wrote for the Guardian and The Observer on Nov. 23 , 2008 : Pianist 's skull plays the jester ' Alas , poor Yorick , ' laments Hamlet , holding up the skull of the King 's late jester .
The gravedigger scene in the hit production of Hamlet starring David Tennant can claim unprecedented realism .
For each night Tennant is holding aloft a genuine skull .
The extra cast member is André Tchaikowsky , a Polish concert pianist and composer who , after his death from cancer in 1982 , bequeathed his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in the hope of achieving his acting dream .
The skull sat in a box in the props department , virtually untouched for 25 years , until director Gregory Doran retrieved it for its stage debut .
Tchaikowsky 's posthumous performance , which it is safe to assume makes up in consistency what it lacks in expressiveness , was kept secret when the show opened in Stratford - upon - Avon , where there was already massive hype around Doctor Who star Tennant .
Tchaikowsky emigrated from Poland to Oxford in 1939 , when he was four , and was a frequent visitor to Stratford .
He died at the age of 46 and left a will requesting that his organs be used for medical purposes , ' with the exception of my skull , which shall be offered by the institution receiving my body to the Royal Shakespeare Company for use in theatrical performance ' .
The Home Office decided the bequest was not illegal and the RSC could accept the gift .
The company put the skull outdoors for a few months so the sunlight would dry it out completely .
Actor Mark Rylance spent a month rehearsing with the skull when he played Hamlet in 1989 , but 'eventually , squeamishness about the rough handling of real human remains seems to have triumphed . '
Seventeen years later , however , Doran decided to take the plunge .
' It was sort of a little shock tactic ... though , of course , to some extent that wears off and it's just André , in his box , ' he said .
Debbie Waite wrote for the Oxford Mail on Nov. 26 , 2008 : Skull gets starring role An Oxford man has achieved his dying wish to have his skull used in Hamlet  26 years after he donated it to the Royal Shakespeare Company .
Concert pianist André Tchaikowskys skull lay unused in a box , because actors shied away from performing with it on stage .
But now it has been revealed Dr. Who actor David Tennant held the skull aloft during the famous ' Alas , poor Yorick ' scene in a 22 - show run at the theatre in Stratford - upon - Avon .
Mr. Tchaikowsky , a Holocaust survivor who came to Oxford after the Second World War , made it a condition of his will to give the body part away in the hope it would be used in a theatrical performance .
Despite being used in rehearsals , the skull had never been in a stage performance until Hamlet director Greg Doran retrieved it from its protective box in the RSCs climate - controlled archives .
The play moves to London next week but it is yet to be decided if Mr. Tennant will use the skull there .
Mr. Tchaikowskys family were delighted his skull had at long last been used on stage .
Mr. Tchaikowsky , who lived in Cumnor , regularly attended performances in Stratford before his death from cancer at the age of 46 .
David Howells , curator of the archives , said :  It has never been used on stage before .
In 1989 the actor Mark Rylance rehearsed with it for quite a while but he couldnt get past the fact it wasnt Yoricks , it was André Tchaikowskys .
That , and the fear of an accident and it being slightly macabre , was why they decided not to use it and used an exact replica . 
The RSC had to apply for special permission to use the skull from the Human Tissue Authority , as it is less than 100 years old .
Mr. Doran , who made the decision to use it , explained why he didnt want anyone to know .
He said :  I thought it would topple the play and it would be all about David acting with a real skull .
It was sort of a little shock tactic , though , of course , to some extent that wore off and it was just André , in his box .
In Hamlet , a gravedigger unearths the skull of jester Yorick , prompting Hamlet to deliver the line :  Alas , poor Yorick !
I knew him , Horatio : a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy . 
Dave Ferre , a friend of the Tchaikowsky family , said :  That was Andrés dream and this is great news .
The family will be pleased .
Richard Faulks , the current manager of the Reeves and Pain Funeral Directors in Oxford , which dealt with Mr. Tchaikowskys request , was surprised to hear about the intriguing tale .
He said :  Unfortunately the funeral director Michael Duckworth is no longer with us , but I have been back through our records and we still have the forms relating to Mr. Tchaikowsky .
It has been very interesting reading about him  he sounds like quite a personality .
We re delighted to learn that his dying wishes have at last been realised .
From the Associated Press by writer Robert Barr : Human skull used in British Hamlet production LONDON ( AP ) - A Polish pianist has made his stage debut in Britain , 26 years after his death .
André Tchaikowsky 's skull featured in performances of " Hamlet " by the Royal Shakespeare Company between July and November [ 2008 ] , company spokeswoman Nada Zakula said Wednesday .
It was the first time the skull was used in a performance - his expressed wish - though the company had used in rehearsals since it was donated in 1982 .
Tchaikowsky 's 1979 will had asked that his skull be offered to the Royal Shakespeare Company " for use in theatrical performance . "
" We hope that he would have been pleased that his final wish has been realized , " company curator David Howells said .
It was unclear if the skull would be used when the company 's production moves from its base in Stratford - upon - Avon to London on Dec. 3 , Zakula said .
Tchaikowsky , a fan of William Shakespeare 's plays , had finished orchestrating all but 24 bars of his operatic adaptation of " The Merchant of Venice " when he died from stomach cancer on June 26 , 1982 .
News of his unique bequest became known soon after .
" He was passionate about Shakespeare and attended many performances , " Terry Hands told the AP in 1982 when he was joint artistic director of the company .
" We are honored by his bequest . "
Andrzej Czajkowski was born in 1935 in the Polish capital of Warsaw as Robert Andrzej Krauthammer , but was given his new name on false identity documents used to smuggle him out of Nazi- occupied Warsaw in 1942 , according to a Web site dedicated to the musician .
December 2008 Update
Once the RSC had made the decision to not use the skull in the London Hamlet production , other news articles appeared .
[ Note that the RSC actually continued to use André 's skull . ]
Typical is that from this December 3rd , 2008 article posted on Yahoo News : Skull dropped after secret revealed A human skull will no longer be used in the Royal Shakespeare Company 's ( RSC's )
Hamlet in case it distracts the audience , the theatre company said .
The skull of Polish pianist André Tchaikowsky was used throughout the play 's recent run in Stratford - upon - Avon , but the unusual prop will be dropped when it opens in London 's West End , the RSC said .
Audiences in Stratford were unaware the skull in the play belonged to the pianist , who had bequeathed it to the RSC in 1982 for this purpose , a spokeswoman said .
But the secret spilled out when actor David Tennant , who plays Hamlet , revealed it in a newspaper interview .
The RSC told Channel 4
News that now the secret is out , it would be " too distracting for the audience " if the skull was used .
Substituting the real skull for a fake one will also stop the RSC having to gain permission from the Human Tissue Authority , which it needed before using the real one in Stratford , the spokeswoman added .
" We never planned to use the real one in the London run , " she said .
In the Stratford production , Tennant held the skull aloft in the " Alas poor Yorick " scene of the play , fulfilling the dying wish of Mr. Tchaikowsky - a Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust but died of cancer aged 46 .
His former agent and friend Terry Harrison told Channel 4 News he was " disappointed " by the decision to abandon the real skull .
The Telegraph reports David Tennant out until at least Christmas and undergoes surgery for a back problem .
He is replaced by Edward Bennett for all of December .
However , on January 4th , 2009 , Tennant returns for the last 6 days of performances to superlative reviews .
November 2009 Update
From the Telegraph of November 24 , 2009 : David Tennant to revive partnership
with real skull for BBC's Hamlet David Tennant is to revive his partnership with a real human skull for a new BBC film version of Shakespeare 's Hamlet .
The skull had starred in a stage run of the classic production last year after pianist Andre Tchaikowsky left his remains to the Royal Shakespeare Company in the hope it would be used on stage .
Now it is being used in a TV dramatisation of the RSC production to be screened this Christmas .
The boss of the RSC admitted that the company secretly used the skull during the play 's London run , despite the company saying at the time it was to use a fake .
Tennant held the skull on stage during the famed '' Alas , poor Yorick ' ' scene for more than 20 performances at the Courtyard Theatre , in Stratford - upon - Avon .
The outgoing Doctor Who star was lauded for his performance in the production and it has now been filmed for BBC2 .
Greg Doran , who directed the stage and TV versions said : '' Yes , Andre appears in the film - as in fact he did throughout both the Stratford and the London runs . ''
He explained : '' I did n't allow news that he transferred to London to be leaked out , as we did not want audiences to be unnecessarily distracted by what had then become a bit of a news story .
'' Andre Tchaikowsky 's skull was a very important part of our production of Hamlet , and despite all the hype about him , he meant a great deal to the company .
'' Yorick 's skull , and Hamlet 's lament to him , is probably one of the most famous icons in Shakespeare , and one most frequently satirised and misquoted .
It was through Andre that the company tried to get beyond those clichés , to investigate something deeper .
'' You can't hold a real human skull in your hand and not be moved by the realisation that your own skull sits just beneath your skin , that you will be reduced to that state at some stage .
That is what Yorick 's skull does to Hamlet .
It reminds him of the very real presence of Death in Life .
Andre 's skull was a profound momento mori , which perhaps no prop skull could quite provide . ''
Composer and concert pianist Tchaikowsky died of cancer in 1982 at the age of 46 , donating his body for medical science .
But he also requested that his skull be offered to the RSC to be used on stage .
Although it had been used in rehearsals , actors did not feel comfortable using his head in front of an audience .
Mark Rylance used a cast of Tchaikowsky 's skull 20 years ago after initially practising his performance with the real thing .
The musician 's remains then went back to a box until the skull was used by Tennant .
It had to be given a special license for use and a stand - in had to be used until permission was given .
Doran said : '' When the Human Tissues Authority ( HTA ) license had not arrived by the evening of the Dress rehearsal in Stratford last July , and we had to place Andre back in his box , our Theatre Collections Curator , David Howells , allowed us to use another skull he had in the collection , which as it was more than 100 years old , did not come under the jurisdiction of the HTA .
'' It was the skull used as Yorick by Edmund Kean in 1813 .
A piece of theatre history happened that night on the Stratford stage as David Tennant , a 21st century Hamlet , stared into the empty eye sockets that a nineteenth century Hamlet had used .
For those of us watching , a little shiver of connection occurred . ''
Doran , who is also chief associate director of the RSC , added : '' I suspect Andre would have been amused by the fact that his cranium became a question on Have I got News for You ? , but his bequest to the RSC was deeply sincere .
' I hope other productions may , with the greatest respect for Andre , use the skull as he intended it to be used , for precisely this purpose . ''
December 2009 Update
From the Jewish Daily Forward of December 8 , 2009 by Benjamin Ivry : ' Alas , Poor Andrzej ' : The Strange Case
of Tchaikowsky 's Skull The admission by Londons Royal Shakespeare Company that , despite previous disavowals , a production of  Hamlet featured not only Dr Who actor David Tennant , but also a real human skull onstage  as Hamlets deceased friend the jester Yorick  brings the donor of that skull back into the limelight .
The Polish - Jewish pianist Andrzej Czajkowski ( who performed as André Tchaikowsky ) , born Robert Andrzej Krauthammer in 1935 bequeathed his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company to be used as Yorick after he died prematurely of colon cancer at age 46 .
Until the most recent  Hamlet ,  no production had the kishkas to do so , and even now , the theatre ( deceptively , as it turned out ) claimed to withdraw the skull after it proved a distraction to audiences , supposedly replacing it with a plastic replica .
In fact , Czajkowskis skull was used all along , including in a soon - to - be - seen BBC filmed version of the play .
Czajkowski , a Warsaw Ghetto survivor and greatly talented performer and composer ( whose few recordings are all available for online listening at the tribute site andretchaikowsky.com ) thus has a weird posthumous triumph , which ranks him as a pianist comparably gifted to , but even more eccentric than , Glenn Gould .
Czajkowskis spirited , mysterious recordings of Mozart ; dazzling Chopin ; witty Haydn ; and warm - hearted Schubert won many admirers , including Arthur Rubinstein , an early mentor .
Yet most were ultimately turned off by his oddball behavior , which included erratic attendance at scheduled performances and recording sessions , and when he did show up he would pull stunts like at one concert , improvising an endlessly percussive , out - of - style Bartok - like cadenza to a Mozart concerto until the unnamed conductor shouted  Enough !  and made the orchestra play loudly to cut him off .
When challenged about such off - putting deeds , Czajkowski would refer to the difficulty of his childhood , when he was smuggled out of the Ghetto .
By the end of his life , too , the social repressiveness of Thatcherism in the UK must also have irked Czajkowski , who led a flamboyantly gay life .
An intermittently gifted composer , Czajkowskis best works , like his  Trio Notturno allowed him to express some of the darker inner aspects .
Apart from his genuine devotion to Shakespeare and particularly  Hamlet ,  Czajkowskis macabre donation may be seen in the optic of this darkness , a sort of desperate theatricality visible in other Polish creators like the author Tadeusz Borowski , an Auschwitz survivor .
Fortunately , Czajkowskis artistry has survived magnificently , and he will be remembered for what went on in his head not just because of his polished up headbone on stage .
Joe Walker , creator of Direct Web Remoting ( DWR ) , has been summing up the reasons that as he thinks have lead the Web to become the default development platform over the last years .
Easy of deployment , simple UI programming , simplicity of HTML and Openness made the Web become the most scalable system today .
Joe starts off by making his point about the Web being the default development platform :
10 years ago the default was probably VB6 / Windows , these days it ’s just the web .
Jeff Huber , Google ’s vice president of engineering , has also advocated in the past that the Web is the dominant platform :
A lot that you have heard here is about platforms and who is going to win .
That is Paleolithic thinking .
The Web has already won .
The web is the Platform .
Joe explains that the Web has ( almost ) none of the common installation issues :
Zero install saves time , builds trust , reduces clicks and confusion , saves space and is much easier to use .
He goes on by praising the simplicity of the Web UIs :
HTML makes it hard to create overlapping windows , complex dialogs , hidden options , deep menu structures - all the things that can make traditional applications harder to use .
It 's easy , when someone does n't ' get ' an application , to think that they 've got a problem , and that they need a training course .
Joe continues with the notion of “ Lazy Text ” :
Lazy
Text means that web pages are : hackable .
Which means advanced users can scrape , mash and plot , and normal users can embed YouTube videos in their blogs .
.
Which means advanced users can scrape , mash and plot , and normal users can embed YouTube videos in their blogs .
debuggable .
When makes them easier to fix , even outside of the development environment .

Postel ’s Law compliant .
Which means they work .
Postel ’s
Law makes browsers harder to write , can makes pages a mess and is a disaster for security , but there are no exceptions to Postel ’s Law
The last quality that Joe finds in the Web Platform is its Openness :
Creating the development platform for the world is quite a responsibility .
It would be a mistake to give it to Dr. Evil .
There are degrees of openness , and while the web is not in the ideal position , it does appear that there are forces currently taking it in that direction .
Joe thinks that all these reasons have lead the Web to scale easily and this is the reason for it becoming the most widely used platform today :
Zero Install means that the web will scale to billions of pages .
Lazy
Text means that the web will scale to millions of developers .
A Simple UI Model means that the web will scale to billions of users .
Openness means that the web will scale to thousands or millions of enablers ( the creators of browsers , servers , development tools , etc )
For a reference as to how big the Web has become , the Google Index these days handles about 1 trillion unique URLs , from the 1 billion it handled at the start of the millennium :
We 've known it for a long time : the web is big .
The first Google index in 1998 already had 26 million pages , and by 2000 the Google index reached the one billion mark .
Over the last eight years , we 've seen a lot of big numbers about how much content is really out there .
Recently , even our search engineers stopped in awe about just how big the web is these days -- when our systems that process links on the web to find new content hit a milestone : 1 trillion ( as in 1,000,000,000,000 ) unique URLs on the web at once !

January 1 , 2008
As the new year begins , the United States is faced with an accelerating economic crisis .
The price of oil will soon top $ 100 a barrel for the first time in history , driven by rising demand in the developed world and in India and China — and by the prospect of continuing Middle Eastern uncertainties .
Although the fact will not be established for another year , when the National Bureau of Economic Research issues its December 2008 report , the U.S. economy has entered a recession .
The catalyzing event is the collapse of the subprime - mortgage market .
During the past 12 months there have been nearly 1.3 million foreclosure filings .
The losses flow upward .
In March , J. P. Morgan Chase and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provide massive emergency loans to prevent a default by Bear Stearns , one of the nation ’s largest financial institutions ; Bear Stearns is ultimately absorbed by J. P. Morgan .
A cascade of economic woe ensues .
Some regulators had been warning for years about the threat posed by bad mortgages and the housing market , but steps to tighten the rules were successfully opposed by lenders .
Robert Shiller ,
Yale economist who warned of a housing bubble :
The Bush strategists were aware of the public enthusiasm for housing , and they dealt with it brilliantly in the 2004 election by making the theme of the campaign the ownership society .
Part of the ownership society seemed to be that the government would encourage home ownership and , therefore , boost the market .
And so Bush was playing along with the bubble in some subtle sense .
I do n’t mean to accuse him of any — I think it probably sounded right to him , and the political strategists knew what was a good winning combination .
I do n’t think that he was in any mode to entertain the possibility that this was a bubble .
Why should he do that ?
Attention was n’t even focused on this .
If you go back to 2004 , most people were just — they thought that we had discovered a law of nature : that housing , because of the fixity of land and the growing economy and the greater prosperity , that it ’s inevitable that this would be a great investment .
It was taken for granted .
John C. Dugan , comptroller of the currency A lot of mortgages got made to people who could not afford them and on terms that would get progressively worse over time , and that created the seeds of an even bigger problem .
As the whole market became even more dependent on house - price appreciation , when house prices flattened and then started to decline the whole situation began to unravel .
The question you have to ask yourself :
Why did credit become so easy ?
Why would lenders make mortgages that became increasingly less likely to be repaid ?
Part of the answer is that there was a huge chunk of the mortgage market that was not regulated to any significant extent .
The overwhelming proportion of subprime loans were being done in entities that were not banks and not regulated as banks —
I ’m talking here about mortgage brokers and non-bank mortgage lenders that could originate these mortgages and then sell them to Wall Street firms that could package them into new kinds of mortgage securities , which arguably could take into account the lower credit risks and still be salable to investors worldwide .
Unfortunately , the theory was not in accord with the reality .
Although they thought they had accurately gauged that risk , they too were in fact depending — when you get to the bottom of it — on house prices continuing to go up and up and up .
And they did not .
Henry Paulson , secretary of the Treasury : I easily could imagine and expected there to be financial turmoil .
But the extent of it , O.K. , I was naïve in terms of — I knew a lot about regulation but not nearly as much as I needed to know , and I knew very little about regulatory powers and authorities .
I just had not gone into it in that kind of detail .
This ’ll be the longest we ’ve gone in recent history without there being turmoil , and given all the innovation in the private pools of capital and the over - the - counter derivatives and the excesses around the world , we figured that when there was turmoil , and these things were tested for the first time by stress , it would be more significant than anything else .

Paying the poor to conserve forests through a market scheme is the new star among initiatives in climate talks .
UXBRIDGE , Canada , Dec 15 ( Tierramérica ) .-
Climate experts meeting in Poznan , Poland , promised to create a new pot of carbon - credit gold for the rural poor as guardians of rural lands and forests .
But there are many who warn that the gold will flow only to corporate interests .
One of the most effective ways to combat climate change , caused by gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the atmosphere , is through biological sequestration of carbon in plants , trees and soils .
That means reducing deforestation , increasing reforestation , and utilizing sustainable agriculture and grazing practices that conserve soil and water .
If these activities become part of a multi-billion - dollar global carbon finance regime , under a new 2009 climate treaty , there could be extraordinary benefits for the rural poor and the environment , according to Olav Kjørven , the former director of the United Nations Development Program ’s ( UNDP ) Energy and Environment Group .
“ Enabling the poor to tap that new potential income , however , implies providing the legal tools and protection to reap the benefits of their good stewardship , ” Kjørven states in the report “ Opportunities in Environmental Stewardship : Climate Change and Legal Empowerment of the Rural Poor , ” coauthored with Estelle Fach .
Delegates from more than 190 countries met Dec. 1 - 12 in Poznan to hammer out some of the final details for a new climate treaty under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .
Targeted for completion in Copenhagen late next year , the new climate treaty will be the successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which has been in force since 2005 and expires in 2012 .
A new Copenhagen treaty will require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from all countries and create an adaptation fund to help poor countries implement sustainable economies and adapt to the impacts of climate change .
“ It is essential to ensure that future , market - based financing mechanisms under the Climate Change Convention will not exclude the rural poor , but work for their benefit , ” Kjørven told Tierramérica .

A couple weeks ago on Twitter I said : “ I still maintain the Drudge Report is one of the best designed sites on the web .
Has been for years . ”
A few people agreed , but most did n’t .
Some thought it was a joke .
I was n’t kidding .
To clarify , my definition of design goes beyond aesthetic qualities and into areas of maintenance , cost , profitability , speed , and purpose .
However , I still think that the Drudge Report is an aesthetic masterpiece even though I also consider it ugly .
Can good design also be ugly ?
I think Drudge proves it can .
Here are a few reasons , in no particular order , why I think The Drudge Report is one of the best designed sites on the web .
People talk about timeless design all the time .
But most things people point to that are timeless end up being time stamped .
The Drudge Report , on the other hand , has proven timeless .
It ’s generic list of links , black and white monospaced font , and ALL CAPS headlines have survived every trend , every fad , every movement , every era , every design do or do n’t .
It does n’t look old and it does n’t look new — it looks Drudge .
It has n’t changed since at least 1997 , and I believe the design goes back even further .
How many sites can survive — and thrive — unchanged for a decade ?
That ’s special .
It ’s straightforward
There are no tricks , no sections , no deep linking , no special technology required .
It ’s all right there on one page .
“ But it ’s a mess ! ” you could say .
I ’d say “ it ’s straightforward mess . ”
I would n’t underestimate the merit in that .
It ’s unique
When you ’re on the Drudge Report you ’re on the Drudge Report .
There ’s no question where you are .
The design has become iconic .
How many other news sites can claim that ?
If you pull the logo off some of the other major news sites / networks ( CNN , MSNBC , FOX News , ABC News , CBS News , etc. ) you may have a hard time distinguishing them from one another .
They all sorta blend into the same standard news - site look and feel .
There are a few standouts , but even the NYT and the WSJ are n’t that unique .
Drudge ’s design stands alone .
This is important
Many news sites have lost their balls .
They ’re afraid to really call out one big story .
They may have a leading headline , but it ’s not all that obvious or different from the others .
It may be a font size or two bigger , but it ’s not confident .
They hedge .
Drudge , on the other hand , says “ this is the story of the moment ” with a huge headline .
This is what ’s important in the news right now and nothing else even comes close .
Drudge is n’t afraid to be an opinionated editor and his site design perfectly emphasizes that .
It ’s bold , it ’s risky , and it ’s pure Drudge design .
It ’s good cluttered
The Drudge Report usually leads with a “ font size = + 7 ” ALL CAPS headline in Arial .
Sometimes it ’s italicized .
Sometimes , for something big big , he ’ll cap it off with the infamous siren .
After that you have three columns .
Some headlines are sentence case , some are ALL CAPS .
Some have photos , some are just a plain text headline .
Sometimes more controversial or sensational headlines are colored red .
There ’s usually a big ad at the top and a few other ads sprinkled among the columns .
Stories are n’t grouped or organized except probably more interesting ones up top .
And that ’s it .
Your eye darts all over the place looking around for something that looks interesting .
The design encourages wandering and random discovery .
The site feels like a chaotic newsroom with the cutting room floor exposed .
I think that ’s part of the excitement — and good design .
Breaking news is breaking news
Have you seen “ breaking news ” on MSNBC or CNN lately ?
Almost anything can pass for breaking news now .
“ So and so speaks to the press about this or that ” is now breaking news .
Breaking news used to mean something seriously big and important or spectacular just happened .
But the major news sites have watered it way down .
When I hit MSNBC or CNN , and they have a “ breaking news ” bar ( red/ yellow usually ) , it ’s easy to ignore because they ’ve cried wolf one too many times .
But when you see a big honking red ALL CAPS headline with the flashing siren on Drudge , you know it ’s newsworthy .
One guy can run it
The site is run by Matt Drudge full time with help from an occasional part - time contributor .
If the site was 5 pages or 10 pages or 30 pages , he ’d likely need additional people and technology to manage it all .
No news is the news
The Drudge Report is a headline site .
There ’s no “ content ” on the site .
Yet , that ’s news .
The headlines themselves can be news .
Drudge breaks stories without writing stories .
In fact , The Drudge Report may be one of the only sites on the web that can break a story with just a headline or a photo .
That ’s baked right into the design .
It sends people away to keep them coming back
There ’s actually no content on the Drudge Report .
Well , sometimes he will post an email or a memo on his site , but it ’s 99 % links out to other news sources .
His site is designed to send you away to bring you back .
The more often you hit his site to go somewhere else the more often you ’ll return to go somewhere else again .
You visit the Drudge Report more because you leave the Drudge Report more .
This is one of the secrets to building traffic :
The more you send people away the more they ’ll come back .
It ’s fast
When you visit The Drudge Report , you get the Drudge report .
There are no interstitial ads .
There ’s no load time .
There ’s no buffering .
There ’s nothing but instant content .
The Drudge Report is Google - fast and Craigslist fast — quite a feat for a site that does 3,000,000 uniques a month run by one guy .
BTW : Those 3,000,000 uniques a month translate into hundreds of millions of visits a month ( source : CNN ) .
It ’s cheap to maintain
The design of the Drudge Report does n’t require a fancy CMS or , in fact , any CMS at all .
It ’s edited by hand .
His overhead is probably a couple grand a month max .
A few thousand bucks a year in overhead that generates a few million a year in revenue .
That ’s good design .
It ’s one page
The Drudge Report is one page .
Every visit and every visitor is focused on that one page with a headline and three columns .
He knows exactly what people are going to see , he knows exactly how people are going to see it .
There ’s no mystery page here that has n’t been redesigned or mystery page there that ’s throwing an error .
It ’s one page to look at at one page to work on .
It is what it is .
It does n’t try too hard to be something it ’s not .
It makes him a great living
Based on published ad rates and traffic numbers , it ’s estimated that Matt Drudge makes “ over a million a year . ”
Not bad for a single black and white page on the internet .
So these are some of the reasons why I think The Drudge Report is one of the best designed sites on the web .
Swing away .
Paul Krugman of the New York Times has been on the attack lately in regard to the New Deal .
His new book " The Return of Depression Economics , " emphasizes the importance of New Deal - style spending .
He has said the trouble with the New Deal was that it did n't spend enough .
He 's also arguing that some writers and economists have been misrepresenting the 1930s to make the effect of FDR 's overall policy look worse than it was .
I 'm interested in part because Mr. Krugman has mentioned me by name .
He recently said that I am the one ...
In a perfect world , the trees and plants would balance the carbon dioxide levels in the air and a natural animal population would emit just the right amount of methane and CO2 to keep the atmosphere and climate in check .
In our world – we ’ve removed vast amounts of vegetation to make space for structures that operate on polluting fossil fuels ; we degrade land by breeding huge herds of methane - emitting cattle to feed our growing population ; we manufacture products using processes that create even more gases .
Our normal habits have altered the gas balance of our atmosphere , retaining more heat than ever before , and is considered to be the man made side of global warming and the current climate change .
Is Global Warming Real ?
We ’ve examined this question in a previous post , Global Warming : Fact or Fiction .
Whether man made or natural , can anyone truly argue the fact that climates are changing around the world ?
Yes , global warming is real – Britain ’s National Academy of Science states :
“ The world ’s leading climate experts at the Nobel Prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believe that it is greater than 90 per cent likely that human activity is responsible for most of the observed warming in recent decades .
That is a pretty strong consensus . ”
Global Warming Proof
“ Global warming will intensify drought and it will intensify floods , ” states Stephen Schneider , editor of the Climatic Change journal .
2007 brought some of the worst floods in history to a number of countries around the planet – including 14 African countries , the UK , Malaysia , the US midwest , and North Korea .
Droughts and water shortages have been just as prominent in recent years – plaguing areas of the Middle East , the southeastern US , Spain , and Australia .
The longtime dream route between Europe and Asia , the Northwest Passage , was open and ‘ fully navigable ’ for the first time in its monitored history in 2007 .
This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the arctic is melting at an alarmingly fast rate .
[ youtube ] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sneGoNdTojY&feature=related[/youtube]
Extreme summer temperatures are another obvious proof that global warming is real .
Not only are the summers becoming unbearable in many regions around the world – they ’re lasting longer and longer .
In fact , here in the Blue Ridge foothills of the southeast US , the leaves are just now showing their bright autumn colors and the highs were in the 70’s last week .
10 years ago , short sleeves were out of sight before the beginning of October !
These unusual changes in climate have also been linked to more frequent and more intense forest fires across the world .
Wildfires in the past decade have burned longer , destroyed more land , and happened more often than ever before .
The US , especially the southeast and southwest , have been affected drastically by these fires .
Fires are also starting in forests in the Amazon , Siberia , Greece , Indonesia , and a number of other countries around the globe .
Proof that global warming is real is all around us – from the extreme temperatures to the more and more frequent natural disasters .
It is almost 100 % likely that a big portion of this climate change is because of our own actions , habits , and lifestyles .
What do you think ?
Taking a power nap is a proven way to increase creativity and productivity while improving the state of our health .
For many years in western societies a power nap was considered laziness , weakness or illness .
But during the last years a power nap is seen increasingly positive .
The scientific data shows that a power nap in the middle of the day helps both our mental and physical condition , making us more creative , more productive and more responsive .
A power nap reduces stress and reduces the risk for heart attacks and heart diseases , diabetes and weight gain .
It can also make you cleverer , healthier and more healthy .
A power nap of 60 minutes can make us function better in the next 10 hours .
Research showed that pilots who take a power nap of 26 minutes during a flight ( while the aircraft is on auto pilot ) improve their performance by 34 % and general alert by 54 % .
6 reasons why you need to take a power nap
1 . A power nap can help you relax
Established research regarding power nap confirmed that even a few minutes of sleep after food is enough to revive our body and mind .
As investigations have shown , a 40 minutes sleep , between 2 to 4 pm , is something that relaxes the body and increases productivity by 50 % .
Unlike to what many people might think , the need for a power nap has nothing to do with the climate or the region someone is living .
As identified by the neurologists involved in the physiology of sleep , the feeling of sleepiness is directly related to body temperature which varies periodically during the day .
When the temperature drops , it is a sign by our organism that indicates the need for relaxation .
The hours that this drop in body temperature is experienced are between 2 to 4 pm and 11 pm to 7 am .
You do not need to feel guilty if you have a need for a power nap after launch and usually during working hours .
2 . A power nap can improve your creativity and productivity
A power nap gives us physical and mental strength , stimulates creativity and makes us more productive .
It seems that many companies , particularly in the U.S. , already know this because they have for their employee ’s chairs and rest rooms an innovation that helped in multiplying their profits .
In Japan it is mandatory by contract for the worker to rest a few minutes after lunch , while in China the right for a 20 minutes power nap is constitutionally guaranteed and inviolable .
3 . A power nap is FREE
A psychologist at Salk Institute in California , Sara Mentnik , in her book Take a Nap !
Change Your Life. , it explains thoroughly the benefits of a power nap .
« Imagine a product that strengthens the feeling , liven the senses , pushing fatigue , improves sexual health , helps us to make decisions , helps us to show younger , to lose weight , reduces the risk of heart disease , brings good mood , strengthens memory .
Imagine also that this product is not toxic , has no side effects and , most importantly , it ’s free » , says the psychologist .
This product is no other than a power nap .
Researchers of Harvard University argue that almost one and a half hours of quality sleep is just as beneficial to the eight - hour bedtime relating to the functions of memory and learning .
4 . A power nap can improve your learning and memory
The American researchers put under learning and memory tests two groups of volunteers , at specified intervals during a day and again the next morning .
The first group of volunteers remained sleepless and as expected their performance in tests began to fall in the afternoon .
The second group of volunteers slept for 60 or 90 minutes at 2 pm , while the researchers monitored the progress of sleep with an encephalogram .
Some people had quality sleep , which consisted of phases of « slow wave » stages and REM ( Rapid Eye Movement ) , representing dreams .
These people had better performance in tests than the first group of volunteers .
Indeed , their performance was comparable to the performance of volunteers who had participated in earlier studies having slept normally for two consecutive nights .
The volunteers who did not go through REM phase showed poor performance but better than the team that was totally vigilant .
The researchers published their findings in the Nature Neuroscience journal and they clearly stated : “ From the perspective of behavioural improvement , a power nap is equally good with a good night sleep from the learning perspective “ .
5 . A power nap reduces the risk for heart diseases
People who regularly take a power nap for at least 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes , have a 37 % lower risk of death due to coronary heart disease ( leading to myocardial infarction ) compared with people who dot not take a power nap .
6 . A power nap helps eliminating the negative effects of stress .
It is known that stress has short - and long - term harmful effects both in frequency and mortality in coronary heart disease .
The degree of reduction of the risk of death because of a power nap is similar to that offered by physical activity .
This is a significant benefit achieved by the pleasant experience of a good sleep .
A power nap has different variations .
The most common are :
Power Nap Variation # 1 : Proactive power nap , typical duration is between 30 and 90 minutes .
It is a typical sleep for people who do not sleep at night or those who work late at night .
Power Nap Variation # 2 : The “ usual power nap ” , typical duration from 10 to 30 minutes .
According to the lovers of this type of a power nap the ideal length is 20 minutes , because the sleep quality can be very good and the alarm is easy and without problems .
This type of a power nap is appropriate for independent professionals .
Power Nap Variation # 3 : The “ exponential ” power nap .
Typical duration is 10 minutes maximum .
Although it can last only ten minutes it is considered the most effective type because it can be done anywhere .

It is the types of power nap that businessmen and military love .
In another week , more than one - hundred million American citizens will go to the polls to choose their next president .
Or so most of those citizens believe , along with all of the corporate media and , of course , the candidates .
But might it be possible that the decision next Tuesday lies , not with those 100 - plus million voters , but instead with a few dozen programmers who write the secret software for the voting machines that will record some 30 percent of the votes , and also for the computers that compile ( i.e. , collect and report ) 80 percent of the “ official ” election returns ?
The very idea is too horrible to contemplate , and so it is not contemplated ; not by the media , not by most of the public , and not by the Democratic party .
A presidential selection by anonymous programmers is not contemplated , much less discussed and publicized , in the face of compelling evidence that the 2004 Presidential election , along with numerous congressional elections during the past decade , were in fact stolen .
A stolen election ?
Impossible !
Unthinkable !
Yeah , sure !
“ The Titanic is unsinkable . ”
“ We have achieved peace in our time ” ( Neville Chamberlain , Munich , 1938 ) .
“ We will be greeted as liberators in Iraq . ”
" There is no doubt Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and is planning to use them against us " ( Dick Cheney )
So let ’s cut past the speculation and ( alleged ) “ paranoid fantasies , ” and focus instead on four simple , undisputed facts :
1. Next Tuesday , 30 % of the votes will be cast on paperless “ direct electronic recording ” ( DRE ) voting machines , and 80 % of those votes will be compiled on computers .
2 . These voting machines and compiling computers are manufactured , and their software is written , by private corporations with close ties to the Republican party .
3 . These voting machines and compiling computers use “ proprietary ” ( i.e. , secret ) software .
4 . Accordingly , there is no independent means of validating the accuracy of the voting machines or the compiling computers .
Am I mistaken ?
I have , during the past eight years , read hundreds of pages of reassurances that our elections are “ fair and accurate . ”
In those pages , I have found not one iota of evidence challenging any of the above four assertions .
I read of “ paranoid fantasies , ” “ sore losers , ” “ they would n’t dare ” etc. aplenty , but never , no never ! , any denial of any of the above facts .
So , assuming the above , it comes to this : if the election returns next Tuesday are fair and accurate , it will be because those anonymous programmers have chosen , for whatever reason , not to finagle the election , and not because they face exposure and prosecution – not , that is , because there is any compelling reason for them not to steal the election .
In short , they might allow the American people to choose their next president , not because they have to , but because they choose to .
And then again , they might not .
And why should the anonymous programmers let “ the people speak ” ?
After all , they did not do so in Georgia in 2002 , or in Ohio in 2004 , or in numerous other elections .
Accordingly , if ES&S , Sequoia , and Premier Election Systems ( formerly Diebold ) so decide , these private corporations and those anonymous writers of that secret source code , and not those 100 million voters , will choose our next President .
These are the plain facts .
Simple as that .
The obvious and familiar rebuttal begins with this question : “ You say these elections were stolen .
Where is your proof ? ”
Direct , “ smoking - gun ” evidence of software codes deliberately designed to “ flip ” or delete votes ?
There is none .
Remember , that software is “ proprietary ” ( i.e. , secret ) .
But this is the wrong question .
Instead , we should be asking , “ where is the proof that the DRE voting totals are accurate ? ”
Likewise , there is none , and for the very same reason : the software that records , compiles and reports the votes is secret .
However , the indirect evidence of computer generated fraud is substantial : statistical evidence , empirical evidence , anecdotal evidence , and sworn testimony by computing experts .
( Because I have written extensively about this evidence , and vast collections of published articles proving election fraud can be readily accessed on the internet ,
here , here , here , and here , I will spare the reader yet another summation of this evidence .
But see the end note below ) .
In any rational and fair election , the burden of proof should be borne by those who count the votes and announce the outcome .
And that proof should consist in “ hard copy ” evidence of each and every vote , which is to say , paper ballots .
This is not the case in the United States of America .
Instead , in enough states to determine the outcome of the presidential election , there is nothing more to validate the accuracy of the totals than the word of the openly partisan manufacturers of the machines and writers of the secret software .
“ Trust us ! ” Period .
The rest is silence .
No self - respecting democracy on the face of the earth should tolerate such a travesty .
So why is this tolerated in the U.S. of A ?
No answer to that question is forthcoming from the corporate media or the two major political parties .
The above account describes how the GOP might steal the election next week , just as they did in numerous congressional elections in the past decade , including the 2004 presidential election .
But will they do so ?
To answer that question , we must leave the hard and provable facts behind , and engage in speculation .
This next election is the same as the previous , in that the means of stealing the election remain intact .
But the circumstances attending this election are significantly different ; perhaps sufficiently different that the public and the Democrats might successfully break out of the electoral trap that has successfully ensnared them in the recent past .
Specifically :
** First of all , the corporate media , which shamelessly ambushed Al Gore in 2000 ( “ inventing the internet ” ) , and John Kerry in 2004 ( “ Swift Boat Vets ” ) , this time is giving the Democratic candidates fairer treatment .
Not “ fair , ” but “ fairer , ” as campaign coverage is once again cluttered with trivia and , in the name of “ balance , ” outright GOP lies are equated with Democratic errors and simplifications .
** Due to the fairer and more transparent media coverage , the essential issues are being reported , along with the incoherence and disorder of the McCain campaign and the appalling incompetence of his running - mate .
** Newspaper endorsements , which were roughly evenly divided between Bush and Kerry in 2004 , are now three to one in favor of Obama .
** Many prominent republicans are endorsing the Obama / Biden team , while the GOP coalition of religious fundamentalists , economic conservatives , neo -con imperialists , is fracturing .
While Sarah Palin is successfully solidifying the “ family values ” base , she is also alienating the center - right independents and establishment “ paleo - conservatives , ” without which a national election can not be won .
** The collapse of the financial markets and the ensuing economic chaos has taken place at the worst possible time for a GOP presidential campaign .
** Consequently , national polls report a substantial and steadily increasing Democratic lead .
In addition , the polls report that the Democratic candidates handily won all the debates , and that the strength of support for the Obama / Biden team is substantially stronger than that of the McCain and Palin .
In the media , there is an increasing sense that an Obama victory is all but certain , absent an “ October surprise ” during the coming week .
All this poses a daunting problem for the programmers who write the secret software that counts and compiles most of the votes that will be cast next Tuesday :
In the face of what would be a Democratic landslide in an honest election , do they dare steal it one more time ?
Just imagine that next Monday , the final polls show Obama / Biden with twelve to fifteen point leads ( i.e. , beyond the “ Diebold Zone ” ) in the national polls , with double - digit leads in most of the battleground states , and with a solid projection of 350 electoral votes .
Then , early Wednesday morning , the TV networks announce that McCain / Palin have achieved a narrow victory , due to upset wins in states using DRE machines and secret compilation software , and where , in addition , hundreds of thousands of intended voters have been denied access to the polls because of registration challenges by GOP attorneys and poll watchers .
Will the public stand for this ?
If not , what follows ?
Massive protest demonstrations followed by suppression by the Army battalion recently assigned to “ domestic duty ” ( in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act ) ?
Sullen public acquiescence ?
If the latter , what remains of President McCain ’s capacity to govern ?
He will , after all , have to deal with a heavily Democratic Congress .
How well can he cope with the severe economic crises directly ahead ?
Might we then at last see an end to the persistent refusal of the media and the Democrats to acknowledge , investigate and deal with computer - generated election fraud ?
Even if the Department of Justice remains in Republican hands , this need not put a stop to criminal investigation , prosecution and conviction for stolen elections .
In the United States , national elections are administered at the state level .
Accordingly , any aggressive state Attorney General in any state can launch a criminal investigation and carry it through all the way to the slamming of the cell doors .
The anonymous programmers of the secret election codes are facing a dilemma : if Obama wins , it is likely that the Department of Justice will , at long last , investigate , indict and convict the culprits .
But if the election is stolen again , despite a formidable Obama lead in the polls and overwhelming public and editorial support , the story of the “ miracle ” McCain victory will likely not be believed .
The Congress will investigate .
The media , beginning with the blogosphere and extending to the corporate media , will at long last take the issue of election fraud seriously .
Then the state Attorneys General will get to work .
We can only guess at what might be going on in the troubled minds of the programmers .
There appears to be some reluctance among the corporate big -wigs to drop the management of the financial crisis in the hands of John McCain , a self - confessed economic ignoramus , or Sarah Palin , who proves her incompetence at every interview .
Consequently , it is quite possible that the programmers have been instructed to cool it this time and let the public have its way .
On the other hand , the stakes in this election are enormous .
An Obama administration will , as promised , raise the taxes of the mega - wealthy , and perhaps attempt to return to the federal treasury some of the public funds looted by the oligarchs .
Obama ’s Department of Justice might well prosecute some of the numerous crimes committed during the Bush / Cheney administration .
Anti-trust laws , now “ on the books ” albeit ignored , may be reinstated , resulting in the break - up of mega - corporations .
Election reform , with the ending of voter purges , cagings , stringent ID requirements , and , of course , unverifiable electronic voting machines , will lock in Democratic majorities far into the future .
This late in the campaign season , the codes have been written and the voting machines and compilers are in place .
Whose decisions will they report : those of the voters or those of the programmers ?
We will likely find out on November 5 .
In the meantime , watch the polls .
If they show a closing race , be suspicious .
Read the punditry with a critical mind .
Perhaps the media might be softening us up for a “ miracle upset . ”
In any case , this is no time for despair .
Instead , this is a time for renewed determination and effort to produce an overwhelming majority for Obama and the Democrats .
In addition to the simple act of voting , volunteers must show up at polling places with video cameras , and voters who are denied access , or who find that their touch - screen votes are “ flipped , ” should be interviewed .
The Election Defense Alliance will be conducting exit polls .
Contact them to see if they need volunteers .
In the election of 2008 , a sizeable majority of American voters , including a formidable number of opinion - makers , academics , scientists , diplomats , and even Republicans , want to see the end of Bushism and Republican rule .
They are supporting in Barack Obama , a young , intelligent , learned and vigorous candidate .
God help us all if a small coterie of anonymous computer programmers once again deny the American people their choice of a President .
We have a short week to do our utmost to see to it that this does n’t happen .
End Note :
As Michael Collins convincingly demonstrates in his article , “ Election 2004 : The Urban Legend , ” the 2004 presidential election was stolen in the big cities , where vote inflation is more easy to conceal .
In the cities , where Bush and Cheney did not campaign and where the GOP issues were alien to the urban voters , the Bush / Cheney 2004 totals increased by 153 % over those of 2000 .
Collins concludes : “ This combination of events has never happened before in American history .
It is unprecedented … and unbelievable . ”
In 2006 , despite a groundswell of support for the Democrats the DRE wizards connived to keep the Senate in GOP hands .
The raw exit polls at the time confirm this suspicion .
The target states were Montana , Missouri and Virginia .
Instead , the voters overwhelmed the “ fixes , ” and substantial Democratic wins , following “ adjustments ” by the secret software , ended up as “ squeakers . ”
While the Democrats gained thirty seats in the House , DRE rigging may have cost them as many as twenty additional seats .

Introduction Games are one of the most applicative areas of programming .
To write even the simplest games , you have to get into graphics , math , physics and even AI .
It 's a great and fun way to practice programming .
If you 're a fan of Python ( and even if you are n't ) and are interested in games , Pygame is a great library for game programming , and you should definitely check it out .
It runs on all major platforms , and provides simple tools to manage complex graphical worlds with movement and sounds .
There are quite a lot of Pygame tutorials on the web , but most of them are basic .
Even the Pygame book stays at an introductory level .
In order to proceed to a higher level of mastery , I 've decided to write a tutorial of my own , hoping that it will provide the next logical step for persons wanting to use Pygame .
This tutorial explicitly encourages you to tinker with the code .
It is also highly recommended to do the exercises in the end .
These will greatly aid your understanding of the learned material .
Preliminaries
For reasons
I 've mentioned above , this tutorial is not for complete beginners .
If you 're just beginning with Pygame , first go through some of the tutorials from this page .
This tutorial is also recommended as a basic introduction to Pygame .
Here , I assume that you have the following knowledge : Python ( you do n't have to be an advanced user , but not a complete beginner either )
Basics of math and physics ( vectors , rectangles , laws of movement , probability , etc. ) .
I will explain all the non-trivial tricks , but I wo n't teach how to add vectors , and so on .
An acquaintance with Pygame .
I.e. you 've already went through at least a couple of the tutorials mentioned above .
Oh , and another thing ...
This tutorial will focus on a 2D game .
3D is a whole new level of complexity , and I prefer a simpler but complete game to a half - baked 3D demo .
Let 's get started
In this part , we 'll end up writing a demo - a complete simulation of creeps , round creatures that move around the screen , bouncing off walls and changing their direction from time to time :
While this is not yet a game per se , it 's a useful starting point , from which we can implement many various ideas .
I 'll leave myself the luxury of postponing the decision of which game it will eventually be , for now .
The code
The complete package for part 1 , with all the required images , can be downloaded from here .
I recommend you to download it and run the demo .
Having the code in front of your eyes is very useful .
I tested it with Python 2.5.2 and Pygame 1.8.1 , although it will probably work with other versions as well .
Pygame 's docs Pygame 's API is documented fairly well .
There is a complete list of modules , classes , constants and functions provided by Pygame there , and I encourage you to consult this resource often - for each Pygame class / method you 're not familiar with .
Creeps Okay , so first let 's set the goals for this part :
We want to have creeps moving around the screen
The number of creeps and their appearance should be easily configurable
The creeps will bounce off walls correctly
To make things more interesting , the creeps will exhibit semi-random behavior
So what is a creep ?
A creep is a small image that will be moved around the screen and rotated using Pygame 's capabilities .
Keeping rotated images pretty takes more artistic skill than I possess , so I 'll limit the rotations to quantas of 45 degrees ( meaning that creeps will move up , down , left , right or in 4 diagonals ) .
The creep images contained in the downloadable package are small .png files
Note that all the creep images have the same orientation .
This is significant , as we will learn later .
How do creeps move ?
As you 've undoubtedly read in one of the basic Pygame tutorials ( have n't you ?? ) , movement is an illusion .
Nothing really moves on a computer screen .
Rather , the program displays a sequence of images with small displacements fast enough for the human eye to perceive movement .
The rule of thumb is that anything 30 updates per second or faster is good enough and looks smooth to the average person .
To implement periodic update of the screen , games use the game loop .
The game loop Just like a GUI , every game has the " main loop " .
In Pygame you implement it with a Python loop , which is simple enough .
Here 's our main loop : #
The main game loop # while True : #
Limit frame speed to 50 FPS # time_passed = clock.tick( 50 ) for event in pygame.event.get ( ) : if event . type == pygame .
QUIT : exit_game ( ) # Redraw the background screen.fill( BG_COLOR ) # Update and redraw all creeps for creep in creeps : creep.update( time_passed ) creep.blitme( ) pygame.display.flip ( )
Jumping right into the code , eh ?
Well , let 's see what goes on here .
As I 've said , it 's your basic Python loop - endless , until the user asks to quit .
pygame .
QUIT is the only event handled here , as you can see .
It arrives when the user attempts to close the program 's window .
How often does this loop run ?
This is decided by the call to clock .
tick .
clock is a pygame .
time .
Clock object , created earlier .
The call to tick basically says this : sleep until the next 1/50 second boundary , at most .
In practice , this limits the game speed to 50 FPS , which is a good thing , because we want the game to be smooth on one hand , and not eat up most of the CPU on the other hand .
You can experiment with this effect by playing with the value .
Lower it to 10 , for example .
How does the demo look ?
Also , see exercises 1 and 3 .
Now is a good time to immerse yourself in the documentation of tick , by the way .
The really interesting stuff happens later .
On each iteration , the screen is refilled with the background color and all the creeps are updated and drawn .
Finally , the display is updated with flip ( Yes , you should read its documentation now ) .
What comes before the loop
Now let 's see what comes before the main loop : # Game parameters SCREEN_WIDTH , SCREEN_HEIGHT = 400 , 400 BG_COLOR = 150 , 150 , 80 CREEP_FILENAMES
= [ ' bluecreep.png ' , ' pinkcreep.png ' , ' graycreep.png ' ] N_CREEPS = 20 pygame.init( ) screen = pygame.display.set_mode ( ( SCREEN_WIDTH , SCREEN_HEIGHT ) , 0 , 32 ) clock = pygame.time .Clock ( ) # Create N_CREEPS random creeps . creeps = [ ] for i in range ( N_CREEPS ) : creeps.append( Creep(screen , choice ( CREEP_FILENAMES ) , ( randint ( 0 , SCREEN_WIDTH ) , randint ( 0 , SCREEN_HEIGHT ) ) , ( choice ( [- 1 , 1 ] ) , choice ( [- 1 , 1 ] ) ) , 0.1 ) )
OK , not much magic here .
The first few lines are self - explanatory .
I also assume you already know how to initialize Pygame and create a display object .
What about the creation of creeps , though ?
creeps is a list of Creep objects - the heart and soul of this game .
Here 's the declaration of the Creep class with its constructor 's signature : class Creep ( Sprite ) : " " " A creep sprite that bounces off walls and changes its direction from time to time . " " " def __init__ ( self , screen , img_filename , init_position , init_direction , speed ) : " " " Create a new Creep .
screen :
The screen on which the creep lives ( must be a pygame Surface object , such as pygame .
display ) img_filaneme : Image file for the creep .
init_position : A vec2d or a pair specifying the initial position of the creep on the screen .
init_direction : A vec2d or a pair specifying the initial direction of the creep .
Must have an angle that is a multiple of 45 degres .
speed : Creep speed , in pixels / millisecond ( px / ms ) " " "
The arguments are well documented , and you can see how they are matched by the passed values when the creeps are created : creeps.append( Creep( screen , choice ( CREEP_FILENAMES ) , ( randint ( 0 , SCREEN_WIDTH ) , randint ( 0 , SCREEN_HEIGHT ) ) , ( choice ( [- 1 , 1 ] ) , choice ( [- 1 , 1 ] ) ) , 0.1 ) )
First , we pass the screen surface to the Creep .
It will use it to figure out how to bounce off walls , and where to draw itself .
Next , the Creep is provided with a random image from the list of images ( choice is a function from Python 's standard random module ) , and is set in a random position on the screen ( randint is also from random ) , with a random direction ( more about the direction later ) .
The speed is set to 0.1 px / ms ( 0.1 pixels per millisecond ) , or 100 pixels per second .
Vectors and directions
This is perhaps the least simple part of the creeps demo .
Grokking vectors in game programming is essential , since vectors are the chief mathematical tool for making computations related to movement on the screen .
We 'll use vectors for two things .
One is to describe the position and velocity ( displacement ) of creeps .
As you surely know , a position ( a point ) on the XY plane can be represented by a 2D vector .
The difference between two vectors is the velocity ( displacement ) vector .
In other words , adding the velocity vector to the original position vector yields the new position :
This is all good and nice , except for a small twist .
While in the mathematical world , we 're accustomed to the XY plane to look as it does on the diagram above ( positive X pointing right , positive Y pointing up ) , when we 're drawing on the screen we must think a bit differently .
In almost all graphical drawing interfaces , the top - left corner is ( 0 , 0 ) , X increases to the right , and Y increases to downwards .
In other words , the screen drawing XY plane is :
This is a very important diagram !
It represents the basic 8 normalized vectors we 'll be using in the creep demo .
These are the directions the creep can be pointing in ( all multiples of 45 degrees over the unit circle ) .
Make sure you understand it before moving on .
Recall the direction argument to the constructor of Creep ?
This is the vector that specifies the initial direction of the creep .
Actually , the constructor allows to pass in a pair , which is later turned into a vector and normalized ( so , for instance , passing the pair ( - 1 , - 1 ) will result in the expected north - west direction ) .
This direction will be later changed by the creep itself when it either decides to go another way or bounces off a wall .
Implementing vectors Surprisingly , Pygame does n't have a " standard " vector implementation shipping with it .
So game writers have to either roll their own or find vector modules online .
Included in the package is the vec2d.py file , a 2D vector implementation I 've borrowed from the Pygame Wiki .
It is a pretty good implementation of a 2D vector with a lot of useful utility functions .
There 's no need for you to read and understand its full code now , but see exercise 4 .
Updating the creep
The most interesting function of this demo is the update method of Creep .
def update ( self , time_passed ) :
This method is called periodically by the main loop and is passed the amount of time passed ( in milliseconds ) since the previous call .
Using this knowledge , the creep can compute its next location .
Let 's learn the code of update , step by step : # Maybe it 's time to change the direction ?
# self ._change_direction( time_passed ) #
Make the creep point in the correct direction .
#
Since our direction vector is in screen coordinates # ( i.e. right bottom is 1 , 1 ) , and rotate ( ) rotates # counter - clockwise , the angle must be inverted to # work correctly .
# self .image = pygame.transform.rotate ( self .
base_image , - self .direction.angle )
First , the internal _change_direction is called to see if the creep wants to randomly change its direction .
The code of _change_direction will be simple to understand after we complete going through update , so I 'm leaving it for exercise 5 .
The next operation is to rotate the creep image in the correct direction .
Recall how I noted that all the creep images point to the right ?
This is essential for correct and consistent rotation .
transform.rotate ( read its docs ! ) rotates a given surface counterclockwise by the provided angle .
Now , why do we give it a negation of the angle ?
This is exactly because of the inverted " screen XY plane " I 've mentioned before .
Imagine the base creep image ( which is , by the way , loaded in the constructor of Creep - see how ) :
And suppose our direction is 45 degrees ( that is , south - east in our screen coordinates ) .
If we give 45 degrees to rotate , it will make the creep point north - east ( as its rotation is counterclockwise ) .
So to perform the correct rotation , we have to negate the angle .
Next in update , we see : # Compute and apply the displacement to the position # vector .
The displacement is a vector , having the angle # of self .
direction ( which is normalized to not affect # the magnitude of the displacement ) # displacement = vec2d ( self .direction .x * self .speed * time_passed , self .direction.y * self .speed * time_passed ) self .pos += displacement
As I said , self .
direction is a normalized vector that tells us where the creep points to .
It is important for it to be normalized for this computation to work correctly , because we do n't want it to affect the magnitude of the displacement .
The displacement is computed from the basic rule of motion that distance equals speed multiplied by time , just in 2 dimensions .
The next part of update deals with bouncing off walls .
To make it more intelligible , I want to first show how the creep is drawn to the screen .
Blitme !
Blitting is the game programmers ' jargon for transferring an image ( or a pattern ) onto a drawable surface .
In Pygame this is implemented with the blit function .
def blitme ( self ) : " " " Blit the creep onto the screen that was provided in the constructor . " " " #
The creep image is placed at self .
pos . #
To allow for smooth movement even when the creep rotates # and the image size changes , its placement is always # centered .
# draw_pos = self .image.get_rect ( ) . move ( self .pos.x - self .image_w / 2 , self .pos.y - self .image_h / 2 ) self .screen.blit( self .image , draw_pos )
Blitting , like many other things in Pygame , use the versatile pygame .
Rect class .
The call to blit accepts an image ( a surface , actually ) and a rectangle that specifies where this image will be blitted to the surface on which blit is invoked .
And sure enough , we provide the drawing position as the creep 's current position ( self.pos ) but with a small adjustment .
What for ?
Thing is , when images are rotated in Pygame , their size increases .
Here 's why :
Since the image is square , Pygame has to include all of its information in the rotated image , so the rotated image has to grow in size .
This only happens for rotations that are not multiples of 90 degrees , by the way ( see exercise 6 ) .
So , whenever a creep turns , its image size changes .
Without a special adjustment , the creep will shift with each turn and the animation wo n't be smooth and pretty .
The adjustment is simple enough : we center the creep when we draw it .
Look at this code again : draw_pos = self .image.get_rect ( ) . move ( self .pos.x - self .image_w / 2 , self .pos.y - self .image_h / 2 ) self .screen.blit( self .image , draw_pos )
The draw position is computed to be the center of the creep 's image .
Even when the image rotates and grows , its center stays in the same place , so there will be no noticeable shift in the creep this way .
Bouncing off walls
Make sure you understand the " centered drawing " trick described in the previous section ( and see exercise 7 ) first .
Once you do , understanding how the creep bounces off walls is easy .
Here 's the code : #
When the image is rotated , its size is changed .
#
We must take the size into account for detecting # collisions with the walls .
# self .image_w , self .image_h = self .image.get_size ( ) bounds_rect = self .screen.get_rect().inflate ( - self .image_w , - self .image_h ) if self .pos.x < bounds_rect.left : self .pos.x = bounds_rect.left self .direction.x *= - 1 elif self .pos.x > bounds_rect.right : self .pos.x = bounds_rect.right self .direction.x *= - 1 elif self .pos.y < bounds_rect.top : self .pos.y = bounds_rect.top self .direction.y *= - 1 elif self .pos.y > bounds_rect.bottom : self .pos.y = bounds_rect.bottom self .direction.y *= - 1
First , the screen boundary itself is computed , by taking the rectangle representing the screen and adjusting it to the image size ( this is required for our centered drawing ) .
Then , for each of the 4 walls we compute whether the creep collides with it , and if it does , the creep 's direction is inverted in the axis perpendicular to the wall , simulating a smooth bounce .
Let 's dissect one of such conditions : if self .pos .x < bounds_rect.left : self .pos.x = bounds_rect.left self .direction.x *= - 1
This is for the bounce off the left wall .
The creeps always arrives to it from the right , so when we negate the X component of its direction vector while keeping the Y component intact , it will start moving to the right but with the same vertical direction .
Conclusion
We 've seen most of the interesting code of creeps .py now .
If something still remains unclear , go through the whole code with the diagrams from this tutorial in front of your eyes .
If things remain unclear , let me know and I 'll gladly help .
One can understand a tutorial or a lecture on several levels .
The most basic is just reading it .
To make understanding deeper , one must also practice the material .
And to master something , you should apply your brain to new material , new challenges based on the tutorial but not directly explained in it .
For this , I once again warmly encourage you to at least look at the exercises and try to think how to do them .
The best would be implementing solutions and tinkering with the code itself .
What 's next
The creeps demo can serve as a good basis for quite a few games .
I have n't decided which I want to write , yet , and how far I want to take this tutorial at all .
So its future direction depends a lot on your feedback .

The second trailer for Summit Entertainment 's Knowing .
Academy Award Winner Nicolas Cage ( National Treasure : Book of Secrets , Leaving Las Vegas ) stars in KNOWING , a gripping action - thriller of global proportions about a professor who stumbles on terrifying predictions about the future — and sets out to prevent them from coming true .
In 1958 , as part of the dedication ceremony for a new elementary school , a group of students is asked to draw pictures to be stored in a time capsule .
But one mysterious girl fills her sheet of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead .
Fifty years later , a new generation of students examines the capsule ’s contents and the girl ’s cryptic message ends up in the hands of young Caleb Koestler .
But it is Caleb ’s father , professor John Koestler ( Nicolas Cage ) , who makes the startling discovery that the encoded message predicts with pinpoint accuracy the dates , death tolls and coordinates of every major disaster of the past 50 years .
As Ted further unravels the document ’s chilling secrets , he realizes the document foretells three additional events — the last of which hints at destruction on a global scale and seems to somehow involve Ted and his son .
When Ted ’s attempts to alert the authorities fall on deaf ears , he takes it upon himself to try to prevent more destruction from taking place .
With the reluctant help of Diana Wayland ( Rose Byrne ) and Abby Wayland , the daughter and granddaughter of the now - deceased author of the prophecies , Ted ’s increasingly desperate efforts take him on a heart - pounding race against time until he finds himself facing the ultimate disaster — and the ultimate sacrifice .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The incoming Obama administration is nearing agreement with congressional Democrats on a huge emergency spending bill intended to jolt the weak U.S. economy and create 3 million jobs over two years , Vice President - elect Joe Biden said on Tuesday .
Asked whether an agreement on the shape of the stimulus bill would be reached by Christmas , Biden said : “ I think we ’re getting awful close to that . ”
But he refused to divulge how much the measure would cost taxpayers once the team of President - elect Barack Obama takes office on January 20 .
In recent days , government sources have talked about moving a bill through Congress next month with a price tag in the range of $ 675 billion to $ 775 billion over two years .
Others have speculated on a somewhat larger overall expenditure to pay for road and bridge rebuilding , investments in mass transit systems , middle - class tax cuts and expanded aid for states and the poor .
Reacting to the worsening economy , which the government on Tuesday said shrank by an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter , Biden noted that the incoming administration has had to raise its job - creation goals to 3 million , from earlier projections of 2.5 million , over the next two years .
“ We do n’t think it ’s going to require any significantly larger increase in investment to do that , ” Biden said .
In upbeat comments about the outlook for the stimulus legislation Congress will consider when it convenes on January 6 , Biden said : “ It ’s clear that we ’re all on the same page , including our Republican colleagues ” on the need for a “ substantial ” bill to create jobs .
“ We ’re all getting very close to an overall number and we ’re getting close to the specific kinds of investment , ” Biden said .
Some Republicans expressed reservations .
House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio said Republicans wanted to cooperate with Obama to help the economy .
“ But we have grave reservations about taking nearly $ 1 trillion from struggling taxpayers and spending it on government programs in the name of economic ‘ stimulus , ’ ” he said .
Boehner has suggested other ways to stimulate the economy , including providing new tax breaks to some companies .

TOP PRIORITY
Early this year , Congress and Republican President George W. Bush enacted an economic stimulus law costing $ 168 billion over two years , mostly in the form of income tax rebates and tax breaks for businesses .
As the crisis worsened , the Bush administration was given authority by Congress to spend up to $ 700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue the nation ’s banking system .

Obama will take office with the U.S. economy in a year - long recession that has brought rising rates of joblessness and home foreclosures .
Many economists predict conditions will get worse for at least the next several months .
Obama has vowed to place top priority on righting the economy and his fellow Democrats in Congress are hoping to put a stimulus bill on his desk by January 20 or shortly thereafter .
Obama ’s chief White House economic advisor , former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , told reporters that without action , “ we will almost certainly face the worst economic downturn since the Second World War . ”
Biden and Summers made their remarks to reporters before a meeting of top advisors on the economy , health care and energy .
While there appears to be widespread backing for a large stimulus bill , Obama and congressional leaders also say they want to demonstrate they are serious about tackling huge government budget deficits that will only get worse with the additional emergency spending being contemplated .
Congressional aides say the stimulus bill is likely to have provisions making it tougher for the government to spend beyond its means over the long term .
Moderate Democrats in the House of Representatives also are pushing for language that would nudge Congress and Obama toward taking on reforming the Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid retirement and health programs that are costing more and more as the U.S. population ages .

On VLC it seems to play just fine , but with an extra window displaying the movie 's title .
In Quicktime it is called an invalid movie file , saying an invalid sample description was found .
i Tunes refuses to add it to the library , but does n't even display an error .
On Windows XP with Media Player Classic it says something about not being able to read some of the pins on the graph , then plays the movie ... upside down ...
Quote : Somehow after removing DRM protection you get the broken m4p container .
If you rename it from .mp4 to .m4 v , it should play in QT and iTunes , though I had a movie with this problem , and it had a strange green line on the bottom when I played the decrypted version .

Why is this so ?
Quote : Same for me all my decryted video ( fairplay v2 ) are differents in brightness and contrast , more light less contrast .
Quote :
That 's not a bug with Requiem .
The problem is that some videos contain additional chapter and thumbnail tracks , which iTunes and QuickTime only handle properly when the file has a .m4v extension , and which some other players do n't know how to handle sensibly at all .

Japanese researchers said Thursday they had created functioning human brain tissues from stem cells , a world first that has raised new hopes for the treatment of disease .
Stem cells taken from human embryos have been used to form tissues of the cerebral cortex , the supreme control tower of the brain , according to researchers at the government - backed research institute Riken .
The research was led by Yoshiki Sasai at Riken Center for Development Biology in Kobe .
The tissues self - organized into four distinct zones very similar to the structure seen in human fetuses , and conducted neuro - activity such as transmitting electrical signals , the institute said .
Research on stem cells is seen as having the potential to save lives by helping to find cures for diseases such as cancer and diabetes or to replace damaged cells , tissues and organs .
The team 's previous studies showed stem cells differentiated into distinct cells but until now they had never organized into functioning tissues .
" In regenerative therapy , only a limited number of diseases can be cured with simple cell transplants .
Transplanting tissues could raise hopes for greater functional recovery , " the institute said in a statement .
" Cultivated tissues are still insufficient and too small to be used to treat stroke patients .
But study of in - vitro cultivation of more mature cortex tissues , such as those with six zones like in the adult human brain , will be stepped up , " it said .
The tissues could also serve as " a mini organ " for use in studying the cause of the Alzheimer 's disease and developing vaccines , it said .
Embryonic stem cells are harvested by destroying a viable embryo , a process that some people find unacceptable .
Riken said cortex tissues were also obtained from " induced pluripotent stem cells , " which are similar to embryonic stem cells but artificially induced , typically from adult cells such as skin cells .
The cultivated tissues look like miniature mushrooms two millimeters in diameter .
The team also succeeded in making cortex tissues from the embryonic stem cells of mice .
Using mouse tissues , scientists confirmed they had formed a network of neurons that properly respond to stimulus .
The tissues can also be selectively induced to different cortex types controlling memories , visual sensation and other tasks .
The findings of the study were published in the Nov 6 online journal Cell Stem Cell in the United States .

Michelle Bachmann Denies Her Own Quote After It Is Read To Her
By Ben Cohen
Michelle Bachmann is a quintessential modern Republican - stupid , vicious and loud .
She made headlines during the presidential campaign in a remarkably Maccarthyite diatribe against liberals and the media .
She stated the following :
" The liberals that are Jeremiah Wright and that are Bill Ayers , they 're
over - the - top anti-American .
And that 's the question that Americans
have .
Remember , it was Michelle Obama who said she 's only recently
proud of her country .
And so these are very anti-American views . "

Then later :
" What I would say -- what I would say is that the news media should do a
penetrating expose and take a look .
I wish they would .
I wish the
American media would take a great look at the views of the people in
Congress and find out , are they pro-America or anti-America ?
I think
people would love to see an expose like that . "
Having swallowed some humble pie ( her opponent during the Congressional race in Minnesota raised a considerable sum in response to the outrageous comments ) , Bachmann has been flat out denying she ever said anything .
Amazingly , Bachmann denied saying she wanted the media to root out anti Americans when Alan Colmbes of Fox News read her back her own quote .
Breath taking .

IS IT any surprise that an industry that enables its customers to escape from reality into elaborate fantasy worlds is thriving in today 's gloomy economic climate ?
As other industries collapse , sales of video games are racing away .
Global sales of console hardware and games software are expected to hit a record $ 49.9 billion this year , says Screen Digest , a consulting firm ( see chart ) .
Games sales in America in October totalled $ 697 m , 35 % more than a year earlier , according to NPD , a market - research firm .
It is often said that video games are recession - proof .
Are they really ?
Video gaming is isolated from the wider economic cycle by having a cycle of its own .
Every few years a new crop of consoles is launched , spurring a wave of sales as gamers upgrade .
( Today 's set consists of Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , launched in 2005 , and Sony 's PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii , which both appeared in 2006 . )
During the cycle the prices of the consoles fall , bringing in more buyers .
Each cycle is bigger than the last as gaming becomes more popular and the average gamer becomes older and richer .
The industry has another layer of recession - proofing in that its biggest - spending customers are typically young men ( the average gamer is around 30 ) with high disposable incomes who regard gaming as an important part of their lives , rather than a form of discretionary spending , says Piers Harding - Rolls of Screen Digest .
There was no sign of weakness during America 's previous recession , in 2001 , he notes , though the industry was smaller than it is now .
Now that gaming has become more popular — a survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that 53 % of American adults play video games of some kind , for example , along with 97 % of teenagers — it seems to be doing well despite the economic downturn for an extra reason : it offers a relatively cheap form of entertainment that can be consumed at home .
Alex Evans of Media Molecule , the British studio behind “ LittleBigPlanet ” , a popular PlayStation 3 game , says people in the industry believe gaming has benefited from the rise of the “ staycation ” , or stay - at - home holiday .
It is much cheaper to escape into the world of “ Fable II ” for a week than to go abroad .
But is there trouble brewing ?
In the past few months big games publishers have announced lay - offs , losses and the cancellation of many titles .
The industry 's two giants , Electronic Arts ( EA ) and Activision Blizzard , announced losses of $ 310 m and $ 108 m respectively in the most recent quarter .
THQ , another big publisher , lost $ 115 m .
On December 9th EA said its revenues and profits would be lower than expected in 2009 , owing to disappointing holiday sales .
It said it would cut 6 % of its workforce and focus on fewer games .
It is too soon to say whether this signals a wider slowdown .
It is not unusual for firms to lay people off at this stage of the console cycle , says Mr Harding - Rolls .
At the start of the cycle , he says , publishers “ go all out for investment , trying to produce ideas , then at a certain stage in the cycle they pare down . ”
EA has also suffered because it spread itself too thinly , making too many mediocre games .
As retailers try to conserve cash and minimise inventories , many are restocking only the fastest - selling games .
This has hurt EA , which had just one game in the American top ten in October and November , according to NPD .
Hence EA 's plan to concentrate on a smaller number of higher - quality titles .
EA also failed to anticipate the success of the Nintendo Wii , the most popular of the three consoles in the current cycle .
( The Wii 's intuitive , motion - sensitive controller means even non-gamers are prepared to give it a try . )
Instead , EA and other large publishers have invested heavily in creating games for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , both of which have high - definition graphics that increase the cost of designing games to $ 15 m - 25 m or more .
Failure to control development costs may also have contributed to the publishers ' woes .
The November sales figures from NPD present a mixed picture .
Software sales in America were up 11 % on a year earlier , far below October 's 35 % growth , but hardware sales grew by 10 % , against 5 % in October .
Given the large number of high - quality games released in October , and the fact that consoles cost far more than individual games , it is unclear whether this signals a slowdown or a pre-Christmas shift from software to hardware purchases .
The big question , says Mr Harding - Rolls , is whether the newcomers brought into the market by the Wii will keep buying games .
The Wii's great strength — its broad appeal — could turn into a weakness , because less committed gamers will be quicker to cut back .
Ominously , in Japan , where the Wii and Nintendo's hand - held console , the DS , have proved particularly popular with gaming neophytes , sales have slowed sharply since October .
Gaming may look recession - proof so far , but that could change in 2009 .
Photographer Mike Hettwer has been kind enough to share with us some of his photographs depicting what remains of the Green Sahara .
About 9,000 years ago , a very wet climate prevailed in parts of the Sahara Desert called the Neolithic Subpluvial period .
Lasting several thousand years , this Green Sahara was home to many grassland and woodland animals as well as humans .
While on an expedition for dinosaur fossils with paleontologist Paul Sereno in Niger in 2000 , Hettwer discovered a burial area containing hundreds of skeletons from two distinct cultures , each thousands of years old - the Kiffian and Tenerian .
Also found in the dry and desolate site were hunting tools , pottery , and bones of large land animals and fish .
Mike Hettwer 's photographs have appeared in 2,500 magazines , newspapers books and web sites - many of these photos are from his article " Lost Tribes of the Green Sahara " in the Sep. 2008 issue of National Geographic .
Also included are related photos from other expeditions , and with paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey .

Steve Jobs is not going to deliver this year 's Macworld keynote .
We suspected this was coming .
But there 's more : Apple has confirmed that this is their last Macworld ever .
Advertisement
Instead of Jobs , delivering this year 's supposedly final Macworld keynote is Phil Schiller , Apple 's senior VP of worldwide product marketing .

While we have confirmed this information with Apple , what this means for WWDC or town halls is unknown .
We had predicted that Steve Jobs was preparing his farewell following his highly de-centered introduction of the new MacBooks .
At the very , very best , this is another step in that direction , preparing the world for an Apple without Steve .
We do n't really want to think about the worst .
But we have to .
This sudden , dramatic announcement says to some , loudly and unfortunately clearly , that Jobs ' health has taken a significant dive since his appearance introducing the new MacBooks .
One theory might be that Jobs had to step down one day , and while we noticed a transition towards other execs at Apple events , starting this fall , a true control freak would want to step down on his own terms before something like health required them to do it without any say in the matter .
That 's one theory .
But there are far better ways to do this .
The best way being Jobs finishing his long career of on stage presentations by giving the last and final Macworld Keynote presentation in person .
There 's not really any reason why they would n't have planned it this way .
At least a brief , headlining appearance Jobs , followed by a team effort announcing new products — if for no other reason than to dispel the alarm that 's already shaking the internet , but also to make the transition even smoother .

What 's Wrong With Macworld ?
There are other possibilities besides illness , we suppose .
Is it a decline in the confidence and importance of Macworld ?
Also possible , but let 's remember this is where Apple launched the iPhone , its most important product since the iPod , and this past year , the MacBook Air , which set the tone for its notebooks for the rest of the year .
True , this year 's rumored products — an updated Mac mini ( plausible ) , iPhone nano ( stupid ) and tablet / netbook ( dream on ) are n't mind - blowing , but still .
What we have seen happen in the last few years is Apple use the internet and their marketing dollars to reach the mainstream without the mainstream press .
They probably do n't need Macworld or that major expense , even if Apple can afford it .
Apple 's launched plenty of product at Cupertino HQ recently and they 've all done well , and on Apple 's own timetable .
( Macworld is in January , at the slump of the retail world 's cycle . )

So why not announce a full retirement , if he is too ill to continue — a possibility if he 's too ill to show up on stage ?
This opaque announcement is more mysterious , and uncertainties tend to be more troubling than truths , even hard ones .
Apple stock has n't quite felt the impact , only down 5 points in after hours trading , but if Steve really is worth $ 20 billion to Apple 's market cap , once the news spreads , expect it to plummet further , faster .
An iPhone delay rumor might knock off a few billion , but the suddenly realer than ever possibility Apple 's wizard - in - chief really is about to fade into the night — something that spooked traders even when Jobs actually did make an appearance — is an even more drastic event .
In the long run , Jobs handing over the reigns is a GOOD thing to start doing now , to reduce dependence of the stock price on one man alone .
If Steve leaves the day to day entirely , the only way any one is going to have confidence in the company is if they see and feel other executives have been in place for awhile .
Like Ballmer taking over for Gates , a transition that took years upon years , Apple would be dumb to start this process late .
And incredibly dumb to do so on the leader 's deathbed , as the world is now speculating .
Who 's Next ?
And why Phil Schiller ?
Why not the man most likely to wear the crown , Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook , who resembles Jobs more than anyone else at Apple ?
If Steve Jobs was retiring , why would n't he announce his retirement himself ?
Or have his immediate successor do it ?
All questions we 'll have to wait until Macworld to get answers to , unless Apple 's iron secrecy dissolves in this apparent crisis moment .
Another one :
If a transition is n't what 's happening here , but Steve is too ill to appear in public , how is he possibly well enough run Apple from behind the scenes ?
Why would n't he make the transition more smooth if at all possible , gradually transferring power to his chosen successor .
An opaque announcement — that Apple had to have known would spark this speculative frenzy is NOT the optimal way to do this .

Timing
The timing of this whole thing is really off , too , in more ways than one .
News that you want buried , you drop on Friday , not Tuesday , which is actually the optimal day for the MOST coverage .
Also , if Steve Jobs is in fact retiring , the best , most controlling way to do announce this would be at Macworld , Apple 's final Macworld , without this back - handed press release sending the press ( us ) into a frenzy before the fact .
This seems like the worst way , but there are other paths that even crappier , which is likely why they 're doing it this way : him appearing seriously ill on stage , or worst of worsts , dying before Macworld .
Which if the latter were the tragic case , it 's unlikely , given how ( very rightly ) guarded he is about his health , that Steve would announce its imminence .
Maybe burying news would have seemed weak , and so Apple launched this on Tuesday in an unflinching message of bravado .
Crazy , but this is a cult we 're talking about .
Advertisement
The Next iThingies ?
Even supposing the worst of all possible scenarios , we do n't think this will change Apple 's roadmap , at least not for the immediate future — products have to be designed and engineered way in advance , so 2009 's slate is likely already completely mapped out , so even if Jobs does leave Apple soon , his direct hand will be felt in Apple products for at least the next year , if not longer .
( That 's even assuming too much ; just because he's not presenting does n't mean he 's actually stepping down day to day . )
And undoubtedly , his impact and legacy will endure far beyond that .
Lack of product is a possible but unlikely thing to happen in the near future , specifically Macworld .
Maybe the fact they have an uberproduct in the wings is a good counterbalance to losing Steve 's presentation skills ?
But then again , one way to look at it is that the Macworld cycle is , again , broken , and Apple has nothing to present this year and Jobs wo n't get on stage for that .
So , just as likely , if not more so than health issues , is that Apple simply has no amazing product to present at Macworld , so they 're sending the B - team to present it , conveniently broadcasting the irrelevance of Macworld at the same time .
The possibilities are endless .
Apple spokesman Steve Dowling reiterates the irrelevance of Macworld as the rationale for their pullout , saying that " " It does n't make sense for us to make a major investment in a trade show we will no longer be attending . "
But it still does n't address why Steve wo n't speak at the final big show .

Apple Announces Its Last Year at Macworld CUPERTINO , Calif. , Dec. 16 /PRNewswire -FirstCall/ — Apple( R ) today announced that this year is the last year the company will exhibit at Macworld Expo .
Philip Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing , will deliver the opening keynote for this year 's Macworld Conference & Expo , and it will be Apple 's last keynote at the show .
The keynote address will be held at Moscone West on Tuesday , January 6 , 2009 at 9:00 a.m.
Macworld will be held at San Francisco 's Moscone Center January 5 - 9 , 2009 .
Apple is reaching more people in more ways than ever before , so like many companies , trade shows have become a very minor part of how Apple reaches its customers .
The increasing popularity of Apple 's Retail Stores , which more than 3.5 million people visit every week , and the Apple.com website enable Apple to directly reach more than a hundred million customers around the world in innovative new ways .
Apple has been steadily scaling back on trade shows in recent years , including NAB , Macworld New York , Macworld Tokyo and Apple Expo in Paris .
Apple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh .
Today , Apple continues to lead the industry in innovation with its
award - winning computers , OS X operating system and iLife and professional applications .
Apple is also spearheading the digital media revolution with its iPod portable music and video players and iTunes online store , and has entered the mobile phone market with its revolutionary iPhone .

( OrganicJar ) A study using rats offers scientific proof for what many dieters already know : Sugar is addictive .
The research showed binging on sugar can act on the brain in ways very similar to a drug abuse .
It can produced behavioral and even neurochemical changes that resembled the changes produced when animals or people take substances of abuse .
In one experiment , the rats were denied sugar for several weeks .
When they were allowed to have sugar again , they consumed more of it than before .
This suggests that they are craving the sugar .
In another experiment , alcohol was offered to the rats instead of sugar water , the sugar - fed rats drank more than a normal rat would .
Now think about this , many foods we eat on a regular basis are loaded with sugar .
Sometimes you ca n’t even taste the sugar but it ’s still in there .
As delicious as sugar - laden foods may taste , the truth is sugar is just bad for your health , especially when you start to overindulge in it .
It ’s no secret that obesity and weight - related illnesses are on the rise in many countries and this is directly attributed to our diets and lifestyle .
Our bodies simply are n’t able to cope with such high sugar levels and this is why illnesses like diabetes are at an all time high .
Cutting the excess sugar out of your diet is one of the best things you can do for your body .

What makes aerial photography so challenging ?
Without any doubt , aerial photography is a challenging art .
Aerial photographers have to tackle many problems while shooting in the air .
Photographers must deal with the effects produced by motion — not only the motion of an airplane or helicopter , but motion of the camera as well .
Photographers should be equipped with cameras that have very fast shutter speeds to avoid hand shakes ( motion blur ) caused by airplane and helicopter vibration .
Because airplane windows are made of Plexiglass , which does n’t have the same optical qualities as normal glass , images taken through them are of inferior quality .
Also , shooting through aircraft windows presents other obstacles , such as having to shoot around your neighbor ’s arm .
But it can also result in some interesting images .
Aerial photography totally depends on a photographer ’s judgment and experience to predict and capture the proper moment .
Also , being a form of outdoor photography , aerial photography depends for its success largely on the environment .
Therefore , a basic understanding of the atmosphere and its effects on photography is necessary for successful aerial images .
As with all outdoor photography , the aerial photographer depends on the sun to illuminate the subject .
And haze further reduces contrast levels in high - altitude shots .
In many ways , aerial photography is both more and less complex than other kinds of photography .
However , the skill and techniques needed to obtain good results are easily learned through careful observation and good judgment .

Is there a difference between tech startups in Silicon Valley vs. Los Angeles ?
Most emphatically , Yes !
I ’ve spent the last year running a tech company based in Santa Monica , CA and I ’ve spent countless weeks in the Bay meeting with hundreds of tech founders .
As unreliable as stereotypes may be , these are my generalizations .
Bay area founders are amazing technologists .
They build obsessively user focused products , do a fantastic job at virally driving a ton of traffic , but usually have their head up their ass when it comes to making money .
Los Angles founders are hustlers and deal makers .
They are more focused on the bottom line and care more about their P&L than their products , which tend to be messy .
At parties in the Bay people talk about Twitter , Friend Feed , what ’s being written on Valleywag and Techcrunch , and kickball games between VC ’s and entrepreneurs .
At parties in Los Angeles people talk about a media deal they ’re “ closing ” , what TV star is at the party , and some “ gray hat ” spam - like technique that made them an extra 100 K last month .
Folks in the Bay are generally way more obsessive about their products , work harder / longer , can be a bit snobby about their accomplishments and tend to be clique - ish .
Folks in Los Angeles are shrewder business people , have better interpersonal skills , but are more full of shit and two faced , and struggle to build products that get virally adopted .
Some of the Entrepreneurs in the Bay I ’ve learned the most from are :
Greg Tseng – smartest person I ’ve ever met about user viral marketing and A/B testing
Michael Arrington – undeniably the hardest worker , obsessive about his product and content
Mark Zuckerberg & Reid Hoffman – hands down built the two best consumer internet applications on the web
Raj Kapoor – a hawk about understanding the metrics that drive the growth of online communities
Some of the Entrepreneurs in Los Angeles I ’ve learned the most from are :
Kamran Pourzanjani – best deal maker and negotiator in the web space I ’ve met
Matt Coffin – guru at scalable revenue models and identifying and exploiting profit centers
Peter Pham – best networker / connector in web 2.0
Jason Calacanis – master promoter of online buzz / controversy
Michael Jones – most intuitively curious and overall talented web entrepreneur in LA
Other than just trying to piss a bunch of people off for hyper - generalizing , there is an important take - away .
The next few years will be an economic apocalypse the likes of which most of us have never lived through before .
Many are going to get washed away in the storm , while others will show their true colors and rise to the cream of the crop .
In order to succeed in the future , web entrepreneurs will have to learn how to incorporate the DNA of both Silicon Valley and Los Angeles .
The goal is to be monetization masters who are focused on consumers and build viral , capital efficient products , and to leave behind the full of shit , spam artists who are snobby about not making money .
This is a horror story from my garden !
I was walking around enjoying the nice weather and then I noticed some weird looking large flies .
After closer inspection it was n’t just one fly , it was three !
Two dance flies were mating and consuming a fly .
So I had to document it with my camera and show it to you .

( CNN ) --
A bomb exploded at a Woodburn , Oregon , bank branch early Friday evening , killing a police officer and injuring the town 's police chief and a state bomb technician , Oregon State Police said .
A police officer was killed Friday after a bomb exploded inside the West Coast Bank in Woodburn , Oregon .
Woodburn Police Chief Scott Russell was listed in critical condition at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital , according to hospital spokeswoman Christine Decker .
The name of the slain police officer has not yet been released .
There was no immediate word on the bomb tech 's identity or condition .
The three were investigating a suspicious device at a West Coast Bank branch when the bomb went off , police said .
Police had brought the device inside after it was discovered outside , bank president Bob Sznewajs told CNN .
Sznewajs said that two bank employees who were in another part of the bank when the bomb exploded suffered very minor injuries , one who may have been hit by some flying debris and another who was " bothered by the sound . "
" I know that all of our employees are fine , " Sznewajs said , adding that none of his employees had been allowed back into the front portion of the building , where the bomb exploded , " so we do n't know what it 's like in there . "
" I heard a loud kaboom , " Robert Currie , who was across the street , told CNN affiliate KATU .
" Well , I 'm a Vietnam veteran and that was no gunshot -- that was definitely a bomb .
So I come running outside to see what was going on and the interior lights of the bank are all out .
And the next thing , it 's just swarming with police cars , two fire trucks and three or four ambulances . "
Do n't Miss KATU : Explosion rocks bank
Several emergency vehicles surrounded the building , according to news video from the scene , but the exterior of the building did not appear damaged .
Sznewajs said police were called to investigate a suspicious package Friday afternoon .
Police gave the all clear , Sznewajs said , but a bank employee saw something in a bush outside the bank , and police were called back .
Sznewajs said he was not at the bank at the time of the incident , but he said his employees told him authorities " scanned it outside , then brought it in . "
His employees had left the front of the building by that point , Sznewajs said , and it was not clear why the device was taken into the building .
Sznewajs said there were " four or five " employees in the bank when the incident began and approximately the same number of customers .
None were in the front of the bank when the explosion took place .
Earlier Friday , police investigated a bomb threat called into a nearby Wells Fargo Bank branch but found nothing , Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Unger said .
The call came in before 10:30 a.m. , Unger said , and the branch closed at 2 p.m .
The Wells branch and the West Coast branch are less than 150 feet apart .
Woodburn is in the Willamette Valley about 30 miles south of Portland .

Ubisoft finance officer Alain Martinez has told a finance conference audience that the publisher has n't put the same faith in review score averages since the runaway success of Assassin 's Creed last year .
" To be honest , when Assassin 's Creed launched and got 82 per cent , we were desperate , and we thought we were going to die , " he said , as quoted by Gamasutra .
However , sales of the game were very healthy - over two and a half million in four weeks , leading Ubi to raise its initial projections from three to five million sales .
As a result , the company questioned whether the link between average review scores and game sales was as strong as it thought .
Martinez cited an opposite example - the high - scoring but relatively low - selling Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time , which earned a rating of 92 per cent on Metacritic.com .
" If you look at our first Prince of Persia , we thought it was going to do great , " he said , " [ but ] it did two million , so we were kind of disappointed . "
Moving on to the latest Prince of Persia , released last week , Martinez said that Ubisoft thought two and a half to three million sales was " clearly achievable " for the title .
He cited the same sales projections for Far Cry 2 , which has n't sold as quickly as the company had hoped it would , but which Ubi is now " repromoting " .
Martinez lamented the lack of chart - topping titles in Ubisoft 's recent history , saying that high chart placings were important in the current economic climate .
" I would probably say competition is tougher , because there is more product , " he said .

Proton discovery may cast doubt on dark - matter theories .
The Milagro detector has seen cosmic - ray hot - spots .
Milagro / U. Maryland / LANL
Hot on the heels of speculation that cosmic rays may have revealed the signature of elusive dark matter in space , new observations could challenge that idea and reinforce an alternative explanation .
A seven - year - long experiment at the Milagro cosmic - ray detector near Los Alamos , New Mexico , has revealed ' bright patches ' of high - energy cosmic rays in the sky1 – something incompatible with a dark - matter source .
Cosmic rays are charged particles , mostly protons and electrons , that are produced in space and generally have a characteristic energy spectrum — the higher their energy , the rarer they are .
But last week , researchers working on the Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter ( ATIC ) experiment , which uses detectors borne by a high - altitude balloon to measure cosmic - ray electrons above the Antarctic , reported an unexpected bump in this energy spectrum , corresponding to a surfeit of electrons with energies between 300 and 800 gigaelectronvolts2 .
Hints at such an anomaly have been seen before .
A satellite observatory — Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light - nuclei Astrophysics ( PAMELA ) — detected an excess of cosmic - ray positrons , the anti-particles of electrons , at similar energies3 .
And a Japanese detector called the Balloon - borne Electron Telescope with Scintillating fibers ( BETS ) also found a small excess of cosmic - ray electrons at high energy4 .
These cosmic rays may be the decay products of hypothetical particles of dark matter , thought to make up about 85 % of all matter in the Universe .
Astronomers have invoked dark matter 's gravitational effects to explain why rotating galaxies do n't fall apart as they whirl through space .
But as the name implies , dark matter can't be seen directly and its identity remains obscure .
A common assumption is that dark matter consists of a hitherto unknown particle that interacts weakly with other forms of matter .
In some theories , two dark - matter particles are predicted to annihilate when they collide , producing a high - energy electron–positron pair .
These could account for the ATIC cosmic - ray bump and the hints of it in the PAMELA data .
But if that 's so , the anomalous cosmic rays should be distributed more or less evenly across the sky .
In contrast , the Milagro team , led by Jordan Goodman at the University of Maryland , College Park , found cosmic - ray protons bunched up in two ' hot spots ' : one between the Orion and Taurus constellations , the other near Gemini .
They think that the excess cosmic rays may be coming from exotic sources such as the rapidly rotating neutron stars known as pulsars , rather than dark - matter annihilations .
Dark - matter mystery
Goodman stresses that it's not yet clear if the ATIC and Milagro results are related , because the former measure cosmic - ray electrons whereas the latter detect protons .
But he says the sources of the protons they have seen could also plausibly generate the electrons and positrons found in the earlier studies .
" If it 's the same phenomenon making them all , then it 's not dark matter , " he says .
But the dark - mater explanation still cannot be ruled out .
" I 've been totally perplexed by the hot spots but I do n't see any reason to connect them with the ATIC findings , " says Dan Hooper , a theoretical physicist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois .
The Milagro detector is n't aimed primarily at investigating cosmic rays , but is instead used for gamma-ray astronomy .
When high - energy gamma rays hit our atmosphere they trigger a shower of exotic particles .
These particles annihilate when they collide with water in Milagro 's giant tank , producing a flash of light that can be recorded by sensors .
But 99.9 % of the flashes seen by Milagro originate from collisions of cosmic - ray protons , explains Goodman .
That creates a background signal that has to be subtracted in order to identify gamma rays from energetic astrophysical sources .
Goodman says that finding localized sources of cosmic - ray protons in this background came as a surprise to them .
An earlier cosmic - ray experiment called the Tibet Air Shower Array , run by a team of researchers in Japan and China , saw broad differences in the cosmic - ray intensity between the two hemispheres5 , but no one had previously seen such smaller - scale concentrations .

The Milagro team suggests that the protons , with energies of around 10,000 gigaelectronvolts , may be generated in the extreme astrophysical environment of a super - dense neutron star or pulsar .
At least some high - energy cosmic rays have previously been shown to come from super - massive black holes in nearby galaxies6 .
" We do n't know what is causing it , " Goodman admits .
He suggests that the localization may be partly caused by magnetic fields focusing the protons ' trajectories .
But in general , magnetic fields in interstellar space should exert a randomizing influence , destroying any bright spots , says Hooper .
" I can't imagine how they 're created , and I do n't know if anyone has any great ideas , " he says .

I was having a drink yesterday with E.J. Dionne and Todd Gitlin ( I 'm so liberal sometimes I actually scare myself ) when E.J. , who in another life probably wrote headlines for Joseph Pulitzer , suddenly , and apropos of nothing much , said of Sarah Palin , " She 's a hockey imam ! "
This was , of course , pure genius .
At first I was going to steal it , but we are in the intermediate days between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur , so no stealing .
I was left with a problem , however :
What does it , in fact , mean ?
We could n't figure that one out ; she 's a fundamentalist , and so are many imams ?
Hockey , of a sort , is big in Pakistan ?
She 's a particularly judgmental hockey mom ?
No matter .
I 'm reasonably sure Palin will say something , to the extent that she says anything , in the coming days that will fit the label .
El PSOE ve posible el aborto libre hasta las 14 semanas en una nueva ley
El secretario general del Grupo Parlamentario Socialista en el Congreso , Ramón Jáuregui , cree que es " una hipótesis más que posible " que el Gobierno proponga una ley que permita el aborto " libre , sin exigencias de supuestos , en las primeras 12 o 14 semanas " de embarazo .
En una entrevista a la agencia Europa Press , Jáuregui opina además que el Tribunal Constitucional , que en 1985 emitió una sentencia contraria a una ley de plazos , haría hoy en día " una interpretación más flexible y más actualizada de ese conflicto " entre el derecho de la madre y el derecho del ' nasciturus ' .
Así , dejó claro que no le preocuparía que el PP decidiera recurrir ante el Tribunal Constitucional la futura ley .
" Es posible que tengamos una nueva sentencia y no me parecería mal porque la sentencia de 1985 responde a un contexto quizás distinto que el de 23 o 25 años después " , explicó .
Flexibilidad en el Constitucional
Jáuregui sostuvo que " una nueva sentencia del Constitucional " no tiene por qué ser un inconveniente " y se mostró de acuerdo con el catedrático de Derecho Constitucional Javier Pérez Royo al afirmar que la " evolución sociológica muy importante " que ha vivido España en los últimos 25 años puede hacer que en una fecha como 2010 el TC " pueda tener un criterio más flexible de la compatibilidad entre el derecho de la madre y el derecho del nasciturus " .
" Creo que si eso se produjera , si el asunto llegara al Tribunal , cabe esperar una interpretación más flexible y más actualizada de ese conflicto " , puntualizó .
No obstante , no adelantó más detalles sobre otros puntos de la próxima reforma de la ley del aborto y recordó que la subcomisión parlamentaria acabará su trabajo en el mes de enero o febrero y elevará un informe para aportar al Gobierno posibles líneas de reforma , al igual que el comité de expertos que asesorará al Ejecutivo .
El PP , en contra de la ampliación
El vicesecretario de Comunicación del PP , Esteban González Pons , afirma que el PP no va a apoyar una ampliación de la Ley del Aborto , pero no se pronunció sobre sí recurrirá al Tribunal Constitucional la que se apruebe porque , dijo " no puedo hacer un recurso ante una Ley que no conozco " .
Al ser preguntado por Europa Press si el PP tiene previsto recurrir la nueva Ley al TC , afirmó : " es una pregunta hipotética , el PP va a votar ' no ' a una ampliación de la ley del aborto " .
" Eso es o que sabemos hoy " , recalcó y añadió : " no puedo hacer un recurso ante una ley que no conozco " .
González Pons aclaró que su partido es " contrario " a la ampliación de la actual Ley del Aborto .
" Lo que habría que hacer es cumplir y garantizar que se cumple la legislación vigente , que es la que el Tribunal Constitucional , hasta la fecha , ha avalado " .
En cualquier caso , reclamó que " en la medida de lo posible , y eso no sé si es mucho pedirle a Zapatero " hay que evitar la utilización del dolor , del " inmenso dolor de las mujeres como medida propagandística " .
Insistió en reclamar al PSOE que no haga " publicidad " a costa de lo que " sufren las mujeres con el aborto y con todo lo que le rodea " .
Ley de Libertad Religiosa
Por otro , afirmó que al Gobierno le llevará tiempo presentar un borrador de reforma de Ley Orgánica de Libertad Religiosa ( LOLR ) porque " es una ley delicada que requiere muchas consultas , muchos trabajos previos y mucha prudencia " , aunque recordó que el asunto depende de la vicepresidenta primera , María Teresa Fernández de la Vega .
En todo caso , opinó que no será " elemento nuclear " de la próxima ley el regular si debe haber o no crucifijos y otras manifestaciones religiosas en las escuelas .
" El uso de los símbolos es una cuestión simbólica , no es menor pero no creo que sea el elemento nuclear " , explicó .
Igualdad de todas las religiones
A su juicio , la " idea fundamental " de la reforma será reconocer " el principio de igualdad de los españoles en relación con sus creencias religiosas " y , a modo de ejemplo , dijo habrá que plantearse que las religiones sean iguales " para el establecimiento de sus lugares religiosos , por ejemplo , a la hora de pedir una iglesia o de habilitar una mezquita " .
" ( El principio de igualdad ) tiene que ir avanzando sobre una realidad que no es despreciable , son 2000 años de presencia cristiana en nuestros paisajes , realidades , usos y costumbres y sin embargo el principio de neutralidad que reconoce la Constitución tiene que hacerse más presente " , argumentó .
Sin embargo , admitió que esa evolución " tiene que hacerse con prudencia y con el máximo consenso " .
" Hay muchos principios que hay que ir implementando en la vida institucional y en la vida real de España " , agregó Jáuregui .
As President Bush ’s term comes to a close , the United States has the world ’s largest economy and its most powerful military .
Yet its global influence is in decline .
The United States emerged from the Cold War a solitary superpower whose political and economic leverage often enabled it to impose its will on others .
Now , America usually needs to build alliances -- and often finds that other powers are n’t willing to go along .
In the 1990s , America exerted leadership in all the remote corners of the globe , from the southern cone of South America to Central Asia .
Now , the United States has largely left the field in many regions , leaving others to step forward .
Bush has been blamed widely for the erosion of American prestige .
And the decline in U.S. influence is partly the result of the reaction to his invasion of Iraq , his campaign against Islamic militants and his early disdain for treaties and international bodies .
Advertisement
But the shift is also a result of independent forces , though hastened by an aversion to Bush .
These include the steady ascent of China , India and other developing countries that throughout the last decade have seen their economies grow , amassing wealth and quietly extending their reach .
As smaller countries have built economic and political ties to these rising powers , they have worked to free themselves from exclusive dependence on the United States .
“ There is no return to the time when the United States was the ‘ indispensable power , ’ ” said Stewart M. Patrick , a former State Department official at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ The world has moved on . ”
Now there are multiple power centers .
The institutions that buttressed Western power , such as the United Nations , the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , are under pressure to allow rising powers more influence .

A vivid illustration of the power shift came Nov. 15 , when Bush convened world leaders in Washington to develop plans for dealing with the global economic crisis .
In the old days , experts said , he would have limited the meeting to a few industrial powers .
But Bush realized that the world economy now has a larger cast of influential players , and invited all members of the so - called Group of 20 developed and developing nations , which includes countries such as Argentina , Indonesia , Mexico and Turkey .
A decade ago , the U.S. might have been able to bring enough economic pressure on its own to force an end to Iran ’s disputed nuclear program , said Nikolas K. Gvosdev , professor of national security studies at the Naval War College .
But Iran has built economic ties to China and India , among others , so the United States has to assemble a much larger group if it hopes to force Tehran ’s hand .
“ Ten years ago , the U.S. was generally the only game in town , and it had the power to close or crack open the door to Iran , ” Gvosdev said .
“ Now other countries have more options .
. . .
This does n’t mean the United States is weak , but it ca n’t unilaterally impose what it wants . ”

The U.S. National Intelligence Council issued a report this year , “ Global Trends 2025 , ” that notes a shift of economic power from the West to the East that is “ without precedent . ”
In 2025 , the United States will “ remain the single most powerful country , but will be less dominant , ” it predicts .
Since World War II , the United States has led by its power of persuasion , as well as its economic might .
But other countries ’ unhappiness with the Iraq war and the conduct of the Bush administration ’s “ global war on terror , ” means that the “ American brand is less legitimate and its persuasive powers are compromised , ” said Charles Kupchan of Georgetown University and the Council on Foreign Relations .
There also has been a dwindling of U.S. influence as the administration has focused most of its energy and resources on the Middle East and Southwest Asia , leaving much less for Central and Southeast Asia , Latin America and other regions .
Many are going their own way , developing new ties among neighbors .
Latin American countries , for example , are building an organization called the Union of South American Nations and a NATO - like defense alliance called the South American Defense Council .
The United States , long dominant in the hemisphere , is pointedly excluded from both .

An 8 - year - old group called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , with Russia , China , and four Central Asian states , has been slowly developing , in part because some members want a bulwark against U.S. involvement in the region .
Other countries are leading diplomatic initiatives that once would have been the province of the United States .
Qatar has taken the lead in brokering a deal between Syria and Lebanon , and Turkey has been acting as an intermediary between Israel and Syria .
As the United States ’ political standing has eroded , its economy has remained powerful .
Its gross domestic product of $ 14 trillion a year dwarfs China ’s $ 7 trillion , adjusted for purchasing power .

Yet American influence on world economic policy is declining , too .
One sign : the failure of the United States and its allies to sell a new agreement to the World Trade Organization in the face of opposition from China , India and other nations .
“ The influence of the U.S. private sector is as strong as ever , ” said Gary C. Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
“ But the United States is much less able to shape world policy these days . ”
Many analysts expect that the economic crisis , for which the U.S. is blamed by much of the world , will convince many countries that they should n’t emulate the loosely regulated American economic model .
Another development is the weakening of U.S. ties with Europe .
Once , when they formed a common front on an issue , they had enormous leverage .
Advertisement
The rift over the Iraq war has largely healed , but Europe continued to differ with the Bush administration on important issues , including climate change and Russia ’s resurgence .
Many analysts predict growing frictions over the joint effort in Afghanistan .
“ There ’s a rebalancing of power away from the West , ” Kupchan said , “ but also within the West . ”

As album sales continue to decline , gadgets and games may help ensure the survival of the music business .
Indeed , the most tech - savvy bands are already recording songs for distribution exclusively through new channels opened up by the iPhone , the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 .
" I do n't really look at the last 10 years of music business as a negative , " Weezer bassist Scott Shriner told Wired.com .
" A lot of people are sad – nobody buys records anymore and everyone 's downloading and all that .
But I think there 's more interest in music than ever , and I just want to use technology to reach people as much as possible . "
Sad or not , the rise of digital music has been a double - edged sword for artists and their record labels .
The fourth quarter of 2008 looks to be the worst ever in terms of CD sales – down 27 percent to date – as consumers abandon physical media in favor of downloads .
On the plus side , the streamlined distribution of music by services such as the iTunes Store as well as illegal P2P channels has people listening to more music than ever before .
Given the exploding popularity of digital music , MP3 players and music - based videogames , many bands have embraced , rather than resisted , the newly gadget - centric universe .
Hoping to gain exposure and give album sales a boost , artists are distributing their music through iPhone games , Rock Band and remixing wizards .
What do they have in common ?
They give fans a way to engage the music more interactively , turning them from listeners into participants , riding the social - networking wave better known as Web 2.0 .
And we can expect this trend to continue , moving beyond game consoles and the iPhone onto other handsets and mobile devices .
Why simply play music when you can play with it ?
" Working with videogame developers , it 's not surprising that they have an innovative take that the music industry can capitalize on , " said Susan Kevorkian , program director of consumer markets at IDC .
" This is just a time when the music industry needs to develop not just one key new channel , but multiple ones . "
Weezer has used the new technology to promote and distribute its music more than most bands have , and in innovative ways .
For instance , lead singer Rivers Cuomo fielded a collaborative songwriting project recently , posting a series of videos collecting contributions from fans on YouTube .
Cuomo will choose the best video responses and knit them into a song titled , " Let 's Write a Sawng . "
Also , Weezer 's latest Red Album was one of the first to be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thYRy9MBY_c
Another group piggybacking off the iPhone 's success , Nine Inch Nails , is selling a similar rhythm game in the App Store for $ 5 .
It includes tracks from the albums The Slip and Ghosts I - IV .
Developers and bands are loath to disclose just how much artists are making off these iPhone games .
But we know that Apple takes 33 percent of each sale in the iPhone App Store , so the remainder is shared between the game developer Tapulous and the artists .
That 's potentially a far better split than most artists get from music labels .
The idea to sell songs through iPhone games comes from the vastly popular console game Rock Band , a booming success .
Artists old and new , including Weezer , Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Radiohead , are selling some of their songs through the Rock Band music store for $ 2 a track .
This method is an effective hook to get players to pay for music , because the fans get to play with the music , not just listen to it .
( Downloading Radiohead 's song " My Iron
Lung , " for example , allows Rock Band players to sing , bang drum pads and play fake guitars along with the original track . )
Rock Band developer Harmonix announced last week that its store surpassed 28 million song downloads .
And the sequel – Rock Band 2 – was the third bestselling game in the United States in September .
Gerd Leonhard , a media futurist who authored the book Future of Music , explained that hopping on digital distribution channels such as Rock Band will take awhile to pay off , but the earnings will be big .
According to Leonhard , the Rock Band Store takes about 30 percent of each transaction , while 65 cents of every dollar goes to the label , and the artist earns about 6 cents .
" It 's all about getting an audience , " Leonhard said .
" When they get the audience , eventually they get the money .
Part of the problem in the current industry is they 're thinking money before they have an audience .
With [ games like Rock Band ] we 're seeing a shift in priorities . "
On top of giving album sales a boost , distribution methods like Rock Band are just plain fun for bands , too , Weezer 's Shriner said .
" Down the street these kids had me come down and play ' My Name Is Jonas , ' and they played on Expert and they absolutely annihilated me , so that was a good time for them , " Shriner said .
" It 's kind of bad to get beat by a bunch of 15 - year - olds playing your own song , but I 'm a good sport . "
Radiohead took a bold step when it offered the new album In Rainbows using a donation model , asking listeners to pay anything they wanted .
Analysts estimated that the band earned millions in donations , and there was a glimmer of hope that this method would revitalize the music industry .
But three months later , the band shut down the promotion , saying it was a short - lived success that likely could n't be repeated .
Radiohead has n't given up , though .
The band 's internet campaign remains one of the most noteworthy in the music industry : Instead of asking for donations , the band is inviting fans to remix its music .
The latest song up for grabs is " Reckoner . "
For the same amount you 'd pay for a regular track , you get the song broken into " stems " – bass , lead vocals , backing vocals , guitar , piano , strings and drums .
But why should huge bands like Radiohead be the only ones to bank off community - mixed music ?
Radiohead 's idea gave birth to a startup called MixMatchMusic that 's aimed at getting smaller and independent bands in the interactivity game , too .
Like Radiohead 's remix project , MixMatchMusic allows artists to sell their music as remixable stems .
Participating artists earn 85 cents for every dollar of sales on the site .
" A remix promotion is a great way to give fans a new interactive music experience that really makes them care about the music , and it also really more actively engages them , " said Alan Khalfin , director of music at MixMatchMusic .
" You could argue Beethoven is a remix of his own creativity of Mozart .
You can argue that early rock and roll is a remix of African rhythms and the mashup of R&B and country ....
This idea of remixing is going to become more and more important in the overall music landscape . "
With 1,500 members , MixMatchMusic is still in its infancy , but the site is quickly gaining momentum .
Just recently punk rock band Slightly Stoopid signed up to do a remix promotion through the site .
And smaller artists such as The Bayliens , Trifonic and MC Lars are working on remix campaigns as well .
" It 's really hard developing fans when there are a million other bands on MySpace , " said Laurence Trifon , keyboardist of electronica duo Trifonic .
" So with MixMatchMusic we 're just trying to get the fans engaged with our music .
I feel you have to do anything you can to stand out and be more appealing . "
Clearly , new tech - savvy methods are working , and they 're effective enough to sway The Beatles .
The British pop-rock band recently entered into a deal with Harmonix to make a Beatles music game .
This move signifies a change of heart for The Beatles , who are continuing to avoid selling their music through the iTunes Store .
" The Beatles continue to evolve with the passing of time and how wonderful that The Beatles ' legacy will find its natural progression into the 21st century through the computerized world we live in , " said Beatles drummer Ringo Star , in a statement .
" Let the games commence . "

By Kim Tae -gyuStaff ReporterIn the aftermath of World War II , the United States helped the rest of the world , in particular Western Europe , reconstruct war - demolished economies through the Marshall Plan begun in 1948 .
Six decades later , the rest of the world , especially East Asia , may have to come to the rescue of the U.S. so that it can overcome the Wall Street - originated financial crisis .
Daewoo Securities managing director Hong Sung - guk , who gained fame by precisely predicting the ongoing global deflation a couple of years ago , calls this idea a ``reverse Marshall Plan . '' `` Sitting on huge foreign exchange reserves , East Asian countries such as China , Japan , Taiwan and Korea need to step up in order to help out the U.S. , '' Hong said .
`` For one , they can accelerate the purchase of U.S. bonds to relieve the country 's debt burden , which is causing great concern amid the financial distress .
This scheme can be dubbed a reverse Marshall Plan , '' the 45 - year - old said .
As of the end of October , the four Asian nations ' combined foreign reserves amounted to $ 3.374 trillion , with China accounting for more than half with $ 1.906 trillion .
Japan holds the second largest foreign reserves on the planet with $ 978 billion .
Taiwan and Korea come in fourth and sixth with $ 278 billion and $ 212 billion , respectively .
The four countries have already snapped up a substantial amount of U.S. treasury bonds .
According to online encyclopedia Wikipedia , the U.S. has more than $ 10 trillion in federal debt , or upside of $ 37,000 per U.S. resident .
However , Hong urges the four East Asian nations to buy additional treasury bonds to stabilize the international financial system .
`` If countries with large foreign reserves do not stage a U.S. recovery plan , under the reverse Marshall Plan , the U.S. may deal with its debt by printing more dollars , '' Hong said .
`` That means the U.S. will practically go under , although the country cannot default by definition as it can print dollars , the key currency involved in more than 80 percent of global trading , '' he said .
Hong 's logic :
The world should not let the U.S. default in a graceful way , by printing too many dollars .
`` In my view , the reverse Marshall Plan is already underway .
China has no choice but to pick up more U.S. bonds to make the global system stay alive , '' Hong said .
`` Otherwise , the whole system would come under jeopardy , which is very bad not only for the U.S. but also for China and other Asian countries , '' he said .

Will the Obama administration force Rush Limbaugh off the air ?
Some conservative activists are claiming such a tragedy is nearly at hand , and they ’ve been trying to whip up a frenzy .
Limbaugh and his brethren believe Democrats are plotting a revival of the Fairness Doctrine , a controversial policy once enforced by the Federal Communications Commission to ensure broadcasters presented balanced views in their coverage of controversial subjects .
While perhaps well intended , the Truman - era rule ultimately encouraged broadcasters to avoid touchy topics altogether , rather than seek out contrasting viewpoints .
Many broadcast journalists saw the rule as a major violation of their free - speech rights .
The FCC voted to abolish it in 1987 .
Democrats attempted to revive the rule , but President George H.W. Bush threatened to veto the legislation ( as Ronald Reagan had in 1987 ) , and those efforts failed .
Since then , the Fairness Doctrine has largely been relegated to textbooks on media law — that is , until it was resurrected as the latest conservative bugaboo .
For the past year or so , some conservatives have been trying to convince their followers that congressional Democrats are dead set on bringing back the regulation as a way of silencing Limbaugh and other right - wing talking heads by requiring broadcasters to provide equal time to liberal shows .
Conservatives assume that broadcasters would balk at any requirement to air liberal ( and probably less profitable ) content and would instead simply boot Limbaugh and find other ways to fill the time .
It ’s true that some Democrats long for a return to the Fairness Doctrine — and they have played a part in fueling the conservative hysteria .
In 2005 , Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) introduced legislation to bring back the doctrine .
Conservatives dubbed the measure the “ Hush Rush ” bill .
Then last year , Sen. Richard Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said publicly that he thought the Fairness Doctrine should be revived , and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , after noting that talk radio was overwhelmingly conservative , suggested that Congress hold hearings on the political imbalance .
Such comments prompted the National Review to put a photo of Limbaugh gagged with duct tape on its cover .
But Hinchey ’s bill went nowhere , Feinstein never held hearings , and the issue died down after President Bush in March threatened to veto any attempt to revive the Fairness Doctrine .
But the election of Barack Obama has reignited conservative paranoia on the issue .
Writing on the National Review ‘s website last week , Peter Kirsanow declared that “ imposition of some form of the Fairness Doctrine likely will be one of the Democrats ’ agenda items for the first 100 days of the new administration … Waiting until Inauguration Day to get geared up is too late .
By that time the Fairness Doctrine Express will be at full steam , wavering Democrats will be pressed to support the new Democratic president , weak - kneed Republicans will want to display comity , the mainstream media will not be saddened to see talk radio annihilated and much of the public will be too enraptured by Obama ’s Camelot inauguration to notice or care . ”
The Center for Individual Freedom has been circulating a fund - raising alert headlined “ Hannity and Limbaugh to be kicked off the air . ”
And on Monday , the conservative website WorldNetDaily posted a story calling the presumed head of Obama ’s FCC transition team , former FCC commissioner Henry Rivera , “ talk radio ’s executioner . ”
( The story offers no evidence that Rivera supports a return to the Fairness Doctrine . )
Conservative talk - radio hosts love to position themselves as the victims of liberal media conspiracies , and the Fairness Doctrine gambit certainly fits the bill .
But there is little substance behind the overheated rhetoric .
Most Democrats have little interest in a big legislative fight over government regulation of the ever - shrinking sphere of broadcast media .
And Obama has explicitly said he ’s not in favor of reviving the Fairness Doctrine .
This summer his campaign issued an unequivocal statement on the subject : “ Sen. Obama does not support reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters .
He considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible .
That is why Sen. Obama supports media - ownership caps , network neutrality , public broadcasting , as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets . ”
According to the Center for Individual Freedom , however , those are just “ code words ” — for what , it does n’t say .
What the conservatives do n’t seem to get is that Obama is a new - media guy .
The Fairness Doctrine was first created in 1949 , at a time when very few people even had a TV .
The rationale behind it , which made sense at one time , was that broadcast opportunities were minimal , and that the government had an obligation to ensure that the public was able to express and hear multiple viewpoints in those scarce venues .
( A fundamental premise underlying the law was that broadcasters were using a public resource : the public airwaves . )
Today , though , technology has created an explosion of forums that have made broadcast media — the only media to which this arcane regulation would apply — less dominant in the face of cable , FiOS , satellite , and Internet platforms .
Even if somehow Democrats succeeded in resurrecting the doctrine , it ’s unclear whether the courts would continue to uphold its application .
In 1969 , the Supreme Court ruled that the FCC had the power to enforce the doctrine , but that ruling specifically referenced the limited public broadcast spectrum .
The court recognized the free - speech issues at stake , but expressed its desire to prevent a radio or TV station from monopolizing the public airwaves .
The dramatic changes in the information landscape would give the current court many First Amendment grounds to reverse that decision .
Really , though , the conservative drumbeat over the Fairness Doctrine is much ado about nothing .
It ’s fearmongering — which may be good for fund - raising .
Conservatives claiming that the Obama administration will mean the death of right - wing radio seem to forget this fact : Limbaugh and other conservative talkers thrived during the Clinton years .
One of the first things FDR did when he became president in 1932 was to end the failed prohibition of alcohol .
This single act freed up resources for needed public works programs and added lots of new tax revenue .
That also dramatically improved public mood as promised by his 1932 campaign song “ Happy Days are Here Again . ”
Another benefit was the dramatic drop in crime and fewer prisoners .
We will see these and other major benefits once the wasteful weed war ends .
President Obama has the same chance to restore a sense of freedom and happiness in our country .
One easy thing to do is end the unethical and ineffective war on medical marijuana .
This will also improve how the rest of the world views the United States .
Read all about what we all can do to persuade and pressure our new president to “ Do the Right Thing ” for millions of medical patients and recreational users across the country and around the world .
The US is the only country standing in the way of global ganjah legalization .
On February 3 , 2008 I predicted that Barack would end the ineffective and unethical war on marijuana .
I kept trying to share that article with the Obama campaign headquarters .
Then in early August , the Obama Campaign sent me the following short , specific , and sweet response to my continued e-mail questioning ( via MySpace ) :
Thanks for getting in touch about the Senator ’s position on allowing severely ill patients to use marijuana for medical purposes .
Many states have laws that condone medical marijuana , but the Bush Administration is using federal drug enforcement agents to raid these facilities and arrest seriously ill people .
Focusing scarce law enforcement resources on these patients who pose no threat while many violent and highly dangerous drug traffickers are at large makes no sense .
Senator Obama will not continue the Bush policy when he is president .
This supports his earlier statements :
“ The war on drugs has been an utter failure .
( W )e need to rethink and decriminalize our ( nation ’s ) marijuana laws . ” - Barack Obama , January 2004
“ I inhaled frequently , that was the point . ” - Barack Obama , November 2006
Read on to learn what is going on at the national and state level .
Pay particular attention to blatant hypocrisy of promoting booze and prescription drugs while denying natural and safe medicine to the masses .

UPDATED Story from February 5 :
DEA continues pot raids Obama opposes
Stephen Dinan and Ben Conery , THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Drug Enforcement Administration agents this week raided four medical marijuana shops in California , contrary to President Obama ’s campaign promises to stop the raids .
The White House said it expects those kinds of raids to end once Mr. Obama nominates someone to take charge of DEA , which is still run by Bush administration holdovers .
“ The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , and as he continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government , he expects them to review their policies with that in mind , ” White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said .
Medical use of marijuana is legal under the law in California and a dozen other states , but the federal government under President Bush , bolstered by a 2005 Supreme Court ruling , argued that federal interests trumped state law .
Dogged by marijuana advocates throughout the campaign , Mr. Obama repeatedly said he was opposed to using the federal government to raid medical marijuana shops , particularly because it was an infringement on states ’ decisions .
“ I ’m not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue , ” Mr. Obama told the Mail Tribune newspaper in Oregon in March , during the Democratic primary campaign .
He told the newspaper the “ basic concept of using medical marijuana for the same purposes and with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors , I think that ’s entirely appropriate . ”
Mr. Obama is still filling key law enforcement posts .
For now , DEA is run by acting Administrator Michele Leonhart , a Bush appointee .
Special Agent Sarah Pullen of the DEA ’s Los Angeles office said agents raided four marijuana dispensaries about noon Tuesday .
Two were in Venice and one each was in Marina Del Rey and Playa Del Ray — all in the Los Angeles area .
A man who answered the phone at Marina Caregivers in Marina Del Rey said his shop was the target of a raid but declined to elaborate , saying the shop was just trying to get back to operating .
Agent Pullen said the four raids seized $ 10,000 in cash and 224 kilograms of marijuana and marijuana - laced food , such as cookies .
No one was arrested , she said , but the raid is part of an ongoing investigation seeking to trace the marijuana back to its suppliers or source .
She said agents have conducted 30 or 40 similar raids in the past several years , many of which resulted in prosecutions .
“ It ’s clear that the DEA is showing no respect for President Obama ’s campaign promises , ” said Dan Bernath , a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , which advocates for medical marijuana and for decriminalizing the drug .
California allows patients whose doctors prescribe marijuana to use the drug .
The state has set up a registry to allow patients to obtain cards allowing them to possess , grow , transport and use marijuana .
Kris Hermes of Americans for Safe Access , a medical marijuana advocacy group in California , called the raids an attempt to undermine state law and said they were apparently conducted without the knowledge of Los Angeles city or police officials .
He said the DEA has raided five medical marijuana dispensaries in the state since Mr. Obama was inaugurated and that the first took place on Jan. 22 in South Lake Tahoe .
“ President Obama needs to keep a promise he made , not just in one campaign stop , but in multiple speeches that he would not be spending Justice Department funds on these kinds of raids , ” Mr. Hermes said .
“ We do want to give him a little bit of leeway , but at the same time we ’re expecting him to stop this egregious enforcement policy that is continuing into his presidency . ”
He said he is aware that Mr. Obama has not installed his own DEA chief but that new Attorney General “ Eric Holder can still suspend these types of operations . ”
The Justice Department referred questions to the White House .

If Obama Is Pro-Science and Honest , He ’ll Put the Kibosh on the Drug War By Alexander Zaitchik , Alternet , December 23 , 2008
One of the many things that made Barack Obama such a refreshing candidate was his frank and unapologetic admission of drug use .
True , Anderson Cooper extracted curt “ yeses ” from some 2004 Democratic candidates when he asked them point - blank if they had ever smoked pot .
But Obama has written openly and without prompting about his experiences , not only with marijuana , but cocaine , a “ hard ” drug .
On the campaign trail he even joked about inhaling deeply — “ that was the point , ” he said more than once .
Unlike George W. Bush , Obama did n’t hide behind evasive murmurs about “ irresponsible behavior , ” or turn his drug experiences into a setup for some maudlin born - again conversion story .
As recounted in his memoir , Dreams From My Father , Obama was a normal American kid .
Which is to say he used drugs , had fun and survived .
The book does n’t romanticize the president - elect ’s days of smoking pot and snorting “ a little blow when [ he ] could afford it , ” but it ’s easy to take what details he provides and imagine him with his basketball buddies on some Oahu beach blazing bowls of Maui Wowie , alternately laughing until his guts hurt and sitting in quiet wonder before a magnificent pink - and - yellow Pacific sunset . …
Partly because Obama was so reasonable and matter - of - fact about his own All - American experiences getting high , drug - policy reformers were among those most excited by his candidacy .
If any aspect of America needs change , it is the country ’s prohibitionist and punitive approach to drugs and drug use .
Obama , it seemed , was the right politician to take an executive hammer to the cracked marble pillars of America ’s disastrous war on drugs .
Throughout the primaries and general election , Obama gently encouraged these hopes by advocating commonsense drug - policy reforms .
He criticized federal paramilitary raids on state - sanctioned greenhouses and called for ending racist discrepancies in cocaine sentencing laws .
( As a little - mentioned footnote to the first of these positions , Obama ’s mother died from cancer five years before the Hawaii legislature legalized medical marijuana . ) …
Regardless of where Obama ’s appointees stand and how much , if any , political capital he is willing to spend on drug - policy reform , the need to turn his campaign slogan into reality has never been greater .
Last week , the Justice Department released numbers showing that 1 in every 100 Americans is now in prison , and 1 in every 31 is either behind bars , on parole or on probation .
For this grotesquerie we can thank the war on drugs .
More than half of federal prisoners ( 95,000 people ) are behind bars for drug - law violations — a record .
Nationally , around half a million people are in prison on nonviolent drug charges .
The Drug Policy Alliance estimates that this is a tenfold increase since 1980 , totaling more than the entire prison population of Western Europe . …
“ One in four Americans now lives in a medical marijuana state , ” Aaron Houston , director of government relations at the Marijuana Policy Project , explained to Reason magazine .
“ And medical marijuana outpolled Obama in Michigan by six points .
Medical marijuana states , including Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada , were essential to Obama ’s victory , and continuing a federal war against a quarter of the country would make no sense . ”
NORML , America ’s pot-reform spearhead , will push for the establishment of a National Marijuana Commission , modeled on congressional commissions formed in 1970 and 1972 to study pot prohibition .
Both prior commissions concluded in favor of decriminalization , and activists think it is high time to throw another national spotlight on the law that last year resulted in 870,000 marijuana arrests .
“ Any serious commission today would come to same conclusion [ in favor of decriminalization ] .
We ’re willing to sit tight for a couple of years as Congress studies it , ” says NORML ’s Keith Stroup .
“ But we want high - profile hearings in the judiciary committees .
We want to get our experts up there . ”
Meanwhile , NORML will push Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , to reintroduce his decriminalization bill , HR5843 , also known as the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act.
Co-sponsored by former presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , the bill would in effect decriminalize possession of up to an ounce .
When introduced last year , it became the first bill to take aim at prohibition since 1982 .
Advocates may have their best ally not in the White House or in Congress , but in the economy .
As state budgets shrink across the country , legislatures are often forced to choose between education and prison budgets .
This phenomenon is most stark in California , where a budget shortfall and massive overcrowding has Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about letting people go and the legislature discussing sentencing reform .
“ During the last recession , we saw an enormous number of states enact reform , ” says DPA ’s Piper .
“ This is the silver lining of an economic downturn .
After the recession recedes , the reforms tend to stick , when the states realize they are saving money . ”
If the economy ends up being the prime mover behind drug reform under Obama and the incoming Congress , it will be better than nothing , but still a sad commentary on the Democratic Party and American democracy in general .
Polls and state ballot initiatives continue to show the public widening its lead ahead of their elected leaders on drug policy , who more often than not remain stuck in the 1980s , if not the 1920s .
While changing the law ultimately falls upon Congress , Obama could help take his party and the country into the new century by using the bully pulpit to question the premises and effects of the drug war .
If he chooses to do so , he is certainly surrounded by enough veteran drug warriors to provide political cover .
Who knows ?
If President Richard Nixon could go to China , maybe Joe Biden & Co. can help Obama make the shorter but equally historic trip down Main Street to the local head shop .
The legalization of marijuana for medical and other purposes would provide unknown billions of dollars in government revenue and even more in private sector profits .
As I wrote here recently ,
Read the following to learn why the versatile and virtuous Bill Richardson should be contacted and encouraged to become a champion for getting our country back on the ganjah track !!
Could Obama ’s Pro-Marijuana Commerce Secretary Spell a Golden Era for Pot Reform ?
By Scott Thill , AlterNet – December 18 , 2008
President - elect Barack Obama nominated New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to his Cabinet as secretary of commerce .
Given that Obama had already confessed to inhaling — “ that was the point , ” he classically cracked — and once declared the hyperbolically named War on Drugs “ an utter failure , ” adding that America needed to “ rethink and decriminalize ” American cannabis laws , Richardson ’s nomination to Commerce was cause for celebration .
After all , Richardson signed a bill in 2007 making New Mexico the 12th state to legalize medical marijuana .
“ So what if it ’s risky ?
It ’s the right thing to do , ” he said of his decision .
“ My God , let ’s be reasonable . ” ?
A mostly Democratic Congress and Richardson offer the best chance in years to right this conundrum .
With Richardson at Commerce , and Congress on the hunt for new sources of green , environmental and financial , during a time of deep economic recession , the launch window for legalization has never been wider ?
“ Richardson was a strong champion for legal access to medical marijuana , ” explains Reena Szczepanski , director of New Mexico ’s chapter of the Drug Policy Alliance .
“ In his role at the Commerce Department , he may be well - positioned to examine the economic contributions of the medical cannabis sector to the economy in states that have medical cannabis laws . ” …
“ The main obstacle to legalization of medical marijuana is that many politicians have n’t yet figured out that it is a popular , politically safe issue , ” argues Bruce Mirken , director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project .
“ The fact that it keeps rolling up wins surely helps with that , and the continuing stream of positive scientific studies does as well .
But clearly the public is more divided on marijuana policy outside of medical situations , and we need to do a better job of understanding the public ’s concerns and addressing them . ”
In order for that to happen , a public dialogue needs to take place on legalization , and that is almost sure to happen under Obama ’s watch , as well of that of his friendly Democratic Congress .
Indeed , the balls have already begun to roll .
“ Legislation will be reintroduced in the House of Representatives during Obama ’s first term to reform America ’s antiquated and overly punitive federal marijuana laws , ” explains Paul Armentano , deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
“ One bill seeks to allow state governments the ability to legalize and dispense medical cannabis without running afoul of federal law .
Another seeks to remove federal anti-drug penalties on the possession of up to 100 grams of marijuana , roughly 3 ounces , by adults .
One would hope that the new Congress will hold hearings on these proposals and begin a long - overdue , objective political discussion on Capitol Hill regarding the need to amend America ’s marijuana policies . ”
“ That we spend billions every year in futile efforts to eradicate America ’s No. 1 cash crop , a drug markedly less harmful than alcohol , is insane , ” says Mirken .
“ And with the federal deficit approaching a trillion dollars , it is time to bring marijuana out of the underground economy , regulate it appropriately , and generate billions of dollars in tax revenues .
Instead of guaranteeing all the profits to criminals , which is what prohibition does . ”
And if money is n’t the point , let ’s move instead to morality .
Even on that diaphanous front , the numbers have spoken .
“ Since 1965 , America has arrested over 20 million Americans for violating marijuana laws , ” explains Armentano .
“ Penalties include probation and mandatory drug testing ; loss of employment ; loss of child custody ; removal from subsidized housing ; asset forfeiture ; loss of student aid ; loss of voting privileges ; loss of adoption rights ; and loss of certain federal welfare benefits , such as food stamps .
In human terms , some 34,000 state inmates and an estimated 11,000 federal inmates are serving time behind bars for violating marijuana laws .
In fiscal terms , this means U.S. taxpayers are spending more than $ 1 billion annually to imprison pot offenders . ”
President Obama has promised that he will be open and accessible to the needs and wishes of the American people .
This important issue of state ’s rights and personal liberty represents an important test that millions of Americans watch to see how he responds to the overwhelming public support for legalizing medical marijuana and ending the drug war .
Time to get busy and tell him and his administration to do our well and protect our “ Rights to Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . ”
Legalizing Marijuana Tops Obama Online Poll – December 15th , 2008
Be careful what you wish for .
Last week , the website Change.gov – the official website of the Obama Transition Team – asked the public to provide them with a list of the top public policy questions facing America .
Visitors to the site were then asked to vote on which questions should take priority for the incoming administration .
According to the website , “ participation outpaced our expectations .
” Since its launch the Open for Questions tool has processed over 600,000 votes from more than 10,000 people on more than 7,300 questions .?
Ironically but perhaps not surprisingly the top question for the new administration – as chosen on and voted by the general public – was one most politicians seem utterly unwilling to talk about .
“ Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it , and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S. ? ”
To anyone thinking the # 1 question was some kind of fluke , consider this :
More than a dozen of the top 50 vote - getting questions pertained to amending America ?s drug policies .
Other examples :
Question # 7 : Thirteen states have compassionate use programs for medial Marijuana , yet the federal government continues to prosecute sick and dying people .
Is n’t it time for the federal government to step out of the way and let doctors and families decide what is appropriate ?
Question # 13 : How will you fix the current war on drugs in America and will there be any chance of decriminalizing marijuana ?
Question # 15 : What kind of progress can be expected on the decriminalization and legalization for medicinal purposes of marijuana and will you re-prioritize the War On Drugs to reflect the need for drug treatment instead of incarceration ?
It was just over a month ago when statewide marijuana law reform initiatives in Massachusetts and Michigan prevailed with more votes than America ’s soon - to - be 44th President – once again reaffirming the widespread popular support for changing our nation ’s antiquated and punitive pot laws .
It was n’t clear that either the national media or the incoming administration were listening then .
Are they listening now ?
Obama ’s Curious , Curt Response to a Torrent of Pot Legalization Questions By Paul Armentano , NORML – December 16 , 2008
In November , editors at the website Alternet.org asked me to draft “ a progressive agenda for Obama ” regarding marijuana policy .
At that time , I listed several realistic , practical actions Obama could take to substantially reform America ’s antiquated and punitive pot laws .
Note , legalizing marijuana by Executive Order was not on my wish list .
These actions include :
As President , Obama must uphold his campaign promise to “ not use Justice Department resources to try and circumvent state laws ” that legalize the medical use of cannabis .

Obama can appoint leaders to the US Department of Justice , DEA , and the Office of National Drug Control Policy who possess professional backgrounds in public health , addiction and treatment rather than in law enforcement .
Obama can support the autonomy and health of Washington D.C. voters by encouraging Congress to lift the so - called “ Barr amendment ” ( passed by Congress in 1998 and reinstated every year since then ) , which prohibits the District of Columbia from implementing a 1998 voter - approved ballot initiative legalizing the use of marijuana by authorized patients .
Obama can call for the creation of a bipartisan Presidential commission to review the budgetary , social and health costs associated with federal marijuana prohibition , and to make progressive recommendations for future policy changes .
Ultimately , of course , it ’s Congress , not the president , who is responsible for crafting America ’s oppressive federal anti-drug strategies .
Moreover , it is clear that in the coming years this battle will continue to primarily be fought — and won — on the state level , not in Washington D.C.
That ’s not to say that we should not continue to keep the pressure on Obama by continuing to post questions to websites like Change.gov .
( My suggestion for the next round of voting How about : “ On Election Day , over 3 million voters decided to legalize the medical use of cannabis in Michigan , making it the 13th state to enact laws allowing the legal medical use of marijuana .
While campaigning , you pledged : ‘ What I ’m not going to be doing is spend Justice Department resources to try and circumvent state laws on this issue . ’
As President , will you and your Attorney General uphold this promise not to target and prosecute patients and providers who are in compliance with state medical marijuana laws ? ” )
However , we must always remember that it will be the actions of tens of thousands — not the actions of just one man — that will ultimately bring an end to America ’s vindictive and senseless war on cannabis consumers .
Now let ’s get back to work !
Happy Days Are Here Again
Legalize it Mr. President
So long sad times , Go long bad times
We are rid of you at last
Howdy gay times , Cloudy gray times
You are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let ’s sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again
Altogether shout it now
There ’s no one who can doubt it now
So let ’s tell the world about it now
Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There ’ll be no more from now on
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So , Let ’s sing a song of cheer again
The following is a wonderful , detailed article that I have abstracted to show how different the world of medical marijuana is in California .
We all know that Arnold and many other famous people get high and think it should be legal .
We also need to pressure Nancy Pelosi to stop subsidizing the billions of dollars that her constituents earn from growing and exporting black market marijuana .
All Americans are guaranteed to equal protection .
How medical marijuana is transforming the pot industry
by David Samuels July 28 , 2008 – A Reporter at Large – Dr. Kush
California now has more than two hundred thousand physician - sanctioned pot users and hundreds of dispensaries .
Since 1996 , when a referendum known as Proposition 215 was approved by California voters , it has been legal , under California state law , for authorized patients to possess or cultivate the drug .
The proposition also allowed a grower to cultivate marijuana for a patient , as long as he had been designated a ? primary caregiver ?
by that patient .
Although much of the public discussion centered on the needs of patients with cancer , AIDS , and other diseases that are synonymous with extraordinary suffering , the language of the proposition was intentionally broad , covering any medical condition for which a licensed physician might judge marijuana to be an appropriate remedy ?
insomnia , say , or attention - deficit disorder .
…
Proposition 215 presented an opportunity to participate in a legally sanctioned experiment in altered living .
The people I met in the high - end ganja business had an affinity for higher modes of thinking and being , including vegetarianism and eating organic food , practicing yoga , avoiding prescription drugs in favor of holistic healing methods , travelling to Indonesia and Thailand , fasting , and experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs .
Many were also financially savvy , working long hours and making six - figure incomes . …
In 2003 , the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill 420 .
The law was intended to clear up some of the confusion caused by Proposition 215 , which had failed to specify how patients who could not grow their own pot were expected to obtain the drug , and how much pot could be cultivated for medical purposes .
The law permitted any Californian with a doctor ?s note to own up to six mature marijuana plants , or to possess up to half a pound of processed weed , which could be obtained from a patients ’ collective or cooperative – terms that were not precisely defined in the statute .
It also permitted a primary caregiver to be paid “ reasonable compensation for services provided to a qualified patient to enable that person to use marijuana . ” …
The counties of California were allowed to amend the state guidelines , and the result was a patchwork of rules and regulations .
Upstate in Humboldt County , the heartland of high - grade marijuana farming in California , the district attorney , Paul Gallegos , decided that a resident could grow up to ninety - nine plants at a time , in a space of a hundred square feet or less , on behalf of a qualified patient .
The limited legal protections afforded to pot growers and dispensary owners have turned marijuana cultivation and distribution in California into a classic gray area business , like gambling or strip clubs , which are tolerated or not , to varying degrees , depending on where you live and on how aggressive your local sheriff is feeling that afternoon .
This summer , Jerry Brown , the state ? s attorney general , plans to release a more consistent set of regulations on medical marijuana , but it is not clear that California ’s judges will uphold his effort .
In May , the state Court of Appeal , in Los Angeles , ruled that Senate Bill 420?s cap on the amount of marijuana a patient could possess was unconstitutional , because voters had not approved the limits .
Most researchers agree that the value of the U.S. marijuana crop has increased sharply since the mid-nineties , as California and twelve other states have passed medical - marijuana laws .
A drug- policy analyst named Jon Gettman recently estimated that in 2006 Californians grew more than twenty million pot plants .
He reckoned that between 1981 and 2006 domestic marijuana production increased tenfold , making pot the leading cash crop in America , displacing corn .
A 2005 State Department report put the country ’s marijuana crop at twenty - two million pounds .
The street value of California ’s crop alone may be as high as fourteen billion dollars .
According to Americans for Safe Access , which lobbies for medical marijuana , there are now more than two hundred thousand physician - sanctioned pot users in California .
They acquire their medication from hundreds of dispensaries , collectives that are kept alive by the financial contributions of their patients , who pay cash for each quarter or eighth of an ounce of pot .
The dispensaries also buy marijuana from their members , and sometimes directly from growers , whose crops can also be considered legal , depending on the size of the crop , the town where the plants are grown , and the disposition of the judge who hears the case .
California ’s encouragement of a licit market for pot has set off a low - level civil war with the federal government .
Growing , selling , and smoking marijuana remain strictly illegal under federal law .
The Drug Enforcement Administration , which maintains that marijuana poses a danger to users on a par with heroin and PCP , has kept up an energetic presence in the state , busting pot growers and dispensary owners with the coöperation of some local police departments .
In the past five years , an unwritten set of rules has emerged to govern Californians participating in the medical - marijuana trade .
Federal authorities do not generally bother arresting patients or doctors who write prescriptions .
Instead , the D.E.A. pressures landlords to evict dispensaries and stages periodic raids on them , either shutting them down or seizing their money and marijuana .
Dispensary owners are rarely arrested , and patient records are usually left alone .
Through trial and error , dispensary owners have learned how to avoid trouble :
Do n’t advertise in newspapers , on billboards , or on flyers distributed door to door .
Do n’t sell to minors or cops .
Do n’t open more than two stores .
Any Californian who is reasonably prudent can live a life centered on the cultivation , sale , and consumption of marijuana with little fear of being fined or going to jail . …
Stronger , better - tasting varieties of pot can sell for more than five thousand dollars per pound , more than double the price of average weed .
The premium paid for designer pot creates a big incentive for growers and dealers to name their product for whatever strains happen to be fashionable that year .
The variety of buds being sold as Kush has proliferated to the point where even the most catholic - minded botanist would be hard pressed to identify a common plant ancestor .
Only a small percentage of consumer marijuana sales in California occur within the medical - marijuana market .
Even so , the dispensaries , by serving as a gold standard for producers and consumers , have fueled the popularity of high - end strains in much the same way that the popularity of the Whole Foods grocery chain has brought heirloom lettuce to ordinary supermarkets .
To serve these sophisticated new consumers , growers in California and elsewhere are producing hundreds of exotic new strains , whose effects are more varied , subtle , and powerful than the street - level pot available to tokers in the nineteen - seventies and eighties . …
The quasi-legal status of smaller growing arrangements , combined with consumers ’ preference for potent , high - maintenance weed , has shifted the balance of the pot business away from large - scale farms .
“ There ’s a lot more people doing little scenes , ” he said .
The welter of laws pertaining to medical marijuana in California has offered careful operators like Guthrie the best of both worlds : prosecution for growing and selling has become much less likely , while federal busts and seizures keep prices high .
Guthrie sells about ten per cent of his product to dispensaries and collectives .
Starting up a sophisticated indoor farming operation costs about three hundred thousand dollars , he said , including the cost of making a building airtight – to lock in the humidity , and to keep passersby from smelling the pot and calling the cops – and fitting it with thousand - watt grow lights . …
Sitting beneath a willow tree on a breezy day in Sonoma County , you can see why the idea of leaving the city behind and growing your own weed exerts such a pull on the holistic health nuts , masseurs , d.j.s , art - school dropouts , and New Age types who populate the medical - marijuana scene in Los Angeles .
Farming a crop of twenty - five or thirty plants of killer weed is an updated ( and highly profitable ) version of the age - old California dream of an orange tree in every back yard .
For those who ca n’t afford to pay for a prime plot of land in Humboldt , there is the possibility of renting a small split - level house in Sonoma or Mendocino and converting the master bedroom into a grow room , where you can turn around an indoor crop every sixty days .
Up North , the marijuana harvest is known as “ trimming season . ”
In Humboldt and Mendocino , she said , October is a month - long sleepover , with all the free ganja , beer , and organic food you want .
A really good trimmer can trim two pounds of pot a day , at a rate of two hundred and fifty dollars per pound , while sitting around a table with three or four friends .
Kids from San Francisco or even Australia hear about the harvest from friends of friends and show up for the pot and the cash .
The D.E.A. routinely busts a few big scenes each year , and the local police have been known to stop cars and check the passengers for telltale scratches on their arms or sticky resin under their fingernails . …
Humboldt ’s economy is so heavily dependent on cannabis cultivation that you can drive for miles on well - kept highways and back roads without discovering a single legitimate source of income , aside from honey stands .
Heading north , we eventually entered a maze of logging roads on a private reserve .
A bunch of hippies grew pot in the forest , and the local cops stayed away .
Our destination was a house occupied by a woman who identified herself as Emily .
A wiry marijuana sharecropper who also works as an environmental activist , she was busy watering her plants .
There were twenty - five plants in all , surrounded by a fence on which hung a laminated patient ’s letter , signed by Ken Miller , M.D. , stating that the marijuana was intended for medical purposes .
Because marijuana is a fungible commodity , like soybeans or rice , there is no way to tell the difference between marijuana that winds up going to patients and marijuana that winds up on the street .
The doctor ’s letter was , therefore , halfway between a legal document and a good - luck charm . …
Before the legalization of medical marijuana , she said , the wholesale price of good weed was forty - eight hundred dollars a pound .
Now it was between twenty - two and twenty - six hundred .
That was still profitable , though , and there were fewer stories in the newspapers about people being bound and gagged by cash - hungry gangsters .
…
Providing that the weather and the authorities cooperated , Emily expected to end up with approximately twenty pounds of pot .
She would dispose of it in whatever manner brought her the most money ; she thought it could fetch as much as fifty thousand dollars .
Being around plants made her happy , she said .
She ?d be even more excited to grow something else , if it paid decently .
Growing pot required a careful rhythm between periods of benign neglect and periods of close , loving attention .
She noted that all her marijuana plants were females .
“ They ’re ladies , right , ” she joked .
“ So how do ladies like to be treated ?
They like to be given lots of attention and then left the fuck alone for a few days to revel in it .
If you hang on to them all the time , they ’re not going to do anything for you . …
That morning , Emily said , she had spent four hours on eight plants , plucking the thickest leaves in order to channel more energy to the buds .
She had fertilized the soil with a mixture of bat and seabird guano .
( Humboldt supermarkets sell the blend for nineteen dollars a gallon . )
Her arms had become dark and sinewy from her labor .
Back at Emily ’s borrowed house , we got high on her private stash and settled in for the night .
The living room was decorated with save - the - rain - forest posters and a fake - leather gray couch .
On the table was a boom box , a Mason jar of marijuana , and a Mac PowerBook .
There was no television set ; the radio was tuned to NPR .
Emily was reading William Morris and working on a half - finished jigsaw puzzle of a Brazil nut , which she had bought at the thrift store for a dollar .
Puzzles were popular during growing season , she said .
That ?s what being a grower in Humboldt County is like , she said .
You do jigsaw puzzles at night , get high , and shit in the woods . …
By going into the pot business , Emily had made the kind of compromise with reality that idealistic people often make when they get older and lose faith in their ability to effect wholesale change , and when they need the money .
Growing ganja lets you feel that you ’re still living on the edge , especially when you ’ve become a little complacent politically .
Emily nodded , and took another puff .
“ The forest is still getting cut down or whatever , ” she said , watching the fragrant smoke swirl in the breeze .
“ But you ’re still working out here .
You ’re still subverting the Man .
And you ’re getting people high . ”
Marijuana Law Comes With Challenges By ABBY GOODNOUGH
December 18 , 2008
BOSTON – Last month , voters approved a statewide measure decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana .
Now , wary authorities say , comes the hard part .
They are scrambling to set up a new system of civil penalties before Jan. 2 , when the change becomes law .
From then on , anyone caught with an ounce or less of marijuana will owe a $ 100 civil fine instead of ending up with an arrest record and possibly facing jail time .
…
About 65 percent of state voters supported the decriminalization measure , which was promoted by a group that spent more than $ 1.5 million on the effort .
The group , the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , said that in addition to ensuring that people caught with marijuana no longer have a criminal record , the change would save about $ 29.5 million a year that it estimates law enforcement currently spends to enforce existing drug laws .
A spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , which supports the drug ?s legalization and created the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy to get the ballot question passed here , said that judging from the experience of other states with civil penalties for marijuana possession , Massachusetts officials were exaggerating the challenges .
Eleven states have decriminalized first - time possession of marijuana , though in most it is technically a misdemeanor instead of a civil offense .
In Nebraska , where possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is punishable by a $ 300 civil fine , the process has worked smoothly for three decades , said Michael Behm , executive director of the Nebraska Crime Commission .
In New York , possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is a noncriminal violation but is still processed through the criminal system , said Robert M. Carney , the district attorney in Schenectady County .
“ They are brought down to the police station so their identity is established , ” Mr. Carney said of violators , “ but they are not fingerprinted because it ’s not an arrest . ”

This is just precious .
And a lot of truth in it .
While it may not present the view of all Mormons , it certainly presents the view of the LDS church and their leaders , and those mortgaging their homes and their families futures in support of Prop 8 .

A powder keg of public anger over government economic policy has been ignited by a spark of outrage over the killing of a 15 - year - old boy by police in Athens .
For updates and background , see our Greece unrest archive : http://libcom.org/tags/greece-unrest
Alexandros Grigoropoulos was shot dead by police in the Exarchia area , an anarchist stronghold of Greece 's capital city on Saturday 6 December .
Police claimed that they fired in the air when their police vehicle came under attack by a group of youths , but eyewitnesses told Greek television that they fired directly at the boy 's chest , and that they were not under attack .
Thousands poured into the streets in the surrounding area and several other cities around the country .
Police officers and buildings came under attack by crowds wielding rocks , metal bars and petrol bombs , and dozens of businesses were burned - out .
The rioting has since spread , including to the holiday islands of Corfu and Crete , and continued daily .
High school and university occupations are now widespread , and university professors have now gone on strike .
Elsewhere , many high school students have boycotted classes .
The killing comes against a background of a 48 hour strike of nurses , and on the eve of a general strike this Wednesday 10 December against the government 's economic reforms .
The events constitute what is now one of the biggest public outbreaks of disorder in decades .
The rioters
Much of the press has blamed the rioting on anarchists , who constitute a significant political force in Greece , especially amongst young people and students .
However , while it is true that anarchists instigated some of the fighting they have been joined by large swathes of workers and young people in particular .
Other groups , such as football fans have also participated in the clashes .
Public anger at the slaying - only the most recent incident of what is habitual police brutality - has intersected with widespread discontent at neoliberal reforms and the widening gap between rich and poor , being exacerbated by government policy .
One participant , Sotev , commented on our forums :
" Let me comment that these are not - and could not be , given the magnitude of the ' misdeeds ' - the acts of the ' anarchists ' doing their thing .
Of course anarchists ... are on the front lines everywhere , but these acts are social .
It 's not just about the murder or the state repression : there 's a growing feeling of revolt , against the ecomony , against the poverty , against the lost jobs etc. that had to break out somehow . " *
Greece - based blogger " Teacher Dude " stated :
" Although violent scenes are not uncommon in Greece the extent , duration and intensity of the riots seems to have taken the authorities by surprise .
In addition the fact that many of those who took in protest marches were neither young nor students is indicative of the fact that the death of the teenager has angered many Greeks .
Case in point was the pensioner , who stood in front of a phalanx of riot police , apoplectic with rage shouting , " cops , killer , pigs " during the march in Thessaloniki . "
The working class
Working people and their families bear the brunt of the everyday violence of Greek police .
In recent weeks , a police HQ in Volos was attacked in response to a police violence , and barricades were erected after police attacked immigrants .
This itself came only days after they killed a Pakistani asylum seeker and fought with textile workers who had n't been paid .
On top of that , Greek workers have been escalating resistance to attacks on pensions , labour rights and education .
Wednesday 's general strike follows a previous national stoppage in October , and two earlier general strikes .
Walkouts by bank workers and the recent strikes of students and nurses , which have involved occupations and the holding hostage of government ministers are have also rocked the government , already in a precarious position by having a majority of just one .

There are plenty of good reasons why Parliament requires MPs to publicly disclose their assets and any gifts they receive .
But why can't we read the details of this register of members ' interests on the internet ?
As things stand , if you want to know which MPs has been given trips abroad , who has investments in mining or pharmaceutical companies , or who has real estate holdings in areas ripe for development , you have to go to Canberra , get into Parliament House , find the Senate or House of Representatives offices where the registers are held and leaf through vast volumes of forms .
The cost and effort of such an exercise mean that while politicians claim the document is public , few members of the public ever see it .
The music you ’re about to hear does n’t come from what most people would consider to be a regular musical instrument .
It is generated via a pair of high powered 7 - foot tesla coils , which can shoot sparks up to 12 feet in the air .

MySQL creator Michael “ Monty ” Widenius has gone on a noisy rant about last week ’s release of MySQL 5.1 because Sun Microsystems has unleashed the database even though it still contains “ fatal bugs ” .
Sun made the popular open source db generally available ( GA ) last Thursday following months of development .
By Saturday Monty was grumbling that MySQL 5.1 was n’t entirely ready for mainstream production use yet .
In a long - winded blog post sardonically entitled “ Oops we did it again – MySQL 5.1 released as GA with crashing bugs ” , Monty warned users to take cautious steps before deploying the latest version of the database on live systems .
At least 20 flaws that cause MySQL to either crash or produce erroneous results remain in MySQL 5.1 , he claimed .
Monty advised that users effectively treat 5.1 as a beta rather than a GA , and perhaps even consider holding off until early patches arrive .
He said the MySQL management team at Sun has failed to learn from its earlier mistakes when – he argues – it released a bug - riddled version of the 5.0 database too soon .
According to Monty , the main argument behind pushing out MySQL 5.1 now is that “ it ’s better than MySQL 5.0 was when it was declared as GA .
“ In my opinion , this is not a good reason to declare something GA , especially as 5.0 GA was in terrible shape when it was released .
What is worse is that the new features in MySQL 5.1 are of no better quality than new features in MySQL 5.0 was at the time MySQL 5.0 was declared GA , ” he said .
Despite all the griping , he reckoned new users should grasp the nettle and use MySQL 5.1 because it ’s better than the 5.0 community version , which has n’t been updated for some time .
Monty was also at pains to point out that Sun , which acquired MySQL in February 2008 for $ 1bn , was n’t to blame for what he sees as a premature release of the database .
“ The decisions to do a GA release was solely been made by the MySQL management in Sun , ” he said .
“ The only thing Sun can be blamed for is to not start fixing the MySQL development organisation soon enough to ensure that things like this can't happen .
“ I still have some hopes that Sun will come in and fix the MySQL development organisation , but with MySQL server releases like this one my hopes have started to fade a bit . ”
One mysterious database administrator hit back at Monty ’s efforts to “ ambush his colleagues with a truckload of blame ” in a blog post today .
She said : “ This is another case of a developer , a brilliant one , mind you , one of the brightest in the open source arena , but a developer nonetheless , who has a non-user oriented mindset and is inflicting his view on the users . ”
In 1995 Monty , the primary architect of the original MySQL database , co-founded MySQL AB with David Axmark , who recently quit the firm .
He walked in October grumbling that he " hated " all the rules he had to follow at Sun .
Since then speculation has continued to mount about Monty ’s future at the firm .
But despite all his gripes he 's hanging on in there – for now . ®
What happened
The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education gave 49 states an “ F ” in college affordability — California earned a “ C ” — in its biennial report card .
The report said that median family income has risen 147 percent between 1982 and 2007 while college tuition and fees jumped 439 percent .
Net costs for four - year state colleges now eat 28 percent of the median family income ; private colleges consume 76 percent .
( The New York Times )
What the commentators said
The rising cost of higher education is hurting us all , said California ’s Contra Costa Times in an editorial .
Only 34 percent of U.S. 18 - to 24 - year - olds are in college , putting us behind countries like Greece and Poland .
If we ’re going to be competitive , U.S. colleges must find “ where costs can be cut ” and states need to step up their support .
“ This woe - is - students whining is ridiculous and counterproductive , ” said Neal McCluskey in the Cato Institute ’s Cato@Liberty .
It ’s hardly unfair to make students take out highly subsidized federal loans to " go to college to vastly improve their earnings over a lifetime . ”
What ’s unjust is “ foisting the costs ” on tax - paying non-college - educated workers .
Maybe , but “ it ’s absurd ” to bail out “ every major bank to get financial capital flowing again , ” said Robert Reich in his blog , while we starve our meager supply of “ human capital . ”
Our future standard of living depends on an educated , innovative workforce , “ not on our ability to borrow money . ”
The NCPPHE report actually revealed “ some educational bargains , ” said Kim Clark in U.S. News & World Report .
In Tennessee , for example , families only pay 13 percent of their income , and parents in Arizona , Florida , Georgia , and North Carolina can “ send their children to highly ranked public universities without beggaring themselves . ”
One of the best parts of that juicy NYT story yesterday about all the infighting in the McCain - Palin campaign was the fact that a huge chunk of the story was given over to exploring who was leaking to sniveling conservative columnist Bill Kristol — a Times columnist !
It 's pretty unusual for a paper to start digging on its own columnist 's confidential sources , but hey , it 's Bill Kristol and nobody at the Times likes him , so they just went for it .
That prompted some further review by the Daily Beast , which concluded , yep , Bill Kristol is basically just a lackey for political operatives :
As one McCain advisor put it to me : “ In the last six weeks there was a remarkable echo .
You could listen to arguments made by folks inside of the campaign who were close to Bill Kristol and then open up the New York Times and read them in Kristol ’s columns .
It was ‘ set Sarah free , ’ coupled with an agenda designed to appeal to the religious right and the more raucous elements of the party .
They got their way often enough , and we started noticing that at many of the Palin functions it was non-stop ‘ Sarah , Sarah , ’ while John McCain all but vanished .
Were they trying to get McCain elected in 2008 , or to help Palin on the way to the Republican nomination in 2012 ?
You ca n’t get yourself into a situation in which anyone can credibly ask that question . ”
Bill Kristol is a partisan hack without any redeeming original thoughts , so he just serves as a pipeline for whatever talking points his pet factions of the conservative movement want to get out that day .
A good hire .

26 : Forbidden Planet ( 1956 ) – Entering the Krell underground .
Inserting real people into matte paintings or hanging miniatures is an SFX technique predating motion pictures , but A. Arnold Gillespie and colleagues went one better for this introductory shot to Leslie Nielson ’s tour of the vast underground labyrinth left behind by an alien civilisation in this sci- fi classic : the camera filming the large Metropolis - like miniature pans around to a pre-fixed position , at which point footage of actors Walter Pidgeon , Nielson and Warren Stevens walking through the MGM car park is matted in .
The same technique is applied to later shots but with rostrum movement and slightly less convincingly ( one can plainly see that the actors are moving in daylight and also discern the concrete of the car park ) .
The initial movement of the camera in our featured footage sets up the conceit that it can move any time it likes , and reinforces the realism of the shot .
25 : Aliens ( 1986 ) – Express elevator to hell .
James Cameron brought old Corman colleagues the Skotak brothers on to his production of the much lauded sequel to Alien .
They had worked before on the SFX teams of Battle Beyond The Stars ( 1981 ) and Galaxy Of Terror ( 1982 ) , and this reunion only re-iterated that it was a great partnership .
Cameron and the Skotaks used the most appropriate technique for each shot , meticulously planning them with sawdust - and - string ’ animatics ( later to become a habit in Hollywood ) .
The very grainy Kodak film stock on which Aliens was shot permitted an extraordinary amount of practical model - on - wires footage , and the results rank amongst the best ever obtained by that method .
This shot is a more traditional ( by then ) motion - control effort , but what makes it outstanding is Cameron ’s demanding vision of how much movement it should have , and the extraordinary sense of scale and drama .
SFX shots as mobile as the deployment of Aliens ‘ dropship were not to become common practice in Hollywood until the advent of CGI ; this is a truly audacious and ambitious piece of film which the makers pull off with jaw - dropping effectiveness .
It ’s almost a shame to look at it out of context .
24 : Terminator 3 ( 2003 ) – Arnie ’s ruined terminator face .
It ’s not every ILM shot that makes it into arguably the most esteemed show reel of any effects house on the planet , but the sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s half - man / half - robot face in T3 is unfaultable and a sure candidate .
The camera lingers on it , and it can afford to .
Similarly astonishing work was achieved with Aaron Eckhart ’s mutilated visage as Two Face in The Dark Knight , but unfortunately common sense kicks in after the shock and one realises that there ’s no way Eckhart ’s lower lip could maintain tension with that much damage to the left cheek .
Here there are no such issues .
With lighting , textures and fusion between actor and illusion absolutely pristine , it ’s a perfect ‘ trick ’ , selling the reality of the Terminator character as never before .
23 : Frenzy ( 1972 ) – Back to Bob ’s place .
Poor Anna Massey unwittingly follows the ‘ necktie killer ’ ( Barry Foster ) back to his flat in Hitchcock ’s hard - hitting London - based thriller .
Hitch follows the couple up the stairs but then backs away from the scene as they enter , as if sickened by the previous rape and murder of Barbara Leigh - Hunt , and not wanting to see any more .
The huge camera seems to make an impossibly adroit and smooth retreat down the stairwell before backing out of the house entirely and out into the environs of Covent Garden .
Except that by the time the camera has backed out completely , it is looking at a totally different house .
Even though the shot is uninterrupted , the descent down the stairs takes place in the studio and the wider retreat into Covent Garden takes place on location .
Can you see the join ?
22 : Dawn Of The Dead ( 2004 ) – The chaos sets in .
Alfred Hitchcock set a precedent for looking down at chaos from above in his ariel shot of the birds gathering their forces over the besieged fishing village in The Birds ( see # 6 ) .
Zach Snyder takes a similarly remote view of the chaos Sarah Polley drives through in the pre-credits sequence of his excellent remake .
Once again ( see # 45 ) injudicious use of exhaust distortion ( on the helicopter ) is the only carbuncle on this astonishing shot of a zombie - strewn world descending into chaos , and it ’s the incident at the petrol station ( at the end of the sequence ) that really drives home the sense of apocalypse .
21 : The Ten Commandments ( 1956 ) – Moses parts the sea .
Cecil B. DeMille ’s second chance at parting the red sea ( which he had first done with his prior version of The Ten Commandments in 1923 ) provides one of the great spectacles of the 1950s .
Water had proved the bugbear of many an SFX artist , and here DeMille follows a similar technique as tried in The Dambusters ( 1955 ) .
The technique involves isolating suitable footage of cascading water in moving matte areas , and this it is that provides the great backward - moving flukes that reveal the impressive ‘ parted sea ’ model ( a Hollywood attraction for many years afterwards ) .
Considering that SFX artists were getting equal or worse results 20 - 30 years later , this is a ground - breaking and ambitious piece of footage greatly assisted by reverse photography .
20 : Things To Come ( 1936 ) – Everytown .
William Cameron Menzies ’ loose adaptation of H.G. Wells ’ vision of Britain ’s future is a patchy affair both in narrative and SFX terms , but this hanging miniature shot ca n’t be faulted , particularly regarding its elaborate integration with the crowd below .
This is a rather late answer to Metropolis ( see # 10 ) but also a more fluid integration of model architecture with real people .
Hanging miniatures were used quite extensively in Aliens , providing both the upper ‘ alien - ised ’ architecture of the reactor centre and also 75 % of the Sulaco ’s hangar bay .
19 : Back To The Future Part II ( 1989 ) – Landing the DeLorean at night .
The secret to a good effects shot ( at least one where you know that the shot is impossible in the real world ) is psychologically integrating the impossible element with the parts of the scene that are manifestly real .
Here the ever - ingenious Robert Zemeckis uses a street - lamp to mask the transition between model and real DeLorean .
The matching of shadows and lights is extraordinary , and if it were n’t for the fact that the car ’s headlights only have a road - reflection after they pass the street - light , it would be a perfect SFX illusion .
18 : Total Recall ( 1990 ) – Doing her nails .
This is an example of a simple effect that could probably have been achieved in the 1950s , if anyone had written a sci - fi script where a woman could change the colour of her nails with a tap on some future - gizmo .
The nails are rotoscoped to provide an area for an animated colour transition to take place , and that ’s all there is to it .
It ’s an elegant and not terribly expensive SFX shot that is 100 % convincing .
17 : The Road To Perdition ( 2002 ) – Entering Chicago .
You do n’t have to recreate the whole damned world to ‘ sell ’ period , but you do need to pull out the stops on one shot that establishes era .
SFX house Cinesite provide Sam Mendes with an unforgettable introduction to 1930s Chicago here , where cinematography , music and first - tier CGI work combine to take one ’s breath away .
The convenient flock of birds throwing the skyscrapers into relief are gilding the lily a little , but otherwise this is flawless .
16 : War Of The Worlds ( 2005 ) – Destroying the bridge .
This ILM shot was used to sell Spielberg ’s reimagining of both the 1953 George Pal production and H.G. Wells original book , and it ’s a marvel of frightening destructiveness custom - made to tap into the horrors of post - 9/11 culture .
The supposed camera operator sensibly moves towards areas of interest whilst not over - doing the manic camera shake .
WoTW is actually quite a close - set and intimate film , and the relatively small clutch of ‘ hero ’ shots like this are intended to sell us the scenario so we ’ll understand the claustrophobia of Tom Cruise ’s plight as he searches for shelter .
No - one could afford to make a film with very many labour - intensive shots like this , but WoTW could ’ve used another 10 - 15 .
Nonetheless , you can really see where the money went in this footage .
15 : The Last Starfighter ( 1984 ) – Starfighter leaves orbit .
SFX wizard John Dykstra marks Nick Castle ’s CGI - laden adventure as the moment that it was clear where optical effects were heading .
Only two years after TRON ( see # 9 ) , even the Cray X - MP computer could n’t hope to integrate non-stylistic live footage seamlessly with computer - generated special effects , and the film ’s ‘ computer game ’ link ( TRON ‘s excuse for the low - res effects ) was too tenuous to bridge the gap .
Nonetheless we see advancements here in rendering phong shaders , huge advancements in transparency shaders and also diffused shadow rendering .
There ’s still only very limited bitmap - texturing , but this shot is one of the most ambitious in Starfighter and it foreshadowed the SFX revolution of the 1990s by over six years .
14 : King Kong ( 1933 ) – Kong wrecks the subway .
This shot , with inserts of screaming citizens removed , is one of the most elaborate in Willis O’Brien ’s fantasy classic , and a veritable masterpiece not only of animation but of compositing .
Every part of the frame is alive with action – check out the strangely loitering gawpers at the windows , stage right .
Note also that fleeing crowds pass both in front of and behind Kong .
Also notice the animated passengers in the bottom left - hand corner of the frame who succeed in climbing down from the wrecked subway train and flee their furry persecutor .
It ’s a shame no - one thought of the go -motion approach for the first train , which passes in a particularly stiff manner , but that does n’t take away credit for the evident weeks or months of work which went into this one shot .
13 : Forrest Gump ( 1994 ) – Picking up Lt. Dan Taylor .
Once again Robert Zemeckis ’ knack for combining good storytelling skills with SFX know - how finds him deservedly in this list again .
Presenting fully - limbed Gary Sinise as an amputee for this shot required Sinise to keep his blue - stockinged lower legs dangling through two holes in the bed , which were later substituted with a combination of plate and CGI model material , whilst the areas around his knees were elaborately substituted with CGI stumps .
You can see the bed dip and rise as Sinise is lifted off , so it ’s no easy matte substitution , and the sheets even respond to the passing of one of his ‘ stumps ’ .
Totally convincing .
12 : Excalibur ( 1981 ) – Sword withdrawal .
Having re-spun the Luke - Skywalker - fights - himself scene from the previous year ’s The Empire Strikes Back , Lancelot ( Nicholas Clay ) extracts his own sword from the left side of his abdomen .
Dazzlingly perfect , this is perhaps literally the oldest trick in the book : a retractable blade combines with a drop - away ‘ exit wound tip ’ to create a perfect illusion .
This trick could have comfortably been performed at the court of the real King Arthur ; but if it ai n’t broke …
11 : Return Of The Jedi ( 1983 ) – ‘ There ’s too many of them ! ’
To give some idea of how hard a composite matte shot with 40 + elements was in the days of photochemical special effects , check out our interview with John Dykstra ( he discusses this at the bottom of page 1 ) .
Even with ILM ’s improved compositing techniques , getting that many elements to combine when the failure of only one could mean starting from scratch , is a huge achievement .
10 : Metropolis ( 1926 ) – View down onto the main street .
Fritz Lang ’s truly seminal SF masterpiece boasts a number of SFX shots that were not only iconic but ground - breaking in their use of hanging miniatures , miniature sets and a makeshift method of compositing known as the “ Schufftan Process ” , which involved removing strategic areas of silvering from a mirror and projecting ‘ live ’ footage onto the other side .
But the film is best known for its astonishing model work , of which this shot is a particularly fine example .
Note that the cars and vans of Lang ’s future city move at varying speeds and even veer a little to the left or right .
Also , the use of bright sunlight truly captures the sense of scale of a grand metropolis , and this is less evident in some of the more widely - reproduced shots featuring flying machines .
9 : TRON ( 1982 ) – Escape on the light - beam .
Having taken a sound thrashing at the box - office when pitting its old - style The Black Hole against Star Trek : The Motion Picture in Christmas of 1979 , Disney was desperate to update its appeal for a generation of kids beginning to think of it in terms of ‘ old ’ movies .
Consequently The Mouse leapt on Steven Lisberger ’s crazy idea for a semi-CGI adventure – even though CGI was a preserve mainly of theoretical labs at the time .
The sails on the ‘ Solar Sailor ’ in this shot had a small amount of transparency to them throughout most of the movie , something that was going to add a fair chunk of cash to the rendering pipeline , but which Lisberger held out for .
In this particular shot , the transparency has been filled in after a ‘ charge up ’ , possibly due to the scope of the shot and the enormously increased rendering times for a transparent element within it .
The shot itself presages the style of many a later CGI adventure , as well as clearly harking back to the holy grail of sci- fi movies – Star Wars .
8 : Cloverfield ( 2008 ) – First look at the devastation .
Matt Reeves ’ initial peek out into post - monster New York is a masterpiece of match - moving , with miles of virtual debris apparently available for the hand - held camera to zoom in on at will .
Oddly , it ’s only the head of the statue of liberty that looks fake * .
It would be a mistake to use the effectiveness of this technique as an excuse for yet more ‘ hand - held ’
Hollywood films , but advances in match - moving are likely to make this kind of seamless CGI integration far more affordable in the next few years .
* Thanks to VFX artist Riddick 1 for pointing out to me that the head was not a prop .
Check out his comment below , and you ’ll see that – fake - looking or not – the CGI Lady Liberty fooled Paramount itself .
7 : Hannibal ( 2001 ) – Brains for dinner .
Though utilising similar motion - capture / CGI combos to Terminator 3 ‘s ‘ ruined face ’ effect ( see # 24 ) , it ’s fairly unlikely that any use of the technique has wrung more horror ( or dinner ) out of people than when a drugged Ray Liotta is served his own brain - tissue to eat in Ridley Scott ’s horrific sequel to Silence Of The Lambs ( 1991 ) .
An animatronic head was used for certain close - up sequences not directly involving Liotta ’s face , but this shot is all CGI and mo-cap .
The only thing that potentially diminishes the effectiveness of the shot is the dark background , which rather gives the impression of sleight - of - hand or a magic show , when in fact the CGI does n’t need it in order to work .
6 : The Birds ( 1963 ) – Destruction of Capitol Oil garage .
An extraordinarily complex piece of compositing ( shown in the clip with inserts removed ) which demonstrates Hitchcock ’s continuing urge to push the lackadaisical state of the art .
The flapping of the birds ’ wings caused too much fringing for conventional blue - screen work to be utilised , and Hitchcock was forced to turn to the ‘ yellow screen ’ or ‘ sodium vapour process ’ .
Only Walt Disney studios have ever been equipped for this process , and indeed only one camera has ever been rigged for it .
SVP involves filming the subject against a screen lit with powerful sodium vapour lights utilising a very narrow spectrum of light .
Unlike most compositing processes , SVP actually shoots two separate elements of the footage simultaneously using a beam - splitter ; one reel exposed is regular photographic stock and the other an emulsion sensitive only to the sodium vapour wavelength .
Very precise mattes are obtained from the latter , allowing the subject to be pulled out of the background and combined with any other in a later run through an optical printer .
The fringing or ‘ matte line ’ effects are negligible compared to blue - screen work , but the very precise conditions under which the footage must be shot mitigated against its wide usage .
Disney , to whom many shots in The Birds was farmed out , used the process in numerous films including Mary Poppins ( 1964 ) , Freaky Friday ( 1976 ) and The Black Hole ( 1979 ) .
5 : The Spy Who Loved Me ( 1977 ) – Heading for Stromberg ’s Lair .
Possibly the first successful example of match - moving in motion pictures , Derek Meddings ’ audacious attempt to co-ordinate the aquatic lair of Bond ’s latest adversary into hand - held footage was a real eye - opener at the time , and another extraordinary achievement for a franchise which has frequently pushed the boundaries of optical effects .
4 : The Lost World ( 1997 ) – T - Rex takes a drink .
Here the T - Rex from the hugely successful dinosaur franchise is so perfectly integrated into its environment that one initially assumes it is the Stan Winston animatronic .
Only when its movements become a little bolder in warning off the barking dog do we realise that it must be CGI .
Selling an element so incongruous in an environment so familiar represents an extraordinary work of lighting and movement .
The Rex shifts its weight superbly , and there ’s very little to give it away , even on close examination .
3 : Star Wars ( 1977 ) – Into the trench .
Though the opening shot of Star Wars remains the most iconic , it suffered sniffy criticism from some quarters for being a higher - speed re-run of Douglas Trumbull ’s initial pan on the Jupiter mission in 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) .
This shot , on the other hand is not only equally exciting but far more original , as we take the point of view of a rebel fighter diving into the Death Star ’s trench to take a shot at the reactors .
The vast scale of the Death Star is revealed as soon as we have made our dizzying descent downward , and we see the walls of the trench extend for miles ahead .
This three - element shot ( model , laser - bolts and star background ) relies on the flexibility ( rather than the repeatability ) of the Dykstraflex motion control system , and is still a stunner .
2 : Star Trek II : The Wrath Of Khan ( 1982 ) – The Genesis project .
While TRON ( see # 9 ) was going for the low - res marathon at the box - office , the first of Nick Meyer ’s very popular Star Trek entries was wowing cinema - goers with some truly advanced CGI sprint - work from ILM showing the effect of the life - giving ‘ genesis device ’ on a planetary scale .
When the lengthy rendering process was well - advanced , someone spotted that the virtual camera was about to crash into one of the randomly created mountain ranges .
So much time and work would have been lost starting from scratch that it was decided to magically introduce a valley to let the camera through ( visible about 39 seconds into the clip ) .
This extraordinary sequence showed the future both of ILM and visual effects , even if there was yet a long wait for the hardware bottlenecks to clear up .
1 : JurassicPark ( 1992 ) – T - Rex investigates the light .
One of the oldest clips from the world of bitmap - textured CGI animation , and – to my mind – simply the most convincing ‘ impossible thing ’ ever committed to celluloid by Hollywood .
The segue between the withdrawing of Stan Winston ’s animatronic head and the appearance of the CGI version is effective and seamless , playing both technologies to their strengths .
The movement of the musculature in the T - Rex combines with the very prosaic illumination of the car headlights to sell the Rex , and the camera judder combines perfectly with the footfalls of the massive beast .
Rain and darkness have sold many a special effect before , and they certainly do no harm here , but the result is pure movie history .
“ Effects these days are in the hands of everyman .
You can go shoot a movie of broadcast quality on your own .
But it does n’t necessarily mean we ’re seeing better movies .
Shakespeare did n’t have a word - processor .
When we got word - processors , we did n’t get Shakespeare .
We gotta separate the two out .
There ’s creativity and there ’s technology , and the two are inter-related .
But technology is not necessarily creative . ”

Planet Of The Apes ( 1968 ) – discovery of the Statue Of Liberty .
Charlton Heston stumbles upon a competent – but not superb – matte painting of a post - holocaust Lady Liberty at the end of the furry sixties classic .
The shot is iconic because the idea is mind - twisting ; it ’s a fantastic ending , but the SFX tech and execution behind it were not ground - breaking , totally convincing or even exceptional .
The Matrix ( 1999 ) – Bullet - Time .
An effect extraordinarily limited in what can usefully be done with it , it has nonetheless been flogged to death in the 10 years since The Matrix .

During his long career , John McCain has battled Detroit and dressed down automakers to demand tougher mileage standards and safer cars .
But he apparently has a soft spot for used car dealers .
The lovefest started years ago , but was on full display during McCain ’s stints as chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee in the late 1990s and early 2000s .
Back in 1997 , McCain cosponsored legislation that would help used car dealers sell rebuilt wrecked cars to consumers , at inflated prices , and without disclosing the damage .
The bill , which had the potential to keep millions of dangerous cars on the nation ’s highways , was a pet project of then - Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) .
In June 1997 , Lott introduced the “ National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Bill , ” which , despite the title , actually would have undermined consumer protection laws nationwide .
Most states require damaged or totaled cars , like those flooded during Hurricane Katrina , to be tagged with what ’s known as a “ salvage title ” before they can be resold , so potential buyers will know those cars may have major problems .
Not surprisingly , car dealers would rather keep this information under wraps .
In one of the most common types of auto fraud , unscrupulous dealers will take damaged cars to a state with weak consumer protection laws and get new , non-salvage titles that allow them to disguise the fact that the car may be held together with gum and bailing wire .
Many states have been working to end this practice and have created stiff penalties for this sort of title fraud .
They also allow consumers to sue dealers to recoup their money if they have been defrauded .
But Lott ’s bill would have done away with those tough state laws by instituting a single weak federal statute governing salvage titles .
That new law would have prevented consumers from suing car dealers to get back their money if they ’d unwittingly bought a rebuilt wreck .
The Lott bill also exempted most used cars from any disclosure requirements .
States that wanted to continue to enforce their own stricter laws would have no choice but to give up federal funds that allowed them to participate in a national fraud - prevention database that helped track wrecked cars across state lines .
Thirty - eight state attorneys general , including Arizona ’s , wrote to McCain and other senators on the committee to oppose the bill , which Iowa attorney general Thomas Miller called a “ wolf in sheep ’s clothing . ”
The bill was a sop to sleazy used car dealers , but also to insurance companies , which profit from the sale of wrecked vehicles and were major financial backers of Lott ’s many Senate campaigns .
William Brauch , the director of the consumer protection division of the Iowa attorney general ’s office , testified against the bill before McCain ’s committee in September 1997 , emphasizing its impact on state consumer protection laws .
“ Our message to Congress was ‘ butt out , ' ” says Brauch .
Car titling , the issue at the heart of the bill , has always been a state function .
During the hearing , Brauch recalls , McCain disputed his contention that the bill would preempt state law .
But Sen. Slade Gorton ( R - Wash . ) set him straight , and McCain was forced to concede that the bill would indeed bigfoot the states .
Nonetheless , McCain shepherded the legislation through his committee and onto the Senate floor .
Both the Republican - controlled Senate and House passed the bill .
It looked like all but a done deal .
Republicans attached the measure to an omnibus spending bill with the assumption that President Clinton would have no choice but to sign it .
But in a minor bit of legislative drama , consumer activists and the state AGs succeeded in lobbying Clinton , who threatened to veto the spending bill unless the measure was taken out .
It was removed .
Lott tried again in 1999 , introducing a virtually identical bill , which McCain again cosponsored .
This time , though , Democrats , through Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , offered a competing bill that would have made the federal law the floor , not the ceiling , for consumer protection .
It would have allowed states to continue to enforce tougher laws if they wanted to , while raising the standards for other states whose laws were seen as too weak .
The bill was modeled on legislation that had successfully cracked down on car dealers who rolled back odometers .
Despite pleas from consumer activists , McCain kept the Feinstein bill bottled up in committee , and he moved Lott ’s bill to the Senate floor .
Rosemary Shahan , the head of California - based Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety , wrote McCain urging him to support the Feinstein bill .
When she got no response , she contacted reporters at the Arizona Republic , which in September 1999 ran a front - page story critical of McCain for supporting an anti-consumer bill .
Shahan says McCain was apparently unhappy with the story .
In February 2000 , when McCain came to Sacramento for a town hall meeting , Shahan was there distributing information about the bill to the audience and assembled reporters .
She also got in line to ask a question .
“ They stopped taking questions when they got to me , ” she says .
So afterward Shahan approached McCain and asked him if he ’d consider dropping his sponsorship of the Lott bill and cosponsor Feinstein’s .
“ He would never look me in the eye , ” she says .
McCain , she says , was clearly very angry and eventually dismissed her by saying , “ You made your point . ”
Then he walked off .
“ He knew it was a bad bill , ” says Shahan .
The Lott bill eventually died , but the episode stands out for several reasons .
For much of his tenure as commerce committee chair , McCain had forged a good relationship with auto safety and consumer groups .
Joan Claybrook , the president of Public Citizen , the consumer group founded by Ralph Nader , has been a fan .
In 2001 , Public Citizen gave McCain an award for his leadership and commitment to consumer rights .
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety also touts an endorsement from McCain on its website .
The rebuilt - wreck issue forced McCain to choose between consumers and a stalwart Republican constituency .
Car dealers have long had a close relationship with the Republican Party .
Republican presidents have gone so far as to give a few car dealers and their wives ambassadorships .
The current ambassador to the UK , Robert Tuttle , owns one of California ’s biggest car dealerships .
The American ambassador to Barbados is married to the owner of a major DC - area auto dealership .
Just this year , car dealers have showered McCain with more than $ 700,000 in campaign contributions , more than four times what they gave Barack Obama .
But campaign money does not sufficiently explain McCain ’s stance .
One reason consumer advocates have liked him is that he has publicly hammered auto industry officials , who were among his largest contributors , for refusing to get on board with new auto safety standards .
“ He was as tough as any member of Congress has been ” on auto issues , says Sally Greenberg , executive director of the National Consumers League .
But the rebuilt - wreck bill was a pet cause of Lott ’s , the Senate majority leader , and consumer advocates figured that McCain ’s party loyalty trumped consumer protection in this case .
It was an episode in which he was neither a maverick nor a reformer .

Connecticut State Representatives are petitioning the State to subsidize The Bristol Press and The Herald of New Britain , two papers facing shutdown in January as we reported November 11 .
The letter from seven Democrat State Representatives to the State Department of Economic and Community Development asks for unspecified “ help ” for both papers , arguing for the continued existence of both as they are a “ central point of information and record about a city ” and that both are important for public accountability .
They even go as far as mentioning free press as an essential part of the Bill of Rights .
Where do you start with this news .
That it ’s happened is n’t greatly surprising in an age where Government regularly intervenes to prop up or save failed businesses .
The entire newspaper industry is in trouble in the United States , so this call for State help is probably the first of many to come .
Newspapers are n’t required to disseminate local information , the internet does a perfectly good job , so their argument is at best bizarre .
These are also fairly small towns with populations less than 100,000 people , so the idea that each would need a daily newspaper is stranger again , and both towns are serviced by State and National newspapers .
I ’ll leave the last word to Mark Finkelstein , who paints a picture of newspapers in the future :
Governor : John ?
It ’s the Governor here .
Say , you guys there at the Bristol Press are doing a great job .
Top notch .
But there is that one reporter of yours making a big stink over our proposal to increase the state income tax .
He really does n’t get what we ’re trying to do to help our state move forward .
And you know , that bill to renew your paper ’s subsidy is coming up next week .
I ’d hate to see it get bogged down in the fuss over this .
Know what I mean ?
Editor : Um , yes , I know , sir .

Updated Six British ISPs are filtering access to Wikipedia after the site was added to an Internet Watch Foundation child - pornography blacklist , according to Wikipedia administrators .
As of Sunday morning UK time , certain British web surfers were unable to view at least one Wikipedia article tagged with ostensible child porn .
And , in a roundabout way , the filtering has resulted in Wikipedia admins banning large swaths of the United Kingdom from editing the " free encyclopedia anyone can edit " .
On Friday , Wikipedia administrators noticed that Virgin Media , Be Unlimited / O2 / Telefonica , EasyNet / UK Online , PlusNet , Demon , and Opal were routing Wikipedia traffic through a small number of transparent proxy servers as a way of blocking access to the encyclopedia 's article on Virgin Killer , a mid-1970s record album from German heavy metal band the Scorpions .
At it stands , the article includes an image of the album 's original cover , which depicts a naked prepubescent girl .
The cover was banned in many countries and replaced by another when the album made its 1976 debut .
And apparently , the image is now on a blacklist compiled by the Internet Watch Foundation , a government - backed organization charged with fighting online child pornography in the UK and Europe .
According to posts on Wikipedia and Wikinews , users of those six ISPs receive blank pages , " 404 errors " or something similar if they attempt to view the Virgin Killer article .
But that 's half the issue .
Because the six ISPs are routing Wikipedia traffic through transparent proxies , huge numbers of would - be Wikipedia editors appear to be coming from the same IP range .
A single IP , for instance , may identify all Virgin Media users .
This means that if Wikipedia admins ban one Virgin Media customer for " abusing " the site with inappropriate edits , they ban every Virgin Media customer .
According to ZDNet , many UK users receive this message if they attempt to edit the site :
Wikipedia has been added to a Internet Watch Foundation UK website blacklist , and your Internet service provider has decided to block part of your access .
Unfortunately , this also makes it impossible for us to differentiate between different users , and block those abusing the site without blocking other innocent people as well .
In Wikiland , this creates an epic user - generated conundrum .
Wikipedia fancies itself as a kind of Web 2.0 wonderland where anyone on earth can contribute .
So it does n't like banning edits from enormous chunks of the UK .
But administrators have refused to remove the naked prepubescent on the grounds that " Wikipedia does n't censor . "
According to admins , the issue is now in the hands of the Wikimedia Foundation , the non-profit that oversees Wikipedia .
But as of Sunday morning , the Foundation had not spoken .
Whether it removes the naked prepubescent or not , the Foundation will receive an uncensored Web 2.0 tongue - lashing .
Wikipedia is n't a user - generated utopia .
It 's a cultish self - contradiction that can't help but undermine its own ideals . ®
Update
The IWF has acknowledged blocking Wikipedia 's Virgin Killer article via British ISPs .
A spokeswoman told The Reg that the organization believes the album cover image includes content that is consistent with the legal definition of child abuse , pointing out that under the UK Children Act , the only issue at stake is the content – not the intent of the publisher .
However , as of Sunday evening UK time , the offending image is still freely available on Amazon , and as the controversy over Wikipedia rolls on , it is being reproduced on hundreds of sites available in the UK and across the world .
David Gerard , an ( unofficial ) Wikipedia UK press spokesman , takes issue with the fact that ISPs are blocking not only the image but the associated text of the article : " Part of the problem lies in the fact that the IWF have not just blocked the offending image , but have blocked the accompanying text as well .
We can not be certain , but we suspect that had they stuck to their remit of focussing on pictures , the problem might not have arisen . "
Update 2
According to Wikipedia admins , British Wikipedia editors are being hidden behind a small number of IP addresses because the ISPs ' proxy servers are not passing Wikipedia the " X - Forwarded - From " header , which would allow the site to identify the true IP range of individual users .
It 's unclear whether a workaround is possible .
Naturally , Virgin Killer is now among the most popular pages on the English - language version of Wikipedia .
The IWF has also posted a statement on its website .
It reads , in part :
A Wikipedia web page was reported through the IWF ’s online reporting mechanism in December 2008 .
As with all child sexual abuse reports received by our Hotline analysts , the image was assessed according to the UK Sentencing Guidelines Council ( page 109 ) .
The content was considered to be a potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18 , but hosted outside the UK .
The IWF does not issue takedown notices to ISPs or hosting companies outside the UK , but we did advise one of our partner Hotlines abroad and our law enforcement partner agency of our assessment .
The specific URL ( individual webpage ) was then added to the list provided to ISPs and other companies in the online sector to protect their customers from inadvertent exposure to a potentially illegal indecent image of a child .
Meanwhile , a Wikimedia Foundation spokesman has acknowledged that huge numbers of British ISPs users have been blocked from editing Wikipedia , but did not seem to comment further : " It appears that there 's a large number of editors — I can't say all — who appear to have access issues , " he told THe AP .

Initial findings from a Russian police investigation indicated the quality of medical treatment did not cause the death of New York Rangers prospect and Continental Hockey League player Alexei Cherepanov .
Cherepanov , the 17th overall pick in the 2007 entry draft , collapsed on the bench during the third period of a KHL game Oct. 13 at the Sports Palace in Chekov outside Moscow .
The Russian state police report was revealed at a Friday news conference in Moscow , the details of which were forwarded to ESPN.com .
Doctors and medical personnel " acted professionally and did everything they could .
The absence of special medical equipment in the arena was not the cause of death of this hockey player , " Vladimir Shalaev , head of hockey operations for the fledgling KHL , said in a news release .
Russian officials , however , refused to reveal exactly what caused Cherepanov 's death , but promised that information would be forthcoming .
It is unknown whether criminal charges still might be filed .
" There was a move to close the criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Aleksei Cherepanov [ sic ] , however the prosecutor ordered that the criminal investigation continue , " Shalaev said .
" Once the KHL receives the results of a comprehensive forensic examination , they will be made public , and any further individuals found to be negligent will be identified , " Shalaev was quoted as saying .
Cherepanov , who had just returned from a shift in a game in which he scored a goal , was carried by Avangard Omsk teammates , including former NHL star Jaromir Jagr , into their dressing room .
Medical staff tried to revive Cherepanov at the arena and later at a hospital , where he died .
He was 19 years old .
There were initial reports that defibrillators at the arena did not work and that ambulance staff were slow responding to the emergency .
The KHL moved quickly to suspend the arena manager and the team manager from the host Vityaz club within days of Cherepanov 's death .
" The KHL acted appropriately and within its bounds in imposing sanctions against the Vityaz club director and other officials involved in this tragic accident , " Shalaev said in Friday 's statement .
The news release also indicated the KHL finally had received medical records from the Rangers regarding Cherepanov 's time at a Rangers training camp following the 2007 draft .
In an interview with ESPN.com in Toronto last weekend , KHL president Alexander Medvedev complained that two requests for those records had been denied by the Rangers .
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly explained to ESPN.com that those records could only be released with the family 's consent , and that Cherepanov 's family had not provided that consent .
" We would like to express our thanks to this NHL club for sharing the results of this medical exam with us . "
Shalaev said .
The KHL also announced that as part of a new medical screening process adopted after Cherepanov 's death , an examination of 67 KHL players revealed that five have medical problems .
" Of this group , it appears that one or two young hockey players may have significant health concerns and may have to change their careers , " a KHL official said .

Russia is to increase sharply its production of strategic nuclear missiles , throwing down the gauntlet to the US president - elect , Barack Obama , who would have to deal with the Kremlin 's response to US missile defence plans in Europe .
A senior government official in Moscow said the Russian military would commission 70 strategic missiles over the next three years .
It was unclear whether sea- launched ballistic missiles were included in this figure , but military experts said it could represent up to a fourfold increase on the rate of production of land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) .
The missiles would be part of a £ 95bn defence procurement package for 2009 - 2011 , said Vladislav Putilin , a deputy head of the Russian cabinet 's military - industrial commission in charge of weapons industries .
Russia has produced only five to seven Topol - M ICBMs a year since the late 1990s and its stockpiles of several hundred heavy Soviet - era missiles such as the SS - 19 Stiletto are rapidly reaching the end of their lifespan .
Putilin told a press conference the defence package represented a 28 % increase on the previously announced procurement budget for 2009 , with further increases in the following two years .
" More than 70 strategic missiles will be bought and delivered to troops in the next three years , more than 30 short - range Iskander missiles and a large number of booster rockets and aircraft , " he said .
Military experts said the increased procurement of ICBMs was an attempt by Russia 's depleted armed forces to produce a bargaining chip in negotiations with Washington over signing a new arms reduction treaty to replace Start I .
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has signalled his intention to take an aggressive stance with the new US administration .
On the day Obama was elected Medvedev announced plans to station short - range Iskander missiles in Russia 's Kaliningrad exclave if the US goes ahead with building a missile defence system in Europe .
Ruben Sergeev , an expert on disarmament issues , said Moscow was afraid of falling behind in a new arms race .
" Russia is decommissioning its old liquid - fuel missiles from the Soviet era at a rate of several dozen every year , " he said .
" The Kremlin knows that if it does n't increase production of ICBMs rapidly , then it will have no chance of getting a new arms reduction treaty out of the United States , which has much greater quantities of missiles . "
The Start I treaty , signed between the Soviet Union and the US , expires in December next year , with negotiations on a new deal expected to start in the spring .
Sergei Lavrov , Russia 's foreign minister , said last week the treaty needed to be " preserved and strengthened " .
" Without the mutual control agreements embodied in the Start treaty , Russia , as the weaker partner , would lose all possibilities to keep tabs on the Americans ' quickly developing strategic nuclear forces , " said Sergeev .
Work has started on the construction of 56 Leonard Street , a 56 - storey residential tower in New York designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron .
The tower , the architects ' first , will be built on the corner of Leonard Street and Church Street in Tribeca .
A specially commissioned sculpture by Anish Kapoor will sit at the corner of the building at street level .

--
CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON HERZOG & DE MEURON ’S 56 LEONARD STREET
Since its formation in 1978 , the Basel , Switzerland - based architecture firm of Herzog & de Meuron has achieved international renown for buildings -- houses , libraries , schools , stores , museums , hotels , factories , arenas -- that strike an uncanny balance between strict refinement and pure invention , practicality and the sublime .
Their recently completed Beijing National Stadium in China , for billions of worldwide spectators the single most enduring image of the 2008 Olympic Games , has redefined the sports arena for the future , while museums like the Tate Modern at Bankside in London and the de Young Museum in San Francisco ambush expectations of what makes a building ideal for art .
With such commissions , Herzog & de Meuron has aimed not for virtuosity but innovation , looking always to the broader culture and art for inspiration .
Referring to Andy Warhol , Jacques Herzog has said , " He used common Pop images to say something new .
That is exactly what we are interested in : to use well known forms and materials in a new way so that they become alive again . ”
On the threshold of its fourth decade , Herzog & de Meuron is poised to reinvent another great architectural prototype as construction begins in New York City on the first hi-rise tower of the firm ’s career .
56 Leonard Street will be a 57 - story residential condominium building at the intersection of Church Street and Leonard Street in the Tribeca Historic District of downtown Manhattan , where it will rise above cobbled streets and historic 19th century neighbors .
The tower will house 145 residences , each with its own unique floor plan and private outdoor space , in a veritable cascade of individual homes that the architects describe as “ houses stacked in the sky , ” blending indoors and outdoors seamlessly together .
With its articulated surfaces , dramatic cantilevers , profiled slab edges , profusion of balconies , expanses of glass , and views from downtown Manhattan to as far as the Atlantic Ocean , Herzog & de Meuron ’s 56 Leonard Street breaks down the old image of the high - rise as a sleek , hermetically sealed urban object to propose instead a thoughtful , daring and ultimately dazzling new alternative -- the iconic American skyscraper re-envisioned as a pixilated vertical layering of individually sculpted , highly customized , graceful private residences opening to the atmosphere .
The architects ’ design for 56 Leonard Street also updates the relationship between private tower and public streetscape with an articulated base whose cantilevers generate a sense of movement and permeability .
Here , the building ’s defining corner will be the site of a major commissioned sculpture by internationally celebrated London - based artist Anish Kapoor .
Fully integrated into the architecture itself as if to say that culture and the city are indivisible , Kapoor ’s massive , reflective stainless steel piece – an enigmatic balloon - like form that appears to be combating compression from above – will be a new cultural landmark in Tribeca and the artist ’s first permanent public work in New York City .
Kapoor ’s sculptural contribution to 56 Leonard Street extends his ongoing exploration of physical and psychological space , as in such works as the “ Cloud Gate ” in Chicago ’s Millennium Park and the recent mammoth temporary installation “ Sky Mirror ” at Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan .
Homes available at 56 Leonard Street will range in size from 1,430 square feet to 6,380 square feet , and will include two - to five - bedroom residences and 10 penthouses .
Prices for the residences at 56 Leonard Street range from $ 3.5 million to $ 33 million .
56 Leonard Street has been developed by Izak Senbahar and Simon Elias of Alexico Group LLC , New York City , developer of such acclaimed Manhattan projects as The Mark by Jacques Grange and 165 Charles Street by Richard Meier .
Costas Kondylis & Partners of New York City is serving as executive architect for the building .
Construction manager for 56 Leonard Street is Hunter Roberts , New York City .
Exclusive sales and marketing agent for the project is Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group .
Occupancy at 56 Leonard Street is anticipated in late fall 2010 .
“ We are extremely pleased and honored to be able to create a tower of true global character at a moment when great architectural ferment is reshaping New York City , ” said Izak Senbahar of Alexcio .
“ With 56 Leonard we aspire to make a unique contribution to the fabric of our town with a building that relates directly to the city but is also an outstanding international address . ”
THE BUILDING
At 56 Leonard Street , the architects ’ intention is to preserve the celebratory spirit of traditional skyscrapers while introducing new structural possibilities and suggesting fresh ways for people inside such towers to relate to their city .
Inspired by the permeability and spatial qualities of Modernist houses and the great American dream of a customized home , Herzog & de Meuron has replaced the usual extrusion of standardized skyscraper floor plates with a staggered progression of structural slabs turning slightly off axis by degrees as they ascend , creating constant variety among the apartment floor plans .
This structural arrangement of floor plates at 56 Leonard Street will create an irregular flurry of cantilevered terraces up and down the building , making plays of light and shadow that give the tower a shimmering , animated appearance on the skyline and widely varying interiors .
56 Leonard Street contains five key zones ascending from street to sky : lobby , “ townhouse ” residences , amenities , tower residences , and penthouses .
Appearing to rest upon Anish Kapoor ’s sculpture , the base of 56 Leonard Street will have the appearance of a stack of cantilevering volumes with varying degrees of transparency and opacity .
This section of the building contains a dramatic double - height , 1,600 square foot lobby with an entrance on Leonard Street adjacent to a verdant exterior vertical garden to the west .
Sheathed in gleaming black granite , the lobby space includes stations for a 24 - hour doorman and concierge , with custom designed reception desks by Herzog & de Meuron ; private residents ’ mail , package and refrigerated storage room ; custom - designed visitor seating fixtures ; and two separate elevator landings with a total of seven elevators featuring interiors designed by the architects .
Above the 18 foot - high black granite - walled lobby are several floors of residences that relate very directly to the immediate scale and panorama of the neighborhood ( homes known by the architects as “ the townhouses ” ) and two full floors of amenities spaces custom designed to the last detail by Herzog & de Meuron .
These include an indoor / outdoor 75 - foot infinity edge pool , one of Manhattan ’s largest , surrounded by a black terrazzo deck inlaid with spherical glass aggregate .
An adjoining outdoor sundeck cantilevers 20 feet over the block to provide extraordinary Tribeca views and a sense of connection to the district .
Other amenities include a fitness center with yoga studio , wet and dry spa features and terrace ; a library lounge ( above ) ; a screening room ; a private dining / conference room ; and a Tribeca Tot Room for children ’s play and family activities .
Every angle and structural element has been designed to create visual access to the cityscape for those inside the building and aesthetic excitement for passersby on the street .
Floors eight through forty - five at 56 Leonard Street containing the building ’s one - to five - bedroom residences .
In each residence , grand glass doors of up to 12 feet in height lead to private outdoor spaces outfitted with travertine pavers , a frameless balustrade and custom designed handrail .
Balconies and terraces are arranged in varied schemes that provide uninterrupted views of the city , its flanking rivers and New York Harbor , and saturate living spaces with light .
Interior details , sharply refined by Herzog & de Meuron , enhance the perception of spatial flow and an atmosphere of harmony .
The building ’s exposed exterior concrete is complemented indoors by a subtle neutral palette of extremely sensual materials .
Champagne colored window mullions , satin etched glass , natural pale solid woods , travertine , Thassos marble , polished metals , black granite and high gloss black lacquer accents are part of a super - customized , luxurious package of finishes chosen to complement furniture and art .
Extending the assertive sculptural character of the building ’s exterior to key interior details , Herzog & de Meuron has conceived several signature sculptural fixtures for the homes at 56 Leonard Street .
Fireplace hearths soar from floor - to - ceiling , crafted by the architects in high gloss white enameled steel .
Derived from pragmatic architectural functions , this monumental freestanding sculptural element anchors the great room and provides a dramatic focal point while reflecting and diffusing ambient light .
For 56 Leonard Street kitchens , Herzog & de Meuron have designed a special prep and dining island fitted with a high gloss black lacquer base and enhanced honed black granite countertop – a feature with the alluring curves of a grand piano or an elliptical lozenge – accompanied by a custom hood either sculpted from the wall or descending from the ceiling .
Generous cooking and entertaining spaces are complemented by top line appliances integrated into custom cabinetry , and sleek , minimal glass cabinets designed by the architects .
Bathrooms at 56 Leonard Street are similarly meticulous in detail .
Curving spaces enclose custom Herzog & de Meuron marble mosaic tiled walls , vanities , cast six foot oval soaking tub , shower , cabinetry and fixtures , all planned in relation to expansive windows framing views in the most private area of the home .
The building ’s dramatic nine - story crown contains its apex penthouses - eight occupying full floors and two occupying half floors - will appear on the Manhattan skyline as a chimerical geometric sculpture of stacked , glimmering glass volumes .
Ranging in size from approximately 3,650 to almost 6,380 square feet , these aeries embrace the outdoors through expansive private terraces of up to 1,700 square feet .
Penthouses are accessed by private elevator .
Soaring window walls rise to 14 feet and open onto panoramas of the city and sky .
Summarizing their design , Herzog & de Meuron has said , “ “ We approached the design process for 56 Leonard Street from the inside out , from the homes themselves .
But we also considered the outside in terms of the Tribeca neighborhood .
Here you have the small townhouses , the old manufacturing buildings , and the high - rise buildings , but also a lot of little corners and surprising things between .
The different scales characterize the neighborhood and we wanted to establish a dialogue among them .
For us , creating a building is a research process .
We call it a journey . ”

From the BFI National Film archive , via YouTube :
" Tibetan Scenes was made by Tsien - Lien Shen in the early 1940s – he was resident Chinese Commissioner in Lhasa from 1942 - 47 .
The colour film records many of the ceremonial events that took place in Lhasa , including the New Year ceremonies , and Shen himself appears in the film .
There is also evidence of the presence of the Chinese in Lhasa .
Although the majority of the film focuses on Tibetan ceremonies , there are some invaluable scenes capturing everyday life in Lhasa , as monks , porters , market stall sellers and the occasional yak compete for space . "
So it should n't be surprising to learn parents have the same bias .
Still , the headline in Science Times was jolting : " Ugly children may get parental short shrift . "
As Nicholas Bakalar wrote : " Canadian researchers have made a startling assertion : parents take better care of pretty children than they do ugly ones . "
Researchers at the University of Alberta observed that at the supermarket , less adorable tykes were more often allowed to engage in potentially dangerous activities - like standing up in the shopping cart or wandering off .
Good - looking children , especially boys , got more attention from their parents and were kept closer at hand .
" When it came to buckling up , pretty and ugly children were treated in starkly different ways , with seatbelt use increasing in direct proportion to attractiveness , " the article said .
" When a woman was in charge , 4 per cent of the homeliest children were strapped in , compared with 13.3 per cent of the most attractive children . "
With fathers , it was even worse , " with none of the least attractive children secured with seatbelts , while 12.5 per cent of the prettiest children were " .
Have n't these parents heard of the ugly duckling ?
Do they read to pretty kids only about pretty ducklings ?
Even if you 're sceptical about supermarket science , the story conjures up poignant images of ugly rugrats toddling off , or flying through the air and crashing into the rotisserie chicken oven because they 're not belted in .
Dr Andrew Harrel , the research team 's leader , put the findings in evolutionary terms : pretty children represent a premium genetic legacy , so get top care .
" Like lots of animals , " he said , " we tend to parcel out our resources on the basis of value . "
As Marilyn Monroe explained in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes : " Do n't you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty ?
You would n't marry a girl just because she 's pretty , but my goodness , does n't it help ? "
A beauty bias against children seems so startling because you grow up thinking parents are the only ones who will give you unconditional love , not measure it out in coffee spoons based on your genetic luck - which , after all , they 're responsible for .
But the world can be harsh .
Surface matters more and more , and the world ignores Shakespeare 's lesson from The Merchant of Venice : " Gilded tombs do worms infold . "
An analysis published last month by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis suggests that the good - looking get more money and promotions than average - looking schmos .
Quoting economists Daniel Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle , the study notes that being tall , slender and attractive could be worth a " beauty premium " - an extra 5 per cent an hour - while there is a " plainness penalty " of 9 per cent in wages ( after excluding other issues ) .
Researchers report that taller men are more likely to win in business and - except for the hapless Al Gore and John Kerry - get elected president .
Correlating 16 - year - olds ' height with their later salaries shows beanstalks grow up to earn about $ US789 more a year for each extra inch ( 2.5 centimetres ) of height .
In his best - seller Blink , Malcolm Gladwell did a survey of half the Fortune 500 CEOs , and found that the average CEO , at 1.8 metres , was about 7.6 centimetres taller than the average American man .
As Randy Newman sang , " Short people got no reason to live . "
Research also shows that obese women get 17 per cent lower wages than women of average weight and that dishy professors get better evaluations from their students .
There can be too much of a good thing .
As Dan Ondrack , a professor at the University of Toronto , told The Toronto Star , there 's a " Boopsey " effect - if women are too gorgeous , people assume they are airheads .
No one seems sure whether bosses discriminate against people because they 're less attractive , or whether more attractive people develop more self - esteem and social finesse .
But one thing 's for sure .
It 's hard to develop self - esteem when you 're hurtling out of the supermarket cart towards the rotisserie oven .
Scarborough drops F - bomb on live television Nick Juliano and David Edwards

This MSNBC morning host Joe Scarborough absentmindedly let slip an expletive during Monday morning 's broadcast .
" These are good decent steady men who do n't go around flipping people off or screaming ' fuck you ' at the top of their lungs , " Scarborough said , ( about the 2:30 point in the below video ) .
The host apparently was oblivious that he had let the word slip ; he was praising Barack Obama and the president - elect 's stable of campaign advisers , contrasting them with the bare - knuckled approach of incoming chief of staff Rahm Emanuel .
Notably , this is n't the first time Scarborough has let the expletive slip during a live broadcast .
In 2006 , Scarborough described his introduction from host Tucker Carlson as " pretty fucking awesome . "
Morning Joe broadcasts live , and viewers saw the curse word un - bleeped .
Scarborough 's co-hosts had to point out what he had just said , prompting numerous apologies .
After a commercial break , Scarborough was able to joke about the incident .
" The e-mails keep coming in to Morning Joe , now with an extra jolt of espresso , " he said .
Broadcast networks are embroiled in a Supreme Court battle over previous incidents where the word has gone out on the air .
It 's unclear what consequences Scarborough or MSNBC will face , although in recent years the FCC has made a point of cracking down on networks that air " fleeting expletives " during live broadcasts such as award shows .
Cable broadcasts , though , generally are not subject to FCC obscenity regulations .
The FCC 's policy is subject to a current Supreme Court case .
The government is trying to fine broadcasters for curse words spoken during award show broadcasts , such as when Bono pronounced U2's Golden Globe award " fucking brilliant in 2003 . "
An appeals court already has ruled against the FCC 's stringent standard .

Even the gravity waves produced by circling pairs of superdense neutron stars can only be detected indirectly ( Image : Mark Galick / SPL )
If you think the idea of gravitational waves propelling interplanetary spacecraft sounds like science fiction , you ’re in good company – any astrophysicist will rubbish the idea out of hand .
However , that did n’t stop the US Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) from commissioning a report to investigate whether the elusive waves could pose a threat to US security .
The JASON Defense Advisory Group were also asked to judge whether high - frequency gravitational waves could image the centre of the Earth , or be used for telecommunications .
Advertisement
Gravitational waves are ripples in space - time caused by the movement of an extremely large mass , such as a very dense star .
Yet even those from huge stellar events have been too weak to trip the most sensitive detectors .
The best evidence is indirect , coming from observations of how superdense , binary neutron stars lose energy .
‘ Pseudo - science ’
Nevertheless , the JASON team was asked to consider a funding proposal from US company GravWave to the DIA that claimed humans could generate strong gravitational waves on Earth , using the Gertsenshtein effect .
This describes how electromagnetic waves travelling through a very strong magnetic field can be converted into gravitational waves .
When the JASON team did the maths , however , results were not good for the plan ’s supporters .
The technique is so inefficient that it would take longer than the lifetime of the universe for every power station on Earth to produce a gravitational wave with the energy of one ten millionth of a Joule .
Accelerating a spacecraft at 10 metres per second squared , a rate that just exceeds the pull of Earth ’s gravity , would require 1025 times ( a 1 followed by 25 zeroes ) the electricity output of the world .
The report ( pdf format ) concludes : “ These proposals belong to the realm of pseudo - science , not science . ”
‘ Utter nonsense ’
Physicists striving to actually detect gravitational waves expressed surprise that a committee needed a 40 - page report to come to that conclusion .
“ The proposal is utter nonsense , ” says Karsten Danzmann from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hanover , Germany , and member of the GEO600 project to detect gravitational waves .
“ I ’m a bit surprised the agency bothered to commission an investigation – it would probably have been enough to just ask an in - house science advisor , ” he says .
David Shoemaker , from MIT in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a member of the LIGO project to detect gravitational waves , agrees that a quick phone call to a physicist may have been sufficient .
But he quips that given the US defence establishment ’s history of funding bad science , over - long reports that rubbish such ideas at an early stage may not be a bad thing .
“ The Department of Defense always have a few projects on the go that disobey the rules of thermodynamics , so I wish they would commission this kind of in - depth study in more cases . ”
In the mid-1990s and early 2000s the Pentagon spent millions of dollars on developing a quasi - nuclear weapon called the hafnium bomb that was actually based on junk science .
When put into that context , perhaps the money spent on a report that prevents similar spending on gravitational wave weapons was actually a good investment .
Microsoft officially says it will ship the Windows 7 operating system within three years of the January 2007 consumer release of Windows Vista .
But speculation abounds that the software giant is gunning to ship halfway through 2009 to be on machines for the back - to - school and holiday seasons .
Microsoft has hinted , whether intentionally or by accident , at a 2009 Windows 7 release by saying on its WinHEC website that , " WinHEC [ 2008 ] is the only chance for you to engage with the team at this level — there is not another WinHEC planned before Windows 7 is released . "
This is eyebrow - raising given that the next WinHEC is scheduled for early May 2009 .
Adding to the bits of evidence that Windows 7 will ship early is a slip of the tongue from Jerry Shen , CEO of Windows OEM Asus , who said in a recent interview : " In the second half of next year we will put Windows 7 on Eee PCs . "
No matter when Windows 7 actually ships , industry analysts agree that the marketing and release of 7 needs to go off without a hitch to avoid the problems encountered during the tumultuous release of Windows Vista .
Gartner : The Earlier the Better
Gartner Research has predicted that Microsoft will ship Windows 7 in time for the 2009 holiday season , which would require shipment to take place around August 2009 .
" It 's much better for a new version of Windows to ship before the holidays than after , " says Michael Silver , a vice president and research director at Gartner .
" After the holidays there are all sorts of problems with advertising the new release to consumers because ads can't start before the holiday because they might suppress PC sales . "
Silver expects that Microsoft will try to differentiate Windows 7 from Vista by keeping ship date hype to a minimum and then delivering earlier than anticipated .
" If they do n't give a date , it 's harder for people to say they were late , " he says .
" This is more of a point release than a major ' dot zero ' release , like Windows XP .
And Windows XP shipped 18 months after Windows 2000 .
So 30 - something months should really be doable [ for Windows 7 ] . "
But Can Windows 7 Make the Holiday Deadline ?
Al Gillen , research VP of system software at IDC , is not entirely convinced that Windows 7 could make the 2009 holiday timeframe even if Microsoft wanted it .
" Let 's work backwards to get a reality check , " says Gillen .
" For Microsoft to make holiday 2009 , the product must be released to OEMs by , say , September , or October 1 at the latest .
That will be RTM [ release to manufacturing ] code .
Back up to RC2 , RC1 , Beta 3 , Beta 2 and Beta 1 , and you are looking at a minimum of an 8 - month window . "
Gillen said that Microsoft could still make the holiday schedule , but there would be no Beta 3 , and possibly no RC2 .
" What happens between now and early January will be pretty telling .
But keep in mind that Microsoft 's early - adopter customers tell Microsoft when they think the product is ready to ship .
They can delay it if they feel features are not mature enough , " he says .
As far as the tone Microsoft should take with the Windows 7 release , Gillen says the software giant will be cautious because it has been burned too many times on ship dates .
" I think Microsoft is being conservative on its promises and schedules and may be trying not to over - promise .
It remains to be seen if they can over - deliver . "
Be Flexible and Make Less Noise Than Vista
Roger Kay , president of research firm Endpoint Technologies , said that Microsoft needs to remain open and flexible as it builds to the release of Windows 7 , whenever that may be .
" Microsoft , because of its position in the industry , must signal its intentions with lots of warning .
So , as the code stabilizes , the company will begin to refine its target ship date , " Kay says .
He added that shipping Windows before the 2009 holiday season will be helpful , but it 's not critical .
" Vista is finally stable and could sustain holiday 2009 .
But shipping Windows 7 would be nice as a way to stimulate traffic . "
Kay stressed that it's also wise for Microsoft to be more low key than it was with the somewhat bombastic unveiling of Vista .
" Microsoft should probably not spend on a launch like it did for Vista , but be lower key .
Nonetheless , I think uptake for Windows 7 will be much better , since its backend is built on the now - stable Vista , but the front end is much better . "
Gartner 's Silver contends that Microsoft is on the right path with Windows 7 because it is positioning it as something more than Vista R2 .
Being on time for holiday 2009 is another way to stay on that path , he says .
Silver concludes : " Where it could get messy for Windows 7 is if the drivers and apps are not ready yet , or they miss the holiday by a few weeks again . "
Ok , let ’s state this for the record :
MP3 is not a crime , it ’s a format .
Before this the music industry has used the exact same rhetoric against almost every emerging method of music distribution , from player pianos at the beginning of the 20th century to LP ’s to the most obvious parallel : cassette tapes .
In hindsight , none of these technologies — even the dreaded home taping — has managed to kill off music despite the stern warnings of the industry .
On the contrary , the new technologies have brought about new genres , such as hiphop and remix cultures , and helped promote up - and - coming bands .
The reluctance of record companies to embrace new technology is understandable once you start taking the marketing aspects into account .
The problem , from their point of view , is not that MP3′s decrease sales but that they take marketing from the hands of the companies .
As personal music distribution becomes easier and more effective , systems like Payola are n’t really getting the job done anymore .
Marketing without predictability , or even the illusion of predictability , is n’t really an attractive development for the Big Five .
And then there is the idea of DRM .
One can imagine how the thought of stopping piracy by adding some form of “ copy protection ” ( a nice turn of phrase , there ) looks really attractive on paper ; a bit like putting a lock on your door to stop burglars .
Unfortunately adding these programs on CD ’s also restricts legal copies — good luck with your MP3 player , there — as well as causes problems in certain CD players .
An even bigger problem with the idea of DRM is the mindset : everyone is a thief and must be stopped before he can steal food from the mouths of starving artist ( and record companies ) .
I ’m sorry , but as music enthusiasts we find that idea a tad insulting .
We ourselves have nothing against free downloads of our music , even if it happens without our permission – in that sense we consider the “ illegal ” distribution of our music to be a tool for promotion .
“ Try it and if you like it , buy it . ”
Buying music is like buying clothes : you ’ll probably want to “ try on ” an album which you might listen to for 10 years before forking out 20 euros for it .
Word of mouth is a great way to get publicity for small bands .
Without internet we would have never reached most of our fans , nor had the chance to tour abroad as much as we have .
There are several sites on the net which spread our music without our own permission .
One example is a packed .rar file with all the songs from our album “ Atomgrad ” , which also includes photos of the cover art and a brief introduction to our music .
This file is being shared in the peer to peer networks and illegal private servers , and we were only happy to find out that our music is interesting enough to spread around the world even without our own effort .
Music downloaders are not immoral thieves , as RIAA and other copyright associations would like everybody to believe .
The claim that every download is lost revenue is weapons grade bullshit .
True , there are people who do n’t want to pay a dime for the music they download , but they would n’t pay for it anyway .
On the other hand there are plenty of people who get to know a band by downloading their songs and who are willing to support their favourite bands by buying their albums and coming to their gigs .
Even though our music is spread around the net , people are still willing to pay for the music .
Conversely , most of the band members have found new music from the net and , after listening to it , paid for the music .
There is also the concept of “ long tail ” sales , where new people get to know a band via downloads and buy their albums long after the official advertising and promotion is over .
On the other hand , selling music without a permission from the band and without paying royalties is flat out wrong .
Again , we have nothing against the general idea of our art being showcased to as wide an audience as possible .
We also sell our music as downloadable files in , for example , Apple Music Store and Recordoffice.net .
However , there are some ( mainly Russian ) sites that sell mp3 - files of our music without our permission – in other words , they are just trying to make money out of our hard work without any plans to support the artist who has made the product .
This kind of activity we strongly condemn .
In this situation the unauthorized download store is tapping directly into the revenue of the band , revenue which in our case is used for paying off the production of our previous album and making the next one .
What ’s even worse , an unsuspecting fan might buy an album from an unauthorized download service , thinking that he or she is supporting the band who never sees a cent of the money .
It ’ll be interesting to see how Creative Commons and other new licensing systems change the legal framework for copyright in the future .
It ’s pretty much the first time artists have the ability to define the terms under which their art can be distributed and used .
We ’ve taken a long look at various copyright issues in Finland and their effect on , for example , releasing our material on the net .
It became very clear to us that the various copyright organizations mostly benefit artists who get heavy airplay ( remember that bit about Payola , incidentally ? ) and / or are looking for contracts with the Big Five .
For independent artists they can actually become an obstacle .
As artists we would lose the right to permit the free use of our material ( for example on soundtracks , promotional samplers , art installations and so on ) as well as the right to appear on projects by artists not belonging to these organizations .
As we find these conditions completely unacceptable , future releases from Älymystö will be licenced under this CC Deed .
[ EDIT : as this may get a bit of traffic , we have clarified our decision to use CC licenses instead of the frankly horrendous " official " copyright systems . ]

It is as thick as your arm , gloopy and smells disgusting - and it has just been caught on camera for what is believed to be the first time .
A crew has managed to film a whale shark - the world 's biggest fish - expelling food waste , which was then scooped up for research .
The footage forms part of a BBC Natural World wildlife programme : Whale Shark .
Whale Shark is on BBC Two on Tuesday 18 November at 2000 GMT .
" I agree it 's a bit of a shock to get rid of some , " said Hodges , a British archaeologist who took over as the Penn museum 's director in 2007 .
" But we 've made it clear to many of them if we can find the funding , we 'll keep them . "
When I first saw governor Sarah Palin I could not believe what I was seeing .
For most of my life I have seen republicans as standing for everything that I would spend my life fighting against .
The idea that these people think they should decide if I have a baby sends blood rushing to my fists .
The fact that there are women in this party astounds me constantly since the republicans , so far , have shown no inkling of care or respect for children , health , the poor , the suffering , or keeping families together .
This disgusts me to no end .
The fact that their version of Christianity is the only correct faith and we in the US should all be forced to follow its teachings seems to be the most un -American scenario that I can imagine .
The fact that the whole reason Europeans came here was to practice how they pleased or be financially secure are the tenants that this country were founded on .
Freedom for different races and women came later and the fact that these Republicans are still fighting against that makes me want to run around screaming .
Their goal is to keep minorities down through poverty and keep women down by keeping them pregnant .
I have seen girls in the eighth grade boast about how they are having a baby and this is what the republican party seems to want the most .
As time goes on I have begun to realize that the whole Palin pick could subvert that whole notion .
Here is a woman who was a beauty queen .
Who became mayor of her town because she was cute , had a lot friends , and called herself a Christian .
The other guy claimed to be a Christian too but you see he was n’t the right kind .
He kept his practice out of his mayoral duties .
Palin claimed that this meant that he was pro-choice ( which , by the way , is the law still in Alaska ) and somehow she won the title .
When the big boys at the top of state ’s leadership got into trouble Palin saw her opportunity and she took it .
Even though she had left her town having a financial deficit for the first time in its history she ran as a fiscal conservative .
Even though her town is now known as the meth capital of Alaska she ran on a record of “ family values ” .
Even though she spent millions on a hockey complex in her town and had the same contractors build her house she claimed to be the ethical choice .
She got elected , fired most of the people who worked for the state and hired a bunch of her friends even if they had no qualifications whatsoever .
She soon came under an ethics investigation .
She gave Alaskans a tax rebate that was sometimes a thousand dollars and those same Alaskans just loved her .
Meanwhile , the Republicans trying to put their old white man into office were wondering what to do about the presidential election .
Suddenly , the democrats had a candidate that appeared to be everything the Republicans were not and the people were loving it .
Here was a smart guy , a professor of constitutional law , a community organizer , a man claiming both black and white heritage , and a senator .
Instead of attacking the social issues that divide us he talked about bringing people together .
He talked about a new direction for the country in a way that people actually believed .
The cynical American culture suddenly was filled with something many young people had never experienced – Hope .
It sounds silly and the republicans try to make fun of this fact all the time but the truth is , for the first time , many people suddenly felt like they had a political figure to believe in .
For those in my generation where the only presidents we have known are Reagan , the Bushes , and Clinton this was something entirely new .
Though many us did n’t agree with different policy positions of Barrack Obama we finally felt like this was a man who could bring us together and lead the country as opposed to selling out the common American and the constitution .
The Republicans did n’t know what to do , they spent the last two elections attacking the people in the democrat party and their beliefs but Obama was unwilling to go that route .
They cynically thought that the reason people were behind Obama was because he was young and black and it was becoming a “ historical ” election .
They wanted to be part of history too so they , apparently , did a Wikipedia search on female republican governors .
They stumbled across Sarah Palin , pretty , well - liked , Christian Fundamentalist , antiabortion – perfect they thought !
Unfortunately for them they did n’t look into the fact that Palin had only been governor of one of the smallest states for 20 months .
She was well liked ( who does n’t like a fat check from the governor ) but completely untested .
Additionally , she just was n’t very knowledgeable about national politics ( besides divisive social issues ) or world affairs and therefore just was n’t prepared to be on the national stage .
Sure , she listened to am radio and knew the distorted neocon view of the world but the problem is that all that stuff is completely made up by the real elites with the soul purpose of keeping the people divided and ignorant of the world ’s actual problems .
She then went on the national stage and was completely unable to defend , or even intelligently talk about , her republican beliefs .
The reason is n’t that she is inherently stupid , it is because those beliefs do n’t follow any logic , you ca n’t be pro-life and pro-death penalty and pro-war .
You can not be a Christian and hate people on welfare .
You can not be pro-jobs when you are against unions .
You ca n’t be for minorities and want to put up all wall and shoot poor people trying to cross our southern border .
You ca n’t be a humanitarian but for torture .
You ca n’t claim to be a patriot and try to take the country apart .
You ca n’t be pro-democracy but then try to stop minorities , city dwellers , and poor people from voting .
It just does n’t add up to any scrutiny whatsoever .
Now Sarah Palin might be a major factor in the Republicans losing the election ( unless they steal it ) .
She could even tear the party apart .
Maybe then the democrats could fall apart too and we could finally have a true democracy where their all multiple parties and people must form coalitions to pass laws rather than just pitting US against THEM .
But that is n’t the reason I think that Sarah Palin will save democracy in the United States .
I think there are many little girls out there , Lisa Simpson types , who are watching this campaign and thinking to themselves , wow she is n’t from the political establishment , did n’t go to a top school , did n’t even know elementary facts about the government , is n’t from a rich family , and ca n’t even speak intelligently .
If she can almost become vice president than I definitely have a shot because I am smarter than her .
I think many little girls will realize this and see that democracy does n’t have to be only for rich white men .
Anyone can do it .
The good and the bad of news on Twitter is this :
First reports can often be akin to a game of Telephone , where the original message gets exaggerated or twisted just a little bit until it ’s completely inaccurate , while others are actually telling the tale in real time and after the fact .
The first reports hit Twitter 30 minutes or so before they hit the news stations .
Unfortunately , the initial reports were inaccurate , stating that a 737 ( correct ) had crashed ( incorrect , technically ) in Denver .
When I hear the word crash , I think “ airplane fell out of the sky ” .
In this case , the plane had gone off the runway on takeoff .
A serious situation , but a little bit more manageable than falling out of the sky .
Once that was sorted out and a mainstream source came along , reports began to spread across the Twitter stream about tweets coming from passengers , which led to the discovery of Mike Wilson ( @2drinksbehind )
My hat ’s off to Mike for this tweet :
You have your wits scared out of you , drag your butt out of a flaming ball of wreckage and you ca n’t even get a vodka - tonic .
Boo
You ’ve just got to really appreciate a guy who : a ) stops after an emergency evacuation out of the left emergency exit door long enough to send a tweet ; and b ) has a sense of humor about it .
Here ’s his account of the crash :
to all who ’ve asked , it ’s hard to know exactly what went wrong — we were in the middle of a normal takeoff when we suddely veered off a 1st class passenger I talked to indicated he saw the left engine come off at the time , but it ’s unclear if this was a cause or an effect shortly after we veered off , the plane quite obviously left the runway at high speed ( maybe 100 kts ) and proceeded to go 4 wheel driving i think we might have gone into a ravine and dropped some distance as there was a sudden bottom - dropped - out feeling and then a jolt i believe it was after the jolt that the right engine , which was near my row , caught fire by the time the plane stopped we were burning pretty well and I think I could feel the heat even through the bulkhead and window whoever was on the left side exit row , god bless him , was johnny on the spot and instantly had the door open – people crowded out in a mass I made for the exit door as quickly as I could , fearing the right wing might explode from the fire .
once out , i scrambled down the wing there was a fire station nearby and that ’s where we all ended up right after the crash fortunately , there did n’t seem to be any life - threatening injuries
Reading his very matter - of - fact account of what would be a terrifying experience for me is fascinating .
He lost his glasses , kept his phone , could n’t get a vodka / tonic , and is just now home .
Thank you , Mike , for a compelling account of your experience , for sharing it , and for getting home safely .
If I had tuned into my local news station , I would have gotten the very dry AP account of the crash .
But tuning into Twitter gave me the real deal , in 140 characters , one Tweet at a time .
Real time , baby .

The body has a sophisticated internal clock
The workings of our internal body clock appear to be directly connected to our risk of diabetes , researchers claim .
International research published in the journal Nature Genetics found faults in a key ' clock gene ' were linked to blood sugar levels and type II diabetes .
Some scientists already believe that our circadian rhythms ( body clock ) have a role to play in the condition , which affects millions worldwide .
But one expert said more evidence was needed , before a link was proved .
Our research demonstrates that abnormalities in the circadian rhythm may partly be causing diabetes and high blood sugar levels - we hope it will ultimately provide new options for treating people
Professor Philippe Froguel
Imperial College Scientists say that unravelling the links between obesity , type II diabetes , and circadian rhythms could point the way towards new strategies to control or prevent the illness .
The fact that humans work on a rough 24 - hour cycle , sleeping at night , and waking to be more active during the day , is controlled partly by hormones released by the body .
One , in particular , called melatonin , released by the pineal gland in the brain , is involved in drowsiness and the lowering of body temperature .
The researchers , from a variety of universities in the UK and abroad , scanned the genomes of thousands of people looking for associations between particular genetic variations and type II diabetes .
A team including scientists from Imperial College London found one genetic " variation " which appeared to be linked to a 20 % increase in the risk of type II diabetes .
Another , including Oxford and Cambridge University scientists , discovered a second variation which could be linked to naturally higher blood sugar levels and diabetes risk .
However , it was the location of these variations on the human genome which suggested the connection to the internal body clock .
Both were connected to MTNR1B , a gene which helps control the action of melatonin on different parts of the body .
Bad sleepers Professor Philippe Froguel , from Imperial College , said that the findings fitted with earlier research linking sleep problems with obesity , which increases the risk of type II diabetes .
" For example , we know that obese children tend to sleep badly and that people become more obese if they are not having enough sleep .
" Our research demonstrates that abnormalities in the circadian rhythm may partly be causing diabetes and high blood sugar levels - we hope it will ultimately provide new options for treating people . "
Professor Nick Wareham , the director of the MRC Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge , said : " This observation provides important clues about the possible mechanisms linking genes to diabetes risk . "
However , sleep and circadian rhythm researcher Dr Jim Horne from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University said it was too early to be suggesting that problems with the body clock might actually be responsible for obesity and diabetes .
He said : " There are other explanations for the link between obesity and sleep disturbance - people who eat too much may have disturbed sleep , or be drowsy or sleep during the day , and obese people may suffer from sleep apnoea which can disturb sleep .
" The evidence linking insufficient sleep with these changes is very contentious , and we should be cautious about drawing the wrong conclusions . "
Separate research by researchers at Leeds University suggests that children with diabetes living in poorer households are less likely to have their blood sugar levels under control .
They looked at blood sugar levels in 1,742 Yorkshire children , mostly with the type I form of the disease , and found that fewer than 15 % were reaching National Institute for Clinical Excellence targets .
Those from lower - income families were less likely to hit the target than those from more affluent families .

London wears many masks .
It has been called a city of tribes .
It grew from villages surrounding a Roman fort into one of the planet 's first mega-cities .
It is multi- everything .
It is historic and it is broad .
You can ' Prime Minister watch ' at Downing Street , go Queen spotting at Buckingham Palace , try to avoid pigeons in Trafalgar Square or stroll through the Royal parks .
This is the tourism of postcards and plastic gifts , where a can of lukewarm Coke costs a quid ( that 's £ 1 , or about $ 1.65 ) .
But , we 're looking for ' gritty London ' - the bits you can just about see from the top floors of the Hilton , in Park Lane but would not venture into .
Areas characterised by ethnic diversity , affordable bars , colourful markets and cracked pavements .
Our London is the run-down boroughs of places like Hackney , Lambeth and Tower Hamlets where two - fifths of the city 's population lives .
It may be a bit ragged and run down but its broken - toothed smile is genuine .
Not to say that being a bit down - at - heel makes these places particularly cheap .
You may be able to sit down for a filling and pleasant ' all - the - trimmings ' kebab for under a fiver ( that 's £ 5 , or about $ 8.25 ) at the warm and hospitable Halkevi Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington ( north - bound 149 bus from Liverpool Street station ) but you 'll be paying eighty quid a week ( about $ 132 ) for a room in a smelly , shared flat above the place .
With the possible exception of Moscow 's giant ' anything goes ' flea - markets , there is no city quite like London when it comes to cheaply - priced markets which line its high streets , fill its church halls and occupy its vacant parking lots .
Ranking the city 's multitude of ' free - market institutions ' in any kind of order would deny them their uniqueness but if eccentricity is what you are looking for then Hackney Dogs ' Car Boot Sale ( Hackney Wick train station , Silverlink Train eastbound from Richmond ) , religiously held every Sunday morning , takes the biscuit .
There are more characters here than you 'll find crammed into your average Dickens novel .
With temporary stalls erected wherever there 's space , everything and anything is up for grabs .
" Ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies " goes the sales patter - as long as you can pay in cash .
With nearly one in three of inner London 's 2.7 m inhabitants describing themselves as non-white many markets are a comfortable reminder how multicultural this metropolis really is .
Ridley Road market ( Dalston Kingsland station , Silverlink Train , eastbound from Richmond ) caters to its largely Caribbean , West African , Southern Asian and Turkish consumer base with stalls selling plantain , salt - fish , oxtail , stuffed green olives and fresh coriander in one of the city 's most amazing Saturday morning melting pots .
Ridley 24 - hour Beigel ( or ' bagel ' to you )
Bakery serves up strong tea and colourful Jewish fare from its no -nonsense corner shop location .
Church Street ( also served by the superb and old - style 73 bus ) is north east London 's gentrification ' frontline ' with inviting pubs and well - priced restaurants pushing their way further and further into the hinterlands of ' untrendified ' Clapton and beyond .
In the day it is an affable part of town where moderately ostentacious wealth is tolerated but at night - like most of London - its personality changes a little .
It 's never threatening but it 's always edgy .
If London 's East End were a mental condition it would be multiple personality syndrome .
Brick Lane Market ( Liverpool Street Station , Central , Circle and District tube lines ) is where the symptoms are most acute .
Young Bangladeshi entrepreneurs selling mobile phone accessories share stall space with white East London ' geezers ' knocking out sea - food spreads of cockles and mussels .
Another 24 - hour beigel bakery belts out familiar cuisine .
On Bacon Street gangs of elderly men in long coats ' flash ' curious buyers with the linings of their jackets - ' gold ' watches ( " nah , ' onest mate , not stolen - straight up " ) , pens and cuff - links dangle from the insides of their mobile ' shops ' .
Nearby long - established trader families operating out of trailer units sell everything from meat to stereos at prices that plummet with the speed of the Yugoslavian dinar - " I ain't asking seventy - even fifty would be unfair and , ' cause I 'm good - hearted , it ai n't even gonna ' be forty .
I want thirty pound for the pair ! " shouts a man through a microphone as he holds two mock - Victorian lamps above his head .
There are a number of other markets nearby - also held on a Sunday - including the famous Petticoat Lane and Spitalfields ( both served by Liverpool Street Station ) but it 's colour , culture and charisma we seek and without fail the fruit and veg market in Brixton ( the heart of black Britain ) rules the roost .
Granville Arcade , Electric Avenue ( made famous by reggae artist Eddy Grant ) , Atlantic Road and a maze of little side streets and alleyways keep the life blood flowing through this part of south London ( Brixton Tube , Victoria line ) where cost - cutting stalls punt out fresh produce , second - hand books , clothes , army - surplus gear and jewellery .
Brixton , like Brick Lane , is changing into a ' trendy ' area .
Its rapid rise from economically - deprived ' tough as boots ' ghetto into trend - setting bohemia is a relatively new phenomenon .
With house prices in the capital sky - rocketing it is a trend affecting London 's entire inner city belt : rough areas with access to a tube line are suddenly catapulted into the status of chic des-res ; fish and chip shop one moment , sushi bar the next .
If Brixton provides an example of an area in the throes of gentrification then its neighbour , Clapham , is the finished product ( Clapham North and Clapham Common , Northern line on the Tube ) .
You could eat / drink / party in a different trio of restaurant / pub / club every night for a week if you had the stamina .
In conjunction with Brixton it provides south London with a serious wedge of partying infrastructure - from raves under disused railway arches to the salubrious inner core of the newly - opened Bierodrome on Clapham High Street - if it sounds like the conversation 's twice as loud it 's because everyone 's got a mobile phone and they 're all talking at once .
While Portobello Road ( Notting Hill Gate Tube , Central , Circle and District line ) may be situated in the inner-city it does n't have the ' grit ' of its urban siblings .
It is an area that has been well and truly discovered and it lacks the substance of the ' what - you - see - is - what - you - get ' redolent of its rougher brothers and sisters .
But it does accommodate Portobello Road market which is arguably the most famous avant - garde market ( that 's posh - speak for second - hand ) in London and respect is due .
With enough used clothes stalls to stock any aspirant ' shabby - chic ' wardrobe and the fatty wafts of the burger van thankfully substituted by the milder aromas of cappuccino and Thai curry it is a pleasant slice of the London pie .
This part of west London hosts the biggest street event in Europe , Notting Hill Carnival ( on the last Sunday and Monday of August ) which pulls in more than a million people a year .
Revellers pack the quaint streets and squares - lined by million pound mansions - to celebrate the country 's Afro-Caribbean community .
Ground ice drinks , barbequed corn and solid basslines combine to make a heady brew .
With the area 's high - rise housing blocks nearby providing suitable accomodation for illegal broadcasting operators the area is full of pirate radio stations .
On the day of Princess Diana 's death 15 home - grown stations blasted everything from drum n' bass to traditional Greek grooves dedicating the music to the " People 's Princess " - it was a moment in London 's underground history .
There 's a popular expression in a very Irish part of London : " Give us back the six counties and we 'll give you back Kilburn " .
Kilburn High Road ( Kilburn Park , Bakerloo Tube line ) is testimony to the people who built this area and the pub names speak volumes :
The Shamrock , O'Leary's .
On a good night it 's a trip to another part of the globe , on a bad night it can all be a bit heavy - men with glasses collecting for " the boyos " .
Without confirming cliches the Guinness here is the best you 'll find outside Dublin - there 's good ' craic ' in County Kilburn .
What Camden Lock ( Camden Town , Northern line ) lacks in tradition it makes up for in size and choice - twenty shades of gothic black ; every variety of velvet ; joss - sticks with every scent known to science ; more African drums than downtown Soweto ; record stalls for all .
Camden Lock is vastly over - subscribed and the crowds which fill its narrow walkways are often there to look and look alone - for all the people actually willing to buy a hand - knitted Peruvian sweater there 's ten who want to watch .
Still , the market and the night life the area supports , is world famous and gives swanky Camden a reason to exist .
And from this patchwork quilt of extremities the whole of London emerges .
Wealth sits indifferently with poverty ; new stands tall over old ; tradition pokes its thumb at trend .
While to some our city may taste like a ill - mixed cocktail , to many it is what makes this ancient city so special .
The ingredients in this communal cup are always changing - movement and variety is the air we breathe .
Blue - haired punks share seats with pin-striped businessmen ; Muslim family - run shops sell copies of the Jewish Chronicle .
In many ways , anything goes .
HIGH POINT , N.C. , July 2 x ( Reuters ) - Furniture maker Carol Gregg got some puzzled looks when she went looking for a U.S. factory to make her Chinese antique reproductions .
A worker at Ercol , a furniture maker in Princes Risborough , in the Chiltern Hills about 96 km ( 60 miles ) northwest of London , stacks machine tooled parts in a workshop July 2 , 2008 .

“ They said , ‘ Honey , do n’t you know everyone is going to China ? ’ ” Gregg said .
“ It took a while to get people on board . ”
She used to ship American wood to a factory in China , which would make the furniture and then ship it back to the United States .
Three years ago , even before oil hit $ 140 per barrel , she decided that was “ really silly ” and decided to move manufacturing back to the United States .
Now , a network of small U.S. factories produces 10 or 20 units at a time for her company , red egg resources , based in High Point , North Carolina .
And other furniture makers are coming to her for advice on how to leave China .
Since 2000 , scores of U.S. factories have shut down as furniture companies shifted manufacturing to China in search of lower costs .
But as rising inflation drives up factory wages in China and high oil prices make shipping costlier , some companies are considering moving back home .
Like Gregg , many furniture makers are finding it hard to return , primarily because of steep factory start - up costs and lack of skilled labor .
The credit crisis that began with failing mortgages but has now led to tighter terms on virtually all loans also makes it tougher to finance a new plant .
However , the cost differences are narrowing , particularly for smaller companies that never could match the big players ’ negotiating power in China .
Gregg said three years ago , it was about 40 percent more expensive to manufacture in the United States than in China .
“ Today , with inflation in China and ocean freight , we ’re about even , ” she said .
LABOR SHORTAGE
Ikea , the Swedish retailer known for its low - priced , flat - packed furniture , opened its first U.S. manufacturing plant about 50 miles north of High Point earlier this year .
The Danville , Virginia , factory makes book shelves , coffee tables and side tables for sale at Ikea ’s U.S. and Canadian stores .
“ The most expensive part of the home furnishings business is actually transport , ” said Ikea spokesman Joseph Roth .
“ For us this ( move ) makes total sense . ”
Rebecca Smothers , the mayor of High Point , hopes others will come to the same conclusion .
The city , known for its twice - yearly home furnishings trade show that draws tens of thousands of visitors , has been hit hard by factory closures .
She said some European companies have expressed interest in setting up shop here .
The euro ’s rise to a record high against the U.S. dollar this year has hurt European exporters .
But for many of the major U.S. manufacturers , China still holds a formidable advantage on both price and infrastructure .
Paul Toms Jr. , chairman and chief executive of Hooker Furniture Corp , said he was surprised by the swift spike in oil prices and the pace of wage increases in China , and was looking for other places to manufacture .
The United States was not an option for the company , which has shut five U.S. factories in recent years .
“ As we closed those plants , we sold the real estate and sold off the machinery and equipment , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ The work force has dispersed , not only the hourly workers but the supervision , had generally moved into other industries .
There ’s not enough need for skilled wood workers for everybody to be able to stay in this industry . ”
“ So it ’s not feasible even if we thought we could produce a better value product here than we could in Asia , ” he added .
Instead , the company is switching some manufacturing to other developing countries , including Vietnam , Indonesia , the Philippines and Honduras .
TIME AND DISTANCE
In addition to cost , distance is also becoming an factor .
Jobi Blachy , president of upscale furniture makers Edward Ferrell and Lewis Mittman , said one reason why his company manufactures in the United States is speed .
Custom orders would take weeks longer if he had to ship them from overseas .
Blachy ’s customers spend as much as $ 26,000 for a dining room table , so paying a bit more for U.S. labor is no big deal .
But even for lower - priced furniture retailers , which have scant pricing power when demand is weak , distance is starting to factor into the sourcing decision .
Alan Cole , who overseas the upholstery business at Hooker Furniture , said retailers were increasingly interested in domestic - made goods as a way to keep a tighter grip on inventory when demand is unpredictable .
If they place a large order from China and the economy remains weak , they may be stuck with the big stockpiles .
And if it rebounds , they could be too slow to stock up .
“ Retailers are trying to figure out how they can buy more products domestically and still not lose some of the economic value that imports bring to them , ” he said .
“ That ’s quite a shift in some of the retail thinking because up until probably within the last year or two years , the retailers were continuing to import more and more directly from Asia and to be less dependent on domestic products . ”
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. home builders took a big step in September toward reducing the gigantic oversupply of homes , boosting sales slightly , slashing prices and reducing the number of unsold homes at a record pace .
Sales of new homes rose an estimated 2.7 % in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 in September , the Commerce Department reported Monday , close to the 460,000 pace expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
See Economic Calendar .
Sales surged 23 % in the West , bouncing back from a similar decline in August .
Meanwhile , sales in the Northeast fell to lowest level recorded in the past 35 years , and sales in the Midwest fell to a 17 - year low .
Nationally , sales in September were down 33 % compared with September 2007 .
The inventory of unsold homes fell a record 7.3 % in September to 394,000 , the lowest level in four years .
In the past year , inventories have fallen 25.4 % , the biggest percentage drop since the government began tracking the data in 1963 .
At 394,000 , the inventory represents 10.4 months ' worth of sales , about double the normal inventory .
It 's taking more than 9 months after completion for the typical new home to sell , a sign that builders have much more work to do to bring supply down to match demand .
In the past year , the number of homes for sale that were under construction has plunged by 35 % .
The median sales price fell to $ 218,400 , down 9.1 % in the past year .
It 's the lowest median sales price in four years .
Government statisticians have low confidence in the monthly report , which is subject to large revisions and sampling and other statistical errors .
In most months , the government is n't sure whether sales rose or fell .
The standard error in September , for instance , was plus or minus 12.1 % .
Read the full government report .
The government says it can take up to five months to establish a new trend in sales .
Over the past five months , sales have been on a 489,000 annual pace , 33 % slower than a year earlier and about 3 % lower than August 's five - month trailing average .
In all of 2007 , 776,000 new homes were sold , down from 1.05 million in 2006 .
Regionally , sales plunged 21 % in the Northeast to 22,000 annualized , the lowest pace recorded in 35 years .
Sales rose 23 % in the West to 108,000 annualized after plunging 30 % in August .
Sales dropped 6 % in the Midwest to a 17 - year low of 65,000 and rose 0.7 % in the South to 269,000 .

I ’ve received more than the usual amount of criticism for my recent opinion piece on Sarah Palin , most of it alleging sexism and / or an unseemly infatuation with Barack Obama .
For those who care , I ’d like to briefly respond :
My alleged sexism :
It is true that I used some hackneyed , gender - slanted language in the piece ( “ get sassy , ” “ girl - next - door , ” etc. ) .
This was deliberate .
Clearly , I played this game at my peril .
I can say that if Sarah Palin were a man of similar qualifications , I would have used equally slanted language to describe him .
I might have called Mr. Palin a “ frat - boy ” or a “ lumberjack . ”
I would have invoked some silly macho phrasing like , “ Watch Cousin Jim flip Putin the bird . ”
My concern is not that Mrs. Palin is a woman .
My concern is that she is a totally unqualified and poorly educated woman who was added to the Republican ticket as a token woman ( and Creationist wacko ) .
For what it ’s worth , the article was vetted by the two women closest to me ( wife and mother ) and by two female editors at the LA Times .
If anything , the editing at the Times made the piece even more “ sexist . ”
My alleged Obamamania : Many McCain supporters have written to say that ( 1 ) Obama is also unqualified ( or even less qualified than Palin ) and ( 2 ) I have shown myself to be a hypocrite by not objecting to Obama ’s religiosity .
Briefly : My criticism of Palin should not be construed as uncritical acceptance of Obama .
Needless to say , I find Obama ’s religious pandering repulsive .
The suspicion that he is pandering , out of obvious necessity , and not quite as religious as he makes out , is somewhat comforting , however .
But even if Obama were precisely as religious as he appears , he is not a Creationist , Rapture - Ready blockhead .
Palin , by all appearances , seems to be one .
This is a difference worth noting .
Whatever you may think of his politics , Obama is very intelligent and reasonably well educated .
Palin thinks the universe is 6000 years old .
Unfortunately , I wrote my article before some of the most disturbing signs of her religious extremism came to my attention .
So , let me simply declare that I would be overjoyed to have a qualified woman in the White House .
I would , likewise , be overjoyed to have a qualified African American in the White House .
In fact , I would be overjoyed to have a qualified WASP man in the White House .
I will be guardedly optimistic to have a very smart ( and somewhat qualified ) Barack Obama in the White House .
And I would be frankly terrified to have a religious bumpkin like Sarah Palin in the White House .
I think you should share this last conviction .
Hence my latest opinion piece .

Once there were three trees on a hill in the woods .
They were discussing
their hopes and dreams when the first tree said , " Someday I hope to be
a treasure chest .
I could be filled with gold , silver and precious gems .
I could be decorated with intricate carving and everyone would see
the beauty . "
Then the second tree said , " Someday I will be a mighty ship .
I will take
kings and queens across the waters and sail to the corners of the world .
Everyone will feel safe in me because of the strength of my hull . "
Finally the third tree said , " I want to grow to be the tallest and straightest
tree in the forest .
People will see me on top of the hill and look up to my
branches , and think of the heavens and God and how close to them
I am reaching .
I will be the greatest tree of all time and people will always
remember me . "
After a few years of praying that their dreams would come true , a group of
woodsmen came upon the trees .
When one came to the first tree he said ,
" This looks like a strong tree , I think I should be able to sell the wood to
a carpenter " ... and he began cutting it down .
The tree was happy ,
because he knew that the carpenter would make him into
a treasure chest .
At the second tree a woodsman said , " This looks like a strong tree ,
I should be able to sell it to the shipyard . "
The second tree was happy
because he knew he was on his way to becoming a mighty ship .
When the woodsmen came upon the third tree , the tree was frightened
because he knew that if they cut him down his dreams would not come
true .
One of the woodsmen said , " I do n't need anything special from my
tree so I 'll take this one " , and he cut it down .
When the first tree arrived at the carpenters , he was made into a feed
box for animals .
He was then placed in a barn and filled with hay .
This was not at all what he had prayed for .
The second tree was cut
and made into a small fishing boat .
His dreams of being a mighty ship
and carrying kings had come to an end .
The third tree was cut into
large pieces and left alone in the dark .
The years went by , and the
trees forgot about their dreams .
Then one day , a man and woman came to the barn .
She gave birth and
they placed the baby in the hay in the feed box that was made from
the first tree .
The man wished that he could have made a crib for the baby ,
but this manger would have to do .
The tree could feel the importance
of this event and knew that it had held the greatest treasure of all time .
Years later , a group of men got in the fishing boat made from the second tree .
One of them was tired and went to sleep .
While they were out on the water ,
a great storm arose and the tree did n't think it was strong enough to keep
the men safe .
The men woke the sleeping man , and he stood and said
" Peace " and the storm stopped .
At this time , the tree knew that it had carried
the King of Kings in its boat .
Finally , someone came and got the third tree .
It was carried through the
streets as the people mocked the man who was carrying it .
When they
came to a stop , the man was nailed to the tree and raised in the air to die
at the top of a hill .
When Sunday came , the tree came to realize that it was
strong enough to stand at the top of the hill and be as close to God as was
possible , because Jesus had been crucified on it .
The moral of this story is that when things do n't seem to be going your way ,
always know that God has a plan for you .
If you place your trust in Him ,
He will give you great gifts .
Each of the trees got what they wanted ,
just not in the way they had imagined .
We do n't always know what God's
plans are for us .
We just know that His ways are not our ways ,
but His ways are always best .

No , really , genuine bricks and mortar things that you can walk into .
It seems that soon in the UK you 'll be able to order something from Amazon then go and get it .
The only question is : why ?
I have a few theories .
First , the novelty of getting everything delivered and not seeing anyone was never going to last forever .
Second , it 's bound to be cheaper to ship a couple of thousand books to one location and have someone pick them up than to deliver them all ( and Amazon 's been using couriers over here for a while now ) .
The latter point , though , gives you the real clue and also tells me that the company might not , in spite of wide predictions , open this experiment up to the rest of the world eventually .
The fact is that the UK has been subject to a number of postal strikes just lately .
Hopefully they 'll just go away but if I were an Internet book seller I 'd be looking around for a Plan B , just in case .
And oh look , there it is .
Add another notch to the tally of credit - crunch casualties : West Virginia 's planned coal - to - liquids plant .
Consol Energy and Synthesis Energy Systems pulled the plug on the project , which aimed to produce 100 million gallons of gasoline from coal .
West Virginia Gov.
Joe Manchin announced the $ 800 million coal project in July ( AP ) SES president and chief executive Tim Vail blamed the credit crunch : " Given the current state of the U.S. credit markets , SES is proactively reevaluating domestic capital investments at this time , " he said in a release .
SES will build a coal - to - liquids facility in China , where credit is easier to come by .
But is the financial meltdown really to blame�or are falling oil prices ?
West Virginia state officials said they 've known SES was planning to abandon the project for " the past few months , " before the credit crunch really hit .
Consol Energy still wants to build a coal - to - liquids plant in West Virginia .
But converting coal into liquid gasoline is a costly process ( and anethema to environmentalists ) .
Falling oil prices do n't make it any more appealing .
Consol 's vice president of external affairs , Tom Hoffman , told the Wheeling Intelligencer future plans hinge to a large extent on what crude oil does :
He said Consol will work with state officials to try and bring a coal liquefaction plant to the area , but much depends on the oil market .
He noted that when the project was first announced , the price of a barrel of oil was much higher than it is today and the economy was not as bad .
" Clearly , the change in crude oil prices will have an effect on any coal - to - liquefaction project , " Hoffman said .
" Nobody has a good handle on what the next year holds for anybody .
It 's too difficult . "
Well this has been a long time coming .
It seems that the iPhone Dev-Team has finally done the impossible -- they 've gone and unlocked the iPhone 3G .
The hack is n't out yet ( the team says they 're shooting for a December 31st release ) , and it requires that you 've got a baseband of 2.11.07 or earlier , but when it drops , the crew seems fairly confident it will result in freedom from carrier oppression .
The team is packaging the app -- formerly codenamed " yellowsn0w " -- into a user - friendly app a la PwnageTool and QuickPwn .

The end of an unforgettable era .
That 's the only way to describe the current situation in American politics .
Very soon , the term of George W. Bush will draw to an end .

How can we best harness the creative talents of all the bloggers , photoshoppers and webcomic artists who created such memorable portraits of Bush as a monkey , Bush swimming in oil or Bush starting a war ?
Thankfully , there 's going to be a new fall guy in place .

Writing a compiler in Ruby , bottom up
( To follow my compiler related posts , either subscribe to my main RSS feed , or the compiler specific one )
Back in March 2008
I started publishing a series on how to write a compiler in Ruby , bottom up , that is , starting with the code generator and working my way up instead of the more traditional approach of writing the parser first .
Here are the parts I 've published on my blog so far .
( The bits labeled " interlude " are sort - of related articles in that the cover issues with writing / developing compilers , or issues related to compilation , but are not directly tied into the actual article series )
All the code can now be found in this GitHub repository

A recent ( as of 2014 ) article series on " reconstructing " Ruby ( in C )
Someone commenting on this series on Hackernews pointed to Nicklaus Wirth 's excellent book on compiler construction ( PDF available on his homepage ) as a good starting point from a traditional , top down point of view .
It 's a good and very approachable book , and well worth a read .
Another great series with a more traditional approach is a famous series by Jack Crenshaw : Let 's build a compiler

He said there could be more arrests .
Some of those under arrest belonged to the now - illegal party under Mr. Hussein ’s government .
Mr. Maliki ’s office declined to comment .
But one of his advisers , insisting that he not be named because he was not authorized to speak , said the detainees were involved in “ a conspiracy . ”
The Ministry of the Interior is dedicated to Iraq ’s internal security , and includes the police forces .
The ministry has a history of being heavily infiltrated with Shiite militias , though it has improved considerably over the past two years .
A police officer , who knows several of the detainees but spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution , said they were innocent , longstanding civil servants and had little in common with one another .
Those who once belonged to the Baath Party were lower - level members , he said , insisting that the arrests were politically motivated .
Interior Minister Jawad Kadem al - Bolani , who has not been implicated and is out of the country , has his own political ambitions and has been expanding his secular Iraqi Constitutional Party .
Iraq is a nation where leadership has often changed by coup , and as next month ’s provincial elections approach , worry about violence is increasing .
So are accusations about politically charged detentions .
The counterterrorism unit involved in these arrests is alleged to have conducted a raid this summer on the Diyala provincial governor ’s office , during which an employee was killed and a provincial council member , one of the few Sunnis Arabs on the council , was arrested .
At a later protest against the arrest , several other Sunni politicians were detained .
A number of politicians who follow the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr , and who have set themselves up as political rivals to the prime minister , have also been arrested over the past months and charged with terrorist activities .
Anxieties about the government ’s treatment of political enemies were also raised this week as the American military , as part of the recently approved security agreement , turned over to Iraqi custody on Monday 39 senior officials from the Hussein government .
Some have been convicted already and others are scheduled to stand trial , the United States military said in a statement .
A Continental airlines 737 slid off the runway in Denver last night .

[ This is from forthcoming book edited by Russell Blackford , called 50 Voices of Disbelief ] .
Blaise Pascal .
Like Pascal , many theists believe reason cannot determine whether or not God exists .
Indeed , many suppose that , because God , if he exists , transcends physical reality , it is in principle impossible for us to determine whether God exists simply by observingit .
Science , and empirical observation more generally , can provide , at best , a few clues .
They cannot settle the question beyond reasonable doubt .
I reject that view .
It seems to me that by observing the world around us , we can answer the question of whether God exists .
In fact , I ’m going to suggest it ’s pretty obvious there ’s no God .
That last claim may surprise even some atheists .
How could it be pretty obvious there ’s no God ?
Surely this is a tortuously difficult and complex question over which the greatest minds have pondered for millennia , without ever reaching any real consensus .
How , then , can the answer beYet I think it is pretty obvious .
I ’ll sketch a case for that conclusion here .
To begin , let ’s clarify which God we are talking about .
The Judeo - Christian god is the God worshipped by Jews , Christians and Muslims .
He is , according to religious orthodoxy , all - powerful , all - knowing , and , perhaps most importantly , maximally good – as good as it ’s possible to be .
Indeed , we ’re told that God loves us as if we were his children .
Those who consider belief in this particular deity at least not unreasonable will typically point to a range of arguments to support their belief .
“ Why is there something rather than nothing ? ” they may ask .
“ God explains the existence of the universe .
And God ’s existence , being necessary , requires no further explanation .
So you see ? -
God provides the only remotely satisfactory answer to this question .
” Or they may run a fine - tuning type argument , like so : “ Only a very particular set of laws and initial conditions can create a universe capable of producing conscious beings such as ourselves .
What is the probability of the universe having just these features by chance ?
Astronomically low .
Far more likely , then , that some sort of cosmic intelligence deliberately designed the universe that way .
That intelligence is God .
These arguments , the theist will usually concede , may not constitute proofs – but they do show that belief in God has at least got something going for it , rationally speaking .
Trouble is , these arguments are very weak ..
The most they establish , if anything , is that the universe has some sort of creator or designer .
It is , as it stands , a huge further , unwarranted leap to the conclusion that this creator - designer is all - powerful and maximally - good .
These arguments , as they stand , no more support that conclusion than they support the conclusion that the creator - designer is , say , maximally evil ( which they do n’t support at all ) .
Things get worse .
Not only do many ( if not all ) of the most popular arguments for the existence of God fail to provide much reason to suppose this particular , Judeo - Christian , God exists , there appears to be very powerful evidence against that hypothesis .
I am thinking , of course , of the “ problem of evil ” ( “ evil ” in this context , covers both pain and suffering , and also morally bad behaviour – such as killing , stealing , and so on ) .
In fact , there are two problems of evil – the logical problem , and the evidential problem .
God , if he exists , is all - powerful , and maximally good .
But the existence of such a being is surely logically incompatible with the existence of evil .
An all - powerful being could prevent evil existing .
Being maximally good , he would not want evil to exist
As evil exists , it follows , logically , that the Judeo - Christian god does not .
Notice that the amount of evil the world contains is not relevant here .
The argument is that the existence of God is logically incompatible with the existence of any evil at all .
The logical problem can perhaps be dealt with by suggesting that God would want to create a maximally good world – a world as good as it is possible for a world to be .
And a maximally good world might contain some evil .
Why ?
Because that evil is the price paid for some greater good – a good outweighing the evil .
Such a maximally good world would be even better than a world containing no evil .
So , for example , a Christian might claim that free - will is a very great good .
True , given free - will , we then sometimes choose to do bad things .
But the good of free - will outweighs the badness of those bad things we do , which is why God would still create such a world .
As I say , the logical problem is that of explaining why an all - powerful maximally good God would allow any evil at all .
Perhaps it can be solved .
The evidential problem , by contrast , is that of explaining why this God would allow quite so much evil into his creation .
Even if we acknowledge that an omnipotent , omniscient and supremely benevolent being might create a world with at least some evil in it , surely there would be no reason for him to create a world containing such extraordinary quantities of pain and suffering ?
We can sharpen the problem by noting that God will presumably not allow gratuitous suffering .
There must be a good reason for every last ounce of it .
But when we consider the enormous quantities of suffering the world contains – including the hundreds of millions of years of animal suffering that occurred before we humans made an appearance ( including the literally unimaginable horror caused mass - extinction events the second to last of which wiped 95 % of all species from the face of the Earth ) – does n’t it quickly become apparent that it cannot all be accounted for in this way ?
So , while the logical problem of evil can perhaps be dealt with , the evidential problem looks , to me , a very serious threat to the rationality of theism .
It seems that , not only do most of the popular arguments for the existence of God fail to provide much support to the hypothesis that there ’s an all - powerful maximally good God , there is also very powerful evidence against the hypothesis .
Far from being a “ not unreasonable ” thing to believe , then , it ’s beginning to look like belief in the Judeo - Christian God is very unreasonable indeed .
How do theists respond to the challenge posed by the evidential problem of evil ?
Often , by constructing theodicies – theistic explanations for the amount of evil that exists .
Many such explanations have been developed .
Here are three popular examples .
Free may be invoked to deal not just with the logical problem of evil , but also the evidential problem .
Here ’s a simple example .
God gave us free - will .
Free - will is a great good .
It also allows for certain important goods , such as our ability to do good of a our own free - will .
True ,
God could compel us always to be good , but then we would be mere puppet beings , and so not morally responsible or praiseworthy for our good actions .
Good done of our own volition is a far greater good .
True , as a result of our having free - will we sometimes do wrong – we steal , kill and start wars , for example .
But these evils are more than outweighed by the goods free - will allows .
This is , to borrow theologian John Hick ’s phrase , a “ vale of soul making ” .
God could have made a heaven - like world for us to inhabit .
He chose not to , because he wants to give us the opportunity to grow and develop into the kind of noble and virtuous beings he wants us to be .
That kind of growth requires a struggle .
No pain , no gain .
Many people , having come through a terrible disease , say that , while their ordeal was terrible , they do n’t regret having been through it .
For tt gave them the opportunity to learn about what is really important , to develop morally and spiritually .
By causing us pain and suffering , God gives us the invaluable opportunity to grow and develop both morally and spiritually .
Effective human action requires the world behave in a regular way ( for example , I am able deliberately to light this fire by striking my match only because there are laws that determine that under such circumstances , fire will result from the striking of a match ) .
That there be laws of nature is a prerequisite of our having the ability both to act on our natural environment and interact with each other within it .
These abilities allows for great goods .
They give us the opportunity to act in a morally virtuous way .
True , such a law - governed world inevitably produces some evils .
For instance , the kind of laws and initial conditions that produce stable land masses on which we can survive and evolve also produce tectonic shifts that result in earthquakes and tsunamis .
Still , the evil earthquakes and tsunamis cause is more than outweighed by the goods these same laws allow .
We might think it possible to design a world that , as a result of being governed by different laws and / or initial conditions , contain a far greater ratio of good to evil ( that contain stable land masses but no earthquakes , for example ) , but , due to consequences we have failed to foresee ( perhaps the absence of earthquakes is at the cost of some even worse kind of global catastrophe ) , such worlds will , in reality , always be worse than the actual worldOf course , all three theodicies outlined above have weakness .
Take the free - will theodicy : it fails to explain so called natural evils – such as the pain and suffering caused by natural disasters .
The character - building theodicy also raises such questions as : why hundreds of millions of years of animal suffering ?
Did their characters need building too ?
Still , many of the faithful , while admitting that the evidential problem of evil is not easily solved , may suggest that such moves , taken together , at least do much to reduce the scale of the evidential problem .
Enough , at least , to make belief in God not unreasonable after all .
They may also , as a parting shot , play the mystery card .
This really is the best of all - possible worlds .
Ultimately , the fact that God would allow such horror does make sense .
It ’s just that , being mere humans , we ca n’t see how .
Remember , we are dealing here with the mind of God - an infinitely powerful and wise being whose plan is likely to be inscrutable to us .
Show a little humility !
If there is a God , and this is all part of his divine plan , it ’s hardly surprising we can’t make much sense of it all , is it ?
So the fact that we ca n’t make much sense of it is poor evidence that there is no God .
I now come to the central aim of this little essay , which is to explain why I find these kind of responses to the evidential problem of evil woefully inadequate .
Indeed , I believe it remains pretty obvious there ’s no such God .
I ’ll explain why by means of an analogy .
Suppose that there is no all - powerful , maximally good God .
There is , instead , an all - powerful , maximally evil God .
His depravity knows no limits , his cruelty no bounds .
Call this the evil God hypothesis .
Suppose I believe in such a being .
How reasonable is my belief ?
Surely , very unreasonable indeed .
But why ?
After all , as they stand , the two popular arguments for the existence of God we examined earlier , provide , as we saw , just as much support for the evil God hypothesis as they do the standard good God hypothesis .
As these arguments are widely supposed by Christians , Jews and Muslims to provide significant rational support to their belief , should n’t they acknowledge that , as they stand , they provide much the same level of support the evil God hypothesis .
But of course , hardly anyone believes the evil God hypothesis .
It ’s immediately dismissed by almost everyone as , not just not reasonable , but as downright unreasonable .
It ’s pretty obvious there ’s no such being .
But why ?
Well , is n’t there overwhelming evidence against the evil God hypothesis - the evidence provided by the enormous amounts of good that exist in the world ?
Perhaps an evil God would allow some good into his creation for the sake of greater evils , but would he allow quite so much ?
Why does he allow love , laughter and rainbows , which give us so much pleasure ?
Why would an evil God allow us children to love , who love us unconditionally in return ?
Evil god hates love !
And why would an evil God allow us to help each other and relieve each others ’ suffering ?
That ’s the last thing an evil God would do , surely ?
Perceptive readers will have noticed that this objection to belief in an evil God mirrors the problem of evil .
If you believe in an all - powerful maximally good God , you face the problem of explaining why there is quite so much evil .
If you believe in an all - powerful , maximally evil God you face the problem of explaining why there ’s so much good .
We might call the latter problem the problem of good .
Despite the fact that the evil God hypothesis is about as well supported by many of the most popular arguments for the existence of God as the good God hypothesis , almost everyone immediately dismisses it as silly and absurd .
And rightly so .
Why ?
Because of the overwhelming empirical evidence against it provided by the problem of good .
But now consider these moves that might be made to deal with the problem of good .
Why would an evil God allow us to selflessly help each other and reduce suffering ?
Well , evil God gave us free - will .
Free - will allows for certain important evils , such as the ability to do evil of our own free - will .
True ,
God could have simply compelled us always to do evil , but then we would be mere puppet beings , and so not morally responsible or blameworthy for our evil actions .
For true moral depravity we must freely choose to do wrong .
That ’s why evil God gave us free - will .
It allows for the very great evil of moral depravity .
True , as a result of being given free - will we sometimes choose to do good things – such as help each other and reduce suffering .
But these goods are more than outweighed by the evil free - will brings .
In addition , free - will also allows for certain important forms of psychological suffering .
True ,
God could have just tortured us for all eternity with a red - hot poker , but how much more satisfying and evil to mess with our minds .
By giving us free - will and also weak and selfish natures , evil God can ensure that we suffer the agony of temptation .
And then , when we succumb , we feel the torture of guilt .
We can only suffer these deeper , psychological forms of anguish if we are given ( or are given the illusion of ) free - will .
Hick was mistaken : this is a vale , not of soul making , but of soul - destruction .
Evil god wants us to suffer , do evil and despair .
Why , then , does an evil god create natural beauty ?
To provide some contrast .
To make what is ugly seem even more so .
If everything were uniformly , maximally ugly , we would n’t be tormented by the ugliness half as much as if it was peppered with some beauty .
The need for contrast to maximize suffering also explains why evil god bestows upon a few people lavish lifestyles and success .
Their great fortune is designed to make the suffering of the rest of us even more acute .
Who can rest content knowing that they have so much more , that they are undeserving , and that no matter how hard we might strive , we will never achieve what they have .
Remember , too , that even those lucky few are not really happy .
Why does evil God allow us to have beautiful children to love and that love us unconditionally in return ?
Because we will worry endlessly about them .
Only a parent knows the depths of anguish and suffering that having children brings .
Why does an evil god give us beautiful , healthy young bodies ?
Because we know that out health and vitality will be short - lived , that we will either die young or else wither and become incontinent , arthritic and repulsive .
By giving us something wonderful for a moment , and then gradually pulling it away , an evil god can make us suffer even more than if we had never had it in the first place .
Effective and purposeful action requires the world behave in a regular way .
That there be laws of nature is a prerequisite of our having the ability to both act on our natural environment and interact with each other within it .
These abilities allows for great evils .
For example , they give us the opportunity to act in morally depraved ways – by killing and torturing each other .
By giving us these abilities , evil god also allows us to experience certain important psychological forms of suffering such as frustration – we cannot try , and become frustrated through repeated failure , unless we are first given the opportunity to act .
True , such a law - governed world inevitably produces some goods .
For example , in giving us the ability to act within a physical environment , evil god gave us the ability to avoid that which causes us pain and seek out that which gives us pleasure .
Still , such goods are more than outweighed by the evils these laws allow .
We might think it possible to design a world that , as a result of being governed by different laws and / or initial conditions , contain a far greater ratio of evil to good ( that contain far more physical pain and far less pleasure , for example ) , but , due to consequences we have failed to foresee ( perhaps the greater suffering will result in us being far more charitable , sympathetic and generally good towards others ) , such worlds will , in reality , always be better than the actual world .
Of course , if these reverse theodicies fail to convince , then I can always play the mystery card :
This really is the worst of all - possible worlds .
Ultimately , the fact that an evil God would allow love , laughter and rainbows does make perfect sense .
It ’s just that , being mere humans , we ca n’t see how .
Remember , we are dealing here with the mind of God – a being of infinite power and guile .
Show a little humility !
If there is an evil God , and this is all part of his divine plan , it ’s hardly surprising we can’t make much sense of it all , is it ?
So the fact that we ca n’t make much sense of it is not good evidence that there ’s no evil God .
Many other ( if not all ) standard theodicies can be similarly reversed .
Should we conclude , then , that we were mistaken ?
Should we suppose that belief in an evil God is , despite the apparent evidence against to the contrary , not unreasonable after all ?
Of course not .
The evil God hypothesis remains pretty obviously false .
The fact that we can gerrymander such explanations for what looks to be overwhelming evidence against the evil God hypothesis does n’t show that there is n’t overwhelming evidence against the hypothesis , or that the evil God hypothesis is not , indeed , a very silly thing believe .
Ditto , I suggest , the good God hypothesis .
The good God hypothesis , far from being something it ’s impossible for reason to determine the truth or falsity of , is , in fact , straightforwardly empirically falsified .
It is , to any one with eyes to see , pretty obviously false ( the real mystery , I think , is why so many fail to see this ) .
Perhaps the universe has a creator .
Perhaps there is some sort of intelligence behind it .
But , even if there is , we can be very sure it ’s not the evil God , ca n ’t we ?
So why ca n’t we be equally sure it ’s not the good God ?
We may not know what or who did create the universe , if anything .
We can still be pretty sure who did n’t .
Of course , those who believe the good God hypothesis will no doubt now try to establish some asymmetry between the good and evil God hypotheses .
There are some asymmetries , in fact .
But I can not see that any of them tilt the scale of reasonableness significantly in the direction of the good God hypothesis .
Which is why I do n’t believe it .
Seems to me the good God hypotheses , like the evil God hypothesis , is pretty obviously false .
Mr Blagojevich says he believes he has done nothing wrong Barack Obama has called on Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to resign following his arrest on charges that he tried to " sell " Mr Obama 's Senate seat .
Mr Blagojevich , as governor , has the sole authority to pick Mr Obama 's successor as senator for Illinois .
Congressman Jesse Jackson
Jr has been revealed as the man who Mr Blagojevich claimed sent an emissary to him , offering campaign cash for the seat .
Mr Jackson denied any wrongdoing in a statement to reporters .
In transcripts of intercepted conversations released by the FBI on Tuesday , Mr Blagojevich is quoted saying that a man referred to by officials as Senate Candidate Five would " raise me 500 grand .
An emissary came .
Then the other guy would raise a million , if I made him a senator " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Jackson 's lawyer confirmed to reporters on Wednesday that Mr Jackson was Senate Candidate Five .
But Mr Jackson , son of the prominent civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
Sr , insisted he was " not a target of this investigation " .
Mr Jackson
Jr said he had never made any approaches to Mr Blagojevich to discuss buying the vacant Senate seat .
" I want to make this fact plain : I reject and denounce ' pay to play ' politics and have no involvement whatsoever in any wrongdoing , " he said .
" I did not initiate or authorise anyone at any time to promise anything to Governor Blagojevich on my behalf . "
He added that he believed the governor " should resign and forfeit his authority to make the Senate appointment " .
Special election Mr Obama , who is not close to Mr Blagojevich , was not involved in the alleged wrongdoing , prosecutors said .
Mr Obama 's official spokesman said the President - elect wanted Mr Blagojevich to resign .
" Under the current circumstances , it is difficult for the governor to effectively do his job and serve the people of Illinois , " he told reporters in a written statement
And he said that Mr Obama was keen for the Illinois legislature to consider holding a special election to fill the seat .
CHARGES AGAINST BLAGOJEVICH
Federal agents say Mr Blagojevich
Tried to obtain campaign contributions in exchange for official actions ;
Tried to use state funds for the private purpose of inducing the Tribune Company to fire Chicago Tribune editorial board members critical of him ;
Tried to obtain personal financial benefits for himself in return for his appointment of a US senator Lawmakers in Illinois have said they could hold a special legislative session as early as Monday to work out the details of the special election .
Mr Blagojevich , who was arrested on Tuesday , was released on bail after appearing before a federal judge and arrived at his office for work on Wednesday .
His lawyer told reporters that Mr Blagojevich believed he had done nothing wrong and had no plans to resign .
Federal investigators , who have been working on a case against Mr Blagojevich for several years , have charged him with a number of offences including soliciting a bribe .
The charges relate to a variety of corruption schemes in which the governor was allegedly involved , including so - called " pay to play " deals - the doling out of jobs , contracts and appointments in return for campaign contributions .
Wiretaps
The US Attorney 's Office has released a 76 - page FBI affidavit detailing the charges against Mr Blagojevich , which includes transcripts of his telephone conversations intercepted by court - authorised wiretaps over the last month .
In the conversations , the Democratic governor allegedly discussed offering Mr Obama 's Senate seat in return for a well - paid position at a non-profit organisation or a group affiliated with trades unions , according to the affidavit .
In the transcripts , on 3 November Mr Blagojevich said the seat was a " [ expletive ] valuable thing , you just do n't give it away for nothing " .
The conduct would make Lincoln roll over in his grave

The day after the presidential election , according to the affidavit , Mr Blagojevich was recorded as saying : " I 've got this thing and it 's [ expletive ] golden , and uh , uh , I 'm just not giving it up for [ expletive ] nothing . "
Mr Blagojevich also allegedly talked about getting his wife Patti placed on a corporate board .
In addition , he has been charged with illegally threatening to block state aid to the company that owns the Chicago Tribune newspaper .
Mr Blagojevich allegedly demanded that the company fire members of its editorial board in return for financial assistance in the sale of Wrigley Field , a Chicago sports stadium .
The governor was elected on a pledge to clean up after his predecessor George Ryan , who is serving a six - and - a - half - year sentence for fraud .

Religious Obama voters and religious McCain voters worship and pray at similar rates but interpret the Bible in dramatically different ways -- and have starkly different views on the issues — according to a new Beliefnet user survey .
Among those who attend church weekly , 81 % of Obama supporters pray daily compared to 93 % of McCain ’s supporters .
But when asked how they interpret the Bible , only 17 % of Obama ’s most religious voters believe “ The Bible is the literal word of God , ” compared to 58 % of McCain ’s religious voters . ”
The user survey provides a unique glimpse at the voting patterns and preferences of the most religious of the Obama and McCain constituencies – those who attend church weekly or more .
( Exit polls indicated that 55 % of those who attend worship services weekly or more voted for McCain while 43 % voted for Obama , an improvement over past Democratic performances . )
The survey also provides new comparisons of Obama ’s and McCain ’s evangelical supporters .

Other key findings :
Half of McCain voters believe Obama is or was Muslim , with 31.7 % saying “ He used to be Muslim and still has too many connections to Islam . ”
Many more Obama voters believe McCain ran an unchristian campaign , rather than vice versa .
Among the most religious voters , Obama supporters believe that education is the best way to reduce abortion , while McCain supporters prefer bans and restrictions on abortion .
Supporters of each candidate doubt the religious sincerity of the other candidate .
The survey is not scientific or based on random sampling .
It was advertised throughout Beliefnet 's Web site and newsletters .
From November 3 through November 6 4,400 users completed the survey .

First Nation in Cyberspace
From : TIME International - Dec. 6 , 1993 , No.49
By Philip Elmer - Dewitt
With reporting by David S. Jackson / San Francisco and Wendy King / Washington Back in the mid-1960s , at the height of the cold war , the U. S. Department of Defense faced a tough question :
How could orders be issued to the armed forces if the U.S. were ravaged by a nuclear assault ?
The communication hubs in place at the time the telephone switching offices and the radio and TV broadcast stations were not only vulnerable to attack , they would also probably be the first to go .
The Pentagon needed a military command - and - control system that would continue to operate even if most of the phone lines were in tatters and the switches had melted down .
In 1964 a researcher at the Rand Corp. named Paul Baran came up with a bizarre solution to this Strangelovian puzzle .
He designed a computer - communications network that had no hub , no central switching station , no governing authority , and that assumed that the links connecting any city to any other were totally unreliable .
Baran 's system was the antithesis of the orderly , efflcient phone network ; it was more like an electronic post offlce designed by a madman .
In Baran 's scheme , each message was cut into tiny strips and stuffed into electronic envelopes , called packets , each marked with the address of the sender and the intended receiver .
The packets were then released like so much confetti into the web of interconnected computers , where they were tossed back and forth over high - speed wires in the general direction of their destination and reassembled when they finally got there .
If any packets were missing or mangled ( and it was assumed that some would be ) , it was no big deal ; they were simply re-sent .
Baran 's packet - switching network , as it came to be called , might have been a minor footnote in cold war history were it not for one contingency : it took root in the computers that began showing up in U.S. universities and government research laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s and became , by a path as circuitous as one taken by those wayward packets , the technological underpinning of the Internet .
The Internet , for those who have n't been hanging out in cyberspace , reading the business pages or following the comic strip Doonesbury ( shown above ) , is the mother of all computer networks - an anarchistic electronic freeway that has spread uncontrollably and now circles the globe .
It is at once the shining archetype and the nightmare vision of the information highway that the Clinton Administration has been touting and that U.S. telephone and cable - TV companies are racing to build .
Much of what Bell Atlantic and Time Warner are planning to sell interactivity , two - way communications , multimedia info on demand the Internet already provides for free .
And because of its cold war roots , the Internet has one quality that makes it a formidable competitor : you could n't destroy it if you tried .
Nobody owns the Internet , and no single organization controls its use .
In the mid-1980s the U.S. National Science Foundation built the high - speed , long - distance data lines that form Internet 's American backbone .
But the major costs of running the network are shared in a cooperative arrangement by its primary users : universities , national labs , high - tech corporations and foreign governments .
Two years ago , the NSF lifted restrictions against commercial use of the Internet , and in September the White House announced a plan to make it the starting point for an even grander concept called the National Information Infrastructure .
Suddenly the Internet is the place to be .
American college students are queuing up outside computing centers to get online .
Executives are ordering new business cards that show off their Internet addresses .
Millions of people around the world are logging on to tap into libraries , call up satellite weather photos , download free computer programs and participate in discussion groups with everyone from lawyers to physicists to sadomasochists .
Even the U.S. President and Vice President have their own Internet accounts ( although they are n't very good at answering their mail ) .
" It 's the Internet boom , " says network activist Mitch Kapor , who thinks the true sign that popular interest has reached critical mass came when the New Yorker printed a cartoon showing two computer - savvy canines with the caption , " On the Internet , nobody knows you 're a dog "
But the Internet is not ready for prime time .
There are no TV Guides to sort through the 5,000 discussion groups or the 2,5OO electronic newsletters or the tens of thousands of computers with files to share .
Instead of feeling surrounded by information , first - timers ( " newbies " in the jargon of the Net ) are likely to find themselves adrift in a borderless sea .
Old - timers say the first wave of dizziness does n't last long .
" It 's like driving a car with a clutch , " says Thomas Lunzer , a network designer at SRI International , a California consulting firm .
" Once you figure it out , you can drive all over the place . "
But you must learn new languages ( like UNIX ) , new forms of address ( like president@whitehouse.gov ) and new ways of expressing feeling , and you must master a whole set of rules for how to behave , called netiquette .
Rule No. 1 : Do n't ask dumb questions .
In fact , do n't ask any questions at all before you 've read the FAQ ( frequently asked questions ) files .
Otherwise you risk annoying a few hundred thousand people who may either yell at you ( IN ALL CAPS ! ) or , worse still , ignore you .
All that is starting to change , however , as successive waves of netters demand , and eventually get , more user - friendly tools for navigating the Internet .
In fact , anyone with a desktop computer and a modem connecting it to a phone line can now find ways into and around the network .
" The Internet is n't just computer scientists talking to one another anymore , " says Glee Willis , the engineering librarian at the University of Nevada at Reno and one of nearly 20,000 ( mostly female ) academic librarians who have joined the Internet in the past five years .
" It 's a family place .
It 's a place for perverts .
It 's everything rolled into one . "
As traffic swells , the Internet is beginning to suffer the problems of any heavily traveled highway , including vandalism , break - ins and traffic jams .
" It 's like an amusement park that 's so successful that there are long waits for the most popular rides , " says David Farber , a professor of information science at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the network 's original architects .
And while most users wait patiently for the access and information they need , rogue hackers use stolen passwords to roam the network , exploring forbidden computers and reading other people 's mail .
How big is the Internet ?
Part of its mystique is that nobody knows for sure .
The only fact that can be measured precisely is the number of computers directly connected to it by highspeed links - a figure that is updated periodically by sending a computer program crawling around , tallying the number of connections ( last count : roughly 2 million ) .
But that figure does not include military computers that for security reasons are invisible to other users , or the hundreds of people who may share a single Internet host .
Nor does it include millions more who dial into the Internet through the growing number of commercial gateways , such as Panix and Netcom , which offer indirect telephone access for $ 10 to $ 20 a month .
When all these users are taken into account , the total number of people around the world who can get into the Internet one way or another may be 20 million .
" It 's a large country , " says Farber of the Internet population .
" We ought to apply to the U.N. as the first nation in cyberspace . "
That nation is about to get even bigger as the major commercial computer networks - Prodigy , CompuServe , America Online , GEnie and Delphi Internet Service - begin to dismantle the walls that have separated their private operations from the public Internet .
The success of the Internet is a matter of frustration to the owners of the commercial networks , who have tried all sorts of marketing tricks and still count fewer than 5 million subscribers among them .
Most commercial networks now allow electronic mail to pass between their services and the Internet .
Delphi , which was purchased by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. in September , began providing its customers full Internet access earlier this year .
America Online ( which publishes an electronic version of TIME ) is scheduled to begin offering limited Internet services later this month .
People who uses these new entry points into the Net may be in for a shock .
Unlike the family - oriented commercial services , which censor messages they find offensive , the Internet imposes no restrictions .
Anybody can start a discussion on any topic and say anything .
There have been sporadic attempts by local network managers to crack down on the raunchier discussion groups , but as Internet pioneer John Gilmore puts it , " The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it . "
The casual visitor to the newsgroups on the Usenet ( a bulletin - board system that began as a competitor to the Internet but has been largely subsumed by it ) will discover discussion groups labeled , according to the Net 's idiosyncratic cataloging system , alt.sex.masturbation , alt.sex.bondage and alt.sex.fetish.feet .
On Internet Relay Chat , a global 24 - hour - a - day message board , one can stumble upon imaginary orgies played out with one - line typed commands ( " Now I 'm taking off your shirt . . . " ) .
In alt.binaries.pictures.erotica , a user can peek at snapshots that would make a sailor blush .
But those who focus on the Internet 's sexual content risk missing the point .
For every sexually oriented discussion group there are hundreds on tamer and often more substantial topics ranging from bungee jumping to particle physics .
Last week Virginia college student Chris Glover responded to a distressed message from a suicidal undergraduate in Denver .
After two hours of messages back and forth , Glover was able to pinpoint the woman 's location and call for help .
With all this variety , Internet users are unimpressed by television 's promise of a 500 - channel future .
The Internet already delivers 10,000 channels , and the only obstacle that prevents it from carrying live TV pictures is the bandwidth ( or carrying capacity ) of the data lines .
Some video clips - and at least one full - length video movies - are already available on the network .
And this year writer Carl Malamud began using the Internet to distribute a weekly " radio " interview show called Geek of the Week .
Malamud is undeterred by the fact that it takes a computer about an hour over a highspeed modem to capture the 30 minutes of sound that a $ 10 radio can pick up instantly for free .
But bandwidth capacity has nowhere to go but up , says Malamud , and its cost will only go down .
The Internet , however , will have to go through some radical changes before it can join the world of commerce .
Subsidized for so long by the U. S. government , its culture is not geared to normal business activities .
It does not take kindly to unsolicited advertisements ; use electronic mail to promote your product and you are likely to be inundated with hate mail directed not only at you personally but also at your supervisor , your suppliers and your customers as well .
" It 's a perfect Marxist state , where almost nobody does any business , ' says Farber .
" But at some point that will have to change . "
The change has already begun .
NSF 's contribution now represents about 10 % of the total cost of the network , and the agency is scheduled to start phasing out its support next April , removing at the same time what few restrictions still remain against commercial activity .
According to Tim O'Reilly , president of O'Reilly & Associates , a publisher experimenting with advertiser - supported Internet magazines , the system could evolve in one of two ways : either entrepreneurs will manage to set up shop on a freemarket version of the Internet , or some consortium will take the whole thing over and turn it into a giant CompuServe .
" That 's an outcome , " O'Reilly says , " that would effectively destroy the Internet as we know it . "
As the traffic builds and the billboards go up , some Internet veterans are mourning the old electronic freeway .
" I feel kind of sad about it , " says Denise Caruso , editorial director of Friday Holdings , a publisher specializing in new media .
" It was such a dynamic , pulsing thing .
I wonder whether we should n't have left it alone . "
Others see the period of uncertainty ahead as a rare opportunity for people to shape their own technological destiny .
" We need . . . a firm idea of the kind of media environment we would like to see in the future , " warns Howard Rheingold in his new book , The Virtual Community .
While it may be difficult for communities as diverse as those on the Internet to set their own agenda , it seems increasingly likely that if they do n't , someone else will do it for them .
Awwww , is n't that kee - yoot ?
That lady 's got one of those novelty backpacks ...
... you know , the kind that look just like a ... just like a ...

I 'm speechless , A. S .

Paranoia on the rise , experts say
If you think they 're out to get you , you 're not alone .
Paranoia , once assumed to afflict only schizophrenics , may be a lot more common than previously thought .
According to British psychologist Daniel Freeman , nearly one in four Londoners regularly have paranoid thoughts .
Freeman is a paranoia expert at the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College and the author of a book on the subject .
Experts say there is a wide spectrum of paranoia , from the dangerous delusions that drive schizophrenics to violence to the irrational fears many people have daily .
" We are now starting to discover that madness is human and that we need to look at normal people to understand it , " said Dr. Jim van Os , a professor of psychiatry at Maastricht University in the Netherlands .
Van
Os was not connected to Freeman 's studies .
Paranoia is defined as the exaggerated or unfounded fear that others are trying to hurt you .
That includes thoughts that other people are trying to upset or annoy you , for example , by staring , laughing , or making unfriendly gestures .
Surveys of several thousands of people in Britain , the United States and elsewhere have found that rates of paranoia are slowly rising , although researchers ' estimates of how many of us have paranoid thoughts varies widely , from 5 percent to 50 percent .
A British survey of more than 8,500 adults found that 21 percent of people thought there had been times when others were acting against them .
Another survey of about 1,0000 adults in New York found that nearly 11 percent thought other people were following or spying on them .
Dennis Combs , an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Tyler , has been studying paranoia for about a decade .
When he first started conducting paranoia studies , mostly in college students , he found that about 5 percent of them had paranoid thoughts .
In recent years , that has tripled to about 15 percent , he said .
In a small experiment in London , Freeman concluded that a quarter of people riding the subway in the capital probably have regular thoughts that qualify as paranoia .
In the study , 200 randomly selected people ( those with a history of mental problems were excluded ) took a virtual reality train ride .
They recorded their reactions to computerized passengers programmed to be neutral .
More than 40 percent of study participants had at least some paranoid thoughts .
Some felt intimidated by the computer passengers , claiming they were aggressive , had made obscene gestures , or tried to start a fight .
Freeman said that in big cities , many ambiguous events can lead to paranoid thoughts .
Because we constantly make snap judgments based on limited information , like which street to take or whether or not strangers are dangerous , the decision - making process is prone to error .
Van
Os said Freeman 's virtual reality experiment was solid and confirmed previous research .
Experts say not everyone with paranoid thoughts needs professional help .
It all depends on how disturbing the thoughts are and if they disrupt your life .
" People walk around with odd thoughts all the time , " said David Penn , a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina .
" The question is if that translates into real behavior . "
Van
Os recalled a delusional patient who was convinced that the French singer Charles Aznavour was in love with her , and had been whispering to her before she went to sleep every night for more than two decades .
" You could call it a psychotic experience , but she was very happy about it , " van Os said .
" There is n't always a need for care when there 's an instance of psychosis . "
He hoped that being able to identify milder delusional symptoms in people could help doctors intervene earlier to prevent more serious cases .
The post -Sept. 11 atmosphere and the war on terror have also increased levels of paranoia in the West , some experts said .
" We are bombarded with information about our alert status and we 're told to report suspicious - looking characters , " Penn said .
" That primes people to be more paranoid . "
Traumatic events can make people more vulnerable to having paranoid thoughts .
Since the attacks , Penn said Americans have been conditioned to be more vigilant of anything out of the ordinary .
While heightened awareness may be good thing , Penn said it can also lead to false accusations and an atmosphere where strangers are negatively viewed .
That can result in more social isolation , hostility , and possibly even crime .
And it can take a toll on physical health .
More paranoia means more stress , a known risk factor for heart disease and strokes .
Still , some experts said that a little bit of paranoia could be helpful .
" In a world full of threat , it may be kind of beneficial for people to be on guard .
It 's good to be looking around and see who 's following you and what 's happening , " Combs said .
" Not everybody is trying to get you , but some people may be . "
Our political and cultural " leaders " are accomplices in a plot to re-engineer humanity to serve the Judeo - Masonic central banking cartel .
Wars , terrorism , depressions , political and social change , entertainment and fads are all contrived to gradually bring about an Orwellian police state .
Many people have said this but last week , I learned of another " smoking gun . "
Randy Engel , the President of the US Coalition of Life sent me a tape she made in 1988 with Dr. Lawrence Dunegan , a Pittsburgh pediatrician who died in Jan. 2004 .
( Engel - http://www.riteofsodomy.com/index.php?act=viewDoc&docId=5 US Coalition of Life -- http://www.uscl.info/index.php?pr=Home_Page)
It consists of his recollection of a speech given March 20 , 1969 by Dr. Richard Day , the National Medical Director of the Rockefeller - sponsored " Planned Parenthood " to a meeting of the Pittsburgh Pediatric Society .
It describes " A New World System , " already in place which would permanently transform the world .
Dr. Day wanted the eighty or so physicians present to be prepared .
The transcript of Dunegan 's recollections has been posted here and should be read in full .
( Transcript - http://www.overlordsofchaos.com/html/ new_order_of_barbarians.html )
Much of what Day promised in 1969 is looking into a rear - view mirror today .
But ominous events have yet to transpire .
They do want to implant a chip in us so they can find and identify us , as well as monitor and control our purchases .
They are weaning us off national allegiance and will resort to terrorism to win our assent to their global police state .
They may use " one or two nuclear bombs to convince people we mean business , " Day said .
He refrained from mentioning who " we " are but said the names are recognizable .
Given that he worked for the Rockefellers , I assume he meant the Rockefellers and their bosses , the Rothschilds .
This adds weight to the widely - held view that the central bankers are responsible for most terrorism , using MI - 6 , Mossad and the CIA .
Dr. Day also said that " war is obsolete " given the danger of nuclear exchange so terrorism would be used instead .
This was 1969 .
He said that there are always two reasons for anything the Rockefellers do : the pretext which makes it palatable to the gullible public and the real reason .
Thus , as I argued in my book " Cruel Hoax " ( 2007 ) , we are being turned into homosexuals in the name of " women 's and gay rights . "
Gender - confused and promiscuous , fewer people are able and willing to bond permanently with the opposite sex for the purpose of having children .
Dr. Day said sex will be separated from marriage and reproduction ( i.e. " sexual liberation " ) to break up the family and reduce population .
Abortion , divorce and homosexuality will be made socially acceptable .
" Homosexuals will be given permission to act out .
Everyone including the elderly will be encouraged to have sex .
It will be brought out into the open .
Anything goes . "
[ The " Stonewall Riots " which unleashed the " gay rights " movement , took place three months later . ]
The ultimate goal is to have sex without reproduction .
Reproduction without sex will occur in laboratories .
Family size will be limited as in China .
It will be made more difficult for families to stay together .
More women will work outside the home and more people will remain single .
Sports instead of dolls will be promoted to girls so they will seek achievement instead of family .
Girls will be taught they are the same as boys .
In general , international sports like soccer and hockey will be pushed so Americans will see themselves as " world citizens . "
American sports like baseball and football will not be similarly encouraged .
Pertinent now that US automakers are hurting , Day said America will be de-industrialized .
Each part of the world will have a specialty and thus become interdependent .
He said American industry will be undermined and shown to be uncompetitive .
The US will remain a center for agriculture , high tech , communications , and education .
Pornography , violence and obscenity on TV and in movies will be increased .
People will be desensitized to violence and porn and made to feel life is short , precarious and brutish .
Music will " get worse " and will be used for indoctrination .
There will be unemployment and mass migration in order to uproot long established ( conservative ) communities .
Social change will be introduced in port cities and work its way to the heartland .
( Thus , the east and west coast are liberal . )
He said a cure to cancer exists in the Rockefeller Institute but is kept secret for purposes of depopulation .
He said there will be an increase in infectious man-made diseases .
Dr. Day , who worked in weather modification during the war , said weather can be used to wage war or create drought and famine .
The food supply will be monitored so no one can get enough food to " support a fugitive from the New System . "
Growing your own food will be outlawed under the pretext of it being unsafe .
He said people are controlled by means of the information they are given .
Thus , information will be selective .
Not everyone will be allowed to own books .
" Certain books will disappear from libraries . "
Literary classics will be subtly altered .
People will spend longer in school but not learn anything .
There will be restrictions on travel ; and private home ownership will disappear .
He said people who do n't want to go along will be " disposed of humanely . "
He said there will be no martyrs --" people will just disappear . "
CONCLUSION Dr. Day says politicians are manipulated " without their even knowing it . "
Their failure to protect us from this Satanic conspiracy is a betrayal of the first order .
We have to alert the sincere ones and reach soldiers and police too .
Civilization hangs in the balance .
We are in real danger and should organize in small independent units .
People are hurting now and are more receptive to this information .
This " economic downturn " is deliberate and part of the police state agenda .
We have to educate people who think these events are random .
The Rockefellers and their traitorous lackeys can't bring this off if the intelligentsia and masses are aware of the truth .
( Deliberate - http://www.henrymakow.com/ illuminati_bankers_seek_revolu.html )
Progressives and Leftists need to learn that " progress " and " change " really refer to totalitarian world government .
This is the change they " believe in . "
Dr. Day said in 1969 , " people will have to get used to constant change . "
I used to be a Liberal - Leftist myself .
If I can see what " changing the world " really means , others can too .
We also have to take practical steps to defend ourselves , our families and our freedom .
Our society and culture are a fraud based on one central fraud , the monopoly over government credit by Cabalist private bankers .
They are using this power to extend their monopoly over every aspect of our lives by manipulating world events and social behavior .
The only way to save civilization from failure is to nationalize the Central Banks .

' Karl Rove 's IT guru ' Mike Connell dies in plane crash RAW STORY
Published : Saturday December 20 , 2008
Print This Email This
UPDATE AT THIS LINK : GOP consultant killed in plane crash was warned of sabotage
A top level Republican IT consultant who was set to testify in a case alleging GOP election tampering in Ohio died in a plane crash late Friday night .
Michael Connell -- founder of Ohio - based New Media Communications , which created campaign Web sites for George W. Bush and John McCain -- died instantly after his single - prop , private aircraft smashed into a vacant home in suburban Lake Township , Ohio .
" The plane was attempting to land around 6 p.m. Friday at Akron - Canton Airport when it crashed about three miles short of the runway , " reports the Akron Beacon Journal .
Connell 's exploits as a top GOP IT ' guru ' have been well documented by RAW STORY 's investigative team .
The interest in Mike Connell stems from his association with a firm called GovTech , which he had spun off from his own New Media Communications under his wife Heather Connells name .
GovTech was hired by Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell to set up an official election website at election .sos.state.oh.us to presented the 2004 presidential returns as they came in .
Connell is a long - time GOP operative , whose New Media Communications provided web services for the Bush - Cheney 04 campaign , the US Chamber of Commerce , the Republican National Committee and many Republican candidates .
This in itself might have raised questions about his involvement in creating Ohios official state election website .
However , the alternative media group ePlubibus Media further discovered in November 2006 that election .
sos.state.oh.us was hosted on the servers of a company in Chattanooga , TN called SmarTech , which also provided hosting for a long list of Republican Internet domains .
 Since early this decade , top Internet gurus in Ohio have been coordinating web services with their GOP counterparts in Chattanooga , wiring up a major hub that in 2004 , first served as a conduit for Ohio 's live election night results ,  researchers at ePluribus Media wrote .
A few months after this revelation , when a scandal erupted surrounding the firing of US Attorneys for reasons of White House policy , other researchers found that the gwb43 domain used by members of the White House staff to evade freedom of information laws by sending emails outside of official White House channels was hosted on those same SmarTech servers .
Given that the Bush White House used SmarTech servers to send and receive email , the use of one of those servers in tabulating Ohios election returns has raised eyebrows .
Ohio gave Bush the decisive margin in the Electoral College to secure his reelection in 2004 .
IT expert Stephen Spoonamore says the SmartTech server could have functioned as a routing point for malicious activity and remains a weakness in electronic voting tabulation .
" ... I have reason to believe that the alternate accounts were used to communicate with US Attorneys involved in political prosecutions , like that of Don Siegelman , " said RAW STORY 's Investigative News Editor , Larisa Alexandrovna , on her personal blog Saturday morning .
" This is what I have been working on to prove for over a year .
In fact , it was through following the Siegelman - Rove trail that I found evidence leading to Connell .
That is how I became aware of him .
Mike was getting ready to talk .
He was frightened .
" He has flown his private plane for years without incident .
I know he was going to DC last night , but I do n't know why .
He apparently ran out of gas , something I find hard to believe .
I am not saying that this was a hit nor am I resigned to this being simply an accident either .
I am no expert on aviation and cannot provide an opinion on the matter .
What I am saying , however , is that given the context , this event needs to be examined carefully . "
" Mr. Connell has confided that he was being threatened , something that his attorneys also told the judge in the Ohio election fraud case , " concluded Alexandrovna .
An FAA investigation into the causes of Connell 's plane crash is underway , but no results are expected for several weeks .
UPDATE AT THIS LINK : GOP consultant killed in plane crash was warned of sabotage
Achtung , es besteht dringender Handlungsbedarf : Obwohl der genaue Text des Koalitions - „ Kompromisses “ zu den neuen Befugnissen des Bundeskriminalamts noch nicht einmal bekannt ist , soll er bereits am Mittwoch nächster Woche (! ) im Bundestag verabschiedet werden .
Wenn der Bundesrat dann auch noch zustimmt , könnten wir zum ersten Januar ein deutsches FBI bekommen , mit allen Problemen , die damit verbunden sind – Vermischung von Polizei und Geheimdienstarbeit , fehlende richterliche und bundesanwaltliche Kontrollen , Kompetenzwirrwarr mit den Ländern , Auskunftspflicht für Journalisten , großem Spähangriff auf Privatwohnungen und natürlich der heimlichen Online - Durchsuchung .
Die Einigung in der Koalitionsrunde auf den Entwurf für das neue BKA - Gesetz hat daher nicht unerwartet sehr viele kritische Reaktionen hervorgerufen – unten folgt eine kleine Auswahl mit den wichtigsten Argumenten .
Mehr Hintergrund - Infos gibt es z.B. im Archiv der Artikel zum Thema bei heise , bei der Humanistischen Union , in der Petition des AK Vorrat , und in den Berichten zur Experten - Anhörung im Bundestag bei Fefe und Ravenhorst .
Wichtig ist jetzt , dass bis nächste Woche die Abgeordneten von SPD und Union massiv zu hören kriegen , dass dieses Überwachungsmonster von der breiten Mehrheit der Bevölkerung abgelehnt wird .
Werdet also bitte schnellstens aktiv !
Ruft eure Wahlkreisabgeordneten an , besucht sie möglichst morgen noch im Wahlkreisbüro , bloggt darüber , macht Mahnwachen vor dem Bundestag , und tut alles andere was euch einfällt , um diesen gefährlichen Unsinn noch zu verhindern .
Vor allem muss denen klar gemacht werden , dass die Großdemo gegen den Überwachungswahn im Oktober der Startschuss für weitere Aktionen der wachsenden Bürgerrechtsbewegung gerade im Wahlkampfjahr 2009 war .
Wenn sie das nicht verstehen , wird es ihnen wie John McCain gehen , der ebenfalls nicht verstanden hat , auf die Internet - Generation einzugehen .
Statt weiterhin auf eine Politik der Angst zu setzen , wollen wir nämlich mehr Freiheit , eine lebenswerte digitale Umwelt ohne ständige Überwachung , und daher eine neue Sicherheitspolitik .
Zur heimlichen Online - Durchsuchung ( Bundestrojaner ) : FDP - Fraktionsvize Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger nannte die Befristung der heimlichen Online - Durchsuchung im Jahr 2020 eine „ Farce “ .
Der fehlende Richtervorbehalt bei „ Gefahr im Verzuge “ sei darüber hinaus sinnlos , denn Online - Razzien seien „ technisch und zeitlich so aufwendig , dass gar keine Eilfälle denkbar sind “ .
Das hat übrigens gerade auch der BKA - Chef Ziercke bestätigt , der sagte ,
„ dass jede Online - Durchsuchung ein sorgfältig programmiertes Unikat sein werde , weil jeder Rechner andere Virenscanner , Firewalls oder Spyware - Sucher aufweisen würde , die überlistet werden müssten . “
Wer unter solchen Umständen immer noch von „ Gefahr im Verzug “ redet ( wie Ziercke übrigens selber auch ) , dem geht es gar nicht um die Online - Durchsuchung , sondern um einen generellen Abbau rechtsstaatlicher Bremsen der Überwachungs - und Sicherheitsbehörden .
Der ehemalige BND - Chef Hansjörg Geiger fordert für solche und andere heimliche Ermittlungsmaßnahmen : Hier „ sollte der Staat einen Bürgeranwalt beauftragen , die Rechte der Betroffenen wahrzunehmen , auch wenn diese zunächst nichts davon erfahren . “
Der Vorsitzende des Deutschen Richterbunds , Christoph Frank , verlangt dagegen weiterhin eine unabhängige Kontrolle durch einen Richter .
Renate Künast von den Grünen und Gerhart Baum von der FDP haben bereits Verfassungsklage angekündigt .
Zu den weiteren BKA - Kompetenzen : Der Vorsitzende des Deutschen Journalisten - Verbandes , Michael Konken , kritisierte ,
dass das BKA von Journalisten die Herausgabe von Recherchematerial verlangen kann , obwohl ein Zeugnisverweigerungsrecht zum Schutz der Informanten besteht .
„ Mit diesem Gesetz werden Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts schlicht ignoriert “ , kritisierte Konken .
Es entziehe Journalisten den Schutz , den sie bei Recherchen bräuchten .
Annalist schreibt zum Spähangriff in Privatwohnungen :
Ich kann nicht sagen , dass ich die Aufregung um die Nacktscanner an Flughäfen letzte Woche schlecht gefunden hätte , aber was ich nicht verstehe ist : Warum ist das so viel dramatischer als die sog .
‚ Visuelle Wohnraumüberwachung ‘ , also Kameras , die das BKA ab nächster Woche legal heimlich in Wohnungen einsetzen darf ?
Am Flughafen kann ich ihnen dabei wenigstens in die Augen gucken .
Und es ist nur ein Moment .
Ex-BND - Chef Geiger befürchtet eine Vermischung von Bundes - und Länderkompetenzen :
Es ist nicht klar geregelt , wann nun das BKA und wann die Länder für die Abwehr internationalen Terrors zuständig sind .
Deshalb droht eine doppelte Zuständigkeit , die die Bürger übermäßig belastet , zudem ineffizient ist und politische Verantwortlichkeit verwischt .
Darüber hinaus weist er darauf hin , dass bei der Gefahrenabwehr das BKA nicht mehr der Kontrolle durch die Bundesanwaltschaft unterliegt .
Zu dem Argument der Überwachungspolitiker , das BKA bekomme nur Kompetenzen , die die Landeskriminalämter auch schon haben , sagte Geiger :
Das BKA ist personell und technisch ganz anders ausgestattet als ein Landeskriminalamt , das führt zu einem qualitativen Sprung .
Denn das BKA kann und wird von diesen Befugnissen – Lausch - und Spähangriff , Computer - und Telefonüberwachung – viel mehr Gebrauch machen als die Länder .
Da entsteht eine
Art deutsches FBI .
Allgemeines : Die Innenpolitiker der großen Koalition sind stolz auf die Einigung :
Der Innenexperte der CDU / CSU - Bundestagsfraktion , Hans - Peter - Uhl , betonte , dass der Kompromiss Sicherheit und Freiheit in ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis bringe .
SPD - Innenexperte Dieter Wiefelspütz lobte das Ergebnis als „ qualifiziertestes Polizeigesetz Deutschlands “ .
Dazu der treffende Kommentar von Fefe :
Wer hat uns verraten ?
Na klar , die Sozialdemokraten .
Zur „ Überprüfung “ im Jahr 2020 hat er ebenfalls die richtigen Worte gefunden :
In a better - late - than - never move , Blockbuster has introduced a video - on - demand ( VOD ) service accompanied by a “ free ” set - top box ( STB ) .
Like TiVo , Roku ’s Netflix box , and many other modern Internet - enabled A/V gadgets , Blockbuster ’s new VOD STB runs Linux .
Blockbuster claims its new VOD service offers “ thousands of titles from the latest movie releases to classic favorites . ”
The company ’s phrasing appears to be a thinly - veiled jab at Netflix ’s VOD service , which currently seems to be limited primarily to TV shows , documentaries , and mostly older ( “ classic ” ) movies .
Blockbuster ’s VOD service uses 2 Wire ’s MediaPoint STB
( Click to enlarge )
Like the Netflix VOD STB , there ’s a $ 99 upfront pricetag associated with the Blockbuster offering .
But that ’s where the pricing similarity ends .
While Netflix ’s box ( made by Roku ; pictured at right ) has a one - time cost of $ 99 followed by a minimum monthly subscription to Netflix ( $ 8.99 + for unlimited downloads ) , Blockbuster currently is providing its VOD STB ( made by 2 Wire ) free with an advance rental of 25 on - demand movies for $ 99 .
Thereafter , VOD titles are available for $ 1.99 each .

STB specs
The VOD STB itself is a Blockbuster - specific version of 2 Wire ’s Mediapoint Digital Media Player , which , we ’ve confirmed , runs an embedded Linux OS .
Although a detailed data sheet is not available at this time , the user ’s manual ( PDF download ) can be found on Blockbuster ’s website .
Rear panel connections ( see list below )

In response to our request for details on the innards of the STB , 2 Wire sent the following summary list of specs :
Processor — Broadcom 7405 chipset ( described in two PDFs , here and here )
2 x USB
SD Cardslot ( not used in the Blockbuster release )
Networking — Ethernet and 802.11b/g WiFi
A/V ports — composite , component , HDMI , digital audio
Software platform — Linux
Bottom line
Although we plan to review the box in a future article , we ’re already skeptical of the growing number of single - service Internet - connected A/V entertainment boxes .
What we ’d really like to see is a reasonably - priced , open - platform STB that serves as an A/V gateway to multiple Internet - based services — one consumer - friendly , environmentally - designed , low - power gadget “ to rule them all , ” if you will .
On this one box , we ’d like to be able to gather : Netflix , based its the monthly subscription ; VOD content on a pay - to - play basis from Amazon , Blockbuster , etc ; free video from YouTube , Hulu , and various TV channels ’ websites ; and free Internet radio from Shoutcast - style sources .
Update ( 12/1/08 ) — Dave Zatz , over at ZatzNotFunny.com , has just published an article relating his experiences in unboxing and setting up the Blockbuster OnDemand STB .
“ The big surprise for me is that Blockbuster OnDemand is not purely a streaming service .
Video can be played back while streaming , without transport controls , and / or once the download has completed , ” says Dave .
A supernova explosion first seen from Earth 436 years ago has come back to life for astronomers in a time - travel - like astronomical twist .
By observing light from supernova SN 1572 that was slowed on its trip to Earth by dust particles , scientists can watch the outburst now as it would have looked originally .
When the explosion first appeared in the sky in 1572 , Danish astronomer Tycho
Brahe named it “ Stella Nova ” or “ New Star ” because it looked like an extremely bright star that had n’t been there before .
Astronomers today call it Tycho's supernova .
“ Tycho Brahe was closer to the supernova idea than others , ” said Oliver Krause of the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy in Germany , and co-author of the study which appears in Nature Thursday .
“ He immediately recognized that this was an extraordinary event .
He was really ahead of his time . ”
Radio waves from remnants of the gases emitted by Tycho 's supernova were first discovered in 1952 , and in 1960 , faint light was identified with an Earth - based telescope .
Today when scientists aim their telescopes at the same spot , they see the gas left over from the supernova
( shown in image above ) .
Krause 's team used a new method to watch the supernova explosion as it would have looked in 1572 .
They observed “ light echoes ” of the bang .
These rays of light coming from the supernova are only just reaching Earth now because they took the long way home , bouncing off dust particles in the interstellar medium on their way .
The team used this same method to study the origin of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A last year .
“ Usually these objects happen very distantly .
The only thing is the bright flash of the supernova and then it ’s gone , ” Krause said .
“ You cannot determine the progenitor , and you also cannot say what happens afterward .
Now the nice thing here is this explosion happened a long time ago , and now its supernova remnant is visible . ”
Using the
Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea , in Hawaii , the team took detailed measurements that revealed the chemical composition of the exploding star , and were able to determine that the supernova is of a class called “ Type 1a . ”
These events occur when mass from a larger star pours onto a smaller white dwarf star , and eventually tips the dwarf over its weight limit , causing the star to collapse in a powerful explosion .
When SN 1572
first occurred , it puzzled most sky watchers .
Many suggested that it was a comet , since those were the only other heavenly objects known to sometimes appear and disappear .
It was only until much later , in the early 20th century , that astronomers first understood that a supernova represents a star ’s death .

Exclusive to STR

According to Gerald Celente , you 'd better be .
Celente is the CEO of Trends Research Institute , who in mid-November made public his prediction that by 2012 , America will witness mass food riots , squatters rebellions by the homeless , tax rebellions by the economically strapped , and even pockets of armed resistance as economic conditions worsen .
It would be easy to dismiss Celente as just another gloom - and - doom wingnut ' were it not for his track record .
Since Celente began predicting trends in 1987 , his accuracy has been nearly occult ( and no , he is not a self - professed psychic , and does not equate 2012 with the Biblical Apocalypse or the end of the Mayan calendar , and has , to the best of my knowledge , never been on Coast to Coast AM ) .
He predicted the ' 87 stock market crash , the collapse of the Soviet Union , the 1997 Asian market collapse , the current economic meltdown ( calling it the ' Panic of 2008 ' ) , and scores of others ' all with amazing aplomb , right down to specific time frames .
He has also predicted that the U.S. dollar will lose 90 % of its value .
It 's enough to give the most hardened skeptic pause .
There 's more : Recently , Celente 's sentiments were echoed by Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical strategist for the beleaguered Citibank , who predicted in an internal memo that the current crisis could create , '. . . depression , civil disorder and possibly wars . '
It gets better .
Igor Panarin , a professor at the Academy of the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry , recently told Russia Today that he has long held the belief that America will not long survive in its present form , and that we are now witnessing the iceberg 's tip of that titanic collapse .
As well , a 2007 British Ministry of Defence report stated that , ' The world 's middle classes might unite , using access to knowledge , resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest , ' and that , ' The middle classes could become a revolutionary class . '
With the recent election of Obama , in spite of surging unemployment and recession , gun and ammunition sales now stand at all - time , record breaking highs .
Of course , one can rationalize that this is due to Obama 's long - standing fanatical anti-gun voting record , but can we decipher the handwriting on the wall that simplistically ?
Food for thought .
And speaking of food , America is no longer a strictly agrarian society .
The supermarkets generally have a two day supply when a panic occurs , and then the shelves go bare .
As it stands , farmers are already finding it difficult to get loans to continue operating .
And of course , we all now know about the five U.S. Army brigades , all combat - hardened in Iraq , who have been domestically deployed with little mainstream media fanfare .
That 's in addition to the 20,000 troops being sent to the American southwest , ostensibly for ' border patrol ' operations .
Then there are the KBR / Halliburton detention facilities recently constructed at various locations .
In my last STR essay , I outlined what I propose to do about the existence of government in general .
It fits just as well when preparing for a storm .
Your mileage may vary , depending .
I much prefer a peaceful revolution of the mind to one involving bullets and bombs and flame .
But this one 's not my call ' nor , in all likelihood , is it yours .
The next four years promise , at the very least , to be quite interesting .
I wish I could say that I could hardly stand the suspense , but it does n't appear as though it 's anything that promising .
I hope I 'm wrong .
I wonder if Obama really knows what he 's talking about when he keeps shouting ' Change ! ' like a mantra .
Drive safely , friends .
Wireless carriers , as a group , tend not to like " open access " mandates from regulators .
That 's why , when the FCC proposed adding a set of Google - backed open access rules to a chunk of its 700M Hz spectrum auction , Verizon promptly sued .
After failing to get an expedited hearing in the case , Verizon dropped the matter — but wireless industry trade group CTIA promptly picked it up again .
RCR
Wireless notes that the group has finally dropped the lawsuit , however .
The FCC 's stand on the open access issue will make it easier for regulators to insist upon such conditions in the future .
While Verizon and CTIA resisted the FCC mandate , they were n't necessarily against opening up wireless networks to more devices and applications .
It 's just , well , they would prefer to do so on their own terms .
Verizon announced its own open access program in late 2007 , before the auction ( where it eventually won the C Block in question ) got underway .
Other carriers have also pledged to be more open , and Sprint even launched a WiMAX unit pledging completely open access to all devices , applications , and content .
CTIA believes that wireless is a fully competitive market which needs no such government mandates .
The open access rules applied only to the 22MHz C Block up for auction , so it was n't as though the rules were industry - wide , or would even affect Verizon 's other spectrum holdings .
But they would set a precedent , and companies like Skype have been pressing the FCC to embrace full " wireless network neutrality " and extend similar rules to the entire wireless data market .
CTIA certainly does not want to see anything that dramatic happen .
Just before the first detailed briefs of the case were due , though , CTIA voluntarily dismissed the case on November 7 .
( Pity Council Tree Communications , Inc , which filed a 9,993 - word brief with the court the very next day ; wasted effort , it appears . )
The issue appears settled .
Without any word yet on how might run the FCC under an Obama administration , it 's too early to guess whether the agency might prove more sympathetic to Skype 's argument that wireless should n't be allowed to block , discriminate , and degrade any more than wireline networks .
Recent FCC approvals of deals between Verizon / Alltel and Clearwire / XOHM have shown that the agency is not indiscriminately throwing its open access rules around , as both were approved without such conditions .
Clearwire has pledged to voluntarily abide by similar rules , and Verizon has poured plenty of effort into openness , so perhaps the FCC thought it wise to simply let the market take its course this time .
In any event , when the agency does decide to write open access into its rules in the future , it will have precedent on its side .
So it 's here at last .
The dawn of the dumb has broken in earnest .
Two mistakes occur - first Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross overstep the mark with an ill - advised bit of juvenilia , then someone decides to broadcast it .
Two listeners complained , but that 's by the by : it should n't have gone out .
But then the Daily Mail - not so much a newspaper as an idiot 's guidebook issued in bite - size daily instalments - uses the incident as the starting point for a full - blown moral crusade .
Suddenly everyone 's complaining , whether they heard the broadcast or not , largely on the basis of hysterical , boggle - eyed descriptions of what the pair said .
Poor Andrew Sachs , who , having been wronged , graciously accepted their apologies and called for everybody to move on , looked bewildered by the sheer number of cameras stuck in his face .
Because , by then , apologies were n't enough .
The Mail was so incensed , it printed a full transcript of the answerphone prankery under the heading " Lest We Forget " - and helpfully included outtakes that were n't even broadcast , so its readers could be enraged by things no one had heard in the first place .
This was like making a point about the cruelty of fox - hunting by ripping a live fox apart with your bare hands , then poking a rabbit 's eye out with a pen for good measure .
And now , like a lion developing a taste for human flesh after munching on a bit of discarded leg , the paper is on the hunt for fresh victims .
First up : Brand 's Channel 4 comedy show Ponderland .
Readers were treated to a blow - by - blow account of what kind of depravity they could expect to see if they tuned in that evening .
" As his closing joke , he performs a graphic mime of sexual acts on a butterfly . "
Funniest .
Daily Mail sentence .
Ever .
Friday 's paper included a rundown of other " obscenities " broadcast by the Beeb , which the paper fearlessly " uncovered " by recording some TV shows and writing down some of the jokes .
To protect readers ' sensibilities , all the rude words were sprinkled with asterisks , although since the Mail 's definition of " rude " extends to biological terms such as " penis " , it was a bit like gazing at an ASCII representation of a snowstorm on a ZX Spectrum circa 1983 .
Perhaps next week it will produce a free sheet of asterisk stickers for readers to plaster over their own genitals , lest they catch sight of them in a mirror and indignantly vomit themselves into a coma .
One of the shows singled out was an episode of the romcom Love Soup transmitted in April that , the Mail insisted , depicted a woman being raped by a dog .
I did n't see the show myself , but I doubt you saw it going in or anything , because I do n't recall seeing Mark Thompson hanging from a lamppost while an angry mob kicked Television Centre to pieces .
Maybe we can " devolve " to that point in time for Christmas .
Still , if it 's OK to be retrospectively enraged , why stop at April ?
Be ambitious !
Keep going !
There 's an endless list of comedy shows that would qualify for the Mail 's hall of shame .
How about Monty Python , which in 1970 included a gloriously tasteless sketch about a man eating his mother 's corpse , then puking the remains into a grave ?
If Python had been banned , we 'd never have seen Fawlty Towers or heard of Andrew Sachs in the first place - problem solved .
Steptoe and Son , Till Death Us Do Part , Porridge , Not the Nine O'Clock News , The Young Ones , Have I Got News For You , Blackadder , The Day Today , Little Britain , The Thick of It ... by the Mail 's reckoning , each of those shows surely deserves a place on the list too .
Hundreds of hours of laughter you 'd never have had .
The sad , likely outcome of this pitiful gitstorm is an increase in BBC jumpiness .
I have a vested interest in this , of course , because I 've just started work on the next series of my BBC4 show Screen Wipe , on which we sometimes sail close to the wind .
In the past , the BBC has occasionally stepped in to nix the odd line that oversteps the mark - as it should do , when parameters are n't out of whack .
But when the Beeb 's under fire , those parameters can change .
Last year , following the " fakery " scandals , we recorded a trailer for the series in which I mocked a BBC4 ident featuring footage of seagulls , by fooling around with a plastic seagull on a stick and muttering about how you could n't trust anything on TV any more .
Pure Crackerjack .
But suddenly it could n't be transmitted , due to " the current climate " .
So God knows how restrictive things might get over the coming months .
And that 's just my basic , low - level gittery .
If something as sublime and revolutionary as Python came along today , the Mail would try to kill it stone dead , and it'd rope in thousands of angry old idiots to help , all of them bravely marching to the Ofcom website to register their disgust .
What a rush .
Feel that pipsqueak throb of empowerment coursing through your starched and joyless veins !
You 've crushed some fun , and it feels good to be alive !
Perhaps it 's time to put a " Complain to Ofcom " button right there on the remote control : if enough viewers press it , the show gets yanked immediately , like a bad variety act being pulled off stage by a shepherd 's crook .
Or maybe , just maybe , it 's time to establish " Counter - Complaints " : a method of registering your complaint about the number of knee - jerk complaints .
And one should cancel out the other - so if 25,000 people complain , and a further 25,000 counter - complain , the total number of complaints is zero .
It might lead to a lot of fruitless button - mashing , but at least we can keep our shared national culture relatively sane .
Because judging by the rest of the news , if the ship 's going down , a few unrestricted taste - free laughs now and then might make things more bearable for all of us .

SOUTH AUSTRALIA -
The Simpson Desert will be closed for the first time this summer because of the danger posed by extreme temperatures .
South Australia 's Department of Environment and Heritage today announced the annual December 1 to March 15 closure , saying a risk assessment showed temperatures of 40 to 50 degrees celsius were dangerous for people crossing the desert .
The closure will take effect in the Simpson Desert Conservation Park and Regional Reserve , covering an area of more than 3.6 million hectares .
Having trouble investing wisely in today ’s tumultuous market ?
The problem may be your brain .
Brad Klontz , a Hawaii - based psychologist who specializes in financial disorders , says that thanks to lessons we learned as cave dwellers , human beings are psychologically pre-programmed to deal irrationally with financial shocks .
We flee in the same direction as the rest of the tribe , because at some deep level we believe that if we do n’t , we ’re going to get trampled or eaten , he said .
And we ’re so emotional : 80 % of the gray matter in our brains is dedicated to dealing with feelings .
Just 20 % is analytical .
Advertisement
Under normal circumstances , the analytical mind directs the emotional mind , a balancing act he likened to a performer ( your analytical brain ) riding an elephant ( your emotional brain ) .
“ That works really well until the elephant gets scared , ” Klontz said .
“ At that point , the elephant is going to go wherever it wants . ”
So what should you do ?
Face your fear
Advertisement
The first problem people have when dealing with financial fears is their predisposition to react , said Rick Kahler , a fee - only financial planner and a coauthor of several books on the psychology of money .
When dealing with a fearful situation , humans typically respond with one of the three Fs -- fight , flight or freeze .
Often , they react before they even think about why .
Instead , Kahler said , you need to recognize that you find the situation frightening and wait at least 20 minutes before doing anything , he said .
Why ?
Your body floods your brain with chemicals when you ’re frightened , which makes it difficult for the analytical side of your mind to function .
You need to recognize that this chemical flood is making you overly emotional and let it recede before you react .

Is your fear rational ?
It ’s rational to be fearful about a falling stock market if you ’re going to need the money soon , or if you ’ve invested in companies that seem to be headed for bankruptcy .
But fear about a stock drop when only long - term money is in the market may not be rational .
That ’s because you may have enough time to let the market climb back .
If you have the resources to save more , or have the ability to create another contingency plan , you will be more likely to survive the storm .
One reason people worry about short - term drops is that it can be difficult to predict the cost of amorphous goals like retirement .
Still , you can make a stab at it by sitting down with a pencil and a pad and working through where your sources of retirement income ( or college income , if that ’s what the money is saved for ) will come from .
Advertisement
For instance , if you ’re estimating what you ’ll need for retirement , you need to consider whether you ’ll receive Social Security .
If so , how much ?
( Go to www.ssa.gov for an estimate if you ’re not sure . )
Are you entitled to a pension , which pays a set amount each month for life ?
If so , estimate the amount .
Now figure out roughly what you expect to spend in retirement .
If it ’s more than the amount you ’re likely to get from Social Security and pensions , you need savings to finance the gap .
That savings can come from the amount you already have invested , from amounts you save between now and then , and from equity you have in other assets , such as your home .
Advertisement
Assuming a conservative rate of return -- maybe 5 % -- from now until then , are you likely to have enough ?
If not , your worries are rational , and you will need to try to find another way to make do .
Investment reality check
When it comes to your individual investments , a similar reality check is in order .
Analyze the companies in which you hold stock to see whether they continue to be well - managed and whether their business models are still sound .
Advertisement
In today ’s environment of tight credit , you need to be particularly mindful about whether the companies you are investing in have sufficient cash flow to finance their operations without a lot of borrowing .
If they do n’t , they ’re far more susceptible to trouble than companies that are capable of generating more cash .
If you determine that the company stocks you own are still valuable , do n’t sell .
You may even want to buy more .
But if the analysis makes you question why you bought this loser in the first place , consider dumping the stock .
Avoid compulsiveness
There are a variety of compulsive behaviors that run rampant when people are under stress , Klontz said .
Compulsive spending , pathological gambling and compulsive drinking and fighting can all be brought on by a financial challenge .
Advertisement
Any one of those behaviors can worsen any real economic problem you might experience .
“ You have to find a healthy way to manage your stress , ” Klontz said .
Exercise and talk with friends , or even with a psychologist or medical doctor , if your stress feels out of control , he suggested .
Know your money script
Advertisement
Many people have subconscious scripts that they follow with money -- things that they learned from their parents or during childhood .
These scripts may cause them to sell everything once they ’ve suffered a set loss -- or get too aggressive when investing because they expect a vast win .
Klontz said his grandfather , who suffered through the Great Depression , kept all of his money in a safe in the attic ; his mother was also skittish of financial risks , so she invested overly conservatively , he said .
He saw that growing up and decided that being conservative was a huge mistake -- so he decided to do just the opposite .
He invested virtually all of his assets in tech stocks right before the bubble burst in 2000 , he said .
That personal experience is what got him interested in financial psychology .
Once you make those unconscious money scripts conscious , you can address whether they ’re reasonable , he added .
If you have trouble doing it alone , hire a financial planner , he suggested .
“ What ’s going on in the stock market is probably not a threat to our lives , ” Klontz said .
“ But we react like we ’re in the jungle , being chased by a saber - toothed tiger .
Making financial decisions in that state is very destructive . ”

It 's not clear who to thank , Sony , Activision , or Harmonix , but a great thing has happened .
Hidden in the patch that fixes compatibility in the downloadable PAX pack for Rock Band is a great feature that has been missing from the PS3 since launch : your Guitar Hero controllers will now work with Rock Band on the PS3 .
The 360 controllers , pictured above , have played nice since launch .
Gamers will be happy to have their PS3 version finally catch up .
This confirmation comes from Matt , an OT reader , who sent me the following note .
Well , last night , they put out an update for Rock Band , I guess , and it fixed the songs .
But even better , my GH3 guitar now works !
I 'm pretty stoked .. just finished playing through a song with my housemate on two guitars for the first time ever on my PS3 .
Sony has claimed that it was working on a fix to all the conflicting plastic instruments , and it 's awesome to see something finally come of it .
This was a rumored feature of this latest patch for a while now , so we 're happy to hear the games are now compatible .

A couple of days ago I posted a 60 Minutes segment that shows how illegal e-waste recycling work , with Colorado - based Executive Recycling ( ER ) as exhibit A. ER has since posted two responses to the 60 Minutes piece on their website , but later removed the first .
Thanks to the miracle of Google ’s cache system ( and some concerned readers who have emailed us over the last few days ) , I have posted below the link to the cached page , released originally on November 14 , the day after the 60 Minutes piece ran , and the text contained therein .
E.R. Response to 60 Minutes Report November 2008 Executive Recycling is a respected and law abiding business that recycles computers and electronic parts in a responsible and lawful way .
Our company has reviewed the recent report of the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) and the 60 Minutes story on E - Waste and we agree on the dangers of unregulated disposal of electronic and computer waste .
Executive Recycling is well aware of every applicable environmental and export standard and has complied throughout its history with such laws , rules and regulations .
Our company takes in tons of computer and electronic products and disposes of them responsibly .
Many such items are refurbished and resold .
Executive Recycling would not sell anything to any purchaser if it had knowledge that said buyer planned to break the law .
However , no business can be responsible for the subsequent improper actions of others who lawfully purchase products from them and hide their intentions to engage in misconduct .
Sadly , Executive Recycling appears now to be the victim of others who have obtained electronic and computer products from our company and then acted irresponsibly .
These buyers apparently sought to hide their own misconduct by leaving the impression that their shipment was the responsibility of our company .
We have discovered that forged documents ( provided by the port authorities ) were used to improperly shift blame to us when ER sold the tested working units to a Canadian wholesale buyer .
We are currently seeking legal actions against this one wholesale buyer in regards to this report .
Executive Recycling urges the Environmental Protection Agency and the government of the United States and other civilized societies to prepare and enact further laws and regulations to make sure that no individuals or environments are damaged through irresponsible disposal of computer or electronic products .
Executive Recycling has cooperated with the Environmental Protection Agency in the past and will continue to do so in an effort to see that humans and the environment are protected .
( Source , for however long Google will keep it cached )
It is my suspicion that this was likely removed on the recommendation of ER ’s lawyers , but in this day and age of distributed caching of websites , simply removing the post from your own does n’t actually remove much .
Yesterday , ER released two emails on their site as a further followup to the 60 Minutes piece .
I ’ve reproduced those emails below as well , in case ER chooses to take down this press release as well :

Yes we saw the 60 minutes segment .
We were surprised they did not delve into who actually arranged the shipment of the container .
They did not contact us which is surprising as we were named on the B/L as the notify party .
BC
Ltd have simply ceased operations and its principals are untraceable .
Attached is the booking confirmation sent to Karen Zhang .
According to our records we had no communications with Executive Recycling prior to the container being loaded .
As such we would not have been in a position to advise you that the container was destined for Hong Kong .
I hope this assists ,

Tere , I wanted to find out if there was anything you could send me on email that shows Executive Recycling did not order the transportation for this booking .
Not sure if you saw the 60 minutes segment on E - waste but they tracked this container from Karen Zhang into Hong Kong , and they are saying that we exported this material to Hong Kong without giving proper notification to the Honk Kong government .
I ’m trying to provide the media , and businesses with information that will clear our name from doing this export .
Any help you can provide on this would be great .
Thank you , Brandon Richter
S&R received leaked copies of these emails but were unable to verify that they were accurate at the time and so chose not to release them publicly .
These emails are proof of neither guilt nor innocence on the part of Executive Recycling .
The emails are circumstantial evidence at best and are almost certainly an attempt by ER ’s public relations department to partially mitigate the legal and PR nightmare that the 60 Minutes piece has certainly become for them .
ER ’s best hope in this situation is probably to ride it out and assist the EPA ’s investigation , as well as any other investigations into illegal dumping that appears to implicate them , as much as possible .
The only thing that will clean up their public image is a finding that they are not , in fact , responsible for the shipping container mentioned in 60 Minutes , or any other containers either .
If ER is found not to have broken any laws , I will certainly report so on this website , just as I will report it if they ’re brought up on charges as a result of any ongoing investigations .
Thank you to the multiple individuals who have kept me up to date on developments in this story .

Northern Rocky Mountains gray wolf
Washington Post , October 25 , 2008 New Debate on Wolf's ' Endangered ' Label
Government Will Try Again to Take Northern Rockies Species Off Protected List
By Joel Achenbach , Washington
Post staff writer
The Bush administration is trying again to take the gray wolf of the northern Rockies off the federal endangered species list .
Having lost in court this summer in a legal battle with conservationists , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has decided to reopen for public comment its 2007 proposal to delist the wolves .
" The position of the service is , we think the wolves no longer need the protection of the Endangered Species Act .
We 're asking the public to weigh in to that , " Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife , said in an interview yesterday .
Wolf advocates immediately protested .
" This is the Bush administration 's last - gasp attempt to remove protections for wolves , " said Louisa Wilcox , a senior wildlife advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Livingston , Mont .
" It looks like they 're launching an all - out run to ram the same flawed package back through , " said Jamie Rappaport Clark , executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife and a director of Fish and Wildlife during the second Clinton administration .
Bangs said the government will open a comment period on Tuesday , lasting until Nov. 28 .
After that , officials could swiftly decide to remove federal protections for the wolves in much of the northern Rockies and turn management of the species over to the states .
The Endangered Species
Act provides that , once a species has recovered , states take control of its management .
The previous attempt to delist the wolves led a coalition of conservation organizations to file suit in federal court .
In July , U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy ruled in their favor , issuing an injunction that put the wolves back under federal protection pending a final resolution of the suit .
In his lengthy opinion , Molloy said Wyoming 's wolf - management plan -- which would allow the predators to be shot on sight in 88 percent of the state -- would put the wolf population there in jeopardy .
Molloy wrote that the federal government 's decision to sign off on the Wyoming plan was " arbitrary and capricious . "
He also said there has not been genetic exchange between isolated subpopulations of wolves , something important for the species 's long - term survival .
Fish and Wildlife withdrew its proposal , and now the agency is trying again .
" We 're particularly interested in comments related to the court action , " Bangs said .
One possibility , he said , is that the wolves could be delisted everywhere but Wyoming .
Bangs , who is not a political appointee , said , " We 'll take whatever time we need to do a good science - based decision . "
" We usually do n't promise litigation , but I think in this instance , if they propose the same old , tired rule , we 'll be left with no choice but to litigate , " said Jenny Harbine , a lawyer with Earthjustice , a plaintiff in the earlier lawsuit .

The worst record in NFL history , a dubious distinction that will permanently stain everyone involved .
The Lions lost to the Green Bay Packers 31 - 21 on Sunday , making them the first team to go winless through a 16 - game season .
The 1976 expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers ( 0 - 14 ) were the last NFL team to complete a season without a victory .
" I 've got to live with this , " center Dominic Raiola said .
" I 've been here eight years .
This is on my resume . "
It 's also on the resume of Lions coach Rod Marinelli , who faces an uncertain future .
" No competitor wants to go through something like this , " Marinelli said .
" This is not fun to go through , obviously .
But there 's people going through a lot worse than this . "
Asked if he was glad it was over , the coach said " no . I could go another 16 . "
Marinelli told reporters that he expected to have a routine Monday -- watch film of Sunday 's game , meet with the team and then with owner William Clay Ford Sr. later in the day .
Marinelli has gone 10 - 38 in three seasons .
His future has not been announced , but Ford has decided the leaders of the front office , Martin Mayhew and Tom Lewand , will be back in some capacity .
The Lions ' last loss did n't come without a fight .
After falling behind 24 - 14 midway through the fourth quarter , Kevin Smith 's 9 - yard touchdown run put Detroit back within a field goal .
But Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers responded with a 71 - yard touchdown pass to Donald Driver and the Lions ' Dan Orlovsky threw an interception on fourth - and - 27 with 3 minutes left , dooming Detroit to futility of historic proportion .
" It 's just kind of numb , " veteran kicker Jason Hanson said .
" It 's here .
It 's been coming , though , a train rolling down the tracks for a while .
We tried to stop it .
We could n't . "
The Lions were building toward this for years and now have lost 23 of their last 24 games .
The 0 - 16 record will be a lasting testimony to the Matt Millen era .
With Millen as president of the team from 2001 until he was fired on Sept. 24 , Detroit won only 31 games -- none this year , of course .
It 's so bad that some Lions can't remember the last time they won .
" I do n't ever want to be a part of this again , " Orlovsky said .
" We have n't won since , November of ' 07 , maybe ?
I do n't even know the last time we won a game . "
The Lions have n't won since Dec. 23 , 2007 , actually , when they beat Kansas City .
Green Bay is where this woeful streak began at the end of last season .
Since then , the Lions have lost 17 straight and have been outscored 551- 281 .
Orlovsky was 22 - of - 42 for 225 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions for the Lions , whose bid to steer clear of the record book came undone in large part because of ill - advised penalties .
A proposal by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative for a new power plant in central Virginia has local environmental activists up in arms .
An environmental coalition that includes the Sierra Club and Chesapeake Climate Action Network is strongly opposed to the $ 6 billion plant , saying they are extremely concerned and are pledging “ all - out war ” against the plans.[social_buttons ]
“ At a time when a majority of Virginians believe that action is required on climate change we have Old Dominion Electric Cooperative ignoring both public opinion and climate science to propose a massive new coal plant .
It ’s not just about climate change ; as a resident of Wise County I see the devastation of mountaintop removal coal mining every day .
We ’ve lost 29 mountains already . ” – Kathy Selvage , Southern Appalachian Mountain Stewards
ODEC ’s announcement is in sharp contrast with a survey released in October by the Miller Center of Public Affairs and University of Virginia which found that 72 % of Virginians believe immediate action is needed to address global warming .
The Governor ’s Climate Commission report is also soon to be released , which calls for reducing the state ’s total carbon emissions 80 % by 2050 .
So why more coal plants ?
Well , the power company seems to think that coal is clean :
“ Coal is a stable , reliable source of generation , and it seemed the most economical thing to do .
With all of the new technology out there , this is going to be the cleanest coal plant anywhere in the United States — it ’s two generations beyond many of the plants out there . ” – Jeb Hockman , ODEC spokesman
According to Glen Besa , Sierra Club - Virginia , “ Utilities in Virginia seem to be in denial about global warming . ”
“ In the face of an economic recession and mounting threats from climate change , the prospect of introducing an unnecessary $ 6 billion coal plant is outrageous .
ODEC ’s proposal is extremely concerning and out of touch . ” – Tom Cormons , Campaign Coordinator with Appalachian Voices
The power plant , named Cypress Creek Power Station , is planned for 1,600 acres in Surry County Virginia , but is only in preliminary stages and will still require permits before construction can begin .
Appalachian coal would be the main source of fuel to produce up to 1,500 megawatts of electricity , with only about 3 % of the fuel coming from timber wastes , or biomass .
The Surry site was picked because of its access to existing electrical transmission lines , a water supply , and rail transportation for the coal .
ODEC target for the plant is to be operating by 2016 .

But the anger of waiting motorists grew more visible this afternoon when the BP station , rapidly running out of fuel , raised its price to $ 1.39 a litre .
" We 're just trying to be competitive , " said one of the staff .
" We 're a family orientated business and we 're just trying to survive . "
He said the business could n't continue to take so much money out of its own pockets , it needed to remain competitive and $ 1.39 was still a competitive price .
Earlier , the station 's manager said : " We are a small business in this area and the [ big ] companies are fighting small businesses out of the market .
" We are trying to survive ... this is our voice ; let people hear about it . "
United , also on Sunnyholt Road , dropped its price to 94.9 cents a litre this morning , but called off the protest this afternoon and stopped selling when it almost ran out of fuel .
A delivery is expected soon .
Police were trying to control traffic flow but said it was close to gridlock .
Carl Partridge , 21 , was given leave by his boss to go and fill up quickly while the price was still below $ 1 .
But 2 ½ hours later he was still in the queue and the price had gone up 40 cents a litre .
" I 'm pretty pissed off , " he said .
" They should n't be allowed to do it .
They put it down to 99 cents .
They should do it for the rest of the day , not just for whenever they feel like it ... it 's unfair . "
He said he had seen at least six verbal fights in the queue .
" It 's not a pretty sight , " he said .
Navneet Kaur , also 21 , lined up for more than an hour .
She joined the queue when prices were 94 cents , but as she neared the front they had reached more than $ 1.39 .
She saved about $ 6 on a tank that would usually have cost her $ 70 .
" I was so angry , it was ridiculous ... it was n't worth the wait . "
Ron Bowden , chief executive of the Service Station Association , encouraged the small stations to challenge the big companies .
" The number of service stations are declining and that 's principally because of the encroachment of big business , particularly from supermarkets , " he said .
" The supermarkets have changed the whole nature of the industry and have led to a lot of closures and will lead to more closures in the future .
" If this is an exercise in trying to publicise the plight of the small independents then good on them because they need all the help they can get . "
Mr Bowden said it was unlikely the stations could have continued their statement for very long because they were subsidising the price by more than 40 cents a litre .
" The longer they do and the more the message gets out , the more motorists can take the benefits , " he said .
Petrol prices are 30 cents a litre higher than they were this time last year , Woolworths chief executive Michael Luscombe said .
Mr Luscombe said today his petrol stations had used the price rise to grab market share from rivals in the past three months , luring motorists with a 4 cents a litre discount if they spend $ 30 in stores as part of the shopper docket scheme .
While sales of petrol across all station operators were down 5 per cent by volume in the past three months - compared with the same period a year ago - Woolworths has increased its sales ( by volume ) by 2 per cent .
The company has sold $ 1.7 billion worth of fuel in the past three months at more than 522 of its petrol stations , he said .
Last financial year Woolworths sold $ 5.6 billion worth of fuel .

How many times have you spent hours slaving over an impossible problem , only to take a break and then easily solve the problem , sometimes within minutes of looking at it again ?
Although this is actually a common phenomenon , up until now the way that this occurs has been unclear .
But new research in the September issue of Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , demonstrates the answer is more complex than simply having an " Aha ! " moment .
The new research , led in part by Kellogg School of Management Professor Adam Galinsky , suggests that unconscious thought results in creative problem - solving via a two - step process .
According to Galinsky and fellow psychologists Chen - Bo Zhong from the University of Toronto and Ap Dijkstererhuis of Radboud University Nijmegen , distractions may be helpful in coming up with creative solutions to a certain problem , but must be followed by a period of conscious thought to ensure that we are aware of those solutions and can apply them .
Likewise , while distractions are more useful in solving difficult problems , it may be better to stay focused on finding the solution when confronted with easier problems .
The researchers conducted two experiments to test their idea .
In the first experiment , 94 subjects participated in a Remote - Association Test ( RAT ) , which tests for creativity .
In this test , participants were presented with three words ( a triad ) and were asked to come up with a fourth word that is linked with all three words .
For example , if presented with the words cheese , sky and ocean , the correct answer would be blue ( blue cheese , blue sky , blue ocean ) .
Subjects were shown nine very difficult triads ( but were instructed not to solve them yet ) and were then divided into groups .
For five minutes following the RAT , participants were either concentrating on the triads they had just seen ( the conscious thought group ) or engaging in a test completely unrelated to the RAT ( the unconscious thought group ) .
Following the five - minute interval , all of the subjects participated in a lexical decision test .
During this test , subjects were shown sequences of letters and had to indicate as quickly as possible if the sequences were English words or not .
The sequences presented included answers to the RAT triads , random words and non-words .
Finally , subjects were again shown the RAT items and had to write down their answers .
The second experiment involved 36 subjects and had a similar set up to the previous experiment , although the RAT triads presented were much easier to solve compared to those in the first experiment .
The results showed that in the first experiment , during the lexical decision test , members of the unconscious thought group had much faster responses to letter sequences which were answers to RAT items , compared to the conscious thought group .
However , when it came time to solve the RAT problems , both groups had similar results .
In the second experiment ( using an easier set of RAT triads ) , the conscious thought group had more correct RAT answers compared to the unconscious thought group , but there was no difference in response time during the lexical decision test .
" Conscious thought is better at making linear , analytic decisions , but unconscious thought is especially effective at solving complex problems , " said Galinsky and his co-authors .
" Unconscious activation may provide inspirational sparks underlying the ' Aha ! ' moment that eventually leads to important discoveries . "

NEW YORK , Dec. 20 ( UPI ) -- Caroline Kennedy , now seeking Hillary Clinton 's New York Senate seat , said through a spokesman Saturday she supports gay marriage .
Kennedy 's staff responded to eight questions on her views submitted by Politico .
She refused to answer one , whether she would support the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York in 2009 over the independent incumbent , Michael Bloomberg .

The 51 - year - old daughter of assassinated President John F. Kennedy has generally stayed out of the limelight for most of her adult life and only recently reverted to using her family name instead of her husband 's , Schlossberg .
She became involved in the presidential campaign , joining her uncle , Sen. Edward Kennedy , to back Barack Obama .
Kennedy gave vague or non-committal answers to some of Politico 's questions .
Asked about how to deal with the financial crisis , she said only that she looks forward to developing legislation to protect investors .
But she was unequivocal on her support of " full equality and marriage rights " for homosexuals .
On marriage , she broke with Obama , who opposes amending the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriage but also opposes legalizing those marriages .
A preliminary study suggests that economic incentives appear to be effective for achieving short - term weight loss , according to a report in the December 10 issue of JAMA .
" In 2004 , 71 percent of U.S. adults were overweight or obese according to standard definitions , and at present obesity falls just behind smoking as a preventable cause of premature death , " the authors provide as background information .
" Although many variables contribute to the increase in obesity prevalence in the United States , behavioral economics has identified several patterns of behavior that help explain why people engage in self - destructive behavior , including the tendency to put disproportionate emphasis on immediate gratifications , such as the pleasure of eating , relative to the much smaller emphasis put on delayed benefits , such as enjoying good health . "
The author suggest " new strategies are needed to help reduce the rate of obesity in the U.S. population . "
Kevin G. Volpp , M.D. , Ph.D. , from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Wharton School , VA Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion , Philadelphia , and colleagues , designed two incentive - based approaches for losing weight .
One was a lottery - based group in which the participants played a lottery and received the earnings if they achieved or lost more than the target weight and the other was a deposit contract condition in which the participants invested their own money , which they lost if they failed to achieve weight goals .
Fifty - seven participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a weight - monitoring program involving monthly weigh - ins , or the same program with one of the two financial incentive plans ( deposit contract or lottery ) .
All participants had a goal weight loss of 16 - pounds over 16 weeks .
" The incentive groups lost significantly more weight than the control group ( mean [ average ] 3.9 pounds ) , " the authors report .
" Compared with the control group , the lottery group lost a mean of 13.1 pounds and the deposit contract group lost a mean of 14.0 pounds .
About half of those in both incentive groups met the 16 - pound target weight loss : 47.4 percent in the deposit contract group and 52.6 percent in the lottery group , whereas 10.5 percent in the control group met the 16 - pound target . "
As for the incentives : " Over the course of the 16 - week study , the average amount of money earned in weight loss incentives was $ 378.49 in the deposit contract condition and $ 272.80 in the lottery condition . "
The authors note that the study participants in both of the incentive groups gained weight between the end of the weight loss incentive intervention and the end of 7 months , but still weighed less at 7 months than they did at the start of the study .
" In conclusion , incentive approaches based on behavioral economic concepts appear to be highly effective in inducing initial weight loss .
However , this weight loss was not fully sustained and further work is needed to test the effectiveness and cost - effectiveness of these approaches in achieving sustained weight loss , " the authors write .

Sarah Palin : Stop Blocking Efforts to Protect Polar Bears
by : Defenders of Wildlife
recipient : Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
Polar bears are starving to death , birthing fewer cubs and drowning as sea ice disappears and their search for food becomes more difficult .
Scientists at the U.S. Geologic
Survey say that polar bears could disappear from Alaska within 50 years , driven to extinction by habitat loss and global warming .
Our polar bears are threatened with extinction , yet Governor Sarah Palin has launched an all - out effort to eliminate protections for threatened polar bears – a move that could lead to more polar bears dying of starvation and drowning , and more being killed by wealthy trophy hunters .
As governor , Sarah Palin has been a disaster for polar bears , wolves and other wildlife .
A heartbeat away from the presidency , she could do even worse .
It 's time for Sarah Palin to own up to the science and stop catering to Big Oil .
Please sign our petition telling Governor Palin to protect polar bears .

As someone who is gravely concerned about the future of America 's struggling polar bears , I strongly urge you to stop obstructing vital protections for polar bears .
The U.S. Geological Survey predicts that loss of summer sea ice -- crucial habitat for polar bears -- could lead to the demise of two - thirds of the world 's polar bears by mid-century , including all of Alaska 's polar bears .
The Bush administration has proposed listing the polar bears as threatened under the ESA to help protect polar bear habitat from threats such as oil and gas development .
Nonetheless , you have actively opposed the listing of the polar bear despite the fact that Alaska 's top marine mammal biologists agreed with the federal scientists who believed the bear should be listed .
You wrote to the Secretary of Interior urging him not to list the bear on the ground it might hurt the state 's oil - and gas - dependent economy .
After the bear was listed , you filed suit seeking to overturn the listing of polar bears .
Scientists predict that polar bears could disappear entirely from Alaska in the next 50 years .
Oil companies that want to drill in polar bear habitat can wait , but our vanishing polar bears cannot .
I strongly urge you to listen to the scientists at the U.S.G.S. and your own top marine mammal biologists , and stop obstructing efforts to protect polar bears from extinction .

また事件起きた。もういいから事件とか。要らんから。
今朝普通に仕事してたらプライベートのケータイに着信あったんですよ。ケータイ持って早11年ですけど、着信とかマジないからね、普通。しかも真っ昼間に着信なんてあるわけない。もうこの時点で身構えますよ。
楽 「もしもし、こちら、テラヤマアニ様のケータイでよろしかったでしょうか」
俺 「( よろしかったでしょうかじゃねえよコノヤロウ ) …… はい、テラヤマですけど 」
楽「 あ、私、楽天KCのナカムラと申します」
俺 「はあ …… 」
楽 「突然のお電話申し訳ございません。カードのご利用状況について二三、ご質問させていただきたいのですが、ええと、昨日ですね、12月7日に、ヴィーナスフォートにて楽天カードをご利用になりましたでしょうか」
俺 「はあ？ ヴィーナスフォート？ ってお台場の？ いやいやいや使ってないですよ。つか昨日家から一歩も出てませんもん。もう俺みたいな低属性のネットゾンビ風情は日曜日あたりは家でパソコン三昧と相場が決まってますもん。つか基本楽天カードは持ち歩きませんからね。今現在ETCでしか使ってないです。なんかあったんですか？」
楽 「はい、昨日ですね、テラヤマ様の楽天カードのご利用履歴があるのですが、不正利用の疑いがあったため、電話で確認させていただいております」
俺 「( わくわくわくわくわく ) ( ｷﾗｷﾗｷﾗｷﾗｷﾗ ) 」
楽 「ええと、昨日、お台場のビーナスフォートでご利用のカード決済が通らなかったのですが、2回目に7万円のご利用となっております。お心当たりはございますか？」
俺 「いやいやいや、お心当たりは全くありません。家から出てませんもん」
楽 「さようでございますか。当方でも不正利用の疑いが濃厚ということで、既にカードはご利用停止とさせていただいております。テラヤマ様の直近の海外利用は7月ということでよろしかったでしょうか？」
俺 「は？ ああ、7月はハワイで1回だけ楽天カード使いましたね。あと、ああ、8月に韓国行きましたけど、その時はえっと…、あ、使ってないですね。あとは2月にもハワイ行ったけど、その時も使ってない……。うん、7月のハワイだけです。。それ以外はネット利用とETCだけで、店頭での利用は一切ありません」
楽 「さようでございますか。差し支えなければ、ハワイでのご利用店をお教えいただけますでしょうか」
俺 「アラモアナショッピングセンターのニーマンマーカスっていうデパートですけど。靴売場。って、ええ！？
ニーマンマーカスでスキミングされたんですか？」
楽 「いえ、加盟店様での可能性はわかりかねます。こういった場合、第三者が加盟店様の端末にスキミングマシンを設置する場合が多いですから」
俺 「はあ 」
楽 「いずれにせよ、今回は不正利用ということで、テラヤマ様に請求がいくことはございませんのでご安心ください。また、誠に申し訳ございませんが、新規のカード番号で再発行とさせていただくことになります。テラヤマ様は公共料金のお支払い等を楽天カードになさっていますでしょうか」
俺 「いえ、楽天カードでは公共料金払ってません」
楽 「さようでございますか。それでは少しお時間をいただくことになりますが、改めて新規カード番号にて再発行手続を行いますので、今暫くお待ちいただけますでしょうか」
俺 「 はい、了解しました 」
楽 「 ご迷惑おかけいたします 」
みたいなね。なんぞこれ。やー、テレビで「クレジットカードの不正使用が云々」みたいなニュースはさんざっぱら見て知ってましたけど、いざ自分の身にふりかかると、怖いっていうか、逆にテンションあがるな！！
ごっさわくわくするな！ つかね、今回俺はカード不正利用の犯罪者に、勝ったんですよ。完勝。ざまあ。
まずですね、ここ注目。 「 ええと、昨日、お台場のヴィーナスフォートでご利用のカード決済が通らなかったのですが、2回目に7万円のご利用となっております。」
最近俺が陸マイラー道にいそしんでいることは何度かご報告いたしましたけど、その一環として、「無駄なカード与信枠の減額」ということをやってたんですよ。陸マイラーをやってると、「どうしてもこのカードで決済したい」っていう場面が多くなるんですね。で、メインカードの与信枠を増やすには、その他のカードの与信枠が逆に足枷になるので、減額するのがいいのです。俺の楽天カードは当初ショッピング枠で100万の与信があったんですけど、全然必要ないのでつい2ヶ月ほど前に10万円に減額してたんです。これがピリッと効いた。
不正利用の犯罪者野郎はお台場ヴィーナスフォートで、偽造カードを使って恐らく高額商品を買おうとしたんだと思います。だけど俺が限度額を10万に減額していたためにオーソリが通らなかった。それで慌てて「あ、やっぱこれはいいわ。この7万のやつだけ買います」とかふざけたことを言って、再度カードをオーソリ処理したんだと思われるのです。
これはいかにも怪しい。この怪しさにすぐ気付いた楽天KCも偉い。というかそういうのを検知するプログラムが偉い。厳密に言うと7万の決済を認めてしまった時点で楽天KCの負けですけど。
仮に俺が、アホ面さげ てS枠100万のまま放置していたら、限度額いっぱいまで犯罪者野郎に使われていた可能性があるのです。これを俺は未然に防いだね。俺自身は使われたところで何の損害もないけど、楽天KCの損害を最少に抑えてあげてやったね。クソ犯罪者涙目。あと言っとくけど、加盟店（買物で使われた店舗）にも何も損害はないからね。それはきっちりカード発行会社からお金もらえるから。
現時点ではどうやって俺のカード情報が偽造されたのかはまったくわかりませんけども(ネット経由でやられた可能性だってある)、楽天KCの危惧していたとおりアラモアナSCのニーマンマーカスがスキミングの舞台だったとすると、もう何を信じたらいいのか……。ニーマンマーカスっつったら、向こうじゃ相当名の知れた高級デパートですよ。日本で言ったら新宿伊勢丹でブランドモノ買ったらスキミングされた、みたいな話ですよ。ちょっと違うかもしんないけど。そこらの怪しい飲み屋とかじゃないですからね。あとついでに言うと、ニーマンマーカスみたいな高級デパートで楽天カード出すのはすごい恥ずかしい。銀座和光でアイマスカード決済するくらい恥ずかしい。
で、皆さんもこれを機会にクレジットカード利用限度枠の見直しをおすすめします。カード裏に書いてある番号に電話すれば、ものの1分で限度額は減額できますから。ただ、一点だけ注意。カードってずっと使ってるとどんどん限度額があがっていくものですけど、1度でも減額すると、普通その後は自動的にはあがらなくなっちゃいます。極端に減額するといざ必要ってときに困っちゃうので、自分の利用状況や今後の事も考えて、ちょうどいい額まで減額しておくといいと思います。
それともうひとつ、普段からネットで利用明細ガン見すること。おかしな明細があがってきたら即デスクに連絡。これ基本。
マジ今回ためになる。しびい。

In recent years , the possible applications for double - walled carbon nanotubes have excited scientists and engineers , particularly those working on developing renewable energy technologies .
These tiny tubes , just two carbon atoms thick , are thin enough to be transparent , yet can still conduct electricity .
This combination makes them well - suited for advanced solar panels , sensors and a host of other applications .
Up until now , the problem with double - walled carbon nanotubes has been being able to produce a homogeneous supply of them .
When double - walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized , the process also creates many of the single - and multi- walled variety .
Given their small size , sorting the valuable double - walled tubes from the other types has posed a real challenge .
In a paper published today in the online edition of the journal Nature Nanotechnology , two researchers from Northwestern University outline a new process for efficiently gathering up these coveted double - walled carbon nanotubes .

Norwich Council are cracking down on hair salons
Norwich council has written to all 104 hairdressing salons in the city telling them they need a licence to serve alcohol .
The letter warns that officers will be snooping on salons to make sure none breaks the law .
Jason Taylor , owner of two salons , said : “ It ’s just a token tipple . ”
But the council said : “ This is about enforcing the law . ”
More on Malcolm Gladwell 's Outliers : The Story of Success
When I was in my early teens I secretly stayed up very late one night to watch The Fountainhead simply because I was a Gary Cooper fan .
At that point in my life I had not heard of Ayn Rand and found the movie laughably silly .
For those who do n't know the story , Howard Roark is an architect hired to design " Cortlandt Homes " , a huge housing project .
Long story short : when the financiers motivated by budgetary concerns start " cutting corners " in Roark 's opinion , he uses dynamite to blow up the half - finished project .
Never - mind anyone else .
The investors did n't count .
The workers who relied on the project for their paychecks did n't count .
The businesses supplying construction materials did n't count .
Ditto for the families planning on moving there after completion .
Nothing mattered but Roark 's huge adolescent ego .
I was about 12 or 13 and completely appalled by his behavior .
Atlas Shrugged is a similar story .
In it a group of scientists and tycoons decide in equally petulant fashion that they will " simply take their ball and go home " , when society refuses to capitulate to their capricious demands .
So what happens ?
Well , according to Ayn Rand everything in the world grinds to a halt .
In her bizarre world view , no replacements are available amongst the rest of humanity to rise up to the occasion and take over from the cry -babies who have gone home in a snit .
So , here 's some food for thought based on Gladwell 's latest book , Outliers : The Story of Success .
Do successful men and women grow up in a vacuum before unleashing their greatness upon the world ?
In other words , was Ayn Rand correct about the great not owing anything to society as a whole for their individual success ?
Think Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead .
Or are the so - called " greats " products of their society and the opportunities afforded to them by it ?
Here 's Gladwell 's thinking on how hockey stars emerge over time :
Consider , for instance , those hockey stars .
Relying on the work of a Canadian psychologist who noticed that a disproportionate number of elite hockey players in his country were born in the first half of the year , Gladwell explains what academics call the relative - age effect , by which an initial advantage attributable to age gets turned into a more profound advantage over time .
Because Canada ’s eligibility cutoff for junior hockey is January 1 , Gladwell writes , “ a boy who turns 10 on January 2 , then , could be playing alongside someone who does n’t turn 10 until the end of the year . ”
You can guess at that age , when the differences in physical maturity are so great , which one of those kids is going to make the league all - star team .
Once on that all - star team , the January 2 kid starts practicing more , getting better coaching , and playing against tougher competition — so much so that by the time he ’s , say , 14 , he ’s not just older than the kid with the December 30 birthday , he ’s better .
The solution ?
Double the number of junior hockey leagues — some for kids born in the first half of the year , others for kids born in the second half .
Or , to apply the principle to something a bit more consequential ( to non-Canadians , at least ) , Gladwell suggests that elementary and middle schools put students with January through April birthdays in one class , the May through August birthdays in another , and those with September through December in a third , in order “ to level the playing field for those who — through no fault of their own — have been dealt a big disadvantage . ”
Then there 's the question of why so many Asian students excel at mathematics :
And then there are the math geniuses who , as anyone ca n’t help noticing , are disproportionately Asian .
Citing the work of an educational researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , Gladwell attributes this phenomenon not to some innate mathematical ability that Asians possess but to the fact that children in Asian countries are willing to work longer and harder than their Western counterparts .
That willingness , Gladwell continues , is due to a cultural legacy of hard work that stems from the cultivation of rice .
Turning to a historian who studies ancient Chinese peasant proverbs , Gladwell marvels at what Chinese rice farmers used to tell one another : “ No one who can rise before dawn 360 days a year fails to make his family rich . ”
Here are a few more highlights from Gladwell :
In Outliers , Malcolm Gladwell posits alternative theories for how successful people got to where they are .
Bill Gates
As a kid growing up in Seattle in the late sixties and seventies , Gates had extensive access to a state - of - the - art computer lab , the likes of which very few in his generation would know anything about until years later .
The Beatles
In the early years , when they took up residency in the clubs of Hamburg , Germany , they had to play very long sets , in a wide variety of styles , forcing them to be creative and excel at experimenting .
Chinese Students
They work much harder at their studies and exhibit greater patience in problem - solving than their American counterparts thanks to their cultural legacy of long days toiling in rice paddies .
Youth Hockey Players
Kids born in the early months of a year are put in the same league as kids born later in the year , a slight edge in physical maturity that gets compounded over the years into a decisive advantage in skill .
So the question is then :
Are the successful truly independent of the society within which they grew up or do they owe their success , at least in part , to the benefits , attitudes , and advantages it bestowed upon them ?
Read the entire article , Why Success Is More Circumstantial Than Personal .
Who is right ?
Malcolm Gladwell or Ayn Rand ?
Dec. 1 , 2008 --
Even if you never touch a salt shaker and steer clear of potato chips and french fries , you are probably eating more salt than you think and much more than is good for you , an investigation from Consumer Reports shows .
Researchers analyzed 37 processed foods and identified some surprising sources of hidden sodium .
Among the least expected findings :
A 1/2 - cup serving of a low - fat cottage cheese had twice as much sodium ( 360 milligrams ) as a 1 - ounce serving of regular potato chips ( 180 milligrams ) .
A Premium Caesar Salad with grilled chicken from McDonald 's had more than twice the salt ( 890 milligrams ) as a large order of McDonald 's fries ( 350 milligrams ) .
And that 's without the dressing .
A half - cup serving of Prego 's Heart Smart Traditional Italian Sauce had 430 milligrams of sodium , slightly less than what the USDA allows per serving in foods labeled " healthy . "
Breakfast foods were an unexpected source of hidden salt .
A popular whole - grain bagel had 440 milligrams of sodium , a best - selling pancake mix had 200 milligrams per pancake , and raisin - bran cereals had between 230 milligrams and 350 milligrams per cup serving .
A maple and brown sugar - flavored instant oatmeal had more than three times as much sodium as its original flavored version .
" One of the big surprises is that foods that you would think would be really salty , like salted nuts , have less sodium than many processed or packaged foods that do n't taste salty at all , " Consumer Reports Associate Health Editor Jamie Hirsh tells WebMD .
Have you ever wondered how a woman 's brain works ?
Well .... it's finally explained here in one , easy - to - understand illustration :
Every one of those little blue balls is a thought about something that needs to be done , a decision or a problem that needs to be solved .
A man has only 2 balls and they take up all his thoughts .
( This came from a friend via e-mail )
The president - elect , no - drama Barack Obama , is expected to name his new secretary of State , all - drama Hillary Clinton , as early as tomorrow as part of the week 's rollout for his national security team .
But can he ?
As pointed out by a number of bloggers in recent hours , including our eloquent friend Susan over at Wake Up America , there 's a clause in the U.S. Constitution ( Article One , Section Six ) that prohibits senators ( or representatives ) from taking a civil office if the legislator has voted to increase the pay for that job .
" No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time ; and no Person holding any Office under the United States , shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office . "
A president - elect who 's a former part - time constitutional law professor , even one without his BlackBerry , presumably is aware of this prohibition , obviously designed to prevent double - dipping and raising your own salary , which is only allowed in Wall Street banks .
And Obama surely knows of its historical precedents .
And if Obama makes the appointment of his former bitter rival , she 'll no doubt take office as the point person for U.S. foreign policy .
But the appointment of the loser of the Democratic presidential nomination by the winner of that nomination and of the subsequent general election would n't be properly Clintonian without some extra dramatic flourishes .
This is likely only the beginning of such chapters .
Apparently , President Nixon ran into the same problem when he wanted to appoint Ohio's Republican Sen. William Saxbe as attorney general .
The solution back then , since dubbed the " Saxbe fix , " was for Congress to pass another law ( not without some outspoken dissent from Democratic senators , by the way ) reducing the AG 's pay so Saxbe would n't benefit financially from the higher salary he 'd previously voted on .
Similar fixes occurred when President Jimmy Carter named Edmund Muskie secretary of State and H. Clinton 's own husband Bill named Lloyd Bentsen to head Treasury .
So much for the actual money aspect and strict construction .
We 're not lawyers .
But we do speak English .
And to our eyes that constitutional clause does n't say anything about getting around the provision by reducing or not benefiting from the increase of said " Emoluments . "
It flat - out prohibits taking the civil office if the pay has been increased during the would - be appointee 's elected term .
Period .
Which it has .
This seems more like a TV scriptwriter 's trick to keep everyone hanging around through the commercials starting tomorrow .

ALMERE , Netherlands ( Reuters ) - Almost a fifth of Amsterdam ’s popular marijuana - selling coffee shops will be closed down because they are too close to schools , the city council said Friday .
Joints containing different types of cannabis are seen in their jars at a coffee shop in the southern Dutch city of Bergen op Zoom November 18 , 2008 .

Of the 228 coffee shops in the Dutch capital , 43 must close by the end of 2011 because they are within 250 meters of a school , the council said .
The Dutch coffee shop policy has come under fresh criticism after the Dutch cities of Bergen op Zoom and Roosendaal , located near the Belgian border , said they will close all their shops within two years to combat drug tourism and crime .
Amsterdam , home to a quarter of the nation ’s cannabis coffee shops that are a big draw for tourists , joined with 32 other Dutch mayors or city council representatives Friday to back a continuation of the Dutch “ soft drugs ” policy of toleration .
But the mayors also called for better rules on the sale and trade of cannabis .
They stressed that while a ban on marijuana use was not a solution to the problem , the use of the drug should be discouraged .
The policy on soft drugs in the Netherlands , one of the most liberal in Europe , allows for the sale of marijuana at coffee shops , which the Dutch have allowed to operate for decades , and possession of less than 5 grams ( 0.18 oz ) .
But the cultivation or supply of the drug to the coffee shops , the so - called “ back door ” of the business , is banned .
Annemarie Jorritsma , Almere Mayor , said mayors agreed to push for a system of “ heavily regulated toleration . ”
“ Make it transparent who is dealing , who is delivering it to the coffee shops and take care that there are no criminals entering there , which they are at the moment , ” she said .
Gerd Leers , Mayor of Maastricht which earlier angered Belgian authorities by proposing to move its city center coffee shops to the edge of the city , said 60 percent of the people who visit the city ’s coffee shops each year are French or Belgian .
He added that the problem is not the fact the Netherlands has coffee shops , the problem is that other countries do n’t .
Arjam Roskam , a spokesman for the Cannabis Retailers Association which represents 100 members , said the proposals from the mayors were a step in the right direction .
The government will finalize next year an evaluation of its soft and hard drugs policy and a Justice Ministry spokesman said the proposals from the mayors may be taken into consideration .
Ulteo Adds Open Virtual Desktop to Browser App Repertoire
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 20 , 2008

Ulteo is an interesting company .
Started by former MandrakeSoft developer Gael Duval , the company aims to make using your computer easier , regardless of whether you 're using your computer .
The company focuses on the development and delivery of open source web applications and storage .
They offer applications such as the Virtual Desktop Beta , which runs a Linux environment over a Windows installation , allowing users to switch easily between the two , the Ulteo Online Desktop , which allows users access to a remote desktop and applications such as OpenOffice 3 , and its full distribution the Ulteo Application System .
Having used a few of these products , some are hits ( the Windows Virtual Desktop is really sleek ) and others ( the Application System ) still need significant work .
Today Ulteo announced another application , the Open Virtual Desktop .
In terms of name and usage , the Open Virtual Desktop would appear pretty similar to the Ulteo Online Desktop , which delivers a number of open source applications through a browser .
The twist with the Open Virtual Desktop release is that instead of existing in Ulteo 's server environment and under Ulteo 's control , this software can be installed on a company 's server , customized to the company 's needs , and integrated with Active Directory / LDAP so that employees can access their online desktops from anywhere .
There is n't any client software required .
Ulteo is very subtle when it says in the Open Virtual Desktop FAQ that the product is a migration tool .
It 's a great option for companies wanting to try out open source software , those that require a mixed operating system environment , or want to take their existing open source system and make it a little more mobile .
The server requirements seem reasonable ( two computers are required , one for session management and one for application delivery -- and though Ubuntu is recommended , there are installation instructions available for other distributions ) .
Ulteo might have found its bit of open source heaven here .
The company offers support and training , as well as collaboration with customers and contributors on developing new features .
If it can make the most of the " migration tool " angle , it may very well be positioned to be the first real point of open source vendor contact for businesses looking to make the change .
Being first to the market is n't everything -- delivering services well is always key -- but Ulteo 's developers have some impressive credentials .

According to Physorg.com , a researcher in France has increased the efficiency of micro-sized direct methanol fuel cells to 75 - percent .
This further paves the way for fuel cells to replace lithium ion batteries in some mobile electronics : I would totally buy a fuel cell powered iPhone !
Fuel cells are seemingly attractive in comparison to lithium ion batteries because of their high energy potential : around sixteen times more energy than lithium ion batteries .
This increase was achieved by injecting a macroporous layer into the silicon - based microfuel cell .
It resulted in fuel cells operating at room temperature with a power density of 385 watt - hours per liter .
Lithium ion batteries typically have a power density of 270 Wh/ L .
Oh snap !
Current tech requires an operating temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or higher for fuel cells to actually produce power .
Obviously , fuel cells must operate at room temperature before they can be adopted by the consumer market .
In the first study , the fuel cells achieved a power density of 4.3 milliwatts per square centimeter using 1.38 microliters per minute of fuel .
But it was the second study that added the macromorphous layer .
And it paid off .
The density reached 9.25 mW /cm2 when using 550 nanoliters of fuel per minute .
Adding fuel boosted power density to 12.7 mW / cm2 but lowered efficiency to 20 percent .
This breakthrough eliminates the need for things like pumps which use fuel to run .
But despite this accomplishment , Steve Arscott at the Institute of Electronics , Microelectronics and Nanotechnology in France says many challenges still remain :
“ The biggest challenges facing micro fuel cells are : ( i ) high - performance room - temperature operation , ( ii ) miniaturization for on - chip use , ( iii ) compatibility with existing system fabrication ( CMOS , for example ) , ( iv ) avoidance of complicated pumps for fuel and air which use energy themselves , ( v ) use of an efficient silicon - based proton exchange membrane and diffusion layers ( novel porous layers for example ) , ( vi ) full integration with a microchannel architecture and also ( vii ) fuel storage , ” he told PhysOrg.com .
“ On the latter point , obviously the more fuel efficient the cell , the less fuel needs to be stored for a given working period . ”
“ One thing is sure , ” he added .
“ Like everyone , I think that energy is about to become very important and , as Mark Twain ( of who I ’m a big fan ) said , ‘ What is a government without energy ?
And what is a man without energy ?
Nothing , nothing at all … ’ ”

The web site you seek
Lies beyond our perception
But others await .
Sites you are seeking
From your path they are fleeing
Their winter has come .
A truth found , be told
You are far from the fold , Go
Come back yet again .
Wind catches lily
Scatt'ring petals to the wind :
Your site is not found .
These three are certain :
Death , taxes , and site not found .
You , victim of one .
Ephemeral site .
I am the Blue Screen of Death .
No one hears your screams .
Aborted effort :
The site , passed this veil of tears .
You ask way too much .
Mourning and sorrow
404 not with us now
Lost to paradise .
Not a pretty sight
When the web dies screaming loud
The site is not found .
Site slips through fingers
Pulse pounding hard and frantic
Vanishing like mist .
The dream is shattered
The web site cannot be found
Inside the spring rain .
Bartender yells loud
Your site cannot be found , boy
Buy another drink .
Chrome megaphone barks
It 's not possible to talk
Not yet anyway .
Emptyness of soul
Forever aching blackness :
" Blah.com not found . "
Click exciting link
Gossamer threads hold you back
404 not found .
With searching comes loss
And the presence of absence :
The site is not found .
You step in the stream ,
But the water has moved on
The site is not here .
Rather than a beep
Or a rude error message ,
These words : ' Site not found . '
Something you entered
Transcended parameters .
The site is unknown .
Stay the patient course
Of little worth is your ire
The server is down
There is a chasm
Of carbon and silicon
The server can't bridge .
Chaos reigns within .
Reflect , repent , and retry .
Server shall return .
Wo n't you please observe
A brief moment of silence
For the dead server ?
First snow , then silence .
This expensive server dies
So beautifully .
Seeing my great fault
Through darkening dead servers
I begin again .
Visit the home page
It can't be done easily
When the site is down .
Cables have been cut
Southwest of Northeast somewhere
We are not amused .
Site is silent , yes
No voices can be heard now
The cows roll their eyes .
Silicon shudders
The site is down for the count
One big knockout punch .
Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
The web is like that .
The ten thousand things
How long do any persist ?
The file , not there .
A file that big ?
It might be very useful
But now it is gone .
To have no errors
Would be life without meaning
No struggle , no joy
Errors have occurred .
We wo n't tell you where or why .
Lazy programmers .
The code was willing
It considered your request ,
But the chips were weak .
Error reduces
Your expensive computer
To a simple stone .
Server 's poor response
Not quick enough for browser .
Timed out , plum blossom .
WASHINGTON --
The federal government sent Detroit packing last week , saying the Big Three auto makers had to establish their financial viability before any bailout , but it moved quickly over the weekend to give Citigroup Inc. $ 20 billion and promised as much as $ 275 billion more .
On Monday , President - elect Barack Obama offered his own rebuke of the auto makers ' stuck - in - the - mud approach to restructuring .
" Taxpayers can't be expected to pony up more money for an auto industry that has been resistant to change , " Mr. Obama said at a news conference in Chicago .
" And I was surprised that they did not have a better - thought - out proposal when they arrived in Congress .... I think that the auto industry needs to present us with some clarity in terms of the dollar figures that they 're talking about . "
When it comes to getting a federal bailout , Detroit , which is seeking $ 25 billion , has let its problems grow for so long that fixing them has become a monumental task , as evidenced by the chilly reception the auto executives of General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC got when they came calling last week .
Mr. Obama has sought creative ways of fixing the auto makers ' financial problems and helping them change their product lines to address climate change , practically since he arrived in Washington four years ago .
Have you ever looked at your patterns of eating when sitting down to a nice hearty buffet of food ?
A study shows that there is a big difference in the behavior of people concerning Chinese buffets .
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the eating behaviors of people at all - you - can - eat Chinese buffets differs depending upon their body mass .
Researchers studied 213 normal weight and obese diners at 11 all - you - can - eat Chinese buffets .
They found that overweight people sat 16 feet closer to the buffet , and also sat facing the food .
They also used larger plates and ate with forks instead of chopsticks .
Instead of casually browsing the buffet to make a choice in what they wanted , many started eating immediately .
All of these were factors that caused them to overeat .
" What 's crazy is that these people are generally unaware of what they 're doing - they 're unaware of sitting closer , facing the food , chewing less , and so on , " says lead author Brian Wansink , director of Cornell University 's Food and Brand Lab .
Researchers found that 27 % of normal weight diners faced the buffet while eating , whereas 42 % of obese diners did .
Overweight diners sat about 16 feet closer to the buffet than normal weight diners .
Sitting at a booth rather than a table was more common for normal weight diners - 38 % vs. 16 % - as was browsing the buffet before serving ( 71 % to 33 % ) .
Finally , the authors looked at utensil use and found that 24 % of normal - weight people used chopsticks , but only 9 % of overweight people did .
It also said that normal weight people were more likely to have a napkin on their lap .
The study was conducted by Cornell University 's Food and Brand Lab and published in the journal Obesity .
I 'll have to check out my eating patterns the next time I go to a Chinese buffet .
I already know that I do n't use chopsticks because it takes too long to eat with them .
I wonder if this study was done in restaurants where the waitress sat the patrons or if they seated themselves ?

The well - preserved family was buried near three other graves containing the skeletons of nine people in a Stone Age cemetery near Eulau in Germany .
The mother was 35 to 50 years old and was laid to rest according to custom , on her left side , with her head pointing to the east .
Her male partner , aged 40 to 60 , was also in a traditional position .
The two boys , aged about four and eight , should also have lain like their father .
But " it appears that the burial orientation pattern was overruled for each boy to face a parent to express a biological relationship " , Dr Haak , whose study is published in the Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences , said .
The 13 people were all participants in a prehistoric tragedy .
One woman had a stone arrowhead embedded in her spine .
Others had fractured skulls , including the family 's eight - year - old , and some had injuries on their arms and hands where they had tried to defend themselves from blows .
This suggested they were victims of a sudden , fierce raid , the researchers said .
" The injury patterns point to a violent event which most probably resulted in the death of all 13 individuals . "
Survivors had obviously had an intimate knowledge of the victims ' relationships from the careful way they had buried the slain .
One of the graves contained a woman , two children and a baby .
DNA testing showed the children were probably brother and sister , but the woman was not their mother .
And this was reflected in the pair 's burial position near her , but not facing her .
Studies of strontium in the people 's teeth also revealed the women in the group had grown up elsewhere , while the men and children were from the local area .
The men and boys were buried with stone axes and the women and girls with animal tooth pendants and flint tools .
Brown urged to keep hacker in UK
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been urged to halt the extradition to the US of computer hacker Gary McKinnon .
Mr McKinnon , from Wood Green , north London , faces up to 70 years in prison if found guilty in the US of breaking into military computers .
Supporters held a vigil and delivered a letter to Downing Street calling for him to be tried in the UK instead .
Campaigners said the fact that Mr McKinnon has Asperger 's Syndrome should be taken into account .
Decision due Glasgow - born Mr McKinnon trespassed on networks owned by Nasa , the US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Department of Defense in 2001 and 2002 .
Despite taking his appeal to the House of Lords last year , he lost a six - year legal battle to avoid extradition .
The European Court of Human Rights also declined to back Mr McKinnon 's case against extradition .
A decision on his proposed extradition is expected at a High Court hearing on 20 January .
Gary is terrified , he 's in pieces - the whole situation is heartbreaking , it 's gone on for so long
Janis Sharp , Gary McKinnon 's mother Supporters held a candlelit protest outside the US Embassy on Friday .
Mr McKinnon 's mother Janis Sharp said : " Gary is terrified , he 's in pieces .
The whole situation is heartbreaking , it 's gone on for so long . "
She added : " I think the US was embarrassed because Gary came out and said there were no passwords and no firewalls . "
The US military said that Mr McKinnon left 300 computers at a US Navy weapons station unusable immediately after the 11 September 2001 attacks .
Mr McKinnon claims he was looking for UFO files .
Nadine Stavonina -de Montagnac , co-founder of the Autistic Culture Movement and Free Gary campaign spokeswoman , said this kind of obsessive behaviour was characteristic of people with Asperger's .
She said : " His obsession was so strong , he could n't fight it .
Even now Gary does n't know what he 's done wrong . "
She added : " He is such a vulnerable man and I 'm relying on Gordon Brown to help him . "

Yale disclosed Tuesday that its endowment had fallen at least 13.4 percent in the four months since June as the decline in asset values during the financial crisis takes its toll on another university .
Richard C. Levin ,
Yale ’s president , said in a letter to the university ’s faculty and staff that the endowment totaled about $ 17 billion , and he warned that Yale could be facing a $ 100 million shortfall in the 2009 school year .
He said the value of Yale ’s marketable securities had declined 13.4 percent for the first four months of the university ’s fiscal year , which started July 1 , and that it had since fallen even more .
Taking into account such illiquid assets as real estate and private equity , he said , the endowment , which is led by David Swensen , was down 25 percent , and Yale is now anticipating it will be down that much for its full fiscal year .
That figure is significantly better than Harvard ’s endowment , which recently said that the value of its $ 36.9 billion endowment had fallen 22 percent during the same period and that the total decline for the full fiscal year is expected to be as much as 30 percent .
Microsoft is now spending $ 300 million to counter Apple 's " I'm a Mac " ads .
Does Linux need its own ad campaign ?
It has been fascinating to see Microsoft roll out its ( can you believe it !! )
$ 300 million ad campaign , the one that counters the now famous and effective “ I ’m a Mac ” ads .
With those ads , the Apple folks have done a great job of defining a narrative for Microsoft and , in the parlance of advertising , affecting their brand image .
The top dog at Microsoft for managing the brand image of Windows said “ [ Apple has ] made a caricature out of the PC . ”
Given the stakes in the marketplace , Microsoft had little choice but to invest a ton of resources and get their own message out into the public realm .
You see the same dynamic in the political realm , too .
It takes a ton of money just to get the most basic message distributed to the public – thus far the presidential candidates have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they will likely top a billion dollars by the end of the campaign .
The third - party candidates may certainly have interesting messages , but without the money , they ’re dead in the water .
Given all of this tossing of hundreds of millions of dollars by Microsoft and Apple , what does this mean for the fate of our dear Linux operating system ?
Can we grow and gain market share without multiple $ 300 million ad campaigns ?
It ’s an interesting question .
While individual companies such as IBM , HP , Red Had and Novell have all done their share of marketing and advertising to promote their Linux - powered wares , most of it has been targeted at the corporate user .
These efforts have done much to polish Linux ’s image as a stable , powerful and reliable option for the enterprise .
Unfortunately none of these companies is in a position to drive adoption on the desktop .
It just is n’t their main focus .
Meanwhile , the Mandrivas , Canonical - Ubuntus and Linspires of the world – the companies who are more desktop focused – simply do n’t have $ 300 million to throw around , even as a group .
In addition , the Linux Foundation does n’t currently see big ad campaigns as part of its mission .
Linux is simply too decentralized and does n’t have the same profit motive behind it .
It has been interesting to see attempts to combat this decentralization , however .
Perhaps the most interesting one I 've seen was when a group of Linux enthusiasts attempted to get a Linux penguin onto a race car at the Indy 500 .
They solicited donations and did OK but fell short of the goal .
While fun and interesting , the failure adequately illustrates Linux ’s weakness when it comes to promotional opportunities .
But is it a weakness ?
Perhaps with every Linux provider doing their own thing with a focus on guerilla tactics is sufficient to keep it growing and clawing desktop market share away from Windows .
Look how far we ’ve come in such a short time , and we are growing , though slowly .
We simply have to be patient and accept the fact that Linux wo n’t rival Windows on the desktop ( i.e. in market share ) for a very long time .
Plus , we also have the advantage of a more sympathetic press .
Admittedly , mainstream journalists often do n’t know what to do with Linux due to ignorance and are often too quick to categorize it as for geeks only .
Nevertheless , Linux ’s ethos characterized by sharing , volunteerism and merit will always draw warm feelings from journalists .
We just need them to be more informed so that they can write about us more effectively .
That task is probably more important than a big ad campaign .
Finally , people are simply curious about Linux , and we need to focus on satisfying that curiosity through an informed press corps .
So , now that I ’ve done my brain dump , I feel better and I am more sure of something .
“ I ’m Linux .
And I do n’t need your stinkin’ $ 300 million ad campaigns . ”

Faint magnetic signals from brain activity in children with autism show that those children process sound and language differently from non-autistic children .
Identifying and classifying these brain response patterns may allow researchers to more accurately diagnose autism and possibly aid in developing more effective treatments for the developmental disorder .
Timing appears to be crucial .
" Children with autism respond a fraction of a second more slowly than healthy children to vowel sounds and tones , " said study leader Timothy Roberts , Ph.D. , vice chair of radiology research and holder of the Oberkircher Family Endowed Chair in Pediatric Radiology at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
Roberts used a technology called magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , which detects magnetic fields in the brain , just as electroencephalography ( EEG ) detects electrical fields .
Roberts presented his findings today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago .
" The brain 's electrical signals generate tiny magnetic fields , which change with each sensation , and with communication among different locations in the brain , " he added .
Roberts is working to develop " neural signatures " that can link recorded brain activity to particular behaviors in children with autistic spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) , which are characterized by impaired development in communications and social functioning .
" Our hypothesis is that speech and other sounds come in too fast for children with ASDs , and their difficulties in processing sound may impair their language and communication skills , " said Roberts .
Physicians already use MEG to map the locations of abnormal brain activity in epilepsy , but the technology Roberts used is one of the few MEG machines available in a dedicated pediatric facility .
In the current study , the researchers evaluated 64 children aged six to 15 at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
Thirty children had ASDs , the rest were age - matched , typically developing control subjects .
The MEG machine has a helmet that surrounds the child 's head .
The researchers presented a series of recorded beeps , vowels and sentences .
As the child 's brain responded to each sound , noninvasive magnetic detectors in the machine analyzed the brain 's changing magnetic fields .
When sounds were presented , the MEG recorded a delay of 20 milliseconds ( 1/50 of a second ) in the brain 's response for children with ASDs , when compared with healthy control subjects .
" This delay indicates that auditory processing is abnormal in children with autism , and may lead to a cascade of delay and overload in further processing of sound and speech , " said Roberts .
" Further research may shed light on how this delay in processing sounds may be related to interconnections among parts of the brain . "
Other testing , measuring a response to mismatched or changed sounds , found longer delays , up to 50 milliseconds ( 1/20 of a second ) .
Because autism disorders range across a spectrum of functional abilities , explained Roberts , neural signatures based on brain responses may allow clinicians to more accurately diagnose which subtype of ASD an individual patient has .
Such diagnoses may be possible at an earlier age if future studies show that such signatures are detectable in infancy — at younger ages than in the children involved in the current study .
" Earlier diagnosis of ASDs may allow clinicians to intervene earlier with possible treatments , " said Roberts .
Furthermore , added Roberts , if a patient 's neural signature overlaps with that found in another neurological condition , such as epilepsy or attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , for which a treatment exists , that patient may benefit from such a treatment .

Isabel Taylor , now a junior governor Running a prison is one of the toughest jobs going .
Traditionally governors have worked up through the ranks , but now graduates are fast - tracked into senior roles to broaden the profile of the Prison Service .
Aged 26 , and standing not much more than five feet tall , Isabel Taylor defies the stereotype of the distinctly male prison governor .
It 's a job she has wanted since she was 11 , and in 2005 she joined the Prison Service 's intensive development scheme , a fast - track course for would - be governors .
She is now a junior governor at Her Majesty 's Prison Leeds , a Category B men 's prison , as deputy head of offender management .
Here , she reflects on key moments from the past three years .
SEPTEMBER 2005
Three day introduction to intensive development scheme I 've had a letter from my prison saying I 've got to be there at nine o'clock on Monday morning .
It 's going to be a major shock , coming straight out of university .
FIND OUT MORE ... Young Governors
Take Control is broadcast on Radio 4 on Monday , 8 and 15 December at 1100 GMT
Or catch up later on the BBC iPlayer There 's a whole new language to learn , not just acronyms , but also things that happen inside the prisons that I do n't know about .
I 've never been faced with a group of prisoners before so I 'm a bit nervous about that .
But I 've always wanted to work in the prison service .
I started looking into it when I was 11 .
Everyone always asks : " What do you want to do that for ? "
But it 's only from the top down can you help the most amount of people , so I 've got to get to the top to do that .
MID - SEPTEMBER 2005
First week in prison - Holme House in Stockton on Tees
There 's been a violent incident in another part of the prison and some of the prisoners are moved onto my unit .
Are you old enough to do this job Miss ?
Until I 've had a bit more training I think I 'd better hang back as they are still quite aggressive .
All the prisoners are asking me how old I am because obviously I do n't look my age : " Are you old enough to do this job Miss ? "
I just laugh and try not to give too much away about myself .
OCTOBER 2005 Training in how to control and restrain a violent prisoner I hate this .
It 's horrible : tiring , hot , sweaty and smelly .
The riot helmet is the worst bit because it's so restrictive - you can hardly see or hear .
It 's also physically exhausting because you 've got all this gear on and it 's quite heavy and you 're trying to move at speed .
If the weapon slips or your hold on the shield slips , and they 're about to come crashing down on you with a weapon , anything could happen .
Your skull could be fractured .
It 's all gone through my head .
It 's just really scary .
I 've definitely had second , third and 24th thoughts about the job .
NOVEMBER 2005 Holme House Prison - first weeks as a qualified prison officer I went home and was in tears all last week .
I just think about the things I should have done better .
It 's a career largely dominated by men
Two nights last week I had to ring up and check I 'd not forgotten to do certain things .
I said to my partner : " I 'm rubbish at this job " .
All I get all day is abuse and I think : " What am I doing ? "
But I 'm trying to look at the big picture and see that in a few years it will be worth it , because I 'll be doing what I really , really want to do .
SPRING 2006 Holme House - six months into the job I was counting prisoners and I signed for how many I had , but it turned out one of them had put a dummy in the bed .
It was n't an escape attempt ; the guy was trying to steal money and he'd hidden during the lunch period but he got found .
There 's been an investigation .
I feel so ashamed and now I 'm obsessive that doors are locked behind me and I double check that I 'm getting a response from prisoners .
Everybody was waiting for the graduate to make a mistake and then I did .
It 's awful .
NOVEMBER 2006 Deerbolt Young Offenders Institute I 've been promoted to senior officer at Deerbolt .
It 's really hard walking onto the wing and saying : " I 'm the boss now " when I 'd only been in the job for nine months .
I have visions of my face splashed all over the Sun , with headlines saying : ' Young Governor gave prisoner licence to go out and rob old ladies '
But I 'm really enjoying it and the staff have been brilliant .
I 've learned a lot about being a manager and how to treat people .
One of the most difficult things I 've had to do is tell someone who 's been here for five years that their performance is n't good enough .
They did n't take it particularly well either .
Combating staff resistance has been difficult and it's made me want to give in .
But I 've persevered and encouraged them to just try my ideas .
And it 's worked .
There 's been one or two occasions where I 've been quite stubborn and not really listened to people around me with more experience .
That 's been the hardest lesson to learn .
OCTOBER 2007 Leeds Prison
I 've had to conduct my first ROTL - Release on Temporary Licence - Board , assessing whether a prisoner will go out for a day or two and then come back into the prison .
I 've been looking at my watch constantly , thinking : " Oh , please let him come back " .
Thankfully he has , but it's a scary responsibility .
I have these visions of my face splashed all over the Sun newspaper , with headlines saying : " Young Governor gave prisoner licence to go out and rob old ladies " .
My face is perfect for that because I look so young and it would look like they had this YTS person making really important decisions .
JUNE 2008 Graduation Day I can't believe how fast it 's come .
Graduating from the fast - track scheme
It stuns me that I 'm a governor .
It 's a bit scary because I was doing my staff development with my line manager the other day , and he was asking what I wanted to do next .
I did n't know .
I 've spent the past 14 years focusing on getting to this point .
Now I 'm here , I 've got quite a lot of years left on my career .
I 've got to decide what to do with the rest of my life .
DECEMBER 2008
What I 've learned since I started is do n't try and hide what you are .
Everywhere I 've gone I 've been really up front and said : " Here I am .
I 've only been in the job five minutes and I do n't really know what I 'm doing so you 're going to have to help me " .
And so far it seems to have endeared people to me .
I 've also learned people just do not take responsibility for their actions .
It 's made me more cynical about the way the world works .
I 'm not taking anything away from people who 've had hard lives , but that does n't necessarily lead to a life of crime .
I thought the prisoners would be so much more grateful for everything I did .
It 's really frustrating .
They never say thank you .

Perhaps the most reviled pointing device ever , the TrackPoint was invented by IBM for use in its line of ThinkPad notebooks .
It had the advantage of being compact , requiring far less space than a touchpad .
With a little practice , it was also a reasonably efficient and ergonomic controller .
On the downside , many people found it difficult to use , it was useless for anything that required finesse ( like drawing applications ) , and it just plain felt weird .
As a result , the TrackPoint collected a wide range of nicknames , of which we 'll list just a few of the more printable ones : cat 's tongue , nub , nubby mouse , pointing stick , stick mouse , stupid little red pointer , nipple mouse .
If you 'll recall , Tsukuba University professor Yoshiyuki Sankai designed a robotic suit called HAL - 5 a few years ago .
Production of this handicap - overcomer began back in 2006 , and as promised , manufacturer Cyberdyne ( not to be confused with Cyberdyne Systems , best known for its genocidal Skynet AI and army of Terminator robots ) is finally ready to crank it out in large numbers .
Starting this Friday , HAL will be available for rent in Japan at the modest rate of $ 2,200 per month .
Sankai hopes it will prove useful to the elderly and folks with disabilities by providing super - strength mechanical assistance when they send brain signals to move their limbs .
HAL may be used for good but it wo n't be used for awesome ; Sankai has turned down military - types who 've expressed interest .

A recent Microsoft patent application dating back to July 2007 has shed light on what the company describes as a type of pay - to - play computing .
Although the specifics of the approved application are somewhat different from the ad- supported " free " PC business models of the late 1990s and early 2000s , a consideration of the merits of the patent identifies many of the same potential problems .
The patent abstract describes
a computer with scalable performance level components and selectable software and service options has a user interface
that allows individual performance levels to be selected ...
Software and services may include word processing , email , browsing ,
database access , etc .
To support a pay - per-use business model , each selectable item may have a cost associated with it , allowing a
user to pay for the services actually selected and that presumably correspond to the task or tasks being performed .
An administrator
may use a similar user interface to set performance levels for each computer in a network , allowing performance and cost to be set
according to a user 's requirements .
We 've seen pay - as - you - go systems before , particularly from certain big iron vendors , but Microsoft 's would - be nickel - and - dime system may run into many of the same snags that affected the " free PC " business .
Skip back ten years , and the idea of handing over a no - cost PC system was an idea that drew considerable interest from press and consumers alike .
The concept worked as follows : instead of paying a large up - front cost , customers would sign a two - year ISP agreement at a rate of , say , $ 24.95 per month .
In exchange for the system , lucky owners agreed to watch advertisements , receive special offers , or turn over their browsing histories .
The terms varied , but at a time when users were rushing to get online and computers were still in the $ 700 - $ 800 range , this was one heck of a deal — on paper .
In reality , the model proved unsustainable .
The PCs in question were often slow , carried minimal amounts of RAM , and ISP service could be extremely spotty .
As hungry as the US was for Internet access back then , the limitations and requirements of the systems turned off a number of potential buyers .
Microsoft 's patent application description accurately describes certain problems that can make the PC buying process non-optimal , but the proposed solution is unattractive for a number of reasons .
The problem , according to Redmond , is that consumers and businesses are forced to buy systems that can match their maximum potential performance needs , even if day - to - day usage requires only a fraction of that potential power .
Similarly , expensive software packages , while necessary , may only be used intermittently or at certain times of the year .
The company 's goal is to provide an alternate solution to the inherent inefficiency of buying a system based on occasional need .
As the patent puts it :
A computer may have individually metered hardware and software components that a user can select and activate based on current need .
Beyond simple activation , the user may be able to select a level of performance related to processor , memory , graphics power , etc. that is driven not by a lifetime maximum requirement , but rather by the need of the moment .
When the need is browsing , a low level of performance may be used and when network - based interactive gaming is the need of the moment , the highest available performance may be made available to the user .
Microsoft presents the following example of how such a system might be priced .
" The Office bundle may be $ 1.00 per hour , the Gaming bundle may be $ 1.25 per hour , and the Browsing bundle may be $ 0.80 per hour .
Alternatively , a bundle may incur a one - time charge that is operable until changed or for a fixed usage period .
Other pricing techniques are apparent . "
The rest of the patent is devoted to describing the various ways in which fees could be implemented , adjusted , and metered .
Redmond admits that the final cost of PC ownership could end up being higher than that of a one - time purchase , but notes that " the payments can be deferred and the user can extend the useful life of the computer beyond that of the one - time purchase machine . "
Limited utility ?
Maybe I 'm just too old - fashioned , but if there 's an upside to this , it seems quite limited .
This type of approach to computer billing might theoretically allow a company to directly tailor system capabilities to user needs , but it does so by requiring a huge amount of additional logistical complexity .
Any company wanting to adopt this sort of system would first have to conduct what amounts to a desk - by - desk survey of exactly what company employees do and how they do it .
Usage models must then be mapped and modified against pricing structures , which could potentially create absurd operating environments .
Higher - performing systems would still cost more , but it 's safe to assume that an employee 's ability to operate in peak performance mode would be closely monitored .
Any pressure from the accounting department to cut costs will land squarely on the shoulders of professionals who legitimately require high - performance systems in order to do their jobs effectively .
( " Bill , this is Greg from accounting .
Any chance you can stop using your graphics card for a week to save us a bit of cash ? " )
The nickel - and - dime approach might have worked when even basic computers were $ 1,500 + , but Dell has Vostro systems for as little as $ 289 .
Even if we assume a pricing plan whereupon a computer using Microsoft 's proposed payment system costs just $ 1.00 per day for 350 days a year , the machine ends up costing more than a base PC in only months .
Such a setup would allow gamers to get more horsepower than they could otherwise afford up front , but allowing such systems into homes opens the obvious risk of hacking and cracking the devices .
At this point , the market has created computers at almost every price point imaginable — it 's hard to imagine how any vendor could simultaneously entice a company with this type of offer and make itself a profit .
Startups with virtually no capital might be interested , but these probably are n't the sorts of companies an OEM wants to build a business segment on .
EDIT : This is a patent application , not an actual granted patent .
When I initially wrote this article , I was unaware that the USPTO now publishes all patent applications 18 months after first filing regardless of their status .
At present , all 20 patent claims have been provisionally rejected ( Microsoft has the opportunity to resolve / restate the claims and resubmit them ) .

" In May 1931 , " author Palmer Cosslett Putnam wrote in his 1949 book , and " after two years of wind measurement , a wind - turbine 100 feet in diameter was put in operation on a bluff near Yalta , overlooking the Black Sea , driving a 100 - kilowatt , 220 - volt induction generator , tied in by a 6300 - volt line to the 20,000 - kilowatt , peat - burning steam - station at Sevastopol , 20 miles distant .
" As if anticipating BLDGBLOG 's recent look at infrastructural domesticity , Putnam points out that " a streamlined house " containing generators was held aloft behind the turbine – but this " house " also offered a temporary place of rest to the maintenance workers who checked up on the turbine 's workings .
Accessible via a long flight of stairs , this airborne space added a small touch of domestic comfort to an otherwise industrial piece of machinery in the sky .

I have been working a lot on a new developer tool , called Crack .
NET .
It is similar to Mole in that it allows you to walk an object graph on the managed heap , and similar to Snoop in that it injects itself into another .NET application and reports back information to you .
It works for WPF applications , as well as Windows Forms applications .
However , on top of that functionality , I added in the ability to write and execute IronPython scripts that run inside the other application .
Those scripts can do , well … pretty much anything .
The possibilities are mind - boggling .
I wrote an article about Crack .
NET and put it on the tool ’s home page .
The binaries and source code are available on that page , as well .
Here ’s the link :

I ’ve been working non-stop on Crack .
NET for almost 48 hours .
Time for some sleep … 😀

Research into algae gene could aid fishing industry
STAFF WRITER , WITH CNA
Marine biologists at National Taiwan Ocean University ( NTOU ) have identified a gene , called “ ScDSP , ” that can control cell death in algae , sources at Keelung City university said .
Researchers said the findings could help predict declines in algae populations , which could help the fishing industry .
In addition , by manipulating the expression of the gene , scientists might be able to trigger the death of the carbon - absorbing organisms , which could reduce greenhouse gases in a given area by causing them to sink .
The team , led by Chang Jeng ( 張正 ) of the Institute of Marine Biology , first reported the discovery of ScDSP in a diatom — Skeletonema costatum — in the December 2005 issue of the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology .
Another paper to be published soon by the journal explains the team ’s work on an ScDSP - based molecular probe that can predict cell death , or apoptosis , in algae , Chang said on Thursday .
Chang said the research could help the aquaculture industry predict mass die - offs of algae , which are a food source for fish .
If large - scale losses of algae could be predicted , measures could be taken to stem the effects , he said .
In addition , scientists have been developing a method to deploy algae to capture greenhouse gases , Chang said .
If the ScDSP gene can be manipulated , it would allow for controlled death in the algae , causing them to sink to the seabed along with carbon particles .
Today , a jury convicted Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) today on felony charges that he made false financial statements about gifts he received in exchange for political patronage .
Do Senate rules require Stevens to step down ?
No , but precedent suggests he is unlikely to keep his office .
There is no rule saying that a convicted felon must be expelled from the Senate , says Howard Gantman , staff director for the Senate Rules and Administration Committee .
But the Senate Ethics Committee can choose to recommend that the senator is expelled .
A two - thirds vote is then needed from the entire Senate to expel him .
The Ethics Committee could also decide to wait for the outcome of Stevens ’ appeal .
But the last time a senator was convicted of a felony -- almost 30 years ago — the committee did n’t wait .
Harrison Williams , a Democratic Senator from New Jersey , was convicted in May 1981 of charges related to the FBI ’s investigation of a bribery scandal known as ABSCAM .
In August of the same year , the Ethics Committee recommended his expulsion .
Williams stayed in office through the beginning of 1982 , until the Senate began to debate the issue .
He found few defenders on the Senate floor , and resigned before his colleagues had a chance to act .
Williams was later sentenced to three years in prison .
Stevens is only the fifth senator convicted of a felony in the history of the Senate .
None of the other were expelled .
Truman Newberry was convicted in 1920 of election fraud , but his conviction was overturned .
Joseph Burton of Kansas resigned after a bribery conviction in 1906 , and John Hipple Mitchell , busted for bribery in 1905 , died before the Senate could expel him .
Only 15 senators have been expelled in the history of the Senate — 14 for supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War .
In any case , the Alaskan Senator is up for re-election in just eight days , meaning voters will likely get a chance to expel him before the Senate does .
( CNN ) -- Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley declared victory over Republican incumbent Sen. Gordon Smith , moving Democrats one seat closer to a filibuster - proof majority in the U.S. Senate .
" This is the beginning of a transformational change for America , " Merkley said at a news conference at Portland State University .
He said he would be working with President - elect Barack Obama " to put this nation back on track . "
Merkley said Smith called him to concede Thursday morning .
" I thanked him for his 12 years of service to our beautiful state , " Merkley said .
Smith had served two terms in the Senate .
" As we exit the stage , our hearts are filled with gratitude , " Smith told reporters Thursday evening during a sometimes tearful concession speech .
Smith said he lost because he was swept up in an " Obama tsunami " or a " strong wave " of national Democratic support .
With 92 percent of the ballots received counted , Merkley has received 48.79 percent of the vote to Smith 's 45.71 percent , according to unofficial results tabulated by the Oregon secretary of state 's office .
A third candidate , David Brownlow , has receive 5 percent of the vote .
The as - yet - uncertified vote totals are 796,644 for Merkley and 746,267 for Smith , the secretary of state 's office said .
Merkley , the current speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives , joins Democrat Sen .
Ron Wyden , who introduced Merkley on Thursday , in Oregon 's delegation in the nation 's capital .
But even with Merkley 's victory , Democrats ' hopes are fading for a filibuster - proof 60 seats in the Senate .
Three hotly contested Senate races hang in the balance : Alaska , Georgia and Minnesota .
Democrats needed to add nine seats to their current caucus of 51 ( 49 Democrats and two independents allied with them ) to gain enough of a majority to push legislation through the Senate unimpeded .
It takes 60 votes to invoke cloture , a device to end filibusters , the unlimited floor speeches by an opponent that can prevent legislation from coming up for a vote .
With Merkley 's victory , and having added five seats Tuesday , Democrats would need to sweep the three remaining undecided races to reach 60 .
See a map of the Senate results »
A wild card in the Senate head count is Connecticut Sen .
Joe Lieberman , an independent who has caucused with the Democrats but who was an ardent supporter of Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain .
If Lieberman switches his allegiance to the GOP , the Democrats cannot reach 60 , and the filibuster remains in play .
A recount is expected in the tight U.S. Senate race in Minnesota , but GOP incumbent Norm Coleman claimed victory anyway Wednesday , despite leading Democrat Al Franken by only a few hundred votes .
" I recognize that because of my margin of victory , Mr. Franken has the right to pursue an official review of the election results .
It is up to him whether such a step is worth the tax dollars it would take to conduct , " Coleman said .
" Yesterday , voters spoke .
We prevailed , " he added .
With all of the precincts reporting , Coleman and Franken were separated by about 720 votes Wednesday afternoon , and the Minnesota secretary of state 's office said a recount probably would be held .
" From what it looks like , that 's where it 's headed , " said John Aiken , the secretary of state 's director of communications .
According to the figures , posted on the secretary of state 's Web site , Coleman received 1,211,616 votes , or 42 percent , and Franken garnered 1,210,895 votes , or 41.97 percent .
The vote count kept changing slightly as more counties reported their results .
Recounts are triggered in Minnesota when the winning margin is less than half of 1 percent .
" One half of one percent is 15,000 votes , " Aiken said .
" We are looking at a couple hundred here . "
Earlier in the day , Franken described the race as " too close to call " and gave no indication that he would back down from a recount .
Watch Franken demand a recount »
" There is reason to believe that the recount could change the vote tally significantly , " he said .
" Our office and the Obama campaign have received reports of irregularities at various precincts around the state .
" For instance , some polling places in Minneapolis ran out of registration materials , " Franken said .
He said his staff members have been examining those issues .
Aiken said the Web site numbers are unofficial until canvassing boards in each of the state 's 87 counties certify their results .
The state canvassing board will meet November 18 to determine whether Coleman 's narrow victory requires a recount .
If the board decides on a recount , it would start the next day .
The ballots would be hand - counted in the process , which Aiken thinks could take a week , if not two .
Meanwhile , the two major candidates in Georgia 's hotly contested Senate race both said Wednesday that they are launching runoff campaigns as votes continued to be counted and neither man held a majority .
At midday Wednesday , Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss led Democratic challenger Jim Martin , with Chambliss having 1,838,891 votes , or 49.9 percent , to Martin 's 1,721,087 , or 46.7 percent .
Libertarian candidate Allen Buckley was credited with 3.4 percent of the vote .
" We 're in a runoff , " Martin said .
" This race has just begun . "
Chambliss also declared , " we 've already hit the ground .
We 're getting ready for the runoff . "
A spokesman for the Georgia secretary of state 's office said it will probably be next week before election results are finalized and certified statewide .
A runoff would be held in December .
In Alaska , incumbent Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens was in a tight race against Democrat Mark Begich .
Stevens was convicted of seven federal corruption charges in October for filing false statements on Senate ethics forms .
In North Carolina , first - term incumbent Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole lost to Democratic state Sen. Kay Hagan .
Watch Hagan have the last word to her critics »
Dole , a first - term incumbent , had been considered a safe seat for Republicans early in the election cycle , but she was targeted heavily by national Democratic Party ads .
CNN's Joe Sterling and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Senate • Al Franken • Norm Coleman
Some companies , like Geely , are looking for more government grants to help them develop hybrid gasoline - electric cars and other cutting - edge technologies for which research spending may be cut if sales do not recover .
But Zheng Qinghong , the general manager of Guangzhou Auto , one of China ’s largest and fastest - growing automakers , said that the Chinese industry needs the government to help consumers become enthusiastic again about buying cars .
Retail sales have dipped a couple percentage points to 750,000 a month ; sales were still rising at an annual pace of 24 percent a year ago .
“ The best way is to boost growth in demand ” for cars , through steps like lower car taxes and lower fuel prices , he said in an interview .
Western multinationals would probably benefit at least indirectly from any government initiative to help China ’s auto industry , because Western companies are required to do business through joint ventures with Chinese automakers , most of which are partly or entirely government owned .
Jeffrey
Shen , the chief executive and president of one of these joint ventures , the Changan Ford Mazda Automobile Company , said that he did not know how the government would help , but that some steps were inevitable .
“ I ’m sure it will come , ” he said , with both extra assistance for research and greater availability of loans .
The renewed willingness of state - owned banks to lend money to the auto industry this autumn is in contrast with the United States , where General Motors , Ford and Chrysler have found banks and other investors leery of lending to them .
Government - mandated lending quotas , not interest rates , tend to be the most important limit on bank lending in China .
Regulators have begun easing the quotas this fall after four years of fairly tight quotas imposed in an effort to control the growth of the money supply and limit inflation .
Direct loans from the government of the sort under discussion in Washington are not needed in China , Mr. Zheng said .
“ For now , the Chinese auto industry does n’t need saving ” in the same way as the American industry , he said .
With Apple hitting the 10,000 app milestone , they 've just released the stats for the most downloaded apps in a number of categories .
And boy , they sure do prove that you people like frivolous , stupid crap on your iPhones .

Frugal v. cheap ... choice v. desperation Share
This :
I hate giving frugal tips during a recession because , in a real sense , the worst time to impose frugality upon yourself is when you absolutely need to .
No , I am not indulging in a paradox .
I adopted frugality as a lifestyle about four years ago when I became intrigued by ' voluntary simplicity ' -- a practical approach to living in which you consume only the goods / services you value as much or more than you do the cost of acquiring them .
For example , a designer dress may cost eight hours of labor at a high - paid job you despise .
Is it worth it ?
Perhaps it is .
But not for me .
I 'd rather have comfortable cotton clothing that I can afford through an hour or two of modestly - paid work that I enjoy .
Voluntary simplicity is about finding out what you value and where you draw the line in what you will trade for it .
Everyone 's lines are different .
Some choices I make seem to go against frugality -- that is , if you equate frugality with cheapness .
For example , living on a 40 - acre farm instead of in a small apartment .
But if you equate frugality with spending your resources ( e.g. money , time ) in a manner that returns as much or more pleasure and satisfaction than is being consumed , then our farm is the height of frugality .
An apartment would be cheaper but it would also impoverish my life : no dogs , no daily walks on my own land , no garden , no privacy ....
My style of frugality is about increasing your choices by being aware of whether you value X enough to pay Y for it .
And remember ... one of the costs in life is " opportunity cost . "
Because I live on a farm , I do not and cannot live on a houseboat .
Which is more intrinsically valuable ?
Neither .
The value -- the content of a frugal trade -- depends on who is answering the question .
Because I approach frugality in this manner , it has never made me feel poor or deprived .
Quite the opposite .
But , if you have been plunged into frugality against your will as a way to pay for your children 's groceries , the process may make you feel impoverished .
If so , then talk of " enriching " your life through frugality might make you want to slap the speaker 's face .
Ouch ! -- because that face would be me .
A freethought writer named John Mackinnon Robertson once said that the best time to treat yourself to a sumptuous meal is when you are down and out because that is when you really need it .
There is a kernel of truth here .
Frugality is now being adopted by people who are in a terrible position to appreciate / enjoy it because they are driven to frugality ( actually to cheapness ) through desperation rather than coming to it with a desire to increase the choices / control in their lives .
To them frugality must seem like a dreary thing .
I encourage everyone who is " cutting back " to take the opportunity to carefully assess the value of what you have been trading your time / live in order to acquire .
I am not one of those dreadful people who look on suffering and say " Wow !
What a growth experience . "
Suffering is suffering .
But , during the process of alleviating it , we can sometimes form new habits and attitudes that are worth holding on to .

Yelp Day , it seems , never happened .
If you recall , Newsom supposedly declared today to be Yelp Day , but it was all one big fib .
Or one big dream .
Or one
George and Sharlee McNamee never realized how complicated a barbecue could be .
The retired couple ’s bluff - top home overlooks a stunning stretch of Corona del Mar State Beach , studded with the jagged rocks of nearby Inspiration Point .
It ’s been their slice of paradise , and they looked forward to whiling away their golden years .
Instead , the McNamees have filled the better part of a decade battling the state Coastal Commission over their backyard .
According to state officials , the couple ’s oasis -- two picnic tables , thatched palapa , storage cabinets , shower , bathroom and barbecue -- on the beach portion of the McNamees ’ property is illegal development that must go .
The McNamees disagree .
And it ’s not just about the grill ; in their view , liberty itself is at stake : “ George and I are the old school , ” Sharlee McNamee , 73 , said .
“ We think you should be able to dispose of your property as you see fit , as long as you ’re not harming anyone else . ”
Advertisement
It does n’t matter that the improvements are on the McNamees ’ property .
Under the 1976 Coastal Act , private and public shorefront property are subject to state regulation to protect the environment and ensure public beach access .
In the McNamees ’ case , the state says their recreational amenities involved unpermitted grading and damage to the fragile bluff , and gives the perception of a private beach -- which intimidates beachgoers into avoiding the public sand nearby .
After a tangle of lawsuits , commission hearings and environmental studies , the McNamees are pretty much back where they began : in apparent violation of the Coastal Act .
Now newly represented by property rights group the Pacific Legal Foundation , they ’re crossing their fingers for their current appeal .
The Coastal Commission has several issues with what ’s on the sand .
For instance , attached to the beige shed at the foot of the McNamees ’ bluff is a small white sign that reads “ George ’s Beach . ”
Advertisement
“ It looks very much like a private beach , ” said Lisa Haage , the commission ’s chief of enforcement .
“ This is not about a picnic table and not entirely about the McNamees , ” said Mark Massara , director of the Sierra Club ’s coastal programs .
“ This is about unpermitted cabinets , stoves , water lines and gas lines running up the hillside , and showers -- pervasive , unpermitted development that creates an atmosphere of a private beach on the sand . ”
The McNamees dispute that their small “ George ’s Beach ” sign shoos the public away , even from their privately owned stretch of sand .
They say people are constantly using their tables , rinsing off under their shower , snapping photos of their garden , nursing stingray bites at their outdoor sink , stashing chairs behind their lockers , convening Scout meetings -- even getting married .
That does n’t change the fact that the McNamees are violating the law , the Coastal Commission says .
Advertisement
“ If someone really likes something -- even if it ’s illegal -- that does n’t make it legal , ” Haage said .
Another problem ?
The thatched canopy and grill , officials say , detract from the ocean view .
The couple ’s argument that they ’re generous with strangers in allowing them use of their yard has “ never been anything other than a throwaway PR line , ” Massara said .
“ The Coastal Commission has been nothing but accommodating to these people , allowing them to maintain this illegal development for years and years and years while the McNamees sue the Coastal Commission . ”
He said several properties nearby have similar violations and the commission has pursued actions against some of those homeowners .

George McNamee , 76 , a retired insurance executive , and his wife have owned their home since 1978 .
They say many of the items in contention were on the beach when they moved in .
Presiding Judge James J. Di Cesare of the Orange County Superior Court ruled last summer that the commission showed , using aerial photographs that the couple disputes , that the original amenities were replaced by new and improved versions .
And commission staff found that the McNamees ’ 1981 permit to remodel their house prohibited beachfront modifications .
After years of administrative back - and - forth , the state issued a cease - and - desist order in 2004 .
The McNamees then applied for an after - the - fact permit from the commission and were denied .
They face a possible fine of $ 6,000 a day if they fail to clear their beachfront ; their attorney has requested a stay of the order until the appeal is decided .
Having nearly exhausted their options , the retirees are contemplating the end of George ’s Beach because they say they ’d find it difficult to use even their private stretch without the amenities .
George , who has a heart condition , said he can’t easily climb the 80 steps to the house to retrieve items or use the bathroom .
And the shade canopy was a measure to protect him from another bout of melanoma .

Beyond the hundreds of thousands of dollars they ’ve sunk into fighting an order they consider wrong , George would have to rip out his beloved rosebushes and flower garden , which he sometimes plants to bloom in the image of an American flag .
The McNamees would then have to pay to replace their plants with erosion controls such as sandbags and native vegetation .
“ They do n’t pollute , they do n’t cause any injury to the public -- this is just a totally innocuous situation , ” said their attorney , Paul Beard , a principal attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation and head of the group ’s Coastal Land Rights project .

According to the couple , the commission is overreaching , “ a small tyranny that has destroyed the concept of private property in California . ”
“ What the Coastal Commission is doing , ” she said , “ is depriving us of a portion of our lives . ”

In solidarity and support of the Black Lives Matter movement , I ’ve decided to pause the comic updates and my social media for the remainder of the week in order for ( way ) more important voices to be heard .
As a ( very ) white person I have n’t for a second felt in danger when encountering police , and I have most definitely been advantageous in any such encounters just because of my white privilege , probably many times without me even taking note of it .
But for many others that is extremely far from their reality .
That ’s why I feel it is more important than ever to keep fighting , and keep speaking up .
To still remain silent speak louder than words .
I feel it ’s difficult for me to be truly articulate about this matter , as usually I would rather communicate my thoughts through a comic , but I just want to show my support and that I ’m standing by every person of color in this matter .
I ’ve donated $ 50 to help fight racism and police brutality and I encourage you to do the same , or however much you can .

A friendly note to America from a Canadian : Quit saying you ’re the “ envy of the world ” !
Dear America ,
You are bombarded every day with your media telling you that you are “ the envy on the world ” .
I ’ve travelled to almost every Canadian province and spent considerable time in four of them .
I hate to burst your bubble but , contrary to your belief that you are “ the envy of the world ” , no Canadian that I ’ve ever met — even in the most conservative parts of Alberta — has ever struck up a conversation with me saying : “ You know who I ’m really envious of ?
The USA . ”
In no conversation I ’ve ever had , even in conversations about America , has any Canadian , European , Aussie , Kiwi , Mexican or Asian that I ’ve ever met said to me “ Jeez , it really sucks that we ’re not Americans .
I ’m so jealous of them . ”
I sometimes wonder if it ’s just that you do n’t realize how ridiculous this claim is .
The rest of the world ca n’t help but notice that no two people can even agree on why America is the envy of the world but that there is a compulsion to recite the refrain every day nevertheless .
The Jacksonville Progress publication yesterday seemed to suggest that America is the envy of the world because of its “ people and for the God - given principles of freedom ” .
( Apparently God only gave freedom to America , therefore the rest of the world is envious ) .
In a state of the union address , your outgoing President claimed instead that it was America ’s economy that was the envy of the world .
( Apparently China ’s nearly double or triple the US ’s GDP growth rate is n’t as economically impressive or envious ) .
While , on a more ridiculous mindset , this news site seems to suggest that America ’s peaceful exchange of power is what makes it the “ envy of the world ” .
( Apparently no other country has yet mastered that whole ‘ democracy ’ thing the Greeks were talking about 2000 years ago ) .
So you do n’t even know why the world is supposed to be envious , but you just know that they are .
Am I the only one who sees how insane that is ?
So please , America , take this in the nicest way possible , but if you ever plan on not being seen as a nation of fools ( which you are not ) and if you ever intend on repairing your image after 8 years of Bush , you absolutely have to stop saying that you are the envy of the world .
Signed ,
A Canadian

I can feel the power of prayer , and that strength that is provided through our prayer warriors across this nation .
And I so appreciate it . ”

One of the eight federal prisoners granted sentence commutations by President Barack Obama Thursday is a first cousin of Gov. Deval Patrick ( D - Mass ) , one of the president 's most devoted supporters on the national political scene .
Reynolds Allen Wintersmith Jr. was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted in Illinois federal court in 1994 of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribute cocaine and cocaine base and possession with intent to distribute crack .
He was 19 at the time of his arrest and 17 at the time he got involved running drugs for the Gangster Disciples gang .
He is 39 today and has spent the past 19 years in prison .
A spokeswoman for Patrick confirmed that the 57 - year - old Massachusetts governor and Wintersmith are cousins but denied any invovement in the drive to get the federal prisoner a rare commutation — one of only nine Obama has granted as president .
( Also on POLITICO : Obama commutes 8 drug sentences )
" The Governor has no recollection of meeting Mr. Wintersmith ( they are quite far apart in age ) , and believes that if they did meet , it would have been when Mr. Wintersmith was a small boy .
The Governor was not involved in any application for a commutation of Mr. Wintersmith ’s sentence , and only learned of the commutation through today ’s media reports , " said the Patrick aide , who asked not to be named .
Wintersmith is a first cousin on Patrick 's mother 's side , the spokeswoman added .
Patrick 's 2011 book , " A Reason to Believe : Lessons from an Improbable Life , " discusses his upbringing on the South Side of Chicago , an uncle 's addiction to heroin and the involvement of others in the neighborhood with drugs and gangs .
( PHOTOS : Obama ’s second term )
A White House spokesman , who also asked not to be named , said Wintersmith 's tie to Patrick had no impact on the commutation decision and officials do not believe Patrick ever had any contact with the feds over the matter .
Wintersmith 's case went to the Supreme Court in 1996 , on a challenge to how his sentence and those of his co-defendants were arrived at based on distribution of both powdered and crack cocaine .
The justices upheld the sentences without any noted dissent two years later in an opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer .
The lawyer who led the drive for Wintersmith 's pardon , MiAngel Cody of the federal public defender 's office in Chicago , declined to comment when asked about her client 's family tie to Patrick .
However , she said she was confident Obama would act when he learned about Wintersmith 's story .
" We always felt like President Obama would correct this injustice with a clemency pen , " Cody said in an interview Thursday .
" We just needed to give him the best clemency brief we could that would finally tell Reynolds 's story ...
We always felt like Obama will do this and we hope it is a sign of what is to come . "
Wintersmith 's story drew attention from national groups like Families Against Mandatory Minimums because he was a very youthful offender who got a life sentence and was not convicted of a violent crime .
" His crime began and ended when he was a teenager , " said Cody .
" It was his first offense .
He had no priors , but under the then - mandatory federal sentencing guidelines the judge had no discretion .
He could only impose a life sentence . "
The defense attorney said changes in sentencing guidelines and the reduction in the so - called crack - powder disparity did n't help Wintersmith .
" The real problem is this 18 - to - 1 disparity in crack versus powder sentences , which currently has rendered him and others ineligible for relief , " Cody said . , estimating that hundreds of inmates are in a similar predicament to her client .
" Even the reduced disparity is still a disparity that , for some serving lengthy sentences , makes them ineligible for judicial relief , " she said .
" This certainly illustrates what we hope is a crack in the dam . "
Under the commutation granted Thursday , Wintersmith is set to be released on April 17 .

Republican incumbent Norm Coleman continues to fight for his political life in the Minnesota Senate race with the contest still undecided as of this morning .
The count still stands at 1,211,644 for Coleman to 1,211,167 for Democratic challenger Al Franken -- or an amazing margin of only 477 votes out of over 2.4 million ballots cast .
( Is n't it astounding that anyone would still think after this and so many other incredibly close races that everyone 's vote does n’t matter ? )
The tight vote difference falls easily within the requirements for Minnesota 's mandatory recount law , that states that a recount must commence if the margin between the top two candidates is less than one - half of one percent .
Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said the recount wo n't begin until the middle of this month , will likely stretch into December and involve local election officials from around the state .
Ritchie said that the recount will happen at about 100 locations and that county election officials will team with counterparts from larger cities to go over each and every ballot to determine voter intent -- much like we saw in Florida after the 2000 presidential election .
" Our goal is to ensure that every vote is properly counted , " said Franken in a statement Wednesday .
" The process , dictated by our laws , will be orderly , fair , and will take place within a matter of days .
We wo n't know for a little while who won this race , but at the end of the day , we will know that the voice of the electorate was clearly heard . "
" We are lucky enough to live in a state with built - in protections to ensure that in close elections like these , the will of the people is accurately reflected in the outcome . "
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
OP -ED :
In politics , there is no such thing as a moral victory .
Vice President Dick Cheney believes that to be the truth about power .
Most of those people who go up against him do not .
Thus , he has usually come out on top and left his opponents bloodied and bitter , or dangling at the end of a rope .
That ’s the hard lesson this reviewer took away from Barton Gellman ’s excellent book , “ Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency . ”
Mr. Gellman , a Washington hand is terse , secretive and often expressionless in a way that unnerves people .
Many type - A males confess to Mr. Gellman that they have to struggle to keep their wits about them in the vice president ’s presence .
The same can rarely be said of Mr. Cheney , in any situation .
When the attacks began on September 11 , he was in the United States out of his office ” to safety .
In the bunker , the live World Trade Center collapsing .
As this happened , Mr. Cheney ’s chin was “ resting on interlaced fingers ” as he took it in .
There was a collective gasp in the room but he “ said nothing .
He made no sound . ”
In fact , “ He did not move in his seat . ”
One witness said that “ whatever change there was in his demeanor was inside . ”
The author documents that change .
First , the vice president gave orders to shoot down any unidentified planes headed to Washington - orders that likely came without first consulting National Security Agency , and to push the boundaries of executive authority and of what we mean by “ torture . ”
Those initiatives were closely guarded secrets for some time but their eventual disclosure can’t have come as any great shock to those who listened to what the vice president was saying publicly very early on .
On “ Meet the Press , ” Mr. Cheney announced to the whole world that the U.S. government would be working “ through … the dark side , if you will … in the shadows in the intelligence world , ” and would “ use any means at our disposal , basically , to achieve our objectives . ”
Coming from most vice presidents , such threats could be laughed off .
During the administration of Vice President Dan Quayle for trying to take the lead during an international crisis .
But by the time of the attacks , Mr. Cheney had already shown he was n’t just any vice president .
Many of the last - minute regulations that President Clinton rammed through were stopped by one phone call by Mr. Cheney .
He told the government printers to stop the presses , knowing that regulations do n’t acquire the force of law until they are published .
During the 2000 Florida recount debacle , most Republicans were busy trying to keep the state in the R column .
Mr. Cheney instead led the new administration ’s transition team , recruiting not only Mr. Bush ’s cabinet but important bureaucratic appointments two or three or four layers down .
He also managed to get several of his own aides a second title of “ assistant to the president , ” putting them on par with Mr. Bush ’s closest advisers .
So , whenever Mr. Cheney decided to act on something - from environmental regulation to tax policy to Iraq - he had unparalleled access to the president , many potential allies to choose from , and an intuitive sense of how to crank up that bureaucratic machinery .
Again and again , Mr. Gellman shows how , through guile and sheer stubborn resolve , the vice president moved the country .
When John McCain threatens to open new fronts in the war on terror or the Republican throngs chant “ Drill , baby , drill ! ” Mr. Cheney may keep up that poker face gamely .
But one suspects he ’s smiling on the inside .

Illinois needs law on medical marijuana
Letter to the Editor
Voters in Michigan approved their medical cannabis proposal , following 12 other states in allowing doctors to recommend cannabis for serious medical conditions .
This should come as no surprise since polling on this issue shows consistent support for allowing sick people to use medical marijuana pursuant to the recommendation of a physician .
In Illinois a lot of progress was made during the 2008 legislative session with the Compassionate Use of Medical Marijuana Pilot Program bill .
SB 2865 picked up three new co-sponsors this year , and the bill 's lead sponsor , Sen . John Cullerton , a Chicago Democrat , sat down with law enforcement to listen to their concerns and then amended the bill to address those concerns .
SB2865 passed the Senate Public Health Committee with a 6 - 4 vote and is now awaiting a vote on the Senate floor , which must take place by January 13 , 2009 , per legislative rule .
Doctors can legally prescribe many otherwise illegal substances , such as OxyContin and morphine .
The same should be true for cannabis , especially since there has not been one documented overdose fatality from cannabis , which is not true for many substances found in most homes ' medicine cabinets .
Ultimately , the decision of what medicine is best for an illness should be left up to the patient and the doctor , not prosecutors and police .

Cassandra 's curse was that she could see the coming future , but could n't convince others of her credibility .
A pessimist 's is that even if they convince the world , it 's not going to be a good day when that bleak forecast is proved correct .
I 'd already figured that out .
But I did n't expect that the very public curtailment of Britain 's internet freedoms would be signalled by the non-appearance of a sleazy and exploitative Kraut - rock album sleeve I last saw in my sixth - form common room some 30 years ago .
It 's partly the fact that the Scorpions ' Virgin Killer has been around all that time without the hint of a prosecution , and partly the cackhanded way the Internet Watch Foundation has gone about justifying its censorship , not to mention the side - effect of wiping out British editing capability on Wikipedia , that seems to have created bemusement on the web , rather than anger .
The linked image is held on Amazon in the US for instance – but the IWF has n't sought to block Amazon .
I compiled a report for Index on Censorship on banned music 10 years ago – there must be a thousand album covers that have upset the censors in their day .
The IWF could have picked Houses of the Holy , Nevermind , or Blind Faith .
Instead , they 've used their peculiar position as an unaccountable body to impose this censorship on an obscure metal album and some 95 % of British web users .
The IWF , a notionally independent charity , in fact acts as a quasi - governmental clearing house for every nutjob with a bee in his bonnet about other people 's surfing habits .
Without any legal authority or legislative backing , this secretive group prepares a list of prohibited IP addresses , which it forwards to ISPs , and to the British government .
We 're not privy to any information regarding the British government 's own additions to the list – they could add anything .
No one outside a tiny department in the Home Office would know .
Thanks to government bully - boy tactics , all British ISPs now promise to implement the IWF 's blacked list – again , regardless of the legality or veracity of the list .
It is n't clear why some ISPs have failed to block the Wikipedia pages – some censorship has clearly been propagated automatically ; but perhaps some ISPs are looking across the Atlantic for guidance , where a related FBI investigation concluded that the album artwork broke no US laws .
Unfortunately the ISP 's are n't talking .
But what we can tell from the technical details is that the architecture for censorship of the internet in Britain is alarmingly sophisticated .
ISPs were able to block the pages in a trice – all their traffic flows through devices that monitor for prohibited destinations .
If banned requests are intercepted , the user request goes no further and a " 404 page not found " error is returned , or simply a blank page .
The hardware infrastructure for this kind of national processing does n't come cheap , it is n't easy to set up and it must have taken some time to implement .
This is an expensive , powerful , integrated censorship that leads the world .
It did n't happen by accident .
Nor did it happen in secret – hence some pessimistic satisfaction at my predictions coming true .
I 've written of the far - reaching impact of Cleanfeed and the gentlemen 's agreements between government and ISPs – all without any democratic control .
" Paranoid " is one of the most common insults in the comments below my articles .
I hope no one is muttering about paranoia now .
Recourse , Of Course
Martin Feldstein has written another Wall Street Journal op - ed ( here ’s an NBER version ) extending his idea for stabilizing home prices .
Steven Levitt has written about Feldstein ’s basic idea before .
The basic idea is for the government to provide low - interest loans to mortgage holders in return for mortgage debt :
The federal government would offer any homeowner with a mortgage an opportunity to replace 20 percent of the mortgage with a low - interest loan from the government , subject to a maximum of $ 80,000 .
This would be available to new buyers as well as those with mortgages .
The interest on that loan would reflect the government ’s cost of funds and could be as low as 2 percent .
The Feldstein proposal has a real advantage relative to Luigi Zingales ‘s ingenious “ Plan B . ”
Zingales proposes that Congress pass a law to give a recontracting option to all homeowners living in a zip code where housing prices have dropped by more than 20 percent .
If exercised , the Plan B option will write down the face value of the mortgage by the same percentage that the area housing price has dropped and , in return , the homeowner will give the mortgage holder 50 percent of any appreciation at time of sale .
( Zingales points out that mortgage holders will do much better under this program than with foreclosures , where transaction costs eat up a hefty proportion of the market value . )
Feldstein , like Zingales , reduces the incentives for homeowners to default on their mortgages .
But Feldstein avoids the sticky question of bank approval .
Zingales ’s plan tries to do this by legislative fiat .
But a law that forces mortgage holders to accept a write - down of principle might violate the Constitution ’s Takings Clause .
Indeed , another parallel between 1932 and 2008 may be how the court responds to legislative innovation .
( Here , Chief Justice Roberts plays the role of Charles Evans Hughes . )
But the Feldstein proposal has a couple of real disadvantages as well .
Feldstein emphasizes that the government loan would be a “ recourse ” loan , giving the government the right to look to homeowners ’ wages and other assets .
Feldstein is critical of American exceptionalism with regard to making mortgages non-recourse :
The “ no recourse ” mortgage is virtually unique to the United States .
That ’s why falling house prices in Europe do not trigger defaults , since the creditors ’ potential to go beyond the house to other assets or to a portion of payroll earnings is enough to deter defaults .
Officials and investors in other countries are amazed to learn that U.S. mortgages are no recourse loans .
It is indeed surprising that this rule in the U.S. applies to home mortgages but not to any other type of loan .
Feldstein ’s proposal , however , goes beyond merely making the government loan “ recourse . ”
Feldstein would not make the loan eligible for relief in bankruptcy .
To me , it ’s an open question whether many homeowners would accept the bribe of a subsidized write - down in third - party mortgages in exchange for taking on a recourse , no - bankruptcy loan .
In scary economic times , many homeowners might be reluctant to take the Feldstein option .
The big concern is that we still may be on the brink of an even larger foreclosure disaster — with wave upon wave of foreclosures feeding back to reduce housing prices , thereby inducing more homeowners to walk away from their mortgages .
To stabilize things , we need to solve what economists call a “ participation constraint ” problem .
We need to either 1 ) meet homeowners ’ participation constraint ( offer them a deal that is worth taking ) , 2 ) meet mortgage holders ’ participation constraint ( hard to do because ownership is so fractionated ) , or 3 ) take on the hard question of cramming down a legislative solution that roughly makes the different participants better off .

The Pacific follows the lives of a U.S Marine Corps squad during the campaign within the Pacific against the Japanese Empire during WW2 .
Made by the creators of Band of Brothers , it follows a similar line of thought to outline the hardships of the common man during war .
The Pacific is in parts a fast paced war series that can be enjoyed by action lovers whilst containing a more sensitive side when projecting the relationships ( brotherhood ) of Marines on the battlefield .
Where The Pacific takes a new direction from its " older brother " is in its depiction of the lives of soldiers who were picked to return home to increase the sales of war bonds .
In doing this it also depicts the life cycle of returned soldiers from initial joy to the eventual feeling of regret and to a certain extent shame felt by soldiers wanting to return to the war in service of either their comrades or nation .

Jessica Cox , 25 , of Tucson , Arizona who was born without arms has become the first pilot licensed to fly using only her feet .
With one foot on the controls and the other on the steering column , she received her Sport Pilot certificate which allows her to fly a sport aircraft to altitudes of 10,000 feet .
Flight Instructor Parrish Traweek who runs PC Aircraft Maintenance and Flight Services at San Manuel ’s Ray Blair Airport told sources : “ She ’s a good pilot .
She ’s rock solid , when she came up here driving a car I knew she ’d have no problem flying a plane . ”
Traweek said : “ that the most difficult thing was finding an aircraft which would be compatible . ”
Cox was taught in a Ercoupe , manufactured in the 1940’s .
She ’s an inspiration and living proof that : “ IF YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN ACHIEVE ! ”

Is Biz Markie ’s You Got What I Need the best music video ever ?
I think it is .
Allow me to give a point by point breakdown for your enjoyment / approval .
It starts off with a little skit .
None of this beginning with the song BS , we want — DEMAND — a story if we are going to enjoy a music video .
The above mentioned skit begins with a “ yo mama ” joke .
This is 1989 and “ yo mama ” jokes are the height of hilarity .
Hell , this is 2008 and they are still pretty funny .
Purple jumpsuit .
Gold chains .
“ Yo mama is so old she knew Central Park when it was just a plant . ”
Ahh , the “ yo mama ” jokes that do n’t even make sense .
Those were the days .
The two girls that are the object of the boys on the bench ’s attention are not exactly wearing what we would call “ good looking ” clothes .
“ You got what I need , man ! ” “ Let me touch you ! ”
“ Forget them girls , man ! ” Is Biz an advocate for abstinence ?
“ Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date / but a year to make love she wanted you to wait ” Biz channels Shakespeare .
And not for the last time .
“ I was talkin’ to this girl from the U.S. nation . ”
Was the girl before this one from the commonwealth of Massachusetts ?
Why does Biz feel the need to get so specific ?
“ I just got onstage drippin ’ , pourin ’ with sweat . ”
Uh , gross .
Grosser , perhaps , is the line for line translation of song into visuals , complete with dripping and pouring sweat .
“ Come to the picture booth / So I can ask you some questions to see if your hundred proof . ”
Putting aside the strange place for a conversation , let ’s look closer at the “ 100 proof ” part .
According to Wikipedia : Alcoholic proof is twice the percentage of alcohol by volume when measured at a temperature of 60 °F .
Consequently , 100 - proof whiskey contains 50 % alcohol by volume .
So did Biz want to know how drunk she was ( 50 % alcohol would be pretty drunk ) or did he just not understand the proof concept fully ?
“ I asked her her name , she said blah - blah - blah . ”
That ’s an unfortunate name .
“ She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra / I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused . ”
Thanks , Biz .
I think we can see this quite clearly in the video , but the narration really brings it all into focus for us .
“ Then when I asked , ‘ Do ya have a man ? ’ she tried to pretend / She said , ‘ No I do n’t , I only have a friend ' ” Oh Biz , will you ever find the right girl for you ?
The chorus is what takes this seemingly mundane song into the straosphere .
In additon to the fact that Biz is one of the worst singers I have ever heard , he decides to play dress - up and dons a wig and some 18th centry clothes ( plus cape ! ) to rock out on the piano .
The beat drops for Biz ’s “ showpiece ” singing and then kicks right back in as he sloughs off his super - awesome cape to really sing his heart out .
They employ the special “ mirror trick ” to make it seem like two ( TWO ! )
Biz Markies are rocking the piano .
TWO !
“ So I took blah - blah ’s word for it at this time
I thought just havin ’ a friend could n’t be no crime
‘ Cause I have friends and that ’s a fact
Like Agnes , Agatha , Germaine , and Jacq ” But it could be a crime , could n’t it Biz ?
A crime against your heart !
“ Forget about that , let ’s go into the story
About a girl named blah - blah - blah that adored me ” Biz is not full of himself at all .
Nice bathing suits !
Aww , a puppy .
Check out those cell - phones .
I wish I had something as awesome as that .
Talk about superflouous jewelry .
I guess Blah - Blah - Blah ’s new guy has more money than poor old Biz with his gigantic cell - phone .
And we ’re back to the chorus .
This time his awesome , super - cool - walking servant is featured .
He walks super -cool .
Also , more mirroring .
TWO !
“ I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm / This guy made me fill out a visitor ’s form ”
Biz will not sacrifice his artistic integrity just to get to the point !
He must share every detail of his trip .
Biz “ dances ” his way towards the school along with some brightly atired friends .
With twirly sticks .
“ Yo , could you tell me where is door three ? ”
It ’s the door that has the number 3 on it .
Silly Biz .
“ They showed me where it was for the moment ”
Although now I understand why Biz asked where it was .
Apparently it changes location several times a day .
“ Oh , snap ! ”
“ A fella tongue - kissin ’ my girl in the mouth , / I was so in shock my heart went down south ”
Biz should have followed his heart .
A vacation to Florida is just what he needs at this point .
“ So please listen to the message that I send / Do n’t ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend ”
So this was a PSA all along !
How informative .
Remember kids , never ever talk to a girl who says she has a friend .
They always cheat on you .
Enlarge By Alessandro Abbonizio , AFP / Getty Images Londoners form a " queue " outside a restaurant .
A consumer watchdog group says Britons should act like Americans and demand better service .
LONDON 
It 's one of the most visible signs of British civility : Stand politely in line and wait your turn .
Whether at check - out registers , bus stops or bank windows , people silently line up — or " queue " — and then wait some more .
The queues usually form on their own without being imposed by the store or bank .
And despite long lines , Britons seldom complain .
It 's a matter of proper etiquette .
Now , a consumer watchdog group says Britons should act more like Americans and demand better customer service .
Businesses take for granted that people are all too happy to wait .
" Around the world , people associate Britain with queuing .
It needs to change .
We need an American impatience , " says Ed Mayo , chief of Consumer Focus , an advocacy group created by Parliament to champion consumer rights .
" We need to ditch the service culture that assumes that the customer can wait , " he says .
" Queuing is almost a culture of low expectations .
Low expectations do n't cut it in a global economy . "
Mayo's group studied the waiting times in British post offices , finding that at least one in five patrons stood in line more than 10 minutes for service .
That 's too long , the group says .
" If that was in the United States , people would be livid , " says Allyson Stewart - Allen , an American who has lived in Britain for 20 years .
Stewart - Allen , director of International Marketing Partners in London , watches British manners and customs closely as she consults with American and British businesses .
Despite her own frustrations with long lines , Stewart - Allen says British customs should n't be ignored if people want to succeed here .
Among her routine advice for Yanks :
Do n't march " to the front of the queue . "
She warns that the British " take queuing very seriously .
Everybody has to wait their turn .
People who do n't wait their turn are sanctioned by those who are in the queue . "
That practice was taken to the extreme earlier this year .
Tony Virasami , 38 , is awaiting trial on manslaughter charges after admitting in court last month that he slapped another London man he thought had jumped ahead in a supermarket line last summer .
The man , who had chronic fatigue syndrome , hit his head on the floor and died four days later .
Martin Skinner , a social psychologist at England 's University of Warwick , says Britons ' tradition of queuing likely evolved as the nation rejected feudal class divisions and became more democratic .
Queues , Skinner says , represent equal rights — first come , first served , regardless of rank .
" There 's an etiquette to it that people agree to in principle : People should be served in the order in which they line up , " he says .
" I like it .
I tend to think it 's civilized . "
Skinner , however , notes an exception to principle .
" In bars , we do n't queue , " he says .
" We all just pile up . "

Woody Johnson Dials Erika Mariani While Suzanne Ircha Gives Birth
Woody Johnson , 61 , has multiple claims to fame .
He is the owner of the New York Jets and is the Band - aid heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune .
He is also the father of two young sons with his current girlfriend Suzanne Ircha .
In a strange twist , Johnson saw fit to include ex-girlfriend Erika Mariani in the drama of the couple 's latest birthing experience .
Woody and Suzanne , a former actress and equities specialist , have a two year old son Robert Wood Johnson V .
The couple welcomed their second son this week and while still in the delivery room , Johnson somehow triggered his cell phone to dial up old flame Erika Mariani .
When Mariani played back the 10 minute voice - mail message , she heard Woody talking to medical personnel in the delivery room .
She heard a baby crying lustily and also heard first hand that the new offspring will be named Jack .
The New York Post Page Six quoted Erika as saying : " It was pretty surreal .
I felt like I was in the room .
I 'm just glad I was n't the one giving birth . "
We 're just wondering why he still had his ex-girlfriend 's telephone number presumably on quick dial .
We 'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was just a fluke and not an ' in your face ' stunt .
This certainly gives new meaning to a play by play .
Johnson has three daughters with ex-wife Nancy Sale Johnson Rashad , who married former NFL football great and television sports commentator Ahmad Rashad last November .
Check out that story here .
UPDATE : January 4 , 2010 : Johnson 's eldest daughter Casey was found dead in her Los Angeles home .
Casey , who was openly gay , had a history of problems with drugs and in November 2009 , she was arrested and charged with the grand theft of more than $ 200,000 worth of jewelry from an ex-girlfriend 's home .
Weeks later , Casey announced her engagement to reality TV star , Tila Tequila .
The engagement was later found to be a publicity stunt by the women .
In early 2009 , Sale Johnson took custody of Casey 's young adopted daughter Ava , because Casey was living with the child , in squalor , and under the influence of drugs in her L.A. home .
Woody Johnson and Sale ceased all financial assistance to Casey at that time , and Casey became estranged from both of her parents .

Special thanks to Erika Mariani , who was kind enough to send us a couple of hot pics for our post .
Rails 2.2 is finally done after we cleared the last issues from the release candidate program .
This release contains an long list of fixes , improvements , and additions that ’ll make everything Rails smoother and better , but we also have a number of star player features to parade this time .
Internationalization by default
The most important is that Rails now includes a full - on internationalization framework and that it ’s pre-wired from start .
The work of the i18n group has been very impressive and it ’s great to see that Rails finally ships with a solution in the box that ’s both simple and extensible .
Great job , guys !
Stronger etag and last - modified support
We ’ve also added much better support for HTTP validators in the form of etag and last - modified .
Making it so much easier to skip expensive procesesing if the client already has the latest stuff .
This also makes it even easier to use Rails with gateway proxies .
Thread safety and a connection pool
Josh Peek has added thread safety to Rails and Nick Sieger from JRuby worked on getting Active Record a proper connection pool .
So now all elements of Rails are thread safe , which is a big boon for the JRuby guys in particular .
For C Ruby , we still need a bunch of dependent libraries to go non-blocking before it ’ll make much of a difference , but work on that is forth coming .
Ruby 1.9 and JRuby compatibility
Jeremy Kemper has been rocking on both Ruby 1.9 and JRuby compatibility .
Rails 2.2 is fully compatible with both , but again , there might be supporting libraries and gems that are not .
Again , lots of work is going into making everything else fully compatible as well .
Better API docs , great guides
Finally , the last big push has been with the documentation of Rails .
Pratik ’s docrails project has made immense progress .
Not only are the API docs much improved , but we also have a whole new guides section generated from documentation that now lives with the source .
A true community project with lots of contributors .
I ’m sure both those new and old to Rails will greatly appreciate the strong focus on documentation .
To read about all these features and more in details , checkout the Rails 2.2 release notes — another one of those guides from the docrails project .
How to install
As always , you can install Rails 2.2 through RubyGems .
We now require RubyGems 1.3.1 , so be sure to update that first : gem update -- system
Then you can install Rails : gem install rails
If you ’re updating an existing application , you can run rake rails : update to get the latest JavaScript files and scripts .
From all of us to all of you , we hope you enjoy this release .
It ’s a true pleasure to see Rails make such big steps forward once again .
Dig in , have fun , and we ’ll be back with Rails 2.3 with even more before you know it .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak ( the Hebrew surname means “ lightning , " German “ Blitz ” ) did it again : a historic record of over 200 Palestinians killed in a single Sabbath ’s blitz ( Dec. 27 ) .
Polls now predict five additional Knesset seats for his Labor Party in the coming February general election .
That ’s 40 Palestinian corpses per seat .
No wonder he promises it ’s just the beginning : at this pace , it will take Labor just about two thousand additional corpses to go from rags to riches , from a dead political party to an absolute majority in parliament like in the good old days .
For Barak , then , the Gaza obituaries are a matter of political survival : they are pasted up on his party ’s obituary .
A similar sickening logic sent former Prime Minister Shimon Peres ( Nobel Peace Prize Laureate , etc. , etc. ) back in 1996 to devastate southern Lebanon and solve the problem of Hezbollah once - and - for - all in Operation Grapes of Wrath , just weeks before the general election  in which he was defeated by Netanyahu .
When the so - called doves behave like hawks , the voters prefer the real hawks , following the Talmudic saying “ Whatever looks like an egg , a true egg is always better . "
But warriors like Barak never learn .
And they are not alone in that : just two days before the pounding of Gaza started , it was the allegedly “ left- liberal ” party Meretz that officially called for military action against Hamas .
You know Meretz : the party of ( Frankfurt Peace Prize Laureate , etc. , etc. ) Amos
Oz and his ilk , those pseudo - intellectuals who always claim to have been against the previous war .
No exception this time : they ’re all there , right behind the bombers , or even ahead of them .
Over 200 corpses lying in open air behind Gaza ’s hospital , which  after more than a year of Israel ’s blockade  cannot offer patients anything but painkillers anyway .
Guess what was the headline of Israel ’s most popular daily , Yediot Ahronoth , the next day .
“ One and a Half Million Gazans Under Fire ” ?
Close , but no cigar .
The actual headline ( Dec. 28 ) read : “ Half a Million Israelis Under Fire . "
Indeed , a single Israeli civilian had been killed that day by a Hamas rocket .
Similarly , journalist Avirama Golan in her Ha’aretz blog devoted a whole post to the agonies of her hysterical pussycat in Sderot .
Some journalists , especially those who consider themselves critical , are excellent prioritizers .
Yediot Ahronoth had six columnists on its front page and several more inside .
The war ’s cheerleaders .
Nahum Barnea , an over - appreciated “ critical ” journalist , expressed his view about the bloodbath rather succinctly : “ better late than never . "
Dov Weissglass , “ closely linked to the peace process ” as Wikipedia puts it , was similarly outspoken : his column was called “ Do Not Stop , " with an exclamation mark to make things clear .
“ It should be just the beginning , " he advises to the very government that has just vowed “ it ’s just the beginning . "
Mirror , mirror on the wall .
Eitan Haber , senior aide to late former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ( Nobel Peace Prize Laureate , etc. , etc. ) , recycled the usual war propaganda of every Israeli government for home consumption : as always , the right - wing opposition is extremist and crazy , but we , the government , launch a moderate , responsible , and restrained war .
“ The political argument that we could have and should have acted long ago is neither true nor justified , " Haber opens his Pavlovian service for the government .
Gadi Taub , an ultra - conservative young mainstreamer , wrote a column titled “ Demagoguery , Anti-Semitism , Ignorance , " with content too trivial to repeat , though fairly summarized by its first and last title - words .
But Taub ’s demagoguery fades compared to Ben - Dror Yemini’s ( an Israeli Daniel Pipes ) in Ma’ariv .
In a column titled “ The Most Justified Offensive Ever ” ( miraculously , the very words used by his Ha’aretz twin Ari Shavit for the Lebanon War just two years ago ) , Yemini draws a straight line from Hitler to Hamas ( no coincidence they both start with an H , just like Hezbollah , Saddam Hussein , and Hemorrhoids ) , and explains that “ Since the Nazi ideology [ ] , no movement has been as dangerous to world peace as political Islam . "
My apologies for quoting this trash ; we need an Israeli demagogue to instrumentalize the Holocaust , and Yemini was born for such dirty jobs .
At the same time , excellent columnist B. Michael does raise a critical voice in Yediot :
" Here it is again , the periodical ‘ déjà vu’ war .
The ritual bleeding poured once again into the boiling basin which has for decades been leading the entire region to hell .
To be honest , our soul is weary of dividing the seventh - day ’s war of the Six - Day War into ‘ operations , ’ ‘ wars , ’ ‘ battles , ’ ‘ actions , ’ and ‘ offensives . ’
They are all just one ongoing war .
They are all one big slaughterhouse .
An occupier ’s war against the occupied , and the occupied ’s war against their occupier . "
B. Michael knows what most Israelis were trained to forget : that despite the Israeli withdrawal , Gaza is still occupied .
Even before the Hamas takeover , Israel retained all the measures to ensure its effective control of the Strip : from direct control of all the border crossings to Gaza , both for goods and for persons , to Israeli control of Gaza ’s population registry .
The only apparent exception  the Rafah checkpoint  is restricted to entry into Gaza of Gaza inhabitants only , as defined by the Israeli registry , and even this is under Israeli supervision .
But for most Israelis , Gaza is an independent , sovereign empire , which was occupied by Israel ages ago , and now , for no reason at all , poses an existential threat to its benevolent Jewish neighbor .
In the evening television news , careful listening  especially to serious reporters like Shlomi Eldar  could reveal the tip of the war - crimes iceberg yet to emerge : a Gazan prison was intentionally bombarded , a clear war crime .
Gaza ’s hospital suffered damages too .
All this in an overcrowded Strip in which life has already been strangled by an embargo on anything from cement and gasoline to medical equipment .
A couple of months ago , journalist Amos Harel quoted an article of a leading military figure regarding Israel ’s next war policy , be it in Lebanon , Syria , or Gaza : “ Using power without any proportion to the enemy ’s threat and actions , in order to damage and punish to an extent that would require long and expensive rehabilitation processes . ”
Another Israeli general explained that villages from which shots are fired will be devastated ; “ we consider them as military bases ” ( Ha’aretz , Oct. 5 ; the names of the two generals  for The Hague ’s ICC  are Gaby Siboni and Gadi Eisenkot ) .
Once the war started , Maj. - Gen. ( Reserve ) Giora Island  former head of the National Security Council  spelled it all out on television , without a shade of shame : Israel should not confine its attacks to military facilities , he said , but must hit civilian targets as well .
The damage to the civil population should be maximized , because the worse the humanitarian crisis is , the better and the sooner the operation would end .
It ’s the same major - general , by the way , who just a year ago caused outrage by urging the Israeli government to negotiate directly with Hamas .
Do not to look for consistency , integrity , or intelligence where war criminals are involved .
Just hours after Microsoft posted details of a critical Windows bug , new attack code that exploits the flaw has surfaced .
It took developers of the Immunity security testing tool two hours to write their exploit , after Microsoft released a patch for the issue Thursday morning .
Software developed by Immunity is made available only to paying customers , which means that not everyone has access to the new attack , but security experts expect that some version of the code will begin circulating in public very soon .
Microsoft took the unusual step of rushing out an emergency patch for the flaw Thursday , two weeks after noticing a small number of targeted attacks that exploited the bug .
The vulnerability was not publicly known before Thursday ; however , by issuing its patch , Microsoft has given hackers and security researchers enough information to develop their own attack code .
The flaw lies in the Windows Server service , used to connect different network resources such as file and print servers over a network .
By sending malicious messages to a Windows machine that uses Windows Server , an attacker could take control of the computer , Microsoft said .
Apparently , it does n't take much effort to write this type of attack code .
" It is very exploitable , " said Immunity Security Researcher Bas Alberts .
" It 's a very controllable stack overflow . "
Stack overflow bugs are caused when a programming error allows the attacker to write a command on parts of the computer 's memory that would normally be out of limits and then cause that command to be run by the victim 's computer .
Microsoft has spent millions of dollars trying to eliminate this type of flaw from its products in recent years .
And one of the architects of Microsoft 's security testing program had a frank assessment of the situation Thursday , saying that the company 's " fuzzing " testing tools should have discovered the issue earlier .
" Our fuzz tests did not catch this and they should have , " wrote Security Program Manager Michael Howard in a blog posting .
" So we are going back to our fuzzing algorithms and libraries to update them accordingly .
For what it 's worth , we constantly update our fuzz testing heuristics and rules , so this bug is not unique . "
While Microsoft has warned that this flaw could be used to build a computer worm , Alberts said that it is unlikely that such a worm , if created , would spread very far .
That 's because most networks would block this type of attack at the firewall .
" I only see it being a problem on internal networks , but it is a very real and exploitable bug , " he said .

The Radical Muslims of Germany
" Jews are the enemy of Allah , " declared Ismael Gharaballi during a recent service in a mosque in Bielefeld , Germany .
" This is not only my belief , but also Allah 's conviction , " the Palestinian imam and Hamas activist declared , waving his Koran in the air .
The congregation of about 200 thundered , " Allahu Akbar ! "
Then Gharaballi turned to another page in the Koran and read , " … and kill them [ he explained this to mean unbelievers , especially the Jews ] wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you " ( Surah 2 , verse 191 ) .
" What are you waiting for ? " he cried .
" Allah Himself is telling us kill them .
No peace can be made with the Jews . "
After the prayers , I approached Gharaballi in the cafeteria of the mosque and asked him if he was serious about what he had preached .
" Of course , I am .
This is not any book .
This is the word of Allah . "
Then I asked if he would kill a Jew here in Germany .
He answered : " Yes , especially those Israelis who are occupying Arab land . "
I reminded him that this would be murder and for that he would land up behind bars .
Ismael retorted angrily : " I do n't care .
The Koran is our law and constitution and anything else is just rubbish . "
Referring to Hitler , Ismael told me : " The man was a hero , almost a Muslim .
I 'm one of his fans . "
Gharaballi is not unique in Germany 's three million - strong Muslim community .
Ibrahim el - Zayat , the head of an extremist Munich - based organization called The Islamic Community of Germany , told a meeting of fellow Muslims last month : " It is still premature to strike against the Jews and infidels in this country .
However , at the lecture at a community center in Neukoeln , Berlin , which I attended , but where no media reporters were allowed access , he went on to assert : " But sooner or later we will strike against the enemies of Allah and Islam .
We have to wait .
Many Germans are converting to Islam , especially friends from the NPD [ a neo - Nazi party ] . "
When I asked a German reporter to verify this by calling el - Zayat , the latter denied having ever said such a thing .
El - Zayat was born in 1968 in Marburg , Germany , to an Egyptian imam and a German mother .
He owns a construction company and receives huge sums of money from the Saudis to build mosques in Germany and in other European countries .
He is an aggressive Muslim fundamentalist and has connections to various Islamists and terrorist organizations across the world .
He is currently being prosecuted in Germany for supporting radical organizations .
El - Zayat is typical of most Muslim activists in Germany .
In their schools and community centers , Muslim organizations incite hatred and violence against Jews and Christians .
In public , however , and before the media , they deny preaching violence .
El - Zayat , Gharaballi and the majority of radical Islamist imams , and officials of Muslim organizations receive big honorariums from the Saudis .
According to a study by Bielefeld University , over 30 percent of the Muslims living in Germany are radicalized .
They reject the German Constitution and hope to establish shari 'a Islamic law .
Many German politicians , in particular in the Green Party , often attribute radicalism among Muslims to social problems and lack of integration in German society .
For all these problems they blame the German side .
Former foreign minister Joschka Fischer stated , in an interview with German radio station WDR earlier this year , that Muslims should be left alone to believe and act the way they please .
" Other religions are not more liberal than Islam . "
The German Home Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has met with heads of Muslim organizations and Islam experts several times over the last two years , the latest was in March .
I attended all these meetings .
The heads of Muslim umbrella organizations tell the German government that they and their members accept the German Constitution .
Back in their communities they preach hatred and violence .
In mid-April , the German police raided the properties of a dozen Muslim extremists and arrested nine of them .
But this is only the tip of the iceberg .
The German media and the public appear to be wary of antagonizing Muslim radicals .
Very few media reproduced the Mohammad cartoons published in Denmark and they downplayed the recent anti-Islam Fitna film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders .
Radical Islam inculcates in impressionable young minds verses from the Koran that are incompatible with modern values and human rights , such as inciting hatred towards Jews and Christians .
Dalal , a 15 - year - old girl who attends a Muslim school in Ulm , was proud to tell me that her teacher told her not to greet non-Muslims .
It is haram ( forbidden ) , she said .
The radical Muslims also emphasize those passages that discriminate against women and incite violence against those who practice freedom of religion and speech .
Christianity and Judaism also have passages in their holy scripts that are incompatible with human rights .
But most Christians and Jews simply ignore these passages , consider them archaic , and instead apply more humane and rational ones .
Most Muslims ignore the more liberal passages that do exist in the Koran .
The majority of Muslims in Germany are peaceful people .
Radical Muslims are a minority .
But this minority dominates .
They are in key positions in the community and control mosques and organizations .
There is no hate - crime law in Germany .
The German government should enact such a law , like the one against Holocaust denial , making it an offense to incite to hatred and the violation of human rights .

between
The Bible and the cult book : " Christianity and Judaism also have passages in their holy scripts that are incompatible with human rights .
But most Christians and Jews simply ignore these passages , consider them archaic , and instead apply more humane and rational ones .
Most Muslims ignore the more liberal passages that do exist in the Koran . "
It also shows the differences between the " religions " and how jews / christians have evolved and those that follow this cult have not .
And that is one of the hallmarks of a cult : not evolving but to stay stagnant .

The author says " Most Muslims ignore the more liberal passages that do exist in the Koran " .
They ignore them because once Mohammed became powerful his ' more liberal ' passages no longer suited his new role as a successful warlord so he abrogated them ... he abolished them .
So Muslims are allowed to ignore them without being hypocrites .
Is n't Islam convenient !
Well done Dr. Sami Alrabaa .

It is through people like that the Islamic governments from the Middle Mast are trying to build a hegemony of Islam around the world .
The only way to stop it is by banning moslem people to enter western countries , no matter which country they are from .
Letting them enter your country , is like letting a hungry wolf enters your home .
Soon it will eat everything in your house , including you and your family .
Remember , Islam / Moslem has no ethical human values , only murders and terrorism and lusts , ha ha ha .....

Most of Moslem countries has oil as their economic strength .
But it will lasts only several decades more .
After the oil is spent , there 's nothing for them left as a means to stay in prosperity .
If , only if , the non-moslem countries pay tax to them ( Jiyza ) , then they can go on living , but it should be supported by strong military forces .
Exporting dates will never be enough to feed their people , ha ha ha .....

REJOICE WITH THEM !!
[ Prov. 5:18 ]
REJOICE WITH THE WIFE of your youth .
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; LET HER BREASTS SATISFY YOU AT ALL TIMES .
[ Song . 8:8 ]
We have a little sister , and she has no breasts .
What shall we do for our sister on the day when is spoken for ?
I was a wall , and MY BREASTS WERE LIKE TOWERS .
WOMAN'S VEIL IN THE BIBLE
[ 1 Corin . 11:5 ]
But any woman who prays and prophecies with her head unveiled dishonors her head - it is the same as if her head were shaven , for if a woman will not veil herself then she should cut off her hair .
But if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her wear a veil .
JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES ; is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
WOMAN IS NOT THE GLORY OF GOD
[ 1 Corin . 11:7 ]
For a man ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God , but woman is the glory of man , for man was not made for woman , but woman from man , neither was man created for woman , but woman for man .
REMAIN SILENCE !
[ 1 Tim 2:11 - 14 ]
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression .
SILENCE IN CHURCHES
[ 1 Corin 14:34 ]
Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to
speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law .
And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
WOMAN IS EVIL !
[ Zech . 5:7 ]
The leaden cover was lifted , there was a woman sitting , and he ( the angel ) said : this is wickedness .
GOD MAKES PEOPLE FALL IN ADULTERY
[ Amos 7:16 ]
God said to Am - a - zi'ah " You say , prophesy not against Israel and drop not your word against the house of Isaac ?
Thus the Lord says : YOUR WIFE SHALL BE AN HARLOT in the city and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword . "
[ Jer. 8:9 ]
They have rejected the word of the Lord .
Therefore I WILL GIVE THEIR WIVES UNTO OTHERS .
[ Jer. 13:22 ]
" For the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts discovered , AND YOUR HEELS MADE BARE .
I will discover your skirts upon your face , that your shame may appear I have seen your adulteries , and your neighings the lewdness of your whoredoms . "
HIDE WOMAN'S VOICE !
[ 1 Corin. 14:34 ]
The woman should keep silence in the churches , for they are not permitted to speak , but should be subordinate , as even the law says .
If there is any thing they desire to know let them ask their husbands at home .
For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church .
[ 1 Timo . 2:9 ]
Woman should adorn themselves modestly and sensibly in seemly apparel , not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly attire but by good deeds .
WOMAN FOR THE MAN
[ 1 Corin 11:5 - 10 ]
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovereddishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven .
For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
For the man is not of the woman : but the woman of the man .
Neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels . "
HOW TO RESCUE HER HUSBAND
[ Deut . 25:11 ]
When men fight with one another , and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him , and puts out her hand seizes him by the private parts , then you shall cut off her hand ; your eye shall have not pity .
MARRIAGE BY FORCE !!
[ Deut . 25:5 ]
If brothers dwell together , and one of them dies and has no son , the wife of the dead shall not be marries outside of the family to a stranger ; her husband 's brother shall go into her , and take her as his wife .
WHAT IF HE REFUSES ?
[ Deut . 25:7 ]
And if the man does not wish to take his brother 's wife then his brother 's wife shall go up to the gate of the elders , and say , " My husband 's brother refuses to perpetuate his brother 's name in Israel ..
Then the elders of his city shall call him .
And if he persists ..
Then his brother 's wife shall go up to him in the presence of the elders , and pull his sandal off his foot , and spit in his face ; and shall answer and say :
So it shall be done to the man who does not build up his brother 's house .
And the name of his house shall be called in Israel THE HOUSE OF HIM THAT HAD HIS SANDAL PULLED OFF .
UPRIGHT WOMEN !
[ Eccless 7:26 - 28 ]
And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare , whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains .
The man who pleases God will escape her , but the sinner she will ensnare .... while I was still searching but not finding , I found one upright man among a thousand but not one upright woman among them all " .
KILL WOMEN , CHILDREN , ANIMALS !!
[ Ezek . 9:5 ]
And the Lord said , " Go through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have you pity .
SLAY UTTERLY OLD AND YOUNG , BOTH MAIDS AND LITTLE CHILDREN , AND WOMEN .
[ Num. 31:1 ]
And the Lord said unto Moses , " Avenge the children of the Mid ' - an 'ites ..
They warred against the Mid' - i - an 'ites , as the Lord commanded Moses , and they slay all the males .
And they took all women as captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt , and all their goodly castles , with fire .
Moses said , " HAVE YOU SAVED ALL THE WOMEN ALIVE ?
NOW KILL EVERY MALE AMONG THE LITTLE ONES , AND KILL EVERY WOMAN that has known a man by lying with him , but all the young girls who have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves .
[ Josh 6:16 ]
Joshua said to the people of Israel , " The Lord has given you the city ( of the Canaanites ) .. all silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated unto the Lord :
They shall come into the treasury of the Lord .
The people utterly DESTROYED ALL THAT WAS IN THE CITY , BOTH MAN AND WOMAN , YOUNG AND OLD , AND OX AND SHEEP , AND ASS , WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD .
KILLING , KIDNAPPING , SLAVERY
[ Josh .
16:10 ]
So the Canaanites have dwelt in the midst of E'phraim to this day , but become slaves to do forced labour .
( see also Joshua 17:13 and Judg .
1:30 )
[ Judg . 21:10 ]
The congregation of Benjamin sent twelve thousand of their bravest men , and commanded them , " Go and smite the inhabitants of Ja' - besh - gil 'ead with the edge of the sword ; also the women and the little ones .
Every male and every
woman that has lain with a male YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY .
And they found among the inhabitants four hundred YOUNG VIRGINS who had not known a man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp of Shiloh , which is the land of Canaan .
And Benjamin returned at that time , and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Ja'besh - gil 'ead , but they did not suffice for them .
STEALING WOMEN !!
And they commanded the Benjaminites , saying : " Go and lie in wait in the vineyard , and watch , if the daughters of Shiloh go out to dance in the dances , then come out of the vineyard and seize each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh .
And the Benjaminites did so , and took their wives from the dancers whom they caught .
KILL THEM AND TAKE THEIR PROPERTIES
[ Deut. 20:10 ]
When you draw near to a city to fight against it , offer terms of peace to it .
And if its answer to you is peace and it opens to you , then all the people who are found in it SHALL BE FORCED LABOUR FOR YOU AND SHALL SERVE YOU .
But if it makes no peace with you , then you shall besiege it , ..
YOU SHALL PUT ALL ITS MALES TO THE SWORD , BUT THE WOMEN AND THE LITTLE ONES , the cattle and every thing else in the city all its spoil , YOU SHALL TAKE AS BOOTY FOR YOURSELVES ; AND YOU SHALL ENJOY THE SPOIL OF YOUR ENEMIES .
As scientists and engineers puzzle over how to inexpensively deliver thin - film photovoltaic solar cells , wave and tidal powered turbines , hydrogen - fueled cars , and other advanced technologies to reduce world dependence on fossil fuels , a team of college engineering students is working on a decidedly lower - tech , though no less difficult , project they hope will bring hydroelectric power to remote areas of the African country of Rwanda .
The group , part of Dartmouth College 's Thayer School of Engineering student - run Humanitarian Engineering Leadership Program ( HELP ) , in September set up two hydroelectric turbines powered by a local water source in Banda , a mountainous region at the edge of Nyungwe National Park with a population of around 6,000 .
The first site 's turbine — prebuilt and taken to Banda by the students — generates enough energy to charge six 12 - volt batteries concurrently .
" While the total power ( 310 watts ) is relatively low by American standards , its enough to charge up to 30 batteries per day , each of which only needs to be recharged once every two weeks , " engineering student Eric Trautmann , 23 , wrote in a September 19 blog on the group 's Web site .
Trautmann , who is pursuing his masters in robotics , is one of 15 Thayer electrical , environmental and mechanical engineering students working on the Rwanda project .
Eight of the students — including Trautmann — have traveled to Banda since June to get the turbines up and running , while the other seven helped plan the project , design the turbines , and provide backup support from the U.S .
The second turbine , built from scratch with local parts and labor , has been more troublesome .
The turbine 's charge controller — used to ensure batteries do not overcharge — has malfunctioned repeatedly , says student Derek Brand , 22 , who recently returned from Rwanda after a three - month stay .
While in Africa , Brand needed to travel several hours to another village in search of new parts to correct the problem .
The turbine is now up and running and producing 300 Watts of energy .
The students plan to , with help from the locals , upgrade the sites over time to improve their output to 1.5 kilowatts , enough meet all of the village 's electrical needs and more .
But for now , Brand says , increasing power is n't a top priority because the combination of energy produced by both sites is " more than enough to meet the town 's demand , at least until we return next summer . "
In the meantime , some of the Banda people use the turbine sites to recharge the car batteries that serve as the main power source for their homes ( providing the juice they need for lighting and to charge smaller batteries used in cell phones , flashlights and radios ) .
It is not uncommon for a Banda resident to walk dozens of miles over the area 's rough terrain with a 40 - pound ( 18 - kilogram ) battery balanced on his or her head to the nearest town with electricity , sleep the night there , and then walk back home the following day with the recharged battery .
One of the project 's aims has been to use locally available components and manufacturing techniques to make the turbines so the locals could build more of them on their own .
" This ensures sustainability and stimulates the local economy instead of importing foreign - made components , " says Benjamin Koons , 22 , a Thayer student set to graduate in March .
" HELP could add a fresh way of looking at hydro projects in the area , driven by locally available materials and labor as opposed to small efficiency gains and profits . "
The students point out in their blog ( which was closed to the public earlier this month due to complaints from some of Rwanda 's ministers ) that there are areas of the country already using small hydroelectric turbines , but that those machines cost as much as $ 4,000 per kilowatt to produce energy , a hefty sum for people here , where the average annual income is $ 260 .
The Thayer team 's ultimate goal is to develop systems that can reduce that cost to less than $ 500 per kilowatt by using local parts and labor instead of expensive foreign parts that are tough to come by in this rural pocket .
The hope is that Banda will serve as a proof of concept and encourage the building of additional hydropower turbines throughout Africa , which is heavily reliant on kerosene for lighting .
Africans consume nearly 3.8 million tons of kerosene annually , making it a significant contributor to climate change - causing greenhouse gas emissions , according to a report by the students .
The Thayer students anticipate the annual cost to run the hydroenergy turbines — including purchasing batteries and compact fluorescent bulbs — will be about $ 50 per family .
Banda families are already paying between $ 50 and $ 60 a year for kerosene , " making our system very competitive with kerosene lighting , while providing a much higher quality light , " Brand says .
" Furthermore , the cost of kerosene is tied to the cost of oil , which will probably rise in the future . "
African countries have been the recipients in recent years of a number of low - tech gadgets designed to improve education , provide access to clean water , and protect people there from disease .
London - based Pump Aid ( a charity formed by three teachers living and working in rural Zimbabwe ) developed the $ 740 Elephant water pump to help villagers gain access to clean water as well as the Elephant toilet , an outhouse sans plumbing that can be constructed using a slab of concrete and other readily available materials for about $ 30 .
Vestergaard Frandsen Group , a Switzerland - based philanthropy organization , makes a number of basic technologies targeting Africa , including the LifeStraw ( a powder blue plastic tube with filters that clears typhoid- , cholera - and diarrhea - causing microorganisms from water ) ; ZeroFly ( a sheet of plastic laminated with insecticide used to create temporary shelters ) ; and PermaNet ( an insecticide - treated curtain that protects against disease - carrying insects ) .
Meanwhile , South Africa 's Freeplay Foundation , a group that promotes access to radio broadcasting in remote pockets of Africa , offers communities in Rwanda and elsewhere its Lifeline radio , which is recharged by winding a spring - loaded handle .

Two years ago , a YouTube member named MadV — who silently performs magic tricks while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask — put up a short , cryptic video .
He held his hand up to the camera , showing what he 'd written on his palm : " One World . "
Then he urged viewers to respond .
The video was just 41 seconds long , but it caught people 's imagination .
Within a few days , hundreds of YouTube users had posted videos — shot on webcams , usually in their bedrooms — displaying their own scrawled messages : " Do n't quit ! " " Tread gently . "
" Think . " " Carpe diem . "
" Open your eyes . "
And my favorite , " They could be gone tomorrow ! "
Soon , MadV had inspired 2,000 replies , making it the most - responded - to video in YouTube 's history .
MadV stitched them all together into a long , voiceless montage , and it 's quite powerful .
All these people from across the globe convey something incredibly evocative while remaining completely mute .
So here 's my question :
What exactly is this ?
What do you call MadV 's project ?
It is n't quite a documentary ; it is n't exactly a conversation or a commentary , either .
It 's some curious mongrel form .
And it would have been inconceivable before the Internet and cheap webcams — prohibitively expensive and difficult to pull off .
This is what 's so fascinating about online video culture .
DIY tools for shooting , editing , and broadcasting video are n't just changing who uses the medium .
They 're changing how we use it .
We 're developing a new language of video — forms that let us say different things and maybe even think in different ways .
Here 's another example : a new trend on Flickr called the long portrait .
These are short videos in which the subjects simply stare into the camera .
The first time you see one , it 's unsettlingly intense .
The subject 's gaze — staring at you — totally discombobulates the normal voyeuristic payload of a photo .
It 's also a lovely comment on the hyperkinetic style of today 's world :
Slow down and look at something , will you !
What 's happening to video is like what happened to word processing .
Back in the ' 70s and early ' 80s , publishing was a rarefied , expert job .
Then Apple 's WYSIWYG interface made it drop - dead easy , enabling an explosion of weird new forms of micropublishing and zines .
Laptop audio editing did the same thing , giving birth to the mashup and cut - and - paste subgenres of music .
Then there 's photo manipulation , once a rarefied propaganda technique .
Photoshop made it a folk art .
In a sense , you could argue that even after 100 years of moving pictures , we still do n't know what video is for .
The sheer cost of creating it meant we used it for a stiflingly narrow set of purposes : news , documentaries , instructional presentations .
Now the lid is blowing off .
The Internet has shown us that video is also good for mass - distributed conversation — as with Talmudic response chains on YouTube or Vimeo , or even the super - short Twitter - like blurts of video on Seesmic .
I know people who use Skype for virtual closeness , leaving a video channel to their spouses open all day long while they work .
They 're not even looking at the feed or talking ; it 's like emotional wallpaper .
Who would have thought of doing that with a $ 10,000 videoconferencing rig ?
Marshall McLuhan pointed out that whenever we get our hands on a new medium we tend to use it like older ones .
Early TV broadcasts consisted of guys sitting around reading radio scripts because nobody had realized yet that TV could tell stories differently .
It 's the same with much of today 's webcam video ; most people still try to emulate TV and film .
Only weirdos like MadV are really exploring its potential .
A bigger leap will occur when we get better tools for archiving and searching video .
Then we 'll start using it the way we use paper or word processing : to take notes or mull over a problem , like Tom Cruise flipping through scenes at the beginning of Minority Report .
We think of video as a way to communicate with others — but it 's becoming a way to communicate with ourselves .

Drink Better Beer
You know the Christmas season is upon you when you see the salvation army ringing bells at Walmart , your neighbors houses are covered in lights and blaring Christmas tunes , but the best sign that Christmas is near is the wide assortment of Christmas beers that show up at the local liquor store ( hey , we ’re in Maryland , we ca n ’t buy beer in the grocery store ) .
There are Christmas spice beers , chock full of Vanilla and Nutmeg , but the best are Winter Warmers , with their high 6 % - 12 % alcohol contents .
I ’ve been reviewing beer for our Drink Better Beer series for a few months , and lately I ’ve reviewed quite a few Winter / Christmas / Holiday beers so I thought I ’d come with a list of the top 5 Christmas beers from the Drink Better Beer series .
Do n’t get upset if your favorite Christmas beer is n’t in this review , I ’m only one guy and can only drink so much beer , I ’ll try to get a bigger variety next year .
Click on the beer to see the full review .
Since I only reviewed 7 winter beers this year I thought I ’d start out with a 3 way tie for fifth .
Even though these are tied for last place they ’re not terrible beers .
Samuel Smith ’s Winter Welcome
Ale has a relatively low alcohol content compared to some of the beers on this list , but at 6 % it provides a bit of a kick compared to a typical American Lager .
It ’s not hoppy , it does n’t have any winter spices but it ’s a smooth easy to drink light colored ale .
Leinenkugel ’s Fireside Nut Brown has an even lower alcohol content ( 4.9 % ) but this one is a winter spice beer not a winter warmer .
It has a nice smokey scent and a sweet malty flavor with just a hint of vanilla .
Michelob Winter ’s Bourbon Cask
Ale is also a spice beer , but it has the same amount of alcohol as the Samuel Smith ’s ( 6 % ) .
The bottle says it was aged on bourbon oak casks with whole Madagascar vanilla beans .
I thought it has a nice malty flavor but the the vanilla was a little too much .
Unlike the # 5 beers Clipper City Winter Storm kicks the alcohol content up a notch to 7.5 % .
Clipper City Winter Storm is a balanced winter warmer with a nice malty flavor and mild hoppy finish .
Clipper City Describes it as ruddy hued “ Imperial ESB ” ( extra special bitter ) in style , which hits the nail on the head , it ’s a very aggressive yet balanced beer .
Winter Storm is brewed by Clipper City Brewing Company in Baltimore , Md and is part of their “ Heavy Seas ” line of beers .
Now , I ’m going to jump to the other side of the US with Sierra Nevada 2008 Celebration Ale .
Celebration
Ale has a nice 6.8 % alcohol content providing that pleasant warming sensation that we ’re all looking for in a winter warmer .
It ’s a pleasantly hoppy IPA , with a bit of malty sweetness and just a touch of those winter spices , that were a little to strong in a few of the previous beers .
2008 Celebration
Ale is made by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in Chico , CA .
As you might be able to figure out on your own this winter beer is a winter warmer .
Pursuit of Happiness is big beer , it ’s very hoppy , it ’s 8.25 % alcohol , but somehow that ’s all balanced by a malty sweetness that just makes this beer a pleasure to drink .
This beer is perfect for sitting back in front of a fire on a cold winter night .
Pursuit of Happiness Winter Warmer is made by Clay Pipe Brewing in Frederick , Md. They ’re a small brewing with only a few beers , but they ’re very good , this one being my favorite .
And the Number 1 Christmas Beer is …Troegs The Mad Elf Ale
I thought that “ The Pursuit ” was going to be number 1 and then I tried The Mad Elf , and all I could say was Mmm .
The Mad Elf
Ale is certainly both a winter warmer and a winter spice beer , to start with this beer is 11 % alcohol .
You might think that it would be overpowering but it ’s balanced by it ’s fantastic flavor .
Mad Elf
Ale is brewed with honey and cherries , ending up with a flavor reminiscent of Dogfish Head ’s Midas Touch .
Amazingly , even with honey and cherries it ’s not too sweet , because it ’s offset by that high alcohol content and just enough hoppy bitterness .
Troegs Brewing Company brews
The Mad Elf Ale in Harrisburg , Pa , and distributes it to PA , NJ , DE , MD , and VA .
Because of this small distribution footprint you might have trouble finding this beer , but if you have the chance , try it .

The Washington Post brings to light just how big an impact Obama ’s pledge will have for renewable energy companies .
We ’re already seeing high profile interest in funding entrepreneurs in solar , wind and alternative energy ; early next year we could see a boom !
President - elect Barack Obama wants the nation to derive 10 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2012 , up from 2 percent today .
That comes on top of the global push for green power , making wind and solar power companies a good bet .
It ’s been a rocky road for the high flying sector , recently as the credit crunch has reduced investors willingness to capitalize any company , least of all those involved in risky new ventures .
But , that has n’t stopped big names like T. Boone Pickens from investing in wind power and ..
The outlook is … sunny for First Solar ( FSLR ) , which makes solar panels .
The rapidly growing firm , which has the least expensive manufacturing cost per watt in the industry , has consistently notched up impressive sales and earnings growth .
Analysts expect sales , just $ 48 million in 2005 , to reach $ 1.2 billion this year and nearly $ 2.1 billion in 2009 … 44 percent of ( the stock ) is owned by the Walton family of Wal - Mart fame .
As January 20th and a new era in American Politics moves closer , alternative energy companies will have a variety of funding choices , from exchange traded funds like First Trust Global Wind Energy to high net worth individuals to mezzanine financiers .
A good place to start looking for that capital might be The Funded.com , an online site for entrepreneurs to research , rate , and review funding sources worldwide .
and to assist one another finding good investors .
There are of course , a variety of opportunities available right now .
What are you seeing ?
Is the credit crunch easing for renewable energy companies ?

Are you in search of a sex toy store to buy a sex toy to liven up your boring sex life ?
All you need to do is surf the internet .
There are a lot of them there , although choosing one may be overwhelming .
What makes it even more difficult is the countless options of sex toys that you can choose from .
Do you wish that the sex toy you will buy would look like your dream girl ?
Or will you be contented with just a part of her ?
Do you know that the most expensive toy costs USD 1.3 million ?
At least we have our budget to limit our choices , or else it would truly be difficult to zero in on one .
The choice of an online store where to purchase a sex toy is crucial .
The first thing to consider is how safe sex toys are that are being sold in the store .
Buying an unsafe sex toy can negate your purpose of pleasure and enjoyment because it can harm you all along .
Here are some ways to how you can spot a reputable online sex toy shop .
Know If It ’s Accredited
It helps to look for the accreditation of an online shop before making your order .
A certification or license can keep a store to be responsible and accountable to its clients .
In its business website , you find its exact address , name of the manager , and contact number and person .
You should try contacting the store by way of telephone and not through email alone .
This way , you can be surer that the store actually exists .
Go Over Customer Reviews
Customer reviews are very important when buying products or services online .
This is because you cannot try the product or service personally .
You may have to rely on other people ’s experiences .
Customer reviews usually center on essential things you need to know , namely , the quality of product and service being sold , promptness of shipment , and if the store is a scam .
Going with what the majority of past customers are saying may help you to avoid being scammed .
Test the Customer Service
A store selling several kinds of sex toys should know their products very well .
When clients ask details about some products , they should be answered promptly , honestly , and competently .
Customer service should be round - the - clock .
Products Are Properly Labeled
Some new sex toys may have been seen by a customer at all .
He may not know how and where to use it .
An online sex toy store should label all the products as to the manner of using it and the materials used to produce it , aside from the price .
All pictures of the products should not be photo - shopped . …
Cheryl Corralejo is mad as hell at Comcast , and she is n't going to take it anymore .
The object of her righteous crusade ?
Cable box rentals .
Corralejo wants to own her box outright , and she has filed a class action complaint on behalf of all other Californians who desperately want to stop paying monthly fees just for a bit of decryption equipment .
The case , filed in federal court in California , began in late November and was recently unearthed by Multichannel News .
Comcast has yet to respond .
The gist of the case , according to a copy of the complaint seen by Ars Technica , is rental fees .
Corralejo argues that Comcast has a monopoly over video service in her area and that it uses that monopoly power to force her to use decryption equipment , which Corralejo cannot purchase outright .
After only a few months , alleges the complaint , end users have already paid Comcast more than the box is worth .
Reading the complaint through is an odd experience , because the first pages sound like something written when the whole CableCARD debate was pending before the Federal Communications Commission .
In the end , the FCC forced the industry to separate out its decryption equipment into a physical CableCARD that could be acquired separately from a cable company box and could be inserted into any third - party video gear that supported it .
In other words , renting a cable box has not actually been a requirement of cable operators for years .
On page six , the complaint finally gets around to the point , acknowledging it but arguing that CableCARDs are n't the equivalent of set - top boxes .
The complaint quotes from Comcast 's own website , which points out that " the full range of interactive services " may not be available with a CableCARD , as current host devices generally support only one - way operation .
In addition , Corralejo complains that the CableCARD still has to be rented from the company ; it can not be purchased outright .
There 's simply no way to avoid some form of rental fee .
( Comcast 's website indicates that the first CableCARD a customer needs is included in the monthly bill , however ; only additional CableCARDs cost money , currently " up to $ 2.05 " a month . )
These practices are called " unlawful tying " under the Sherman Antitrust Act , as well as a violation of California 's business and professions code .
Kudos to Salon for having the interest , less than two weeks before a presidential election , to still fund and run an interview with Stephen King to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his opus The Stand .
As conducted by John Marks , the discussion is a typically great sit - down with the best - selling writer of all time , replete with the horror master ’s sardonic wit and self - criticism .
It ’s essential reading for anyone who likes the man ’s books , and perhaps even more so for those who have never read them out of snobbery .
King has sold so many books and become such a cultural institution that any serious reader eventually has to come to grips with him .
The common thinking is that no writer can be so popular and still be considered “ literary ” ; perhaps the better question is , how can a writer who speaks to such a tremendous audience be truly “ bad ” ?
King is unabashed about his stylistic shortcomings , namely a complete lack of style , which he likens to early - 20th century writers like Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser .
In 2003 , a quarter - century after publishing his best - loved book , King received the National Book Association ’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters , and he gave an eminently quotable acceptance speech that included the following :
I was in those early days [ of my career ] so often bitterly angry at writers who were considered " literary . "
I knew I did n't have quite enough talent or polish to be one of them so there was an element of jealousy , but I was also infuriated by how these writers always seemed to have the inside track in my view at that time .
He refers to the unfair assumption that his books , because they were so popular , were written for money .
It ’s a bizarre conclusion to reach , particularly given how many of King ’s books are exceedingly long ( The Stand , in its unexpurgated version released in 1990 , runs over 1100 pages ) and brimming with gross ( not titillating ) subject matter .
As for the dismissive claim that his books are merely first drafts for eventual and inevitable movie treatments , that ignores the fact that most King - based movies , in addition to being aesthetic failures , have also tanked financially .
For every Shawshank Redemption and Carrie , there ’s a handful of Thinners , Cujos , Dreamcatchers , and of course , the TV miniseries of The Stand .
The Salon interview , which mostly addresses that book , contains much of King ’s typical modesty .
Asked to account for his success , for instance , he nearly brushes it off :
Some of it is chronological accident .
I 'm a baby boomer , and I 'm an old baby boomer .
I was born in 1947 .
You ca n't say I 'm the oldest of the old , but I 'm close to it .
I was the first in that generation to become a best - selling writer in my own right , so I was the guy , the first guy , I think , I can't think of anyone else , to become a bestseller and join people from the old guard like Irwin Shaw , James Michener and Herman Wouk .
I was the guy who wrote best - selling books who had also marched in demonstrations against the war in Vietnam .
Here , I think , we have the key to King ’s success , both artistically and commercially .
The man has a distinctly American ( one has to assume it ’s also rural New England ) avoidance of bullshit at all costs .
As seen in his tremendous memoir On Writing , he writes purely for the visceral thrill of storytelling .
There ’s always an audience in mind for King , and subsequently , always a pressure to entertain .
And since the more hoity - toity gatekeepers of the literary world do n’t very much value entertainment for it's own sake as an inherently worthwhile pursuit , it blinds them to the extraordinary creativity in King ’s work that overcomes any stylistic deficit he may have .
I ’ve read a handful of King ’s novels , and while The Stand is n’t my favorite ( that would be It , the grim and beautiful affront to anyone who thinks the man ca n’t write , and one of the best American novels of the last 25 years ) , it ’s certainly the greatest testament to the breadth of his imaginative powers , as well as the best example of his numerous shortcomings .
It ’s a hugely ambitious novel , in which a plague called Captain Trips is accidentally loosed from an American military base and wipes out most of the country ’s population within days .
Then the forces of good and evil have to do battle one more ( not last ) time for the fate of humankind .
It ’s all great fun , filled with memorable characters and set pieces , and it also exemplifies the shortcomings that detractors cite in King ’s work : for one , it ’s unnecessarily long , in desperate need of a sympathetic editor ( although it was King ’s fans , not he , that demanded the eventual “ director ’s cut ” version be published ) .
It ’s also persistently melodramatic , with a brusque approach to characterizations that sometimes works and sometimes falls flat .
But still , that ambition .
King ’s desire to entertain , to will his audience into his narrative spell , is on every page .
And when his scary moments work — my favorite is an office meeting when the evil Randall Flagg slowly reveals his powers to a follower — they are as emotionally engaging as any book you ’ll read , it just so happens that the emotion is fear .
And The Stand contains what I consider to be the quintessential Stephen King sentence , describing the long - suffering man-child called Trashcan Man , who suffers brutally at the hands of a sadistic redneck named The Kid .
In the aftermath of a viral near - apocalypse , and after being routinely sodomized by the abuser that he ’s too scared to leave , Trashcan Man experiences the following : “ He made wee - wee in his pants , and his mind dissolved into a madly fluttering black bird of panic . ”
That ’s Stephen King in a nutshell — simultaneously crude and poetically over - ambitious beyond his stylistic abilities .
But it ’s also strangely , undeniably descriptive on a visceral level .
It ’s a testament to his storytelling powers , and his understanding of the most primal human emotions , that 30 years after writing a sentence that bizarre and uneven , King is now a National Book Association - certified writer and worthy of celebration on a site as knowingly high - culture as Salon .
He deserves all credit he ’s finally being given .

Robert Marion LaFollette ( 1855 -1925 ) delivered the following speech in the Senate on March 17 , 1908 , in response to Senate bill 3023 to amend the national banking laws .
[ While the public ’s mind and the Hearst and the Pulitzer papers ( and other papers ) were preoccupied with the sex - life and murder of Stanford White , and the night of the " velvet swing " ; while senators and congressmen interrupted their business to read the details of the " trial of the century " in the evening papers , there was some trouble in America ]
Congressional Record — Senate

1908 March 17
Senate bill 3023
AMENDMENT OF NATIONAL BANKING LAWS .
The Vice - President .
The Secretary will suspend .
The hour of 2 o’clock having arrived , the Chair lays before the Senate the unfinished business , which will be stated by the Secretary .
The SECRETARY .
A bill ( S. 3023 ) to amend the national banking laws .
Mr. ALDRICH .
The Senator from Wisconsin [ Mr. La Follette ] is now in the Chamber , and he has given notice of his intention to speak to - day .
I do not know whether he desires to speak now or whether he will wait until the appropriation bill is completed .
Mr. La Follette .
I shall be glad to begin whenever the Senate is ready to yield me the time .
Mr. CULLOM . Mr. President — —
The Vice - President .
Does the Senator from Wisconsin yield to the Senator from Illinois ?
Mr. La Follette .
Certainly .
Mr. CULLOM .
This morning , when the routine morning business was completed , I inquired if the Senator from Wisconsin was present , as he had given notice that he desired to speak to - day .
He was not here , and hence I called up the appropriation bill .
It will be but a little while , I think , before the reading of the bill for action on the committee amendments will be completed .
I will then be willing to allow the Senator to take the floor , if that course is agreeable to him .
Mr. La Follette .
I would like to begin as soon as possible .
Mr. CULLOM .
I have no objection .
If the Senator desires to begin now , I will let the bill go over until after he gets through with his speech .
Mr. La Follette .
The Senator is very kind , and I shall be glad to begin at once , if the Senator will permit the bill under consideration to go over .
Mr. CULLOM .
All right .
AMENDMENT OF NATIONAL BANKING LAWS .
The Senate , as in Committee of the Whole , resumed the consideration of the bill ( S. 3023 ) to amend the national banking laws .
Mr. La Follette .
Mr. President , what I have to say upon the pending bill is made more pertinent , if possible , by the unexpected announcement just now made by the chairman of the Finance Committee of the intention to amend it by striking out the provision for the use of railroad bonds as security for emergency currency .
The ALDRICH bill in my view — and I use that term because the measure pending before the Senate bears the country over the name of its author — can not be fairly judged without considering the changes which have been wrought in the industrial and commercial life of this country within a decade , and the consequent changes that have taken place in banking within a few years .
It is to be expected that the remarkable industrial development of a country will induce corresponding growth in banking .
To meet the increasing demand of expanding business new banks must be established , and established banks must make large additions to capital , surplus , and undivided profits .
Such changes may be extraordinary , but they should be natural , measuring year by year the growing commercial development of the nation .
But something besides a normal growth of business and resulting demands upon our currency system requires attention in connection with this proposed legislation .
CONSOLIDATION OF BANKING AND “ BIG BUSINESS . ”
Eighteen hundred and ninety - eight was the beginning of great industrial reorganization .
Men directly engaged in production brought about in the first instance an association of the independent concerns which they had built up .
These reorganizations were at the outset limited to those turning out finished products similar in kind .
Within a period of three years following , 149 such reorganizations were effected with a total stock and bond capitalization of $ 3,784,000,000 .
In making these reorganizations the opportunity for a large paper capitalization offered too great a temptation to be resisted .
This was but the first stage in the creation of fictitious wealth .
The success of these organizations led quickly on to a consolidation of combined industries , until a mere handful of men controlled the industrial production of the country .
The opportunity to associate the reorganization of the industrial institutions of the country with banking capital presented itself .
Such connections were a powerful aid to reorganization , and reorganization offered an unlimited field for speculation .
It was a tremendous temptation .
It contributes nothing of value to this discussion to denounce individuals on the one hand or laud them on the other .
I have compiled a list of about one hundred men with their directorships in the great corporate business enterprises of the United States .
It furnishes indisputable proof of the community of interest that controls the industrial life of the country .
I shall ask , Mr. President , to have incorporated in the RECORD this list of about 100 men with their directorships .
It discloses their connections with the transportation , the industrial , and the commercial life of the American people .
This exhibit will make it clear to anyone that a small group of men hold in their hands the business of this country .
No student of the economic changes in recent years can escape the conclusion that the railroads , telegraph , shipping , cable , telephone , traction , express , mining , iron , steel , coal , oil , gas , electric light , cotton , copper , sugar , tobacco , agricultural implements , and the food products are completely controlled and mainly owned by these hundred men ; that they have through reorganization multiplied their wealth almost beyond their own ability to know its amount with accuracy .
It is not necessary to examine in detail the related events that have led to this marvelous concentration of business .
The facts are well understood and generally recognized .
But the country seems not to understand how completely great banking institutions in the principal money centers have become bound up with the control of industrial institutions , nor the logical connection of this relationship to the financial depression which we have so recently suffered , nor the dangers which threaten us from this source in the future .
That there was a tendency on the part of the great banking associations to merge and combine could not be overlooked ; and while financial and economic writers had directed public attention to the fact , and had even pointed out the opportunity and temptation for the use of this augmented power in connection with the promotion of the speculative side of business organization , they have been slow to believe that banking institutions could be so prostituted .
Nevertheless , most conservative authorities suggested and foreshadowed the dangers that unfortunately actually exist .
FINANCIAL BANKING RESPONSIBLE FOR MONEY STRINGENCY .
An English economist , writing in Littell ’s Living Age for December 26 , 1906 , concludes an analysis of the currency - reform programme proposed , respectively , by the committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce and the committee of the American Banking Association then under discussion , as follows :
Unfortunately , however , defective as the present currency system is , all the evils complained of are not due to its defects .
In part they have resulted from the way in which the system has been worked .
Thus the recent extreme stringency of money in New York would probably never have arisen if the banks , instead of preparing for the autumn demands , had not locked up their funds to far too great an extent in the financiering of Wall street .
That the banks are to a large extent under the domination of the big financiers is well known , and the recent insurance investigations have shown how , under such domination , private interests may be made to prevail over those of the public .
In an address delivered before the Minnesota Bankers ’ Association at Lake Minnetonka , Thomas F. Woodlock , formerly editor of the Wall Street Journal , author of the Anatomy of Railway Reports , and now a member of the New York Exchange , gave this warning :
The one thing that stands out most prominent , in my judgment , with reference to Wall street banking is the danger of the concentration of banking powers in the hands of a few great speculative interests .
We have clearly defined tendencies in Wall street , the ultimate effect of which is likely to be the creation of two or three powerful groups of banks .
There is , for example , the so - called “ Standard Oil ” group of banks , headed by the National City ; there is the so - called “ Morgan Life Insurance ” group , with the National Bank of Commerce and the First National Bank at its head .
These two groups contain many of the most powerful banks in New York City , and together account for a very large proportion of the total volume of credit at the disposal of the public .
* * *
The connection between the management of the banks in New York City and the great financial and speculative interests is very close , and if we ever have serious banking trouble it will come from this fact .
In an article on the “ Concentration of banking interests in the United States , ” written in 1905 , Charles J. Bullock , professor of economics , Williams College , says :
Unlike the central banks of other countries , our largest institutions are closely connected with various industrial interests , so that they do not occupy an independent position .
Their policy is not controlled with sole regard for the general welfare of our banking system ; but they have been drawn into vast enterprises , into promotion or reorganization , often of a speculative character , and have displayed less , not more , than ordinary conservatism .
The National City Bank stood sponsor for the Amalgamated Copper Company , and the First National Bank has lent its aid to the various undertakings with which Mr. Morgan has been identified .
Mr. President , I shall later call the attention of the Senate to these two great groups of banks referred to by Mr. Bullock , which are every day increasing their control of the banking business of this country , Standard Oil at the head of one and Morgan at the head of the other .
I should like the Senate to remember that this writer , speaking simply as a student of economics and finance , singles out the heads of these two groups to illustrate the dangers of the association of banks with industrial promotion and speculative enterprises .
Continuing , Professor Bullock says :
It is to be feared that our financiers have not yet learned the difference between banking and the promotion of companies —
In reading this , I need not suggest to Senators that Professor Bullock , being at the head of the economics department of an old renowned Massachusetts college , would certainly be very conservative in all that he might write —
It is to be feared that our financiers have not yet learned the difference between banking and the promotion of companies ; but until this distinction is better understood , New York City will not rival London as an international financial center .
* * *
The concentration of banking power has now proceeded so far that discussion has inevitably arisen concerning the length to which it will be carried , and the possible dangers of the movement .
In the counting room and upon the streets New Yorkers are still pondering upon these questions , and not infrequently printed remarks are made about the “ money trust . ”
If this expression were heard only in the region of the one hundredth meridian , its interpretation would be obvious , but within the sacred precincts of Wall street such words can not fail to produce a certain impression .
Mark you , Mr. President , I am quoting from recognized authority , not upon present conditions , but upon the situation as it presented itself to students of government finance three or four or five years ago .
WALL STREET JOURNAL ON FINANCIAL BANKING .
As early as in 1903 the Wall Street Journal , in an editorial , entitled “ Evolution of a strong financial oligarchy , ” thus strongly set forth the dangerous tendencies in banking :
In the New York money market there are now seven great groups or chains of banks , trust companies , and insurance companies .
These groups in some cases represent common ownership , and in others such an alliance of interests that the very institutions are controlled practically under a common policy .
The tendency is for the large banks to control by ownership several smaller banks , and to be in close alliance with one or more trust companies .
After giving a classification of the different groups with the amount of loans outstanding , this editorial shows that there is a close bond of business interests among the groups , so that they are often operated together .
It says :
The two insurance companies are , for instance , united in the Western National Bank .
Messrs . J.P. Morgan & Co. have affiliations with three of the groups , mainly that of the First National Bank , that of the Bank of Commerce , and , in a measure , that of the National City Bank .
The Standard Oil Company is , of course , closely affiliated with the National City and the Hanover National groups .
The seventh group , the largest in number of institutions though not in amount of loans , is the socalled “ Morse group . ”
Let me say , Mr. President , that this described the beginning of bank consolidation .
This editorial , written in 1903 , speaks of seven organizations .
There are far less to - day .
To return — and please note that I am still reading from the Wall Street Journal —
In many respects the evolution outlined in the foregoing features is more remarkable and perhaps more important than the great evolution in industrial finance of the past few years .
It may be that the high organization of credit will tend to prevent panics in the time to come .
The Wall Street Journal was giving them the benefit of the doubt —
It may be that it will have quite the contrary result .
In any event , it is clear that its effect for good or ill upon the destinies of those who are accustomed to use credit in their business will be very far - reaching .
Under the title “ Perils of the money trust , ” the Wall Street Journal again pointed out these dangers in the following language :
What is taking place is a concentration of banking that is not merely a normal growth , but a concentration that comes from combination , consolidation , and other methods employed to secure monopolistic power .
Not only this , but this concentration has not been along the lines of commercial banking .
The great banks of concentration are in close alliance with financial interests intimately connected with promotion of immense enterprises , many of them being largely speculative .
The bank credits of the country are being rapidly concentrated in the hands of a few bankers who are more interested in banking on its financial ( watered stock ) side than in banking on its commercial side .
Such concentration as this is dangerous in a political sense .
The people have already been greatly disturbed by the concentration that has taken place in the industrial world .
* * * But concentration in the industrial world is a far less menacing condition than concentration in banking .
The men or set of men who control the credits of the country control the country .
And if this concentration continues at the rapid rate with which it has progressed in the past ten years there will surely come a time when the people , alarmed at the growth , will rise up in some vigorous measures to assert their power .
Such an uprising would involve the most serious consequences and would likely be carried to the most unreasonable limits .
There can be no doubt that further concentration of banking power in New York is the end in view of some of our leading bankers .
They believe that there will be a further reduction in the number of banks and a farther increase in the power of the big banks .
That is one reason why this banking concentration needs to be studied and its consequences carefully weighed .
But there is still another reason why this development in modern banking is open to criticism .
It is largely a departure from commercial banking .
It is turning the power over bank credits into financial ( stock promotion ) channels .
So long as the country is prosperous no immediate danger may be apprehended from such a development as that .
* * *
But it is always the unexpected that happens , and our panics are commonly ushered in by some unforeseen calamity and it is a fair inquiry to make whether banking conducted on a “ department - store ” principle , with credits concentrated in a few great institutions , and with these institutions having large interests in financial and speculative enterprises , would be in a position in such a moment of unexpected calamity to do more than to protect the financial and speculative interests with which it is allied .
In such a contingency , what protection would be left for the great commercial interests of the country ?
Does that not sound like a prophecy for the times through which this country and its commercial interests have just passed ?
GROWTH OF FINANCIAL BANKING .
The closeness of business association between Wall street and the centralized banking power of New York can , unfortunately , be but imperfectly traced through the official reports .
It would seem that the radical changes taking place in the banking business of the country , suggesting to the conservative , economic , and financial authorities the gravest possible dangers to our industrial and commercial integrity , might well have caused the Treasury Department to recognize the necessity of so directing its investigations of the national banks in the greater cities which are centers of speculation and to so classify their returns as to inform itself and the country definitely respecting such changes .
This has not been done .
Financial and economic writers have long complained of the form of classification of credits in Government reports .
Eminent students of finance have given warning of the dangers arising from too close association of combined banking interests with Wall street .
The report of the Armstrong committee established the connection , and yet the classifications in the official report of condition of these banks remains mixed as to securities , so that investigation is made vastly more laborious and unsatisfactory , if not altogether baffled .
It is , however , possible to find evidence which establishes the diversion of a large volume of the bank resources to securities which are the subject of speculative operation in the stock exchange .
The ratio of the aggregate investment in “ bonds , stocks , and other securities ” ( not including United States bonds ) to the total individual deposits of the national banks increased from 7.2 per cent in 1890 to 16.2 per cent in 1907 .
The ratio of “ stocks , bonds , securities , etc. , ” to capital , surplus , and undivided profits held by the national banks of the United States increased from 12 per cent in 1890 to 42.9 per cent in 1907 .
Official figures do not show the real condition .
The reports from banks upon which statistics are based fail to make clear the actual investment in speculative securities , not only through classification , but they fail for another reason .
Banks secure information in advance that reports will be called for at a given time .
Indeed , such notice comes to them through news dispatches from Washington direct .
This gives an opportunity to sweep out and patch up and put the house in order , and the opportunity is not neglected .
There is another reason why the actual holdings of banks in such securities are not shown in more recent reports .
These banks have either established connections with trust companies or have organized inside trust companies as a protection and convenience .
The bank and trust company , though differently officered , will be found closely welded together in their directorates .
These companies afford a convenient cover for the banks in many ways .
Their securities can be borrowed and shuffled back and forth to make a good showing .
The trust companies can handle securities which the banks can not touch .
They can underwrite bonds and float loans for which the banks could not openly stand sponsor .
They can deal with themselves in innumerable ways to their own benefit and the detriment of the public .
As the interests represented by the great banks use their customers , so they use to a less degree the various State , private , and savings banks which they control .
The growth of financial banking appears even more marked when all classes of financial institutions are taken together .
The ratio of stock and bond investments of national , State , private , and savings banks and trust companies to their total individual deposits , as shown by the reports of the Comptroller of the Currency , has increased from 8.9 per cent in 1890 to 28.2 per cent in 1907 .
The total holdings by advance and trust companies in these stocks and bonds , exclusive of United States bonds , amounted in 1907 to over $ 3,690,000,000 .
By reliable estimate , based on extensive investigation by an independent New York banking house , to which I shall have occasion to refer a little later , the holdings of the banks and trust companies were three years ago almost a billion dollars in railroad bonds alone .
The effect of the proposed legislation becomes more apparent as we investigate the grouping together of the great financial institutions holding these railroad bonds and other special securities and then trace their connection with the companies issuing these bonds .
Mr. President , the bare names of the directors of two great bank groups — the Standard Oil group and the Morgan group — given in connection with their other business associations is all the evidence that need be offered of the absolute community of interest between banks , railroads , and all the great industries .
There are twenty - three directors of the National City Bank ( Standard Oil ) .
There are thirty - nine directors of the National Bank of Commerce ( Morgan ) .
Examination of these directorates shows that the two groups are being knit together in business associations , suggesting their ultimate unification .
Subject to personal differences which may arise between powerful individuals of these different groups , resulting in occasional collision , they are practically a monopoly , and as far as the public is concerned , practically one group .
The business partner of the head of the Morgan group is found on the directorate of the chief financial institution which heads the Standard Oil group .
And one of the leading directors of the National City Bank ( Standard Oil ) is a member of the board of directors of the principal financial institution in the Morgan group .
The directors of the leading organizations comprising the two principal groups are bound together in mutual interest as shareholders in the various industrial concerns which have been financed by one or the other of these groups in recent years .
Remember that these sixty - two men who are directors of the two banks standing at the head of the two great groups are not additional to the list of less than 100 men to whom I have referred as controlling the industrial life of the nation , but a most important part of it .

Now here 's a policy that will win over the children .
Cabinet Office Minister Tom Watson says youngsters should be encouraged to play more on computer consoles like Xboxes .
He reckons even violent games can be educational and increase intelligence .
Mr Watson , who is in charge of encouraging new technology across Government , said : " Basically , I think playing games is a good thing .
" I 'd rather my boy be playing on his Wii than passively watching telly .
" Most games are educational .
They make you think , focus , challenge and change - 500 years ago a medium that did this would be called art . "
Mr Watson revealed his three - year - old son learned to count using a Telly Tubbies game .
And he said a friend 's eight - year - old learned how to make bronze - by mixing copper and tin - after playing Runequest .
He added : " Even the fun stuff has serious real - world applications . "
But the remarks clash with Government attempts to cut childhood obesity .
Ministers want parents to stop children playing on consoles .
Former sports minister Richard Caborn said : " We all have a role to play in encouraging young people to get out from behind their computer games and playing sport . "
Figures this week showed a quarter of five - year - olds are overweight or obese .
That rises to a third by the age of 11 .
ARE COMPUTER GAMES GOOD FOR KIDS ?
YES says KEVIN LYNCH Mirror Technology Expert
While conventional wisdom used to say that staring at a screen for hours was bad for your eyes , there 's evidence to suggest gaming can improve your visual skills and actually " sharpen the mind " .
A recent study by the US government 's National Institute of Health , found regular players of shootem - ups like Half - Life and Medal of Honour were better at spotting details in busy , confusing scenes and could cope with more distractions than average .
And researchers found that doctors who spent at least three hours a week playing video games made 37 per cent fewer mistakes .
On top of this , the Nintendo Wii is a great way for kids to keep fit and active .
There is also now a positive sociable side to modern gaming with the likes of Xbox Live and Sony 's PS3 Network allowing you to play against pals and make new friends .
And the likes of Singstar and Rockband actively encourage you to gather some mates and have a singsong !
Screens creating obese children
NO says HEATHER WELFORD Childcare & Parenting Author
No One would deny that these games can be fun .
And some may even be educational .
But the risk is that children play them at the expense of interaction with real people - especially parents and friends .
It 's preposterous to claim that children need these games to develop properly .
Sitting at the table eating a meal will help to develop their co-ordination skills just as well and a three - year - old can learn to count by playing simple games with mum and dad .
There is plenty of research to show that children are spending too long in front of computer and TV screens and missing out on active playtime outside - the rise in childhood obesity is testament to that .
The research I have seen shows children are now starting school with shorter concentration spans , poor social skills and language delay .
At least partly to blame is parents relying on computers to entertain youngsters .

Is ' Good Design ' an asphyxiating dogma ?
Design is a peculiar activity :
It 's a creative process , but a process that subscribes to and reinforces certain restrictive attitudes .
It can be rigid and self - policing , since a profession that earns its living by discerning what is good and bad must necessarily become judgmental .
Ultimately this judgmental nature creates and enshrines certain points of view , which left unchallenged , become dogma .
Today , one could argue that this dogma , generally predicated on longstanding ideas of ' rightness ' and ' beauty ' is choking the profession down , and worse yet , stifling its creativity as it faces some truly great problems problems which if handled with new thinking and true creativity , will define the substance , practice and contribution of a generation of designers .
Embracing the word " ugly " so readily identified with everything popular design claims to have been a reaction againstseems a logical choice if we are to create a vision for the practice of design freed from the restrictions and prejudices of its past .
How might product designers better position the discipline to take on the hairy problems of sustainability , economic uncertainty , global competition and the like ?
Well , one thing is for certain , simply co-opting present patterns of consumption into activities and services linked to conservation wo n't get us there .
That path might work if the world population of 6.5 billion was to stay fixed , but with an additional 3 billion consumers arriving to the party by 2050 we 'll need to find more expedient ( read : more creative ) solutions .
Longtime anathema of design circles , I 'd like to suggest that design capitalize on UGLY 's present arrival on the scene to boldly re-imagine itself and its future .
Appropriating UGLY affords a latitude that would serve to liberate design and design thinking , expediting the introduction of new voices and ideas that might stimulate and revitalize the practice of design .
Embracing a word so readily identified with everything popular design claims to have been a reaction against seems a logical choice if we are to create a vision for the practice of design freed from the restrictions and prejudices of its past .
UGLY thinking :
Where do we look for it ?
There are three contemporary developments I believe are already starting to re-characterize design ; three developments that when mingled with the liberating effects of thinking UGLY offer potential insights on the future practice and content of design .
These developments are : the impact of Computational Culture on design , lessons of Centralized and Decentralized Structures , and the implications of DIY / Hack Culture for product design .
Similarly , the relative ease and economy with which the computer permits us to blend , splice , and mix across source material enhances design 's natural inclination to branch and sub - branch into multiple lines of inquiry .
In that so much design happens inside the act of iterating and refining , computational culture is empowering the single greatest domain of design : the process itself , or more specifically the ' flow ' of the design process .
It permits us to slowly relinquish our firm clench on aesthetic expectation , let go of our visual prejudices , and ' give in ' to what the process offers up .
Computational culture is also changing design by breaking down long - standing barriers to fabrication and distribution .
Rapid prototyping services such as ZapFab , FirstCut and Shapeways offer professionals and non-professionals alike the tools necessary to execute and disseminate their work .
Accelerating the situation , an ecosystem of sites like Ponoko and Etsy stand ready to provide these ' blackmarket ' results a very real pipeline to consumers .
The relatively low barrier of access to these tools in terms of cost and resources means that larger numbers are now able to bring their specific needs and ideas into discussion alongside formal design ( aka big D design ) .
While there is no guarantee that the increase in participants will elevate the quality of design work , it does suggest that the small and relatively exclusive core of design culture will be increasingly confronted with new and divergent points of view .
And that 's a good thing .
Failure to appreciate DIY / Hack Culture is to risk having professional design become as irrelevant to the contemporary landscape as record labels and network television are in the age of iTunes and YouTube .
One consequence of computational culture has been to deliver us a shared mental model of the web and an accompanying appreciation for the merits of networked systems .
This common understanding is important because it equips all of us consumers and designers alike with a scaled model for the forces at work in the environment at large .
The forces at work in the node / web dynamic are important because they mirror the forces at work in local / global relationships .
In both cases the strengths and weaknesses of networked systems become readily apparent .
A virus introduced to a network can start at one node and threaten the health of the entire system .
Similarly , pollutants generated in China can cross the pacific and rain down on the western seaboard of North America .
Or ( borrowing from today 's headlines ) an economic system built on credit can be felled by the introduction of one flawed instrument : mortgage backed securities , for example .
In both models nothing exists in a vacuum ; for every action there is a reaction somewhere , sometime , someplace .
The lessons for designers of centralized and decentralized structures are n't just in regard to sustainability and global credit ; they also lie in the insights they offer into models of manufacturing and distribution , of resource management and economic compensation .
Kiva 's Microloans , Zipcar 's shared vehicles , Netflix 's mega- management of DVDs and a host of emerging service models succeed because of the way in which they leverage the power embedded in networked structures .
That the power of these systems is intimately wed to their fragility is a critical lesson for product design as it attempts to address increasingly interconnected problems .
As designers we flatter ourselves when we forgo understanding the context of our design efforts or when we lend our professional talents to producing thoughtless iterations of old ideas .
Thinking within systems will force us to operate in more responsible ways ; to consider both agreeable ( easy ) and disagreeable ( hard ) factors as we work to gain understanding of a problem .
Mainstreaming resolution of design problems across such contradictory filters is essential if we are to evolve as a profession and as a practice .
The elevation of hack culture from a subversive activity to a pedestrian preoccupation also casts a light on changing notions of propriety .
Websites such as LifeHacker , ThinkGeek and Inventables routinely categorize and publish burgeoning catalogs of top hacks .
Reviewing these sites frequently , one can catch a glimpse of a new species of product design emerging .
Alice Wang 's Tyrant alarm which drunk dials your friends if you refuse to turn it off , or ThinkGeek 's SnuZnLuz , which threatens to donate your money to the GOP offer up something truly new in consumer electronics : product with a soul layered atop its physical design and functional OS .
DIY / Hack Culture is also significant because it starts to break down the neat partitions between consumer and fabricator upon which contemporary product design has found its present place as arbitrator .
Regardless of your position on amateur culture , it is clear that formal design will need to reevaluate its positioning if it is to continue to act as mediator between these converging groups .
Failure to do so is to risk having professional design become as irrelevant to the contemporary landscape as record labels and network television are in the age of iTunes and YouTube .
In a marketplace where designer , manufacturer and consumer finally meet on an equitable plane , the tools of specialization we 've inherited will need to be rethought .
If product evolves to accommodate the consumer 's ultimate modification and final purposing of the object , what is the design process that supports this new definition of product ?
How might product designers better position the discipline to take on the hairy problems of sustainability , economic uncertainty , global competition and the like ?
Well , one thing is for certain , simply co-opting present patterns of consumption into activities and services linked to conservation wo n't get us there .
- Question existing assumptions ( i.e. is beauty intrinsically admirable ? ) .
- Utilize intellect as well as intuition ; temper your muscle memory with intellectual rigor .
- Do n't rely on what you can anticipate ; believe in the creative power of experimentation .
- Change : expect it , embrace it , understand it , leverage it .
- Sustainability : stop segregating it into a class of problems separate than the one you are currently working on .
- Iterate Iterate Iterate : work to get it right , respect the resources required to execute your solution .
- Cut / Paste / Slice .
Do n't get locked in , draw upon sources from outside of your core discipline .
- Move in , out and across mediums frequently .
The change in perspective will serve you and your ideas , forcing connections that might otherwise remain hidden .
- Be prepared to walk away from the problem you are tackling , but come back .
- Do n't know , Do. Invest the time to vet out your ideas and assumptions .
- Listen to those you do n't agree with , you 'll learn more .
- Try things that scare you , you 'll grow and your tool kit will as well .
- Co-opt an opposing point of view : live in the skin of another viewpoint .
- Disagree early and frequently , the debate will add depth to your solutions .
UGLY is about fundamentally recognizing the role ' popular ' design has played in creating the culture of disposable consumption .
UGLY seeks to utilize design 's unique position as co-conspirator and change agent to help evolve a practice of consumer design that goes beyond stylistic achievement in its effort to seek out new techniques and processes that can progress the profession toward an offering better aligned with contemporary problems .
While UGLY finds its name in a word seemingly at odds with aesthetic achievement , it does not reject aesthetic achievement .
UGLY rejects aesthetic achievement only when it is arrived at to the exclusion or disregard of contemporary factors such as environmental impact , excessive cost or redundancy of purpose .
If classic design of the post - war period arose as a response to a world without order , can there be any better chance for our profession then to adopt a new set of ideas in the face of world comprised of too much order , too much corporate influence , and an increasingly borderless consumer culture ?
I doubt it .

Back in 2006 ( when the current generation of consoles was still called the next generation ) we did our first Xbox 360 vs. PlayStation 3 graphics comparison .
Since then we 've released rounds 2 , 3 , and 4 , but we had n't touched the third rail -- the PC - - until now .
The graphics comparison features started out as a way to examine which console had better graphics , but readers began asking us to include PC image comparisons for games available on all three platforms .
We focused on more recent games for our current comparison , because those are the games people are still buying and playing .
You 'll likely recognize many of the shots from our previous graphics comparisons .
The results are n't terribly surprising , but the differences are still interesting to see .
A well - equipped PC beats both consoles easily -- of course , that same PC also costs three to four times more than either of the consoles .
On the PC , we used FRAPs to capture images at 1920x1080 resolution .
We equipped our test PC with high - end components , a GeForce 280 GTX , and a quad - core Intel Core 2 CPU .
The PC allowed us to enable high - quality settings in most games and have plenty of power left over to kick antialiasing up to 4 x and anisotropic filtering up to 8x .
For the consoles , we captured all of our images over HDMI with games running at 720 p resolution , and we enabled full HDMI range on the PS3 .
Each game has four sets of rollover images .
The first image is a full screenshot set resized to fit the width of the page , followed by a zoomed - in image set that we created by cropping the original screen grabs to show you how the games look at a 1:1 pixel ratio .
To easily compare the PC to the consoles , we scaled down the original 1920x1080 PC images to 1280x720 and cropped from there .
The third and fourth image sets follow the same pattern .
Mouse over the captions to swap the images back and forth .
Keep in mind that these are large screenshots , so viewers with slow Internet connections should expect to wait a while for images to load .
Fallout 3
A Washington , DC , teeming with automotive executives seeking government aid is n't nearly as dismal as the postapocalyptic DC setting in Fallout 3 .
Shadows and lighting change according to the game 's day - and - night cycle , and we made sure to match timestamps for our comparison shots .
In what will come as no surprise , the PC shames both consoles in the image - quality comparison .
Everything from the textures to the antialiasing to the reflections looks better on the PC .
Foliage , piping , and far - off buildings look far superior on the PC due to transparency antialiasing effects .
Even draw distance is better on the PC , as the rocks and a fence near the burned - out bus are n't even visible on the consoles .

Dead Space
Dark corners , slow player movement , intense music , and monsters with a propensity to crawl out of walls left us reaching for a pair of adult diapers while taking screenshots .
Once again , the PC is the overall champ here .
A high - end video card goes a long way when it comes to running a game at insanely high resolutions with detailed textures and superior antialiasing .
Objects in the seating area and the sheets of paper in the middle of the room get blurrier and blurrier as you switch between the platforms .
Even the text readout that 's practically in front of your character 's face looks better on the PC .

Call of Duty : World at War
Call of Duty : World at War puts you in the thick of both the Japanese and Russian WWII fronts .
The platforms look largely the same , except that the PC edges out both of the consoles in antialiasing and textures , which you can see in higher detailed surfaces and smoother edges in the PC shots .
Interestingly enough , we also noticed that the water - landing scenario shown in the second set of shots plays differently in the PC version .
When your character gets pulled up from the water at the start of the level in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game , he remains stationary .
In the PC version , the waves actively push your character around , making screenshots more difficult to capture .

Grand Theft Auto IV
Grand Theft Auto IV finally made it to the PC ; unfortunately , it arrived with its fair share of performance problems .
At times we experienced massive texture issues that caused the game to render nothing but water with our lonely car sitting on top of the waves .
The game 's lighting and shadowing also rendered incorrectly , creating nasty shadow bands over the buildings and streets .
We did n't include images of the graphical artifacts because we did n't see them frequently enough warrant documenting .
Generally GTAIV runs fine , and RockStar has released a patch since our testing that should clear up most of these visual oddities .
GTAIV is the one game we tested for this comparison that did n't let us max out the image - quality settings on the PC .
At the moment , no video card has enough RAM to load up high - quality textures with high resolutions at maximum - quality settings .
We could , however , load up medium textures with very high - quality rendering and mostly maxed - out sliders .
Surprisingly , GTAIV does not support antialiasing in any form , which heavily detracts from the game because the city environment has a lot of hard edges , wires , and random foliage .
Even with all the problems , GTAIV looks better on the PC by a wide margin .
The PC's high resolution and draw - distance levels keep higher - quality textures , lighting , and transparency effects visible farther into the distance .

Poorer countries have also been hit The United Nations says the world economy faces its worst downturn since the Great Depression .
It expects world economic output to shrink by as much as 0.4 % in 2009 , due to a slump among developed countries - particularly the US and in Europe .
This would mark the world economy 's first year of contraction since the 1930s , the UN said .
The report added there had been complacency about the impact of the financial crisis on poorer countries .
" It seems inevitable that the major countries will see significant contraction in the immediate period ahead and that recovery may not materialise any time soon , even if the bail - out and stimulus package succeed , " it says .
Day by day , we are getting closer to the pessimistic scenario
Rob Vos , chief economist , UN Secretariat
The UN expects developed economies to shrink by up to 1.5 % , while developing nations should expand by at least 2.7 % .
But because of higher population growth in developing countries , income per capita for the world as a whole is expected to fall in 2009 .
And the slowing of growth in the poorest countries " suggests a significant setback in the progress made in poverty reduction in many developing countries over the past few years . "
Pessimistic
The UN's World Economic Situation and Prospects 2009 report gives three forecasts for growth next year - a baseline forecast of 1 % growth , a pessimistic scenario of a 0.4 % contraction and an optimistic scenario of 1.6 % growth .
This compares with growth of 2.5 % in 2008 and 3.8 % in 2007 .
Rob Vos , chief economist at the UN Secretariat and co-author of the report , told BBC News that the gloomy forecast was a distinct possibility unless financial markets calmed down and bank lending quickly returned to normal levels .
" Day by day , we are getting closer to the pessimistic scenario , " he said .
The world economy last contracted in the 1930s amid the Great Depression , he added .
Reform
The report said that developed economies have led the downturn , but that the global nature of trade and finance meant that economic weakness had spread rapidly to developing countries .
It warned that the international community had been complacent about the impact of the global financial crisis on poorer countries .
They are facing higher borrowing costs and lower export growth .
The UN also says that the downturn highlights key failures in the international financial system .
The reliance on the dollar as the sole reserve currency poses risks for developing countries , since a collapse in the value of the dollar could have severe effects on their earnings .
The report also calls for increased funding for the IMF and World Bank , greater international policy coordination , particularly in relation to exchange rates , and fundamental reform of the system of financial regulation .
And it says that developing countries need mechanisms to " mitigate the damaging effects of volatile capital flows and commodity prices " including additional funds during downturns when private flows tend to dry up .
The UN usually publishes its annual economic report in January but it brought forward the release of the main chapter to coincide with the UN Conference on Financing for Development in Doha , Qatar .
The conference aims to track progress on development aid given fears that rich countries will cut back on aid as a result of the looming recession .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Pakistan is continuing to conduct raids on targets linked to the outlawed group that India blames for last month 's massacre in Mumbai , a Pakistani security official told CNN on Monday .
Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman from the attacks claimed he was trained by Lashkar - e - Tayyiba .
Raids took place Sunday near Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani - controlled Kashmir , the sources said .
A Pakistani military official said 15 people were arrested in the raid but he would not identify any of the suspects until the preliminary investigation has concluded .
It is the first sign of government action against Lashkar - e - Tayyiba , the Islamic militant group India says was behind the killings of more than 160 people in Mumbai , since last month 's attacks .
iReport.com : Share your reaction to the attacks
Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the attacks has told investigators that he was trained by LeT , which was banned following a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the nuclear - armed rivals to the brink of war .
Initial reports indicated Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi , a suspected mastermind of the Mumbai attacks , was arrested although it was later denied by CNN sources .
The camp raided was owned by Jamaat - ud - Dawa , a charity formed after the ban .
The group says it uses the site as an office for relief work in an area hit by a major earthquake in 2005 but it did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday .
LeT was formed to fight Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir , the flashpoint for two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought since independence .
It has denied any responsibility for Mumbai attacks , and Pakistani authorities deny the attackers were from their country and blamed " non-state actors " for the killings .
India revised the death toll from the attacks downward Monday to 164 , including 120 Indian civilians , 26 non-Indians and 18 troops and police officers who died in three days of battles with the attackers .
Nine of the gunmen involved in the attacks were killed as well , according to Mumbai police .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pressured Pakistan to take action against militant groups within its territory during a visit to India and Pakistan last week .
She told CNN's " Late Edition " on Sunday that while there are " historic ties " between the Pakistani government and LeT , " Pakistan is a different place now , " with a civilian government working to crack down on militants within its territory .
" We have to remember that Pakistan itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism .
So whatever the history here , and there is a history , the important thing is that Pakistan act against those who used Pakistani soil to perpetrate attacks . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
President Bush has grudgingly allowed General Motors and Chrysler to drive away with the last few billion bucks in Treasury 's TARP till , which boasted $ 350 billion a mere 77 days ago .
How did it all slip away so fast ?
The money pot -- intended to save the teetering financial system -- was formally proposed in a three - page missive that Treasury sent to Congress on the morning of Saturday , Sept. 20 .
Over the course of two weeks , lawmakers debated the potential moral , ethical and financial hazards of handing over unprecedented power and unprecedented sums of taxpayer money to the Treasury .
Their responses ranged from gobsmacked to apoplectic .
By Friday , Oct. 3 , Congress had passed a 451 - page bill that President Bush signed into law within hours .
The law granted Treasury up to $ 700 billion , half of which was made available right away .
Since then , Treasury has :
sent checks totaling $ 168 billion in varying amounts to 116 banks ;
committed another $ 82 billion to capitalize more banks ;
bought $ 40 billion in preferred shares of American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) so the troubled insurer could pay off an earlier loan from the Federal Reserve ;
committed $ 20 billion to back any losses that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York might incur in a new program to lend money to owners of securities backed by credit card debt , student loans , auto loans and small business loans ;
committed to invest $ 20 billion in Citigroup on top of $ 25 billion the bank had already received ;
committed $ 5 billion as a loan loss backstop to Citigroup ;
agreed to loan $ 13.4 billion to GM and Chrysler to get them through the next few months .
That next $ 350B ?
Maybe not yet , Hank
Now , it 's likely that Treasury will ask for the second tranche of $ 350 billion .
" It 's clear Congress will need to release the remainder of the TARP to support financial market stability , " Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Friday .
" I will discuss that process with the congressional leadership and the president - elect 's transition team in the near future . "
It 's not clear , however , whether Paulson will formally ask Congress for the second tranche of TARP money before turning over the keys of the Treasury to his likely successor , Tim Geithner .
Even if Paulson wants to , however , he 's likely to face an uphill battle getting it .
" It seems very unlikely that Congress will give the final TARP installment to the Bush administration , " said Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst at policy research firm Stanford Group .
That 's because the apoplexy among those who originally opposed the TARP or who voted for it reluctantly has grown and spread for several reasons .
One cause of Capitol Hill 's bailout rage : the Treasury has not used TARP money to help prevent foreclosures .
Democratic lawmakers , who crafted the legislation and purposefully included language about foreclosure prevention , beg to differ .
They have said repeatedly they will not release any more TARP money until the Treasury commits to use some of it to help troubled homeowners .
Second , lawmakers are not happy Treasury has given so much capital to banks without requiring them to lend more and do more to oversee how the banks are using the money .
Paulson has said Treasury told TARP recipients that it expects them to lend .
" But it 's not practical or prudent for the government to say ' make this loan , do n't make that loan , ' " he said Thursday , speaking at an event in New York .
And third , Republicans in particular resent what they see as TARP mission creep .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , was one of many who opposed the auto bailout , and the fact that TARP was the source of the bridge loans in particular .
" The use of TARP funds is also regrettable , the latest in a growing list of TARP money uses that were not discussed with or envisioned by Congress when the program was authorized , " Boehner said Friday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , has said she is working on a bill to add more guarantees that future TARP funds be used to prevent foreclosures and protect taxpayers .
But it 's not clear yet how much Democratic support that will get .
And there is near total Republican opposition in the House to approve any more TARP funding .
If that remains the case , the Obama team will have to add yet another entry to its ever - growing to - do list when they take power on Jan. 20 .
- CNN congressional producer Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Global delivery company DHL announced Monday that it was cutting 9,500 jobs as it discontinues air and ground operations within the United States .
DHL said its DHL Express unit will continue to operate between the United States and other nations .
But the company said it was dropping " domestic - only " air and ground services within the United States by Jan. 30 " to minimize future uncertainties . "
" We see [ a ] significant shortfall in the U.S. part of our express business due to the fact that the economy has weakened deeply , " said Frank Appel , chief executive of DHL 's parent company Deutsche Post World Net .
" We have taken a massive action in the U.S. "
" As you can imagine , this was not an easy decision , " said Appel , speaking by webcast from corporate headquarters in Bonn , Germany .
" It has a massive impact on jobs for our people . "
Elias Sleiman , a quality control worker and one of 375 DHL employees at a shipping facility in Allentown , Pa. , said the company has scheduled a 10:30 p.m. meeting to explain their fate .
" At the meeting they 're going to be telling us the bad news , " said Sleiman .
" We do n't know what 's going to happen . "
U.S. job losses have been mounting for months .
On Friday , the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy shed nearly 1.2 million jobs through October .
Just in the month of October , the economy lost 240,000 jobs , raising the unemployment rate to 6.5 % .
Another 15,000 cuts were announced in the first week of November .
DHL 's 9,500 job cuts are on top of 5,400 job reductions announced earlier this year .
After these layoffs , between 3,000 and 4,000 employees will remain at DHL's U.S. operations , the company said .
The company also said it was shutting down all ground hubs and reducing the number of its U.S. stations to 103 from 412 .
DHL said it was making the cuts to improve profitability and " to prepare the company for the economic challenges ahead . "
The company said this latest action would add $ 1.9 billion to its restructuring costs , for a total of $ 3.8 billion over two years , most of it during 2008 .
The company said the cuts would reduce the annual operating costs of DHL's U.S. unit to less than $ 1 billion , from its current cost of $ 5.4 billion .
8,000 more jobs
DHL 's main U.S. hub is in Wilmington , Ohio , a town of about 12,000 people .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , visited Wilmington in August as part of his bid for the presidency , noting at the time that he was " deeply troubled by the specter of job loss confronting Wilmington " and the surrounding area .
DHL spokespersons said the cuts would take place nationwide and will not be concentrated in any one location .
But there could be many non-DHL jobs on the line in Wilmington as well .
Because DHL is n't U.S. - owned , the company is n't permitted to make deliveries between U.S. airports .
Instead , these services are currently performed for DHL by U.S. - based carriers like ABX Air , Inc. and Air Cargo Carrier , which are both also based in Wilmington .
As DHL scales down its domestic operations , it 's working on a deal to outsource these services to UPS Inc. , ( UPS , Fortune 500 ) based in Atlanta .
If the deal goes through , then UPS could transport DHL packages between U.S. airports , instead of ABX and ASTAR .
ABX and ASTAR depend heavily on DHL for their business .
Joseph Teuchert , a 16 - year captain on an ASTAR cargo plane and a spokesman for the " Save the Jobs " organization in Wilmington , said that if the UPS deal goes through , " you 're going to see a minimum of 8,000 jobs gone from Wilmington . "
DHL spokesman Robert Mintz told CNNMoney that the company is still " in full negotiations with UPS [ and ] expects to reach an agreement by the end of the year . "
" If [ domestic shipping ] goes to UPS , then my job is probably gone , " said James Garner , a shipping handler for ABX Air in Wilmington .
Michele Nadeem , vice president of corporate communications for DHL , said " a great number " of the non-DHL workers " will be affected " by the job cuts , but she would n't say how many .
DHL 's pullback in the U.S. should help not only UPS but also competitor FedEx Corp ( FDX , Fortune 500 ) , said Donald Broughton , analyst for Avondale Partners .
" Obviously , it 's good news for FedEx and UPS , because this puts the 3 - 4 % market share that DHL had [ for domestic ground and air shipping within the U.S. ] up for grabs , " said Broughton .
" Makes it a jump ball , if you will . "
UPS shares rose more than 3 % in Monday trading , and FedEx shares rose about 2 % .
Both outperformed the Dow Jones industrial average , the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 , which declined .
Massacre in Mumbai : Under doctors ' care , the gunman who carried out the hospital attack

Defiant Cafe Leopold reopens after horrific attacks
This is the face of the only gunman captured alive in the Mumbai terror attacks .
Azam Amir Kasab has been pictured lying on a bed beside medical equipment in an undisclosed location in the city in this undated photograph released by police today .
Kasab , 21 , and an accomplice took part in a lethal killing spree in the busy Chhatrapati Shivagji Terminus rail station and are also believed to have attacked a police vehicle at Cama Hospital , killing anti-terror squad chief Hemant Karkare .
He was captured alive on Wednesday night , after being shot in the hand during a stand - off with security forces .
Left , Azam Amir Kasab during the attacks , and right , pictured in hospital receiving treatment after the atrocity
Under interrogation he is understood to have said the terrorists intended to kill up to 5,000 people , and that he was told to ' kill until his last breath ' .
The picture emerged amid fears five more terrorists may be on the loose in Mumbai and could be planning a second wave of attacks .
Police sources were quoted today revealing the hijacked Indian fishing boat used by the gunmen to approach Mumbai had equipment for 15 men on board – suggesting that several gunmen could still be at large .
' Fifteen jackets were found , 15 toothbrushes even , ' one police source was quoted as saying in The Times .
' That more men were involved is possible . '

Haul : Weapons recovered from the terrorists involved in the Taj Mahal hotel siege
The toothbrushes were found as terror group Deccan Mujahideen , which claimed responsibility for the Mumbai attacks , reportedly threatened new attacks in Delhi in an email sent to intelligence sources .
The attack would target Delhi's main international airport and three railway stations .
Police are also checking rickshaws after receiving intelligence the three - wheeled vehicles could be used in a bombing campaign .
The fears came as Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari appealed to India not to punish his country for last week 's attacks , saying militants could precipitate a regional war .
Mr Zardari , whose wife , Benazir Bhutto , was assassinated by Islamist militants last year , warned that provocation by rogue ' non - state actors ' posed the danger of a return to war between the nuclear - armed neighbours .
' Even if the militants are linked to Lashkar - e - Taiba , who do you think we are fighting ? ' asked Mr Zardari in an interview with the Financial Times today .
In total , 188 people , including a British millionaire , died in last week 's attacks .
Almost 400 were injured .
Analysts say last week 's Mumbai assaults by Islamist militants bore the hallmarks of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based group blamed for attacks in India including a 2001 parliament blast that almost plunged the two countries into a fourth war .

' We live in troubled times where non-state actors have taken us to war before , whether it is the case of those who perpetrated [ the ] 9/11 [ attacks on the United States ] or contributed to the escalation of the situation in Iraq , ' said Mr Zardari .
' Now , events in Mumbai tell us that there are ongoing efforts to carry out copycat attacks by militants .
We must all stand together to fight out this menace . '
Indian officials have said the 10 attackers who held Mumbai hostage came from Pakistan , a Muslim nation carved out of Hindu- majority India in 1947 .
Yesterday India said it had proof linking its nuclear rival Pakistan to the massacre – and warned it would raise security to a ' war level ' .
Flashpoint : Pakistan president Ali Zardari has warned militants could push nuclear neighbours Pakistan and India into war
In an effort to ease tension between the two states , The White House said that U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would travel to India on Wednesday .
Pakistan is already struggling to contain Islamic militants within its borders .
Earlier today eight people were killed in a suicide bomb attack in the country , with both Al Qaeda and Taliban militants stepping up their attacks against Pakistani security forces .
Pakistan 's position as Afghanistan 's neighbour has made it a key flashpoint , with Osama bin Laden fleeing there in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and militants training in camps there before fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Mumbai residents returned to schools and offices today for the first time since the attacks .
Address : Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari speaks via video link to a leadership conference in India just four days before the Mumbai terror attacks
Yesterday candlelight vigils were held in New Delhi and at various spots in Mumbai , with people holding hands , singing songs and holding posters , some in remembrance of victims , others protesting over what they saw as government inaction .
On Sunday it was revealed that intelligence warnings of an Islamic terror attack on Mumbai were ' lost in the system ' .
Nine days before terrorists arrived by boat to launch a three day assault on the Indian city , security services received information that it was to be targeted .
The intelligence even warned that the strike would come from the sea .
The authorities have acknowledged that a warning was received .
Intelligence officials say it was passed to the navy , coastguard and police .
But the agencies say it did not reach them .
' It appears to have been lost in the system , ' one official said yesterday .
However , intelligence sources said Mumbai authorities were also told in writing of a possible attack , naming the Taj Mahal hotel , which became the scene of shootings , as a target .
Keeping the faith : People gather at a funeral ceremony for those who died in the terrorist attack
While Mumbai grieves , recriminations have also begun .
Today Maharashtra state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh , a member of the ruling Congress party , said he had offered to resign over the attacks that locked India 's financial capital in a three - day siege .
Party leaders will now make a final decision over his resignation which follows those of Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil and national security adviser MK Narayanan .
Yesterday Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's announced a wide - ranging overhaul of the nation 's counter - terrorism capabilities .
Yesterday candles , flowers and pictures were also strewn at the bullet - scarred Cafe Leopold and at the barricades in front of the Taj and Trident hotels , where the gunmen holed themselves up during a 60 - hour siege .
The cafe , where seven people were killed , reopened today .
' I want them [ the attackers ] to feel we have won , they have lost , ' said manager Farzad Jehani .
More vigils and remembrances were planned in the city , with messages going out as mass texts , e-mails and Facebook messages .
Hundreds of demonstrators also marched past the shell of the Taj hotel demanding explanations .
There is anger at the intelligence failure , and at the delayed response to the assaults on two of the best known luxury hotels and other landmarks in India 's financial capital .
Carnage :

Newspapers condemned politicians for failing to prevent the attacks .
The Sunday Times declared : ' Our Politicians Fiddle As Innocents Die . '
India has pointed the finger at Pakistan .
Most of the attackers are said to be from the outlawed Lashkar - e - Taiba , an extremist Pakistani group based in Kashmir .
It accuses senior elements within Pakistan 's intelligence and security body , of supporting Lashkar – and of providing them with training .
The tension raised the prospect of a breakdown of peace efforts going on since 2004 .
Delhi was reported to be considering whether to suspend air and rail links and to send more troops to the so - called Line of Control in Kashmir .
' We will increase security and strengthen it to a war level like we have never done it before , ' said India 's minister of state for home affairs .
Islamabad demanded evidence of the militants ' links to Pakistan .
It warned that if tension escalated , it would move troops to the Indian border , from its border with Afghanistan .
Pakistan has denied involvement by state agencies .
Indian anti-terror investigators are said to have the satellite telephone used by the militants with details of calls to Pakistan and to Lashkar leaders .
A group calling itself the Deccan Muhijadeen claimed responsibility for the attacks in an email .
This too is said to have been traced to Pakistan .
Charred : The Taj Mahal Hotel after the operations to dislodge terrorists ended
Ministers in London and Delhi say no evidence has yet been uncovered to support suggestions of a UK link .
Some of the Britons injured in the attack were flown home yesterday .
And Scotland Yard detectives visited the Taj Mahal hotel to take fingerprints from the dead militants , which will be checked against their records .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the attacks would cause Britain to review its security .
' We need to revise the very important work that we do on protecting our crowded places .
— Cumberland County sheriff 's deputies say someone broke into a family 's Fayetteville home Wednesday and stole their Christmas presents .
When Michael Schillinger , 17 , came home from school , he found the back door of his house had been kicked in .
“ I noticed this ( door broken ) , and that 's when I realized somebody had broken into the house , ” Schillinger said .
He immediately called his parents and got out of the house , at 719 Foxcroft Drive .
“ I had to ask him again to repeat it again because I just could not believe it , ” his mother , Liberty Schillinger , said .
When the family checked about the house , they discovered most of their electronics were gone .
“ We feel violated , ” Liberty Schillinger said .
Even more disheartening for the Schillingers was that the thief made off with all but one of their Christmas presents .
“ The electronics , the gifts , can be replaced .
It 's the invasion ” that 's so bothersome , Liberty Schillinger said .
“ It 's just the fact that somebody else has forcefully come into our world .
It 's kind of upsetting , and I 'm still a little on edge from it , ” father Thomas Schillinger said .
The Schillingers still plan to make the best of the holidays .
Liberty Schillinger says she will deliver her Christmas baked goods to friends and neighbors as usual .
“ We 'll enjoy Christmas and what the spirit of it is for .
We just thank God nobody was injured and nobody was hurt and that we 're all OK , ” Thomas Schillinger said .
Thomas Schillinger says he and his family have lived in the neighborhood for eight years without crime problems .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In yet another move to prop up the crumbling U.S. auto industry , the government announced Monday that it will pump $ 6 billion into GMAC Financial Services , a financing company critical to the survival of General Motors .
The rescue package has two parts .
The Treasury Department is injecting $ 5 billion directly into GMAC in exchange for preferred equity shares that pay an 8 % dividend .
GMAC also is issuing warrants to Treasury in the form of preferred stock .
If exercised , the warrants will pay a 9 % dividend .
Also , the government will lend $ 1 billion to GM that the automaker will invest in its financing arm .
GMAC needs the funding to convert to a bank holding company , a necessary step to receiving the bailout money .
The Federal Reserve said last week that it would approve GMAC 's conversion to a bank holding company , subject to certain conditions .
The move deepens the federal government 's bailout of the troubled auto industry .
Less than two weeks ago , President Bush announced a $ 17.4 billion rescue package to prevent the collapses of General Motors and Chrysler LLC .
Treasury officials called Monday 's action " part of a broader program to assist the domestic automotive industry in becoming financially viable . "
As part of the bailout , GMAC will have to limit executives ' compensation .
Top officials will not be allowed to receive severance packages and the bonus pool for the top 25 executives must be 40 % lower than 2007 levels , a Treasury official said .
Some of the conditions are stricter than those that banks receiving bailout funds must comply with .
The federal injection will allow GMAC to jumpstart its lending .
The company said Tuesday that it will immediately modify its credit criteria to include financing for customers with a credit score of 621 or higher as a result of Treasury 's investment .
For the past two months , GMAC only served customers with a score of 700 or higher .
" The actions of the federal government to support GMAC are having an immediate and meaningful effect on our ability to provide credit to automotive customers , " said GMAC President Bill Muir in the statement .
" We will continue to employ responsible credit standards , but will be able to relax the constraints we put in place a few months ago due to the credit crisis . "
A score of 620 generally represents the line between good and bad credit , according to analysts .
GMAC said , historically , most of its loans have been for customers in the so - called " prime " arena with scores above 620 .
" Opening access to credit for those with ... scores of 621 or better will allow us to return to more normal levels of financing volume , and should help in efforts to stabilize the U.S. auto industry , " Muir said .
Treasury needs more bailout funds
The GMAC investment commits Treasury to total bailout spending above the $ 350 billion limit set so far by Congress .
Treasury has some wiggle room because $ 79.5 billion that it has allocated for purchasing stakes in banks has not yet been distributed .
Regulators are still reviewing applications from many institutions .
However , to fulfill its commitment to the banks , officials will have to ask Congress to release at least part of the $ 350 billion remaining in the $ 700 billion financial sector rescue package it approved in October .
A Treasury official Monday night repeated Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's earlier comments that he will work with Congress and President - elect Barack Obama 's transition team on releasing the additional funds .
GMAC vital to GM
GMAC , which is currently 51 % owned by Chrysler 's parent company Cerberus Capital Management and 49 % by GM , is critical to the automaker 's recovery .
Once a major source of profits for GM , GMAC has lost $ 7.9 billion over the past five quarters , mostly from risky subprime mortgage bets made by its Residential Capital division .
The holdings plummeted in value when the housing market began to decline in 2007 .
GMAC is the biggest lender to GM 's 6,500 dealers nationwide , providing financing they need to operate and buy vehicle inventory from the automaker .
The failure of GMAC could spark widespread failures among GM 's dealership network and cut even more deeply into auto sales .
A majority of GM's U.S. sales typically were financed by GMAC before the economy slowed down .
But in November , less than 2 % of its sales were financed through the unit .
Becoming a bank
Before becoming a bank holding company , GMAC must meet other conditions .
Cerberus must reduce its stake in GMAC to 33 % and GM 's share must drop to less than 10 % .
Cerberus will distribute the remainder of its stake to its investors and GM 's stake will go into an independent trust to be sold off within three years .
In granting its approval , the Fed cited " emergency conditions , " saying the company was important to the future success of GM .
Separately , GMAC said Monday that it has accepted the tendered bonds it aimed to exchange as part of a debt - for - stock exchange program .
The company wanted to convert 75 % of its $ 38 billion debt into equity shares so it could raise $ 30 billion in capital .
GMAC put the program up for a vote for its investors , but despite a Dec. 26 deadline , the company did not yet announce the results .
The finance company has said its ability to stay afloat lays in the balance of the vote .
Though the Fed already accepted the company 's bid to convert to a bank holding company , the exchange was a critical part of GMAC 's attempt to meet the Fed 's typical capital requirements for a bank .
Automaker loans
Separate from the GMAC bailout , General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler were expected to receive $ 4 billion each in emergency aid from Treasury on Monday .
However , that delivery of the loan was stalled .
The federal government is " moving expeditiously on all fronts " to finalize the loans , a Treasury official said Monday night .
The carmakers will receive the funds " on timelines necessary for each company . "

" The events in Hebron are riots , plain and simple .
The damage caused to the Muslim graveyard , and the graffiti on the walls of mosques throughout Judea and Samaria – they shame and disgrace us as Jews , " a senior IDF officer belonging to the army 's Central Command told Ynet on Tuesday evening following a particularly violent day in Hebron .
Appeal Barak : Leave IDF out of political debate Ahiya Raved Defense minister tours northern IDF base , speaks of volatile situation in Hebron .
He asks settlers to avoid violence , refrain from ' pushing security forces into corners '
Barak : Leave IDF out of political debate
Dozens of right - wing activists and Palestinians were wounded in the clashes , and it was decided that a special Border Guard force will be deployed to secure area of the disputed house in the city slated for eviction .
" I do n't understand how the preparatory schools and yeshivas are willing to allow these boys to run about and riot without restraint , " the officer said .
" Just today a 15 - year - old youth was seriously wounded in Hebron ; it 's unclear why he there and not in school like the rest of the boys his age .
The Hadassah Ein-Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem said that the boy is undergoing surgery , and is in serious but stable condition .
Another military official told Ynet the Civil Administration has been working to calm the tensions in Hebron .
" We 've sent calming messages to the Palestinians , without our taking this action the Hebron region might have erupted from both sides , " said the official .
He added that the situation is spiraling out of control , and the feeling in the field is that there is no leadership capable of dealing with the feral youths .
Following the escalation in violence a special meeting was held Tuesday morning by Central Command chief , Maj. Gen. Gadi Shamni , to assess the security situation .
It was decided to deploy a special Border Guard task force to the volatile area in order to deal with the riots .
Border Guard officials told
Ynet that " despite the public disturbances these past few days , we believe that the relationship between the Border Guard troops and the Jewish community will help calm the tensions in Hebron .
The idea behind the decision to send in a special force is to isolate the Hebron region and that of the disputed house , and by doing so decrease the rioting and prevent the arrival of more people .
The officials noted that placing a Border Guard task force in Hebron , similar to the deployment of a task force in Naalin due to the rioting of left - wing activists , will allow the IDF to focus on terror threats and protecting residents of the region .
Extreme - rightist Baruch Marzel called the deployment " a miserable decision .
Putting the force there will only fan the flames .
We have seen before that the judgment of Border Guard troops is flawed and impaired .
Putting them there will only lead to more violence . "
The Federal Reserve tried for a major shock - and - awe effect with its interest rate cut and other moves Tuesday aimed at rescuing the economy from a devastating downturn .
For savers and investors , the shock may be that paltry rates on bank savings certificates will fall further -- forcing many people to consider moving cash into riskier assets , such as stocks .
For homeowners , the awe element may be the ability to refinance a mortgage at a rate of less than 5 % .
The Fed said it would allow its benchmark short - term rate to fall as low as zero , from 1 % .
Advertisement
And with that rate now at rock bottom , policymakers emphasized other steps they could take to drive down mortgage rates and other long - term interest rates , mainly by buying bonds and other securities for the Fed ’s own portfolio .
Wall Street ’s reaction was jubilant :
The stock market surged , with the Dow Jones industrial average rallying 359.61 points , or 4.2 % , to 8,924.14 .
The broader Standard & Poor ’s 500 index rose 5.1 % .
Investors also rushed to lock in yields on long - term Treasury bonds and other fixed - income securities .
Advertisement
In poker terms , “ The Fed went all in , ” said Paul McCulley , a managing director at bond - fund giant Pimco in Newport Beach .
“ It was exactly what they needed to do , ” he said , to strengthen their commitment to ending the credit crisis and to set the stage for a turnaround in the economy .
Here are some of the potential effects of the Fed ’s moves on three key constituencies :
Savers
In part , by cutting the target for its benchmark short - term interest rate to a range of zero to 0.25 % , the Fed was acknowledging market reality :
That rate -- what banks charge one another for overnight loans -- already had fallen under 0.5 % in recent weeks , a reflection of other Fed moves to flood the banking system with cash .
Advertisement
Still , with a new zero floor for the Fed ’s rate , banks now have more leeway to reduce further what they pay on deposits .
Even though many banks have been eager to hang on to deposits , yields on savings certificates have been in a steady decline since early October .
The national average yield on six - month certificates was 2.11 % on Tuesday , down from 2.14 % a week earlier and 2.33 % on Oct. 7 , according to Informa Research Services .
By reducing the cost of money , the Fed wants to fatten banks ’ profits and thereby encourage them to lend more .
Savers , however , “ are stuck holding the bag , as usual , ” said Greg McBride , senior analyst at Bankrate.com .
“ Yields are going to come down . ”
Advertisement
Interest rates on the short - term corporate , bank and government IOUs that money market funds buy also could continue to slide , further depressing fund yields .
The average seven - day annualized yield on taxable money funds fell under 1 % last week , to 0.94 % , according to IMoney Net Inc .
To earn a yield of 4 % or more , savers will have to consider locking their money up for an extended period , perhaps at least 18 months .
That ’s a good idea for at least some of your savings , McBride says , noting that the Fed warned Tuesday in its post - meeting statement that the economy was “ likely to warrant exceptionally low levels [ of interest rates ] for some time . ”
The silver lining , he said , is that with inflation dropping rapidly , savers ’ “ real ” returns -- after inflation -- have improved sharply .
Advertisement
Investors
Although the Fed ’s efforts can’t turn the economy around on a dime , they can make investors more hopeful about the future .
And boosting psychology is a big part of the battle , analysts note .
“ The Fed made it very clear it is committed , without limits , to avoiding a depression , ” said David Kotok , head of money manager Cumberland Advisors in Vineland , N.J .
“ This is a tremendously bullish move for all ‘ risk ’ assets , ” including stocks and bonds , he said .
Advertisement
Fed policymakers on Tuesday noted that they had previously agreed to buy large amounts of mortgage - related securities for the central bank ’s portfolio .
Their statement said they stood ready to expand those purchases and to “ consider new ways . . . to further support credit markets and economic activity ” -- including by purchasing long - term Treasury securities .
Translation : The Fed is ready to do whatever it takes to break the credit logjam .
As it competes with other investors to buy bonds , the effect is to push up bond prices and pull down yields .
The yield on the 10 - year T - note plunged to a generational low of 2.36 % on Tuesday , from 2.53 % on Monday .
Pimco ’s McCulley said he believed the Fed could expand its financing efforts to the corporate and municipal bond markets , where interest rates have remained high .
Those yields edged lower Tuesday .
Advertisement
For the stock market , anything that persuades investors that the economy will bottom in 2009 could cement the idea that share prices have seen their worst levels .
Stocks worldwide have been moving up , in fits and starts , since about Nov. 20 .
The S&P ; 500 is up 21.4 % since then .
The big risk is that all of the money the Fed is pumping into the economy eventually will fuel inflation .
But given the magnitude of the economy ’s downturn , inflation is n’t on most investors ’ worry lists at the moment .
Borrowers
Because many home - equity credit lines and other consumer loans are tied to banks ’ prime lending rate , those borrowers will immediately get a break :
With the Fed ’s rate move , banks cut the prime Tuesday to 3.25 % from 4 % .
Advertisement
What ’s more , the Fed ’s plan to boost credit in the economy in 2009 includes a program aimed at bringing rates down on other consumer credit and on small - business loans .
The Fed already has succeeded in pulling down mortgage rates :
Since the central bank announced its mortgage - bond purchase program the week of Nov. 24 , the average 30 - year loan rate as tracked by loan - finance giant Freddie Mac has dropped more than half a percentage point , from 6.04 % to 5.47 % as of last week .
With mortgage - bond yields diving again Tuesday , the Freddie Mac rate could soon near its record low of 5.21 % reached in mid-2003 .
Some mortgage brokers already are quoting loan rates under 5 % .
Current homeowners “ who are at 6 % or above should at least be considering ” refinancing , said Keith Gumbinger , vice president of mortgage research firm HSH Associates .
Advertisement
The hitch , of course , is that homeowners whose equity has vanished with falling prices wo n’t qualify to refinance .
That ’s another reminder that the Fed ’s efforts , however extraordinary , are no cure - all for the housing crisis that ’s at the root of the economy ’s woes .

Canada 's central bank hopes monetary policies will encourage consumption
Canada 's central bank has cut interest rates to their lowest level in 50 years , to 1.5 % , in an effort to stem recession and support economic growth .
The rate cut , by 0.75 % , is the largest since the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 .
The central bank said the global recession would be broader and deeper than previously anticipated .
But it added that strong action by governments worldwide was beginning to rebuild trust in money markets .
" Global financial markets remain severely strained , " Canada 's central bank said in a statement .
It also noted that slowing demand was severely hitting consumption .
" The recent declines in terms of trade , real income growth , and confidence are prompting more cautious behaviour by households and businesses . "
The Canadian government has launched a 25 bn Canadian dollar ( $ 19bn ; £ 13 bn ) bail - out package that would allow them to buy mortgages from troubled banks .
Canada 's economy is closely tied to that of the United States , its biggest export market , which has been in recession since the end of 2007 .

EMERYVILLE , California —
" We have 203 employees — and we 're growing , " John Melo , CEO of alt - fuel startup Amyris , said as he stepped jauntily through the glass doors at his company 's gorgeous new digs just down the street from Pixar in this industrial town outside Oakland .
In the worst financial climate in decades , the company is pushing ahead with its audacious plans to make 200 million gallons of synthetic biofuel a year at $ 2 per gallon by 2011 .
Last week while other companies handed out pink slips and contemplated cutbacks , Amyris had a modest party — cheese , bread , and wine in their not - quite - Google cafeteria — to celebrate the completion of a new pilot plant with 2.4 million gallons of annual capacity .
" It 's the first time you put all the pieces together and you let it go , " Melo said .
" From beginning to end , it 's commercial process . "
The synthetic biology startup , which uses genetically engineered yeast to rearrange the molecules in sugars to create higher - value products like diesel fuel or malaria medication , is a very bright , very green story amidst the torrent of bummer headlines :
More than 500,000 people filed jobless claims last week , the highest number since 9/11 ;
The well - regarded International Energy Agency released a new report last Thursday declaring that " current trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable ; " And the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down almost 40 percent this year .
The young company has become a corporate face , or a beacon on the hill , for the green revolution that President - elect Barack Obama and his administration hope will pull the U.S. economy out of recession .
Amyris , in short , could disrupt the energy marketplace the way Google sent the media world into disarray .
And by staying a step ahead of the rest of the world through science and engineering , America could recreate the living - wage jobs that have left the country over the last two decades and recharge the economy .
The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory spin off has been talked up and invested in by uber - V.C. Kleiner Perkins as the model for green growth .
John Doerr and Al Gore have used the company in their clean - energy stump speeches for years .
Indeed , the Amyris offices , a refreshingly open set of high - design rooms and hallways that look out on a lush courtyard garden , seem like the very incarnation of renewal .
Packing powerful science that allows the company to turn any carbon - containing sugar into liquid transportation fuel , Amyris sidesteps the energy intensive crude - oil refining process .
They claim that allows them to reduce the " well - to - wheel " greenhouse gas emissions of their fuel by 80 percent over conventional diesel .
Though emission accounting for biofuels is notoriously difficult — particularly calculating the secondary effects of land use changes — it 's safe to say that Amyris is better for the environment than petroleum .
And if the company really can make $ 2 - a - gallon diesel , there is little doubt they 'll find a market , even if the price of a barrel of oil stays under $ 100 .
The company 's continuing march towards commercialization represents the maturation of the first - generation of venture - backed companies in the recent clean - tech boom .
But it 's not just the sector 's scientific potential that excites people in both Silicon Valley and Washington , D.C.
Because clean - tech companies compete in industrial sectors , they could generate lots of real factory jobs where people are employed making actual products .
Or at least that 's the story that green - tech investors and savvy politicians have sold to the laid - off workers of Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Ohio .
" It 's not clear , in the absence of the concerted effort to make investments in the clean - tech sector , what geographies or sectors are going to pull the U.S. out of the recession , " Eric Janszen , a prominent investor and author , told Wired.com earlier this year .
" What tends to happen is that policymakers survey this scene and say : ' What are we going to do to get people working ? '
They focus on the one sector of the economy that can drag us out .__ "
__
Obama 's energy plan calls for five million new jobs in the low - carbon and alternative energy sector .
That would mean creating 20 new General Motors - size companies , each employing 250,000 people .
But green tech companies are nowhere near the scale of the economy they are supposed to replace , no matter how fast they 're growing .
Just 200 jobs is a lot in Silicon Valley 's startup landscape .
The pilot plant , after all , is n't that big .
In fact , you'd be hard - pressed to play a game of half - court basketball in it .
And unlike a real fuel plant , it 's not dirty or industrial - looking .
Liquids gurgle inside bulbous silver tanks .
Surfaces gleam .
Rows of empty folding chairs face a podium at the front of the room , the leftovers from a press conference earlier in the week .
" We actually had a harvest yesterday that made the place smell and look great , " Melo said , pointing out the steel 300 - liter fermenters that grow the fuel - producing yeast .
The heady brewery smell lingers .
*
In the full - size plant the company plans to build next year , the fermenters — and everything else — will need to be ten times larger .
And to make an impact on climate change or the world 's liquid fuels ledger , there would need to be thousands of similar plants .
Still , the pilot plant is a major step towards commercialization .
While it might seem trivial to turn in - lab discoveries into real - world products , the engineering process is fraught with challenges .
It 's like the difference between cooking for your family and cooking for 500 or 10,000 people ; it 's rare that the food in the school lunch line tastes good .
Melo 's team , happily , has found that their yield — the amount of fuel they get out per unit of sugar put in — has actually increased using the commercial process .
But they are still a long way from a profitable process .
" We have a four - fold improvement year - to - date and we have a three - fold improvement to go , " Melo said .
And getting there is n't a certainty .
Scaling up green technologies takes time and money — both of which the American economy is short on .
And just as politicians have latched onto the green collar job meme , investors are getting cold feet , particularly about the big , expensive commercial operations that provide large amounts of jobs .
In addition , the price of oil , which drove much of the biofuel investment over the last couple of years , has fallen in response to a slowing world economy .
At a clean tech conference last week , more than 60 percent of a group of investors surveyed said they did not expect financing to be available for companies " looking to commercialize or scale " their projects .
But the problems that inspired the science — climate change and rapidly - depleting oil fields — remain in play .
" The number of projects I 've seen fall off , both because of the debt markets and because of the economics , the price of oil , is pretty significant , " Melo said .
" We 're setting ourselves up for a bigger problem , " Melo added .
The International Energy Agency report painted a grim picture of oil fields declining faster than expected while growth in the demand for crude has only slightly slowed .
" Even if oil demand was to remain flat to 2030 , 45 [ million barrels a day ] of gross capacity – roughly four times the current capacity of Saudi Arabia – would need to be built by 2030 just to offset the effect of oilfield decline , " Nobuo Tanaka , the IEA 's executive director said in a release .
Melo said Amyris has taken in enough money — about $ 120 million to date — to continue growing for the next 18 months .
The deteriorating economic conditions , however , have put the company 's plan to go public sometime in the next two years on the back burner .
With the pilot plant complete , Amyris will now focus on building a similar plant in Brazil , where they 've established a joint - venture with SantalisaVale , the second - largest ethanol producer in that country .
SantalisaVale has promised two million tons of sugar cane crushing capacity , which will provide the feedstock for their full - size facilities .
Despite its green appeal , Amyris has its critics .
Some environmental organizations are opposed to biofuels generally , and others , like the Ottawa - based ETC Group , target the techniques and business models that synthetic biology companies employ .
They take aim at the fledgling industry in a report released last week , saying it will be as environmentally destructive as the system it replaces .
" Advocates of converging technologies promise a greener , cleaner post - petroleum future where the production of economically important compounds depends not on fossil fuels — but on biological manufacturing platforms fueled by plant sugars , " the group writes .
" It may sound sweet and clean , but the so - called ' sugar economy ' will also be the catalyst for a corporate grab on all plant matter — and destruction of biodiversity on a massive scale . "
Groups like ETC argue that biofuels , of any type , will eventually cause serious environmental damage — by eroding and degrading soils , reducing biodiversity , and increasing food insecurity — merely shifting the world 's energy problem from " Peak Oil " to " Peak Soil " .
And it does n't help Amyris ' case with hardcore environmentalists that Melo was brought in from British Petroleum to scale up the company .
Liquid fuels , though , underpin the world 's transportation system .
They are useful because they are their own storage .
Electric vehicles need batteries to store energy and batteries are expensive , said Ron Cogan , editor of Green Car Journal .
" What is the answer ?
There is no single answer , " said Cogan , who has been following alternative energy for cars since the early 1990s .
" I think we 're in a position where we can't afford to ignore any fuel or technology . "
The incoming administration sees the interlinked urgency of the economic and climate crises .
The head of Barack Obama 's transition team , John Podesta , co-authored a report earlier this year through the Center of American Progress detailing a plan for a $ 100 - billion green stimulus package .
The clean - tech investment situation is deteriorating quickly , though , and the amount of growth that must occur for the industry to transform the energy economy is huge .
With deep recession and catastrophic climate change looming , the green cavalry — in the form of loans and incentives — might arrive too late .
That could leave companies like Amyris with only their shiny , empty pilot plants , which are too small to hold the ambitions of the people pushing a new , clean economy .

“ The name ‘ Madoff ’ has overnight gone from being revered to reviled in the Helfman family , ” Mr. Helfman said on Friday .
His grandmother , at 98 , relied on her Madoff money to pay for round - the - clock care , he said , and his two children ’s college funds were wiped out .
“ Thirty - six years of loyalty , through two generations , and this is what we get , ” he said .
The news was equally devastating for the Robert I. Lappin Charitable Foundation in Salem , Mass. , which works to reverse the dilution of Jewish identity through intermarriage and assimilation by sending teenagers to Israel and supporting other Jewish education efforts .
The foundation was forced on Friday to dismiss its small staff and shut down its programs to cope with its losses in the Madoff funds , according to Deborah Coltin , its executive director .
“ We ’ve canceled everything as of today , everything , ” she said tearfully .
Ms. Coltin said she did not know how the little foundation came to be so exposed to the Madoff firm .
Its most recent tax filings show that it had $ 7 million at the end of 2006 , with $ 143,344 in stocks and the rest in “ government securities . ”
It reported the sale that year of “ Bernie Madoff ” securities , but did not explain what those securities were .
Sam Englebardt , a media investor in Los Angeles , said several relatives had entrusted virtually all of their assets to Mr. Madoff  and he understood why .
“ It seems like a huge over - allocation , I know , ” Mr. Englebardt said .
“ But remember , they had started out small and invested over 5 years , 15 years , 30 years  and every year they got a great return , and they could always take money out without ever having a problem . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Investors who wagered that Washington Mutual would somehow survive the latest market turmoil will have to pay far less than some had feared .
According to the final results of an auction of complex financial instruments called credit default swaps held Thursday , banks and other investors who sold these insurance - like products will have to pay 43 cents on the dollar to investors who bet that WaMu would default on its debt , according to Creditfixings.com .
" This is still a considerably higher recovery than many anticipated only a few weeks ago when [ WaMu ] bonds were trading in the 20s , " said Tim Backshall , chief strategist at Credit Derivatives Research .
At those prices , sellers would have had to pay out as much as 80 cents on the dollar .
The final figures were higher than preliminary estimates from Creditfixings.com of a payout of about 36 cents on the dollar , but far below what happened at a similar auction held earlier this month regarding Lehman Brothers .
Investors who bet on the fallen Wall Street firm lost more than 91 cents on the dollar on credit default swap contracts .
Credit default swaps act as a form of insurance .
Corporate bondholders sometimes purchase these products to protect themselves in case a company is unable to make their debt payments or goes bankrupt , as was the case with both WaMu and Lehman Brothers .
Other investors also use credit default swaps -- even if they do n't own the company 's debt -- as a way to make side bets about a company 's health .
Investors feared during the Lehman Brothers auction on October 10 that troubles in the credit default swap could have exacerbated the recent turmoil in broader financial markets .
Stocks were whipsawed that day and some traders blamed concerns about the auction and the impact it would have on many already struggling banks for much of the volatility that day .
Yet buyers and sellers of Lehman credit default swaps managed to settle those claims earlier this week without any major fallout amongst financial institutions or the broader market , which many feared could happen .
Just $ 5.2 billion is expected to trade hands between investors that bet on a Lehman default , according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation , which handles trades in over - the - counter markets such as credit default swaps , as some institutional investors both bought and sold credit default swaps .
Still , Thursday 's auction offered yet another glimpse at this long - ignored market , which some estimate to be worth $ 55 trillion .
Over 500 parties participated in Thursday 's WaMu auction , including major global financial institutions such as Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Barclays ( BCS ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) .
That number dwarfed the more than 350 banks and investors that took part in Lehman 's auction .
What remains unclear is whether the payments related to the WaMu 's credit default swaps will surpass that of Lehman .
Yet in some ways , Thursday 's auction brings the WaMu tale one step closer to the end .
Saddled by toxic home loans , WaMu struggled for months and tried numerous remedies to shore up its problems , including a $ 7 billion private equity investment and the expulsion of long - time CEO Kerry Killinger .
But fallout in the U.S. mortgage market and waning confidence in the company proved too much for the Seattle - based thrift .
Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) collapsed on Sept. 29 , making it the biggest bank failure in the nation 's history .
Federal regulators seized the company 's banking operations , only to turn around and sell them to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) for $ 1.9 billion .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Brittany Zimmerman , a 21 - year - old college student who wanted to be a doctor , called 911 as she was being attacked by a stranger , police say .
Brittany Zimmerman 's screams and struggle for her life were captured by a 911 tape .
But the police did not come for 48 minutes .
By that time , Zimmerman was dead .
Her fiance found her body .
Although the dispatcher claimed later to have heard nothing , the 911 tape captured screams , gasps and what sounds like a struggle , according to the court documents .
Spring was in the air when college student Zimmerman returned April 2 from classes at the University of Wisconsin to the off - campus apartment she shared with her fiance , Jordan Gonnering .
He was out when she arrived home .
He discovered her body when he returned .
Zimmerman had been stabbed multiple times in her chest , near her heart .
She 'd also been beaten and strangled , according to warrants released recently .
Watch an update on the case »
Zimmerman managed to call 911 at 12:20 p.m .
The call was taken by the Dane County 911 center and an internal investigation revealed the dispatcher did not hear any sounds that would signal an emergency .
Because of that , police were not sent to the apartment until 48 minutes after Zimmerman made the call .
Her fiance was already there .
Dane County has taken some harsh criticism from the public regarding the delay , and tough questions have been raised about whether a prompt response might have saved Zimmerman 's life .
Police are still looking for her killer .
" We are working diligently on this case , have generated significant leads , and are making progress , " said Joel De Spain of the Madison Police Department .
The police said they believe Zimmerman was attacked by a stranger .
Her apartment door showed signs of forced entry .
After interviews with Zimmerman 's family , friends and acquaintances , investigators determined there was no personal motive for the attack .
" In fact , we have not been able to determine any motive yet in this case , " De Spain said .
He emphasized that police have no reason to believe Zimmerman was the victim of a serial killer .
During the investigation , police have tracked leads pointing to vagrants in Zimmerman 's off - campus neighborhood .
The vagrants often would knock on doors and beg for money .
" We are still investigating this avenue , but at this time we have not been able to develop any specific suspects , " De Spain said .
Zimmerman 's family and friends describe her as a loving , warm young woman , who had much to look forward to .
She was engaged to the love of her life and had dreams of earning a medical degree , they said .
She was idealistic , and her goal was to help people , not to earn a large salary , they said .
Other details in the released warrants reveal that Zimmerman was murdered in her bedroom , that her cell phone was found in " parts , " and that her bloody slippers and bloody computer paper were recovered .
The murder weapon is described as a knife , two to five inches long .
Police are not saying whether they have recovered it .
DNA was collected from Zimmerman 's body , as well as hair , blood samples , footprints and fingerprints .
So far , no match has been made to a suspect .
Zimmerman 's family is offering a $ 14,000 reward , and Crime Stoppers is offering $ 1,000 for tips leading to the arrest and / or conviction of anyone responsible for Zimmerman 's death .

WASHINGTON — Lashkar - e - Taiba , the Pakistan - based militant group suspected of conducting the Mumbai attacks , has quietly gained strength in recent years with the help of Pakistan ’s main spy service , assistance that has allowed the group to train and raise money while other militants have been under siege , American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say .
American officials say there is no hard evidence to link the spy service , the Directorate for Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , to the Mumbai attacks .
But the ISI has shared intelligence with Lashkar and provided protection for it , the officials said , and investigators are focusing on one Lashkar leader they believe is a main liaison with the spy service and a mastermind of the attacks .
As a result of the assault on Mumbai , India ’s financial hub , American counterterrorism and military officials say they are reassessing their view of Lashkar and believe it to be more capable and a greater threat than they had previously recognized .
“ People are having to go back and relook at all the connections , ” said one American counterterrorism official , who was among several officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still progressing .
Grand jury ' to indict officers in subway sodomy case ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email
This A grand jury has reportedly decided to indict three police officers over allegations that a man was sodomized with a police baton after being seen smoking marijuana outside a Brooklyn subway station last October .
The victim , Michael Mineo , called Rev. Al Sharpton 's radio show on Monday to thank the Brooklyn district attorney and the grand jury .
He told Sharpton , " At first a lot of people were n't believing me , but you know I left it in God 's hands . "
Mineo claims that Officer Richard Kern sodomized him with a collapsible police baton , while the other cops held him down , after they chased him into the subway .
But instead of being arrested , Mineo was let go with a summons for disorderly conduct .
The Associated Press now reports that the three patrolmen will surrender after having been notified that they face criminal charges in the case .
According to a New York Times report , Mineo 's lawyers " said the attack left Mr. Mineo with a tear to his rectum that became abscessed and had to be surgically drained . "
While the hospital records have n't been publicly released , his lawyers maintain that they " showed that Mr. Mineo had suffered from an ' anal assault , ' and that the diagnosis reflected an independent medical conclusion .
One law enforcement official said Mr. Mineo suffered a tear to his rectum that was both internal and external , " the paper reported .
Mineo , who says he still suffers pain from his injury , told the New York Post , " I 'm looking forward to my day in court .
...
This man ... does n't deserve to be on the street .
I want him to go to jail . "
The grand jury indictment has not yet been unsealed , but sources report that Kern will be charged on Tuesday with either assault or aggravated sexual assault , while two other officers will face lesser charges .
Mineo's attorneys also plan to file a federal civil rights lawsuit .
The Daily News revealed last month that New York City paid $ 50,000 earlier this year to settle a police brutality suit brought against Kern and another officer
Although the New York Police Department initially denied Mineo 's charges , citing some onlookers who said they had not witnessed the alleged assault , other witnesses said they saw the officers punching Mineo and kicking him in the head and that his pants were pulled down .
Sharpton was the first prominent figure to support Mineo and led the call for an independent investigation .
He told reporters on Monday , " I think the outrage of this case is that the Internal Affairs Department of the New York City Police Department repeatedly said that there was no grounds to believe Michael Mineo . "
Mineo's doctors testified to his injuries before the grand jury , and the jurors were particularly convinced by evidence that Mineo's DNA had been found on a piece of equipment belonging to Officer Kern .
One of the other transit officers also testified that he had seen Kern place his baton across Mineo 's buttocks as he was being handcuffed .
Mineo expressed gratitude to that officer when he spoke to the Post on Monday , saying .
" He 's a good dude .
I appreciate it because without him , I would still be in limbo . "

In a recent developer conference in Sydney , someone asked Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer why they ’re spending so many resources on their beloved browser , Internet Explorer :
Why is IE still relevant and why is it worth spending money on rendering engines when there are open source ones available that can respond to changes in Web standards faster ?
According to Techworld , this was his reply :
Ballmer began his answer philosophically , saying Microsoft will need to look at what the browser is like in the future and , if there is no innovation around them , which he thinks is “ likely ” , Microsoft may still need its own browser because of proprietary extensions that broaden its functionality .
“ Open source is interesting , ” he said .
“ Apple has embraced Webkit and we may look at that , but we will continue to build extensions for IE 8 . ”
So now if we can imagine Microsoft actually swallowing its pride to rework IE to use the same code Apple is using with Safari , and Google with Chrome , we ’d have 3 competing browsers by 3 technological giants using the same foundations for building a browser .
It would seem like good news for those who ’ve spent sleepless nights keeping websites from breaking due to IE ’s numerous bugs , although I ’m not quite sure why have to have 3 different derivatives of WebKit in the first place — which is an issue for another day .
I want to go back to the question of relevance .
Ballmer did n’t exactly defend IE ’s relevance , even saying that there is likely to be “ no innovation around them ” .
Are you sure ?
Mozilla definitely thinks otherwise .
So does Google .
Add to that Microsoft ’s foray into the “ cloud ” with Windows Azure .
Google , which wanted to make sure its web apps provided the best experience , created its own web browser .
IE has been around for years now , but what could be crucial to next - generation platform computing seems to be an afterthought , or is just playing catch - up .
If we were to actually take Ballmer ’s words to heart , we can expect that either way , web browsing should improve for the better : either through a Webkit - based IE , or the death of IE .
It may very well be the latter , if we ’re to believe this comment on the article at the AppleInsider forums :
The IE team was dismantled except for a core team called IE SE – which translates to “ IE Sustained Engineering ” .
What this means … is a product is dead and the SE team simply puts out hot - fixes for any pertinent issues .
This all happened during that great legal battle that Microsoft had with the States .
I know we can accomplish a lot more by not waiting around for IE ( and Microsoft ) to get its act together , but here ’s yet another reason web designers and developers are in a rut .
If the company behind Internet Explorer does not believe in it , why should we ?
American officials can have some pretty over - the - top reactions to hackers and so - called cyber terrorists .
Once , I saw a briefing comparing our own Kevin Poulsen to Osama bin Laden and Pablo Escobar – seriously .
But the U.S. has nothing on Pakistan , when it comes to cyber terror paranoia .
Yesterday , Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari signed a law making cyber terror a crime " punishable with death . "
Executions will only be allowed if the hack attack " causes [ the ] death of any person , " the Prevention of Electronic Crimes law states .
But the definition of what is considered " cyber terror " is alarmingly broad in the law , proposed last year and signed Thursday by the Pakistani president .
Not only does it apply to " any person , group or organization who , with terroristic intent utilizes , accesses or causes to be accessed a computer or computer network or electronic system or electronic device or by any available means , and thereby knowingly engages in or attempts to engage in a terroristic act . "
The ordinance also considers cyber terrorism to be :
*( a )
altering by addition , deletion , or change or attempting to alter information that may result in the imminent injury , sickness , or death to any segment of the population ;
* *( b)
transmission or attempted transmission of a harmful program with the purpose of substantially disrupting or disabling any computer network operated by the
Government or any public entity ;
* ( c )
aiding the commission of or attempting to aid the commission of an act of violence against the sovereignty of Pakistan , whether or not the commission of such act of violence is actually completed ; or
* ( d )
stealing or copying , or attempting to steal or copy , or secure classified information or data necessary to manufacture any form of chemical , biological or nuclear weapon , or any other weapon of mass destruction .
*
In contrast , the maximum penalty for a hacking crime under U.S. law is 20 years in prison .
Although , as we 've seen in recent years , Washington seems to give itself a little , um , * leeway * when it comes to perceived terror threats .

bout three years ago , I spent a few hours building an RSS news aggregator for Ruby news .
I wrote it in Java because my one leased server at the time was all set up to host multiple JSP web applications .
I deployed the finished product as RubyPlanet . net .
Around the same time , I discovered Ruby on Rails ( RoR ) and have since become an enthusiastic RoR user .
For new web projects these days , I typically use Rails ( unless I need the speed and scalability of some part of the J2 EE stack ) .
But the introduction of the MVC framework Merb may change that .
Merb is potentially much faster than Rails , and with the performance improvements to Ruby ( C - Ruby , JRuby , etc. ) , the combination of Merb and Ruby may well provide adequate performance for most of my new projects in the future .
On the eve of the version 1.0 release , this article explains how Merb can deliver a 2 - 4X speed increase over Rails and why that makes it better for certain applications .
Merb is clearly patterned after Rails , so this article concentrates more on how Merb is different from Rails and on which types of applications are better suited for Merb than Rails .
While using Merb is more difficult than using Rails , Merb is touted as a " hacker 's framework " and there is a lot of truth in that .
With a small kernel ( about 6,000 lines of code ) , it is easier to get into the Merb code base .
The web application I use as an example is a Ruby +
Merb replacement for the original Java version of RubyPlanet .
net that I wrote three years ago ( see Figure 1 for an overview ) .
The new Ruby +
Merb version took the same amount of time to write , but it required less code and has more functionality .
Less code makes it simpler to maintain and modify .
Thread Safe Beyond the Speed Boost
Merb has more to offer than just runtime performance .
For example , its small core of functionality with plugins and " slices " ( complete mini-apps that install in an existing Merb project ) does not , in principle , have cross dependencies .
Because Merb was designed to be modular , you can include just the plugins and " slices " your application needs , keeping your systems simpler .
Perhaps more importantly , Merb is thread safe and has built - in support for running background tasks as threads .
That means deployed Merb applications are likely to require much less memory because you can use work threads instead of extra processes to serve up page and web service requests .
Without this feature , you risk duplicating application and framework libraries ( if shared libraries are not used ) as well as application data when you run many identical processes on a server .
For some types of web applications , using a cluster of Mongrels and aggressive page and page fragment caching provides very good performance .
For applications with highly customized page content , a single process with in - memory data caching is better .
Because Merb is thread safe , it enables you to build web applications that can better take advantage of in - memory data caching .
Figure 1 . Layout of the Merb Demo App : Here is the rough layout of the Merb version of RubyPlanet.
net .
If you want to use in - memory caching with RoR instead , you can run a cluster of Mongrels , each with a copy of the cache .
However , that eats up more server memory .
Alternatively , you can use Memcached to cache common data between multiple Mongrels , but that incurs some communications overhead .
For some applications , it is simply more efficient to cache data in - memory and count on multiple threads to support concurrent users .
Because Merb is thread safe and supports running background tasks as threads , I was able to run the entire Merb version of RubyPlanet .
net in a single process and use an in - memory cache for active feeds .
A single Merb process can process many page requests per second ( more on that later ) .
Figure 1 shows the rough layout of the Merb version of RubyPlanet.net .
Installing Merb
The first decision that you need to make before installing Merb is whether you want to use stable or " edge " versions .
While I encourage you to eventually contribute to Merb , in which case you would install nightly developer builds , this article assumes that you are starting with stable builds and using C - Ruby 1.8.6 ( I had some difficulties with Merb 1.0RC4 and JRuby but these may be fixed soon ) .
Begin by typing the following to install a stable version of Merb as a collection of gems :
gem install merb
You will also need the simple - rss and atom gems installed :
gem install simple - rss gem install atom
The simple - rss gem handles both RSS and Atom , but for Atom it returns only the first link element , ignoring the rest .
For blogging services like blogger.com , you need all links to get the one with the attribute rel= ' alternate ' .
The Merb core developer team intended Merb to be modular and highly customizable , but for new users they also wanted to provide a ready - to - use experience out of the box .
This standard Merb install uses DataMapper instead of ActiveRecord ( which you can easily use with a change to the config / init.rb file ) and installs and uses the jQuery JavaScript library .
Erb is the default template engine ( also set in the config / init.rb file ) .
I have been using Hotelogix since August of 2012 and I must say that I am more than delighted .
Hotelogix is a very reliable system that has eased day - to - day work , giving me up to 3 hours of free time per day .
The system makes all our rooms available online which helps us stay fully booked .
Designed by Manuel Saez for Humanscale , a popular manufacturer of ergonomic office furniture , the daybed is what I would call the ultimate chair for lazy , laptop - using Web surfers .
I mean , look at this thing !
It looks so comfortable , I doubt anyone sitting in it would ever want to get up , even after several hours of intensive Web surfing .
However , the design of the chair definitely looks like it could prevent unhealthy postures , particularly those adopted when using a laptop .
With the upcoming Star Trek Movie on our doorstep , it looks like it could fit in somewhere aboard the enterprise .
Unfortunately , there ’s no word yet on pricing or availability , but my guess is that as most Humanscale furniture , it ’s going to be pretty damn expensive .

I 'm a big fan of Noah Scalin 's ambitious Skull - a - Day project , through which he crafts and posts a skull using a different medium every day .
So I was delighted to get a review copy of SKULLS , the book adaptation of his website , which lavishly reproduces his expert photographs of his widely varied projects .
Every one of these skulls is an artistic success , though some are better than others ( I 'm a big fan of the food - skulls like those shown below — even the simple Soy - Sauce Skull is admirably well - executed given the volatility of the medium ) .
It 's always tricky to turn a website into a book , but this is a good one : in addition to the skulls and the brief artist 's notes , there 's a couple of appendices , one of which will teach to you make skulls from a variety of household objects , the other shows off some of the best fan - skulls Scalin inspired .

I am a popular commodity amoung some people I know , I am the only one who knows how to roll a joint .
Now this is because I tend to be older than most of the people who smoke dope around me and have a bit more intense life lesson than others .
I like rolling joints .
It is a very viscereal pleasure , you get to play with the nifty green stuff and it gives your hands something to do .
This is especially nice if it is good if you do n't wanna get really stoned but just catch a nice buzz and instead of keeping your hands busy smoking you keep 'em busy rolling .
I like that green stuff .
It 's cool , kinda like oregano or some other green bulk spice but you know it aint .
It has the smell , strange how so many people do n't groove to it , ahh well learnd response , like appreciating good scotch .
It reminds me of harvest day , right after the fruit has been reaped and the oils and esthers fill the air .
Very good green homey feel to it .
Then you get into carding the stuff to take out the seeds and stems and to break it down so it will roll effectively .
It has to feel right , a bit drier than the best feel , where it is so sticky with resin that all you can do is load it into a bowl and do bong hits until your brain goes numb .
You gotta decide how fine you are gonna sift the shake .
I know some who remove everything until nothing is left but a fine red dust .
I do n't like that , it takes too long , and casues too many volatiles to be released as you card it , and makes really lousey joints that pack too tightly and do n't draw worth shit .
We all roll joints to match our personality , my joins tend to have stuff in them that should n't be there , leave things on the tray that SHOULD be , double paper walled , kinda fat in the middle , nice where it meats the mouth , and fulla garbage that gets burnt .
Once you got the grass ready you them have to get you papers in order .
The way I learned to make a joint was to make a boat out of the paper .
Take the paper in you hand so that the gummed side is up and the crease is away from you , the short sides are called edges and the long sides are called sides .
You fold the end towards the side , each in turn .
First you take the left edge and you fold it about the top corner of that edge , bringing the lower corner up to where it meets the top side and the edge is perfectly in line with the side .
Then you do the same thing about the bottom corner , and then you do it for each of the other corners on the other side .
You have to make sure all the creases are away from you , then , from where the two bisectors meet on out to the edge you fold agains the crease , you fold in the same place but in the other direction of the original crease
You do that with each edge and you get a little paper boat into which you can shift your sift .
After having thoughly raked the herb you wind up with a little mound of grass , how big depends on how strong the grass is , how big the papers are , and how stoned you wanna get .
I usually use a bit more than would fill a large bowl .
You pick the gras up between you fingers and dust it into the paper boat .
Try to get it even but do n't worry about it you can fix it .
Towards the bottom of the mound you run into stuff too fine pick up with your fingers , I consider it a point of grace to card once , and once only , it back into a smalled mound and then try to get at least one good pinch or two from it and let the rest of the shit go back into the baggie until one is scaping for anything green that burns .
As you load the paper you are gonna spill dust , just let it go .
Make sure you load over the tray and you will either get it with the cleanup card or smoke it some other time .
Now you take your boat full of dope and begin leveling it .
Stir it about with your finger to balance as much as possible and then you will begin rolling it .
Make sure the gummed side is away from you if there is one .
You roll it to settle the grass and get it even , and ya try to get it to spread out towards the edges .
This is where people who use doller bills use them , I always thought it was too much hassle to fuck with .
Once you have it spread to suit your desires you then have to roll the paper up into a joint .
This is the tricky part .
I always try to finish rolling it so that it is very near the ungummed edge and then to just fold that over and roll it up .
Try to get it a bit tighter than you wanna some cause it will looesen as you roll it up .
Just before your finished you have to lick the gum .
The best I ever saw anyone do that was this little oriental girl I knew who had the most pointed tounge that was always moist .
She had absolute control over her tounge , she could make it do things that would give you an orgasm just watching the movements .
I being who I am tend to either slobber a bit too much or not get enough on there , it could be better but it works .
You finish rolling it up and and then you gotta close the sides .
The best way I have found to close the sides is to just roll one end and figure what gets caught gets caught and turn it so the other end is upright and then use a small poker to pull out things which stick out and push in the stuff that needs to go inside .
Roll the ends counter to each other and lick to close .
I got friends that stick half the damned joint in thier mouths , and others who just touch it to thier tounge .
I am undecided , the wetter it gets the better the joint is but it just grates my aesthetics .
Let it dry and you gotta joint .
I tend to double wrap mine , by rolling that joint in annother , it strengths that fragine middle section and generally keeps a tight nice looking joint .
I also tend to tear off that messy end , the one that caught what got caught , to suck on , and use the flashy paper tail to light it .
Spanish designers Discoh have created a sex toy inspired by the aloe vera plant .
Called Aloe , the product comes packaged in a " pot " and its function only becomes apparent once removed .
Here 's some text from the designers :
--
ALOE
Physical stimulation .
Aesthetic pleasure .
A complicit wink able to be a natural part of our daily environment .
“ Aloe ” reimagines the role of erotic toys , becoming itself a piece that rises from obscurity to become an integral part of any home .
An object of worship .
An unexpected gift .
The model gets inspiration from the well - known Aloe - Vera , and shows a refined silhouette that only reveals its true aim once its two pieces are separated ( plant + pot )
According to its creators , “ Aloe gives the user the chance to choose .
It 's a dildo .
But visually it can also be a plant .
It can be a perfect gift or even an elegant way of ending a relationship ” .
“ Aloe ” features a rigid smooth surface and a packaging that draws inspiration from the high - cosmetics world .

There is something about having sex on a daily basis , and then suddenly not having it anymore .
It does something to you .
It changes you .
It 's like having a cup of coffee twice a day , and then not having it anymore .
You get headaches , right ?
So what happens when I do n't get my daily dose of penis ?
Well , I 've noticed the following series of maladies : 1. IRRITABILITY - Suddenly I 'm aware of how annoying Eva Longoria is .
I do n't know what it is .
Maybe it is the fact that she is representing us Latin actresses , but cannot seem to get a role that does n't require her to be a " sex pot " .
What does that say about our culture ?
Where are the roles with substance ?
I know there are intelligent roles for Latin women , but there are few .
I 'm irritated .
In addition , my impatience in everything is increasing .
I was in line at the grocery store , and I was watching some kid tying his shoes for fifteen minutes .
I almost lunged at him and tied them myself .
Those two minutes I spend waiting for my cup - o - soup to heat up in the microwave are interminable .
I attritute this new impatience and irritability to my celibacy .
2. BLURRED VISION -
Does that sign say " slow for pedestians " or " glow on partisans " ?
I have dubbed the nickname " squinty . "
Do I need a stronger prescription of glasses ?
Would that cure the double vision ?
It ca n't be age related .
I 'm only 21 .
I shall attribute this new blurred vision to my celibacy .
3. SEXUAL SYMBOLISM - Everything around me has a sexual connotation .
Is it just me , but is Marge Simpson 's hair do a phallic symbol ?
George W. Bush 's face looks like a vagina .
Trees ?
Phallic .
Pumping gas into my car ?
Oh so sexual .
Skyscrapers ?
Phallic .
Hotdogs ?
Phallic .
Even my neighbor looks like a walking penis with his shaven head .
I attribute this to my celibacy .
4. INCORRECT GRAMMAR -
You cannot imagine how many times I 've spell checked this document .
Is it spelled " grammar " or " grammer " ?
Do I use a comma or a semi-colon ?
I 've never had this problem before .
I attribute any occurences of incorrect grammar to my celibacy .
5. GERIATRIC MAGNETISM -
Suddenly , everywhere I go I 'm surrounded by old people .
I 'm talking about 70 +.
I do n't have a problem with senior citizens , but I find it a strange occurence that they navigate towards me .
Hell , I was at a club on college night last Thursday , and there was Sean Connery looking fellow standing beside me .
WTF ???
It 's as if they can sense the unuse of genitalia and they think I 'm one of them .
I attribute this new geriatric magnetism to my celibacy .
6 . THE DESIRE TO OWN A CAT - That homeless tabby looks so cute .
Maybe I 'll take him in .
What ?
Wait a damn minute .
. . I 'm allergic !
Why the hell do I suddenly want a cat ?
I shall attribute this strange desire to my celibacy .
7. DRIVING AT A SLOWER SPEED - I 've always been a speed demon on the road , but lately I 've been having old ladies in Lincoln Towncars pass me while giving me the finger .
80 miles an hour on the highway ?
No siree Spongebob !
I drive at a solid 60 mph now .
Why ?
I do n't know , but I 'll go ahead and attribute my slower speed to my celibacy .
8. KNITTING - I 'm sitting in front of my television watching a riveting episode of House .
I look down .
There is a ball of yarn on my lap and I 'm holding two needles .
How did the yarn get there ?
And when did I learn how to knit ?
I attribute this phenomenon to my celibacy .
9 . MASTERY OF PUZZLES - Jigsaw , crossword , cryptograms , or whatever .
Somehow I 'm an expert .
I attribute this to my celibacy .
10 .
DECLINE OF HUMOR - Suddenly
I 'm not as funny or as clever as I used to be .
I 'm no longer on top of my game .
My keen observations of the trivialties of life have turned into inane ramblings .
I was once sharp , but now I 'm dull .
I 'll consider this a phase , and I will attribute this to my celibacy .
