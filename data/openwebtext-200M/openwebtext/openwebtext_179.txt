SAN FRANCISCO / Judges OK warrantless monitoring of Web use / Privacy rules do n't apply to Internet messages , court says
Federal agents do not need a search warrant to monitor a suspect 's computer use and determine the e-mail addresses and Web pages the suspect is contacting , a federal appeals court ruled Friday .
In a drug case from San Diego County , the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco likened computer surveillance to the " pen register " devices that officers use to pinpoint the phone numbers a suspect dials , without listening to the phone calls themselves .
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the use of pen registers in 1979 , saying callers have no right to conceal from the government the numbers they communicate electronically to the phone companies that carry their calls .
Federal law requires court approval for a pen register .
But because it is not considered a search , authorities do not need a search warrant , which would require them to show that the surveillance is likely to produce evidence of a crime .
They also do not need a wiretap order , which would require them to show that less intrusive methods of surveillance have failed or would be futile .
In Friday 's ruling , the court said computer users should know that they lose privacy protections with e-mail and Web site addresses when they are communicated to the company whose equipment carries the messages .
Likewise , the court said , although the government learns what computer sites someone visited , " it does not find out the contents of the messages or the particular pages on the Web sites the person viewed . "
The search is no more intrusive than officers ' examination of a list of phone numbers or the outside of a mailed package , neither of which requires a warrant , Judge Raymond Fisher said in the 3 - 0 ruling .
Defense lawyer Michael Crowley disagreed .
His client , Dennis Alba , was sentenced to 30 years in prison after being convicted of operating a laboratory in Escondido that manufactured the drug ecstasy .
Some of the evidence against Alba came from agents ' tracking of his computer use .
The court upheld his conviction and sentence .
Expert evidence in Alba 's case showed that the Web addresses obtained by federal agents included page numbers that allowed the agents to determine what someone read online , Crowley said .
The ruling " further erodes our privacy , " the attorney said .
" The great political marketplace of ideas is the Internet , and the government has unbridled access to it . "

Global warming will melt polar ice , the UN has warned
The statement from the Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment ( Globe ) forum brings together Americans , Chinese , Indians , Brazilians , Canadians and Europeans into a surprising agreement about the way ahead .
It has no government authority .
But it will be sent to the meeting of G8 world leaders , so it is significant .
It has three main planks - firstly , an agreement that all countries had to face targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
It has been a major bone of contention in the United States that China and India do not have targets at the moment - so that is useful .
American shift
Secondly , it urges the G8 to set a very aggressive timetable for a deal to replace the Kyoto protocol when the first period ends in 2012 .
Talks should be launched at the UN meeting in Bali in November and concluded by 2009 .
This is very ambitious .
Thirdly , it demands world leaders agree to a top limit beyond which carbon dioxide emissions should not go - between 450 and 550 parts per million .
China and India currently have no targets for emissions cuts
The notion of a stabilisation goal has been championed by the British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
The legislators ' deal was forged by the British delegation working round the clock in the majestic columned hall at the US Senate where the Watergate hearings were held .
The British prime minister 's climate envoy Elliot Morley was in the chair , with Mr Blair 's Sherpa for the Gleneagles G8 meeting - Lord Jay - working behind the scenes .
What has been particularly remarkable over the past few days is to witness the shift in American opinion .
A procession of top US politicians shared their conviction that the US was just about to make mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
The president 's official spokesman did not say that , but the senators think they can either bypass the president or wait him out .
Political lag
Binding limits will not be imposed without a fight .
Larry Craig the Republican member of the energy committee changed the mood by asserting that it was only " possible " that greenhouse gas emissions were cranking up the climate .
He said he could not support anything that would reduce American growth , and suggested that the slower growth in Europe was partly due to carbon dioxide controls .
Senator Craig was later buttonholed by a shouting female Italian Green MP as he emerged from a side door - his face an impassive senatorial mask , his eyes alarmed and darting for an escape route .
He was rebuked by the man who failed to beat President George W Bush last time round - John Kerry .
He pledged that mandatory greenhouse gas cuts would be agreed in Congress over the next few years , maybe even under George Bush if he was presented with legislation overwhelmingly supported by Congress .
Scientists present lamented that the politics still lagged far behind what was need to protect the climate - but this political deal is movement of sorts .

What is the single biggest way people waste time without even realizing it ?
Surfing the web .
Maybe that does n’t count , though , since most folks actually do know they ’re wasting time .
Biggest time waster without knowing it is being chatty .
For real .
Chattiness is a total time sink !
Brendon Connelly from Slacker Manager ( rss )
I ’m starting to experiment with a Firefox plugin called PageAddict that is supposed to show you how much time you spend on various websites throughout the day .
I think very few of us realize how much time we spend browsing .
Being chatty is n’t something I would have thought of , but that is a good one .
Which ties in nicely with our next time waster …
Instant Messaging .
It ’s convenient , but usually a giant distracting time sink .
Chanpory Rith from LifeClever ( rss )
I have a love / hate relationship with IM .
One tip I ’ve heard of people using is to always leave your status set to busy or hidden .
That way you can interrupt other people , but they wo n’t know you are available to interrupt yourself .
In my opinion , one of the biggest ways that people waste time without realizing it is by not having a basic agenda for their day , a routine if you will .
Many people get up in the morning and just start doing things without being organized about it .
The same applies when they get to work .
I have had plenty of jobs , and have seen so many people come in and putter around , getting coffee , searching for something in their desk from the day before , generally being unorganized about getting through their day .
They often waste an entire hour trying to “ Get started ” , and then wonder why they feel like they are behind the 8 - ball all day long .
Stephen Smith from HD BizBlog 1.2 ( rss )
Stephen makes a good point about having a routine .
Most of the highly productive people I ’ve known have a routine for at least certain parts of their day .
I think communication tools , of all types , get in the way of productivity .
Of course , it ’s not the tools themselves that is the problem , but rather our attention to them .
If we allow every incoming communication to take our focus away from what we ’re doing , we quickly lose chunks of productive time .
Ian McKenzie from Ian ’s Messy Desk ( rss )
If a communication tool is breaking your flow of concentration , it probably is hindering you more than it is helping .
I ’ve heard people talking about only answering their email twice a day or even once per week in order to keep it from becoming a distraction .
When I think about the number of devices I have that other people can cause to beep , vibrate or shriek it is amazing I get anything done .
Fortunately I ’ve turned most of them to silent so I can deal with them on my own schedule .
Multitasking
John Richardson from Success Begins Today ( rss )
Multitasking is something that I think in 10 years will have major negative connotations .
It was brought to the fore because of computers , so for a while it carried the idea of being fast like a computer .
In the near future I think it will stick out as a negative term .
Kind of like the name ChemLawn does today .
When ChemLawn was created it probably sounded scientific and sophisticated .
Now it sounds toxic .
( And they have changed their name to TruGreen . )
Watching television .
Although we realize that TV is a waste of time , we do n’t notice how much time it really consumes .
In most households it ’s constantly on and it has a way of sucking you in longer than you plan .
Just try going without it for a weekend and you ’ll be amazed at how much more productively you spend your spare time .
It increased my productivity 500 - 1000 % easily and I felt great too .
John Wesley from Pick the Brain : An Analytical Approach to Self Improvement ( rss )
When I read this time waster , I immediately thought of a blog entry I read where someone was describing going the weekend without TV .
After doing some searching I discovered it was actually from Johns blog here .
My wife and I have gone without a television for several years now .
We will watch DVDs for entertainment , but we do n’t sit down and channel surf .
If we are bored , we ’ll go for a walk , but we do n’t let television just consume our time .
Attacking television has been a common theme at Productivity 501 , but it is a pretty easy target .
According to a study , Americans spend half of their free time watching television .
So on average , cutting out TV will double the amount of free time you have .
Not bad .
Not having a purpose for being productive – they do n’t understand the difference between being busy and being effective .
When you ’re busy , you may look like you ’re getting lots done , but it ’s actually energy being scattered .
When you ’re moving in pursuit of a goal , then you ’re doing things effectively .
Alvin Soon from Life Coaches Blog
This is a very good point that is often overlooked .
It is n’t how much you do that matters .
I see this problem a lot when people start buying all kinds of gadgets to “ help ” them get work done .
Unless those things are part of an overall plan toward a particular goal , it is unlikely that new electronic toys will be of any benefit .
Staying busy , without really working .
What I mean by this is doing lots of activities — checking email , making phone calls , meetings , reading feeds and Websites — things that keep you busy , but not working towards a goal .
Staying busy , and accomplishing your goals , are two very different things .
I ’ve fallen into this trap myself many times
Tony D. Clark from Success from the Nest ( rss )
In Productivity and Values I said : “ It is n’t a matter of doing a lot of things .
Productivity is accomplishing important things . ”
Busyness .
Most people do n’t realize that being busyness is just disguised laziness .
I ’m talking about doing stuff that makes you feel productive without contributing any value to your life .
Productivity is n’t about becoming a robot , it ’s about becoming smart .
Learn to do the things that count , and think critically about the stuff that really does n’t .
Scott Young from Scott H Young ( rss )
Wow .
Three in a row about busyness .
Honestly , this is one of the problems I have with time management and organizational systems and processes .
They often give people an easy way to track minutia that really should be forgotten or passed off to someone else .
If you really want to be productive your goal should be to narrow down the things you do to just the things where you add the most value .
By not breaking down projects into bite - sized tasks , people procrastinate as they are n’t really sure how to tackle the project .
Mike St. Pierre from The Daily Saint ( rss )
I actually suffered from this problem in putting this post together .
So many people participated that just organizing all the responses was getting daunting .
I finally decided to just deal with the responses from the first day .
Once I got on a roll it was easy to finish the rest .
However before I gave myself a small manageable amount , I spent a bunch of time thinking about the task instead of actually doing it .
Mindless routines .
You get into a habit of doing something a certain way , but because you ’re in a groove , you do n’t notice when the situation changes and you keep doing things that way .
Over time , this accumulates and results in a lot of lost time .
Here ’s an example : before my son was born , I had a highly efficient morning routine .
When he was born , I simply added taking my son to his daycare to that routine , which made sense at first .
What I found out , though , was that a bit of analysis of this change would easily shave fifteen minutes a day off of the overall routine .
Look at your normal routines and ask yourself if they really make sense .
Trent Hamm from The Simple Dollar ( rss )
I see this a lot when I work with clients and look at their business processes .
Often times something is being done by a worker who does n’t really understand the entire process flow and as a result they are performing senseless tasks that do n’t add any value .
It is amazing how easy it is to overlook simple ways to save time once we get into a habit .
The order of things can make a big difference in the amount of time required .
In fact As I ’m writing this , I ’ve thought of two or three things in my morning routine that can probably give me an extra 20 minutes if I just switch them around to different times .
Leaving an email in the in - box after reading it .
Laura Stack , MBA , CSP from The Productivity Pro(R ) ( rss )
I know this is good advice , but I ’ve given up on cleaning out my inbox .
I keep everything in there unless I know it can safely be deleted .
However , I ’ve created other systems to deal with todo items that come in .
I like the idea of a clean inbox , but the ability to easily search for any email from my computer or the web has always outweighed the benefits of having my inbox completely clean .
For me , I ’ve found my biggest problem is when I read an email and think “ Ok I ’ll deal with that later ” .
If I deal with it now whether that is by replying , moving it to a to - do folder or deleting it , I fare much better .
Maybe I need a better system .
People waste time making the same little decisions again and again .
They keep asking themselves things like “ do I have to wake up now ” “ should I work out today , ” “ can I watch another 30 minutes of TV . ”
Success is a habit .
Train yourself to always wake up at a certain time , make your workouts mandatory , schedule your TV watching and stick to that schedule .
The constant plea bargaining in your mind not only wastes your time , but it also lowers your motivation to get things done .
Will from Wise Bread ( rss )
This very much relates to the idea of having a routine .
Someone who gets up and goes jogging every day for the past 5 years is n’t going to spend much time wondering if he should go today .
Part of the trick to doing this is to start small with things that you will actually follow through with .
I see people decide they are going to get up at 5 am every morning and it lasts exactly 0 days .
They would be better off getting up consistently at 7 and sticking with that commitment and then see about moving it back .
Instead of committing to yourself to workout for 2 hours a day , maybe you should start with doing 50 sit ups and 25 push ups and sticking with it .
Not making decisions consciously early .
Often they set papers aside or leave emails sitting in the inbox to go back to the later .
They sometime do n’t go back , sometime loose papers under other papers , and sometime create an unmanageable backlog .
Thus , they waste time in handling mail and email too many times .
Another place decisions ahead of time could help is in interactions with others .
For example , time is wasted in meetings without agendas and during visits at cubicles without defined purpose .
Susan Sabo from Productivity Cafe ( rss )
It is very easy to deal with a grouping of items ( email , mail , papers , etc. ) with the idea that you ’ll find something you want to act on and do it .
This creates a terrible environment for productivity because instead of getting work done , you start shopping for your favorite task .
When I was 12 my mom gave me a book on how to clean my room .
It said that once you pickup an item you should put it away .
Do n’t put it back down and just pick something else up that you ’d rather put away ( or fiddle with ) .
This is good advice for almost everything .
I would have to say that the largest time sink ( at least , in my humble opinion ) is the simple act of thinking about all of your responsibilities and commitments ( called “ open loops ” in GTD parlance ) .
Having your own mind constantly interrupt you with other things you need to be doing ( or forgot to do ) can absolutely cripple your productivity and effectiveness in most areas of your life .
Not to be too much of a GTD evangelist , but knowing that all of my stuff is written down elsewhere makes it much easier to focus on what I ’m doing , and doing that task well .
And obviously , the clearer your head is when doing something , the better you ’ll be able to perform .
Brett Kelly from Cranking Widgets ( rss )
To me this is the most valuable part of GTD .
I ’m not really that big on particular systems because I think it is very easy to start working your system instead of accomplishing actual work .
But the idea that you need to put your ideas , thoughts and commitments somewhere you trust so you can concentrate on other things with a clear mind is very valuable .
When I was practicing the piano for 4 hours a day , I would keep a notepad with me in the practice room .
If I thought of something important , I would right it down and go back to giving my full attention to the music I was working on .
If I did n’t part of my attention would remain distracted .
Over a 4 hour session , it was easy to come up with so many things to think about that half of my attention was on things other than the music .
Writing things down allowed me to focus just on the task at hand .
Not de-cluttering and simplifying their lives .
Knowing where everything is saves on time and stress , compared to having to dig around in a drawer , cupboard or even something as small as your wallet ( stuffed with receipts ) to find what you are after .
James from Organize IT ( rss )
I ’ve been doing a lot of this .
It can be incredibly difficult .
My wife and I have moved several times in the past year and this has allowed us to really trim down on the things we have that we did n’t really need .
It is n’t cheap to do because you end up giving things away only to discover that later on you need them again , but that is just part of the cost of simplifying things .
It is amazing how good it feels to know that you have exactly what you need–nothing more and nothing less .
Tweaking your productivity system .
It ’s great to have a spiffy system , but do n’t forget to actually do the tasks on your list .
It feels productive to tweak and change systems , but it ’s so wasteful .
Just do !
Andrew Flusche from Legal Andrew ( rss )
I think sometimes we have a romantic idea of how nice it will be to work when we are perfectly organized .
It is easy to keep chasing a fairytale instead of just doing what needs done .
The perfect tool is not always the best .
Auto - pilot and routine have got to be the biggest culprits .
We are creatures of habit , and our comfort zones get us to justify all sorts of behaviors that are less than productive for us .
The up side to this is that we can consciously create good habits which work in our favor instead .
Auto - pilot now becomes well - placed faith in a trusted system .
Rosa Say from Managing with Aloha ( rss )
I have recently started looking at some of my routines trying to be objective .
I ’m amazed at how many things I find myself doing that make me think “ what in the world ? ! ? ”
They usually are n’t huge time wasters , but just a bunch of small bad habits that waste a few minutes here and there .
Obviously I ’m working to correct these . :)
I believe it is a combination of two things that causes people to waste time without even realizing it .
First , as Stephen Covey put it eloquently , people may be climbing the “ ladder of success ” very efficiently , but if this ladder is leaning against the wrong wall , they wo n’t be effective .
In other words , they may find that they have been very busy doing the wrong things without even realizing it , and therefore wasting their time .
Second , people may be “ doing ” a project or trying to achieve a goal , without having a clear idea about why exactly they are doing it .
In other words , they have n’t given the desired successful outcome of the task or project any significant thought at all .
Again , they may find themselves wasting their time on finishing a project that turns out to have no real value to them .
gtdfrk from Getting Things Done ( rss )
I see a lot of people doing this with their careers .
They spend years working for someone else without ever really thinking about where they want to be later on in life .
One of the strengths I see in the Franklin Planners is that they try to help you figure out your values first and then decide your goals to base your tasks around .
Not knowing their life purpose .
There is no bigger time waster than putting a lot of effort in doing things only to eventually find that they have climbed the wrong ladder for years .
People could even waste their entire life this way .
Donald Latumahina from Life Optimizer ( rss )
A few years ago my wife and I decided to take a much different path from the norm .
This involved selling our huge house and giving up other things , but the result is that we ’ve been able to spend a lot more time focusing on things that are actually important to us .
It is surprising how difficult it can be to really sit down and decide what is important in life because we are so conditioned to think of a particular path and lifestyle as the way to success–even if the result is n’t somewhere we want to end up .
I ’m going to give an answer to an assumption that ’s implicit in your question :
That there is a uniform single problem for everyone .
Instead , I think everyone ’s challenges are different .
When working with clients I ’m always a bit surprised when one thing leaps out at them .
For example , one client loved the simple A - Z filing system – she was very excited to try it .
Another found my email tips most helpful .
However , generalizing one experience to everyone is limiting – it ’s why I teach a consistent , complete system instead of tips and tricks .
That said , email is huge , and presents a big opportunity for many people to improve how they use their time .
Some of my suggestions include scheduling fixed times in the day to process messages ( AKA “ time blocking ” or “ time mapping ” ) , quitting the program afterwards , and making sure the “ new mail ” alarm is disabled .
In workshops I ask clients to think about email as they would a chainsaw – it ’s powerful , dangerous , and should not be fired up just to “ check the trees ” :-)
Start the program , so the work of dealing with each message ( getting them out of the inbox ) , then move on .
Matthew Cornell from Idea Matt ( rss )
I like the chainsaw idea !
It is my understanding that the banks in Switzerland only allow their employees to check email twice each day to help keep it from becoming a huge waste of time .
I think people who attempt to handle all of the inputs of our communication obsessed culture , without having some sort of system , process or plan to deal with it , is the biggest time suck .
A lot of people I know receive scores of e-mails , dozens of phone calls , and a few hundred IM messages and other “ small ” interruptions a day .
Yet , they try to handle the assault of these things with no plan in place .
No wonder they are overwhelmed , wasting time and dropping balls left and right .
I certainly was , until I figured out that having some simple habits , a plan that worked for me and some ruthless changes in what I was willing to accept in order to regain some control .
Patrick Rhone from Patrick Rhone ( rss )
I think some of this goes back to the idea that people do n’t really know how they add value .
Since they do n’t really know what is important and what is n’t they default to doing whatever makes them feel important and feeling busy often fills this void .
Email .
Definitely email .
Email stealthily hides under a title of a “ productivity application ” , while it quietly sucks the time out of your day .
With little applications that pop-up on your computer screen every 3 minutes ( or more ) demanding your attention to forwards to funny videos , email ensures that your productivity flow will be interrupted at regular intervals throughout the day .
Glen Stansberry from LifeDev ( rss )
Our computer desktops are becoming more and more like pinball machines everyday .
A light starts flashing and dinging notifying us that we can score 2,500 points if we respond right now , etc .
The term “ productivity application ” is grossly misused in my opinion .
A productivity application is something that lets you focus on your productive work .
Most “ productivity applications ” are full of all kinds of features to allow us to do things that add no value whatsoever .
We can add animation to our PowerPoint slides , change the color of our fonts in Word , and use email to subscribe to jokes .
If you need to write the content for a document , Notepad with spellcheck is probably a better productivity tool than about any wordprocessor .
Constantly trying to do everything at the same time .
Frank Meeuwsen from
What ’s the Next Action ( rss )
“ Time is what keeps everything from happening all at once . ”
The idea of trying to do everything at the same time sounds crazy , but this is exactly what a lot of people try to do .
They try to answer emails while instant messaging and catching up on the morning news , while drinking their coffee and sorting through yesterday ’s mail .
For a computer to multitask , it has to change its context , which means moving one process out of the processor and moving another in .
The computer can do this very quickly .
People can’t .
I believe most people waste time thinking about unimportant things .
I would call it ‘ unproductive thinking ’ , it ’s those moments when we have arguments with people in our heads when we ’ve not actually had an argument .
If we were to become more aware of our thoughts we could think more productively .
Steven Aitchison from Change Your Thoughts ( rss )
What I like about arguments in my head is that I always win . :)
Seriously this is a good point .
It is difficult to train your mind to be focused and most healthy people have a constant barrage of other thoughts competing with their current task .
Training yourself to focus and to “ turn off ” unproductive thoughts is a difficult but valuable skill to acquire .
Surfing the internet or the TV without a purpose .
Phil Gerbyshak from Make It Great ! ( rss )
And another vote for turning off the TV .
Where I grew up in the country , we only got 2 channels anyway , so it was a lot easier to avoid watching television –there was n’t anything to watch .
There have been some studies that link television watching with small children to autism .
This is pretty scary when you think about how much TV kids watch .
Perfectionism – like taking an half hour to fold laundry perfectly
Looking for things that should be routine – like keys , cell phone , remote controls , clothing , etc .
Long phone calls Ariane Benefit from Neat Living ( rss )
I use to work with a lot of graphic designers .
The perfectionism thing was always a tough issue .
I wanted them to create a quanity of nice brochures for our clients , but they wanted to produce work of art master pieces with absolutely no flaws .
For any type of work , you have to understand the acceptable margin for error .
Otherwise you end up with gilded bricks for building a dog house .
A big time waster that we often do n’t realize is failing to set and focus on priorities .
I speak from my own experience on this !
Rosemary Hon from Daily PlanIt ( rss )
Good point .
This kind of goes along with the idea of busyness .
When you are doing things that are n’t priority , it a matter of being a busy instead of being productive .
Watching television .
For some reason , sitting in front of the TV makes clocks move faster .
I know that even I get lost in it sometimes , with all those channels to pick from .
Seems to always be something on that I am interested in , even though I know I have much better things to do .
David from My Two Dollars ( rss )
I like the point about TV making clocks move faster .
So basically the more you watch television , the shorter your life expectancy . :)
Confusing “ busy - ness ” with productivity .
You can be completely busy all day , uber - organized , on - top - of your calendar , next action lists , reference material , etc. , and yet still not get anything done .
It ’s not just about Collecting , Processing , Organizing .
You really need to get to the Doing and Reviewing .
GTD Wannabe from GTD Wannabe ( rss )
I know a lot of people get too hung up on their organization process and use it as a way to avoid doing actual work .
Managing email constantly , instead of setting aside time , a couple of times a day , to focus on it .
If you are slave to your email inbox , you will waste an incredible amount of time chasing things that are “ urgent ” instead of focusing on the most important things .
Jason Echols from Blackbelt Productivity ( rss )
The old Franklin Quest training use to show everything in four quadrants .
Important and Urgent .
Important and Not Urgent .
Not Important and Urgent .
Not Important and Not Urgent .
They pointed out that the more time you spend in Important and Urgent , the less time you have to focus on things that really help you in the future .
When email is used wrong , it falls into the Important and Urgent category .
There are a million ways we keep ourselves busy when we ’re actually not really accomplishing anything — phone calls , emails , reading blogs , IM , Twitter , etc .
The biggest reason people waste time this way while still thinking they ’re getting stuff done is that they do n’t identify the 2 - 3 most important tasks they want to accomplish today , and focus on them .
Leo Babauta from Zen Habits ( rss )
I like the 2 or 3 task ideas .
If we ’ve organized our lives correctly , 2 or 3 tasks should be all we need to really move ahead .
From HaskellWiki
Overview
Haskell is a functional ( that is , everything is done with function calls ) , statically , implicitly typed ( types are checked by the compiler , but you do n't have to declare them ) , lazy ( nothing is done until it needs to be ) language .
Its closest popular relative is probably the ML family of languages ( which are not , however , lazy languages ) .
The most common Haskell compiler is GHC .
You can download GHC from http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download .
GHC binaries are available for GNU / Linux , FreeBSD , MacOS , Windows , and Solaris .
Once you 've installed GHC , you get two programs you 're interested in right now : ghc , and ghci .
The first compiles Haskell libraries or applications to binary code .
The second is an interpreter that lets you write Haskell code and get feedback right away .
Simple expressions
You can type most math expressions directly into ghci and get an answer .
Prelude > is the default GHCi prompt .
Prelude > 3 * 5 15 Prelude > 4 ^ 2 - 1 15 Prelude > ( 1 - 5 ) ^( 3 * 2 - 4 ) 16
Strings are in " double quotes . "
You can concatenate them with ++ .
Prelude > " Hello " " Hello " Prelude > " Hello " ++ " , Haskell " " Hello , Haskell "
Calling functions is done by putting the arguments directly after the function .
There are no parentheses as part of the function call :
Prelude > succ 5 6 Prelude > truncate 6.59 6 Prelude > round 6.59 7 Prelude > sqrt 2 1.4142135623730951 Prelude > not ( 5 < 3 ) True Prelude > gcd 21 14 7
The console
I /O actions can be used to read from and write to the console .
Some common ones include :
Prelude > putStrLn " Hello , Haskell " Hello , Haskell Prelude > putStr " No newline " No newline Prelude > print ( 5 + 4 ) 9 Prelude > print ( 1 < 2 ) True
The putStr and putStrLn functions output strings to the terminal .
The print function outputs any type of value .
( If you print a string , it will have quotes around it . )
If you need multiple I /O actions in one expression , you can use a do block .
Actions are separated by semicolons .
Prelude > do { putStr " 2 + 2 = " ; print ( 2 + 2 ) } 2 + 2 = 4 Prelude > do { putStrLn " ABCDE " ; putStrLn " 12345 " } ABCDE 12345
Reading can be done with getLine ( which gives back a String ) or readLn ( which gives back whatever type of value you want ) .
The <- symbol is used to assign a name to the result of an I /O action .
Prelude > do { n <- readLn ; print ( n ^ 2 ) } 4 16
( The 4 was input .
The 16 was a result . )
There is actually another way to write do blocks .
If you leave off the braces and semicolons , then indentation becomes significant .
This does n't work so well in ghci , but try putting the file in a source file ( say , Test.hs ) and build it .
main = do putStrLn " What is 2 + 2 ? " x <- readLn if x == 4 then putStrLn " You 're right ! " else putStrLn " You 're wrong ! "
You can build with ghc -- make Test.hs , and the result will be called Test .
( On Windows , Test.exe )
You get an if expression as a bonus .
The first non -space character after do is special .
In this case , it 's the p from putStrLn .
Every line that starts in the same column as that p is another statement in the do block .
If you indent more , it 's part of the previous statement .
If you indent less , it ends the do block .
This is called " layout " , and Haskell uses it to avoid making you put in statement terminators and braces all the time .
( The then and else phrases have to be indented for this reason : if they started in the same column , they'd be separate statements , which is wrong . )
( Note : Do not indent with tabs if you 're using layout .
It technically still works if your tabs are 8 spaces , but it 's a bad idea .
Also , do n't use proportional fonts -- which apparently some people do , even when programming ! )
Simple types
So far , not a single type declaration has been mentioned .
That 's because Haskell does type inference .
You generally do n't have to declare types unless you want to .
If you do want to declare types , you use :: to do it .
Prelude > 5 :: Int 5 Prelude > 5 :: Double 5.0
Types ( and type classes , discussed later ) always start with upper - case letters in Haskell .
Variables always start with lower - case letters .
This is a rule of the language , not a naming convention .
You can also ask ghci what type it has chosen for something .
This is useful because you do n't generally have to declare your types .
Prelude > :t True True :: Bool Prelude > :t ' X ' ' X ' :: Char Prelude > :t " Hello , Haskell " " Hello , Haskell " :: [ Char ]
( In case you noticed , [ Char ] is another way of saying String .
See the section on lists later . )
Things get more interesting for numbers .
Prelude > :t 42 42 :: ( Num t ) => t Prelude > :t 42.0 42.0 :: ( Fractional t ) => t Prelude > :t gcd 15 20 gcd 15 20 :: ( Integral t ) => t
These types use " type classes . "
They mean :
42 can be used as any numeric type .
( This is why I was able to declare 5 as either an Int or a Double earlier . )
can be used as any numeric type .
( This is why I was able to declare as either an or a earlier . ) 42.0 can be any fractional type , but not an integral type .
can be any fractional type , but not an integral type .
gcd 15 20 ( which is a function call , incidentally ) can be any integral type , but not a fractional type .
There are five numeric types in the Haskell " prelude " ( the part of the library you get without having to import anything ) :
Int is an integer with at least 30 bits of precision .
is an integer with at least 30 bits of precision .
Integer is an integer with unlimited precision .
is an integer with unlimited precision .
Float is a single precision floating point number .
is a single precision floating point number .
Double is a double precision floating point number .
is a double precision floating point number .
Rational is a fraction type , with no rounding error .
All five are instances of the Num type class .
The first two are instances of Integral , and the last three are instances of Fractional .
Putting it all together ,
Prelude > gcd 42 35 :: Int 7 Prelude > gcd 42 35 :: Double < interactive >: 1:0 : No instance for ( Integral Double )
The final type worth mentioning here is ( ) , pronounced " unit . "
It only has one value , also written as ( ) and pronounced " unit . "
Prelude > ( ) () Prelude > :t ( ) ( ) :: ()
You can think of this as similar to the void keyword in C family languages .
You can return ( ) from an I / O action if you do n't want to return anything .
Structured data
Basic data types can be easily combined in two ways : lists , which go in [ square brackets ] , and tuples , which go in ( parentheses ) .
Lists are used to hold multiple values of the same type .
Prelude > [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ 1,2,3 ] Prelude > [ 1 .. 5 ] [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] Prelude > [ 1 , 3 .. 10 ] [ 1,3,5,7,9 ] Prelude > [ True , False , True ] [ True , False , True ]
Strings are just lists of characters .
Prelude > [ ' H ' , 'e ' , 'l ' , 'l ' , 'o ' ] " Hello "
The : operator appends an item to the beginning of a list .
( It is Haskell 's version of the cons function in the Lisp family of languages . )
Prelude > ' C ' : [ ' H ' , 'e ' , 'l ' , 'l ' , 'o ' ] " CHello "
Tuples hold a fixed number of values , which can have different types .
Prelude > ( 1 , True ) ( 1 , True ) Prelude > zip [ 1 .. 5 ] [ ' a ' .. 'e ' ] [ ( 1 , 'a ' ) , ( 2 , 'b ' ) , ( 3 , 'c ' ) , ( 4 , 'd ' ) , ( 5, 'e ' ) ]
The last example used zip , a library function that turns two lists into a list of tuples .
The types are probably what you 'd expect .
Prelude > :t [ ' a ' .. 'c ' ] [ ' a ' .. ' c ' ] :: [ Char ] Prelude > :t [ ( 'x ' , True ) , ( 'y ' , False ) ] [ ( 'x ' , True ) , ( 'y ' , False ) ] :: [ ( Char , Bool ) ]
Lists are used a lot in Haskell .
There are several functions that do nice things with them .
Prelude > [ 1 .. 5 ] [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] Prelude > map (+ 2 ) [ 1 .. 5 ] [ 3,4,5,6,7 ] Prelude > filter (> 2 ) [ 1 .. 5 ] [ 3,4,5 ]
There are two nice functions on ordered pairs ( tuples of two elements ) :
Prelude > fst ( 1 , 2 ) 1 Prelude > snd ( 1 , 2 ) 2 Prelude > map fst [ ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 5 , 6 ) ] [ 1,3,5 ]
Also see how to work on lists
We wrote a definition of an IO action earlier , called main :
main = do putStrLn " What is 2 + 2 ? " x <- readLn if x == 4 then putStrLn " You 're right ! " else putStrLn " You 're wrong ! "
Now , let 's supplement it by actually writing a function definition and call it factorial .
I 'm also adding a module header , which is good form .
module Main where factorial n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial ( n - 1 ) main = do putStrLn " What is 5 ! ? " x <- readLn if x == factorial 5 then putStrLn " You 're right ! " else putStrLn " You 're wrong ! "
Build again with ghc -- make Test.hs .
And ,
$ ./Test What is 5 ! ?
120 You 're right !
There 's a function .
Just like the built - in functions , it can be called as factorial 5 without needing parentheses .
Now ask ghci for the type .
$ ghci Test.hs << GHCi banner >>
Ok , modules loaded : Main .
Prelude Main > :t factorial factorial :: ( Num a ) => a -> a
Function types are written with the argument type , then -> , then the result type .
( This also has the type class Num . )
Factorial can be simplified by writing it with case analysis .
factorial 0 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial ( n - 1 )
Convenient syntax
A couple extra pieces of syntax are helpful .
secsToWeeks secs = let perMinute = 60 perHour = 60 * perMinute perDay = 24 * perHour perWeek = 7 * perDay in secs / perWeek
The let expression defines temporary names .
( This is using layout again .
You could use {braces} , and separate the names with semicolons , if you prefer . )
classify age = case age of 0 -> " newborn " 1 -> " infant " 2 -> " toddler " _ -> " senior citizen "
The case expression does a multi-way branch .
The special label _ means " anything else " .
Using libraries
Everything used so far in this tutorial is part of the Prelude , which is the set of Haskell functions that are always there in any program .
The best road from here to becoming a very productive Haskell programmer ( aside from practice ! ) is becoming familiar with other libraries that do the things you need .
Documentation on the standard libraries is at http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/.
There are modules there with :
module Main where import qualified Data .
Map as M errorsPerLine = M . fromList [ ( " Chris " , 472 ) , ( " Don " , 100 ) , ( " Simon " , - 5 ) ] main = do putStrLn " Who are you ? " name <- getLine case M . lookup name errorsPerLine of Nothing -> putStrLn
" I do n't know you " Just n -> do putStr " Errors per line : " print n
The import says to use code from Data .
Map and that it will be prefixed by M .
( That 's necessary because some of the functions have the same names as functions from the prelude .
Most libraries do n't need the as part . )
If you want something that 's not in the standard library , try looking at http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html or this wiki's applications and libraries page .
This is a collection of many different libraries written by a lot of people for Haskell .
Once you 've got a library , extract it and switch into that directory and do this :
runhaskell Setup configure runhaskell Setup build runhaskell Setup install
On a UNIX system , you may need to be root for that last part .

and we can skin a buck ; and we can run a trot line .
and a country boy can survive
country folks can survive .
Hank Williams , Jr./ Country Boy Can Survive
This is a well known lyric from a country song held dear by many a good old boy .
It embodied the philosophy that should the world go to hell in a hand basket country folks can survive .
I believe this to be a dangerous position upon which to pin one 's hopes .
This is n't the US of past generations .
The US was at one time an agrarian society with many families living on the land they farmed .
They knew how to raise grain , livestock , forage for edible foodstuff in the fields and forests .
That America is a fading memory , one that has more reality in memory and the media than in actuality .
America is no longer closely allied to the land .
The farm family has been replaced by the suburban family , or even worse an urban assemblage of various individuals bound together by a variety of forces .
These urban dwellers often live day to day from fast food restaurants or their finer relatives where there are wait staff , chefs , etc .
Should they not buy their food relatively hot at a restaurant they may buy prepackaged food requiring not much more than a quick trip through the friendly microwave oven .
The selection of food , preparation and cooking of same seems to be a dying art .
The popularity of the Food Network which instructs people about food and ways to cook it displays the need for that instruction .
Given that preparing food is a challenge to many , imagine the difficulty presented by growing or finding those foods should there be a significant interruption in the food supply system .
How many people know how to prepare the soil , plant a garden , then harvest and preserve the produce from it ?
How many people even have land available for this endeavor ?
A typical city dweller is totally without options should this become necessary .
The food production and distribution system is a finely tuned instrument .
On one end foods are obtained from either storage or fresh sources .
Then they are quickly distributed through truck , train , plane , or ship to another distribution point .
There the food is broken down into orders by the end purchaser , whether store , restaurant , or wholesaler .
Only then can the consumer enjoy it .
If anything should happen to disrupt any link in that distribution chain , store shelves will quickly become bare .
Many of you are familiar with how quickly the shelves empty when the weatherman forecasts a blizzard or hurricane .
The public apparently feels that milk , eggs , and bread will ward off whatever bad karma is blowing on the wind .
The day following the interruption finds the delivery trucks rolling again , refilling the shelves and no one 's life is inconvenienced to a major degree .
What happens if the interruption lasts more than 2 days ?
What if it lasts 2 weeks ?
What if it lasts 2 months ?
How would you and your significant others fare ?
The US federal government regularly runs public service advertising aimed at encouraging people to have basic supplies of food , water , and other goods on hand for at least 3 days in the case of an emergency situation .
If the water system in your city went down due to contamination or destruction of the infrastructure , what would you be drinking 3 days from now ?
What would be for dinner ?
How would you go about cooking it if the electrical grid was down ?
According to Hank Williams , Jr. , the answer is to live off the land .
Go out and shoot a buck , skin him and have fresh venison .
That works for a couple days .
What if there are 300 million people forced to that solution ?
The deer population is stable in most areas , and it is stable because hunting is only allowed for a short period each year .
Hunting is done by a minority of the population during that regulated period .
What if hunting season was every day , and everyone became a hunter ?
In a few weeks there would be no deer , elk , antelope , bison , any of a number of species considered game .
The land would soon be scoured clean of wildlife , disappearing into the hungry maw of a needy populace .
The same applies to fish and other aquatic foods .
Hunger would drive people to consume whatever they could get , regardless of whether it harmed the species or not .
My interest is not to be an alarmist or doom sayer .
It is to open the eyes of people , help them to realize just how precarious our position is on this planet .
Climate change , whether man made or normally cyclical , always affects people and their ability to feed themselves .
The period we are currently in with large areas open to agriculture may be an aberration in the long view .
It seems the history of Earth is long ice ages interrupted by warm periods such as we are enjoying at present .
There is no reason to surmise that the last ice age was the final one .
The current dependency on fossil fuels has been in effect for just over a century .
The time will come when the supplies are depleted and when that occurs , we need to have answers to enable our civilization to continue .
Following the Arab Oil Embargo during the 70s our federal government created a Department of Energy .
That department was created with the mandate to find solutions to our energy needs .
The Department of Energy produces a nice pamphlet advising us to cut off lights in unoccupied rooms .
As long as there are large sums of money to be made from the discovery , distribution , and sale of a finite commodity ( oil ) there will be pressure to keep the status quo intact .
Last week when a Class 5 hurricane ripped through the Caribbean toward impact on the Yucatan Peninsula and then continental Mexico a regional petroleum supplier in the Midwest ( Speedway ) jacked up prices 30 cents per gallon .
The reason given was in anticipation of interruptions to supply , though no US rigs were forced to suspend operations .
The result was a windfall profit for this supplier .
Why , you ask , did they do this ?
The answer is , of course , because they CAN .
Every time there is a price surge in the petroleum markets there are calls for investigations into price gouging , Congress leaps into the fray , and regularly does absolutely nothing .
It 's all window dressing for the masses , quieting the cries for investigations .
Congress gets to look like it 's doing something , and the petroleum giants keep on contributing to those campaign chests .
During WW II the US was faced with the most severe threat it had ever encountered .
Once we entered the war , it was win or suffer defeat .
To the end of achieving victory America instituted the Manhattan Project which resulted in the development of the atomic bomb .
The Pacific war was ended when the US used that dreadful weapon .
Without trying to color that act as either a moral or immoral decision , the bottom line was a breakthrough came about due to a concentrated effort by the government .
The US needs an energy Manhattan Project .
Funding for energy research of all types needs to become a national priority .
We have had our eggs in one basket for far too long .
On a planet of over 6 billion humans , the stress on the environment is staggering .
Consider if each person consumes just 1.5 lbs of food per day , the planet must provide 9 billion pounds of foodstuff before the first bird eats a seed , before the first animal dines .
While many species consume things we are n't consuming ourselves , we do compete with others for certain foods .
The planet has a finite ability to support its animal populations .
We as humans are able to tweak that output to a degree , but that too has its limits .
The future forcasts more population growth , not less .
That would seem to foretell of an inevitable crash .
If and when that crash occurs under hundreds of billions of pounds of human flesh , a country boy can't survive .
No one can .
Last year , Spamhaus found itself on the wrong end of an $ 11.7 million default judgment awarded to online marketing firm e360 insight after it decided not to fight the case due to its belief that US courts had no jurisdiction over the group because of its location in the UK .
Yesterday , an appeals court overturned the award , sending the case back down to a lower court .
The not - for - profit Spamhaus maintains a blacklist of known spammers and spam operations that is used by ISPs to help filter the spam from legitimate e-mail .
Its anti-spam crusade has drawn the ire of some spammers , including e360 insight owner David Linhardt , who sued Spamhaus in federal court .
Linhardt argued that Spamhaus is a " fanatical , vigilante organization " that operates with " blatant disregard for US law . "
After originally filing a response to the lawsuit , Spamhaus decided that , given its location in the UK , it was beyond the reach of the US court system .
After Judge Charles Kocoras issued the default judgment — which required the anti-spam group to remove e360 insight from its database , post a message saying that Linhardt 's company is not a spamming operation , and pay $ 11.7 million in damages — Spamhaus told Linhardt not to hold his breath waiting for a payment .
A couple of weeks after the judgment , Judge Kocoras issued a proposed order directing ICANN to suspend the spamhaus.org domain as part of a contempt of court ruling .
ICANN quickly weighed in on the matter , saying that it lacked the authority to suspend the Spamhaus domain .
Judge Kocoras later decided against pulling the plug on Spamhaus , ruling that it was not warranted in this case .
Spamhaus said it was n't concerned by the threat of having its domain suspended but ultimately decided it was time to jump back into the legal proceedings and attempt to appeal the decision .
Spamhaus founder Steve Linford told
Ars that the group was looking for a way to " both appeal the ruling and stop further nonsense by the spammer . "
In its opinion ( PDF ) , the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals noted that while Spamhaus intentionally decided against mounting a defense in the case , the court erred by awarding damages and ordering Spamhaus to exonerate e360 insight of spamming .
" The district court failed to undertake an inquiry into the proof of damages and the necessity of injunctive relief and issued an injunction that is overbroad , " wrote the court .
As a result , the default judgment stands , but the lower court will now have to consider the remedy once again .
It 's important to note that since the appeals court declined to overturn the original finding , further court action will be only related to the damages e360 insight should be awarded .
Ironically , Spamhaus ' original decision to not fight the original lawsuit because it believed that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of a US District Court might have been effective — if it had decided to show up in court and make the argument .
When you use psychic seduction on others , your thought will originate within their mind .
It is because your mind and their mind are one Mind .
They will be thinking the thoughts of interest , desire and attraction that you project towards them , and they will think it was their idea .
Therefore sometimes when you find yourself noticing someone and thinking thoughts of interest or attraction for no apparent reason , it may not actually be originally your idea but are thoughts directed from that person to you .
The alpha state is the key state for psychic seduction .
When you are in this state , the effect will be the most pronounced on the mind of the person you are influencing .
Your thoughts will be able to get to them with greater clarity and force .
The alpha state is where your consciousness is in vibrational resonance with the planet ’s frequency , therefore your thoughts will have greater ability to materialize .
Visualization works best in the dreamlike state because it is the link between the physical and mental world .
Being in theta state is more powerful but most people are unable to achieve a conscious theta state .
The theta state is the point just before you fall asleep , the instant before .
You can remember starting to fall asleep as you are in very deep alpha , just approaching theta .
But the actual moment of theta is the moment of amnesia .
You almost never recall the exact point where you fell asleep .
The conscious theta state occurs also when you become conscious in a dream .
You can influence in that state .
The difference between mind power in the two states is that , if you were visualizing your fingers touching someone in an erotic way while you were in an alpha state , the person would feel a slight tingling or warm erotic sensation followed by thoughts of you .
It is subtle but it works .
If you were in a conscious theta state , the person would actually feel the touch as if your actual physical hand was actually touching them in person .
That is how real it would feel for them !
This is the power of altered mind states .
The most important aspect of psychic seduction is mental touching .
Use your mental sense of touch to erotically caress them with your hand .
Even if you loose the entire image of the person , it is alright .
Just concentrate on the area of their body that you are touching .
It is this magic touch that will drive them into a frenzy and eventually draw them to you .
You create in your mind what you are doing to them and what they are experiencing .
Let your fingers and hands explore the different areas of their body .
No other mental ability can compare with touch and there is no way the person can avoid it .
If you only do it for five minutes , you can create effects that will last hours .
The person will begin to feel warmth , tingling , hardness , wetness and a turned on feeling .
The longer you use this magic touch , the excitement that will build up in the person will be hard to resist and they will have a strong attraction towards you , even if they do n’t know who you are .
They ca n’t fight the feelings as it is coming from within them .
Wait , this is just PART of the secrets revealed ...
There is MUCH vital information you are missing ...

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - A Microsoft MSFT.O document format that may be adopted as an international standard this weekend is a ploy to lock in customers , who could lose control over their own data in a worst - case scenario , critics say .
The International Organisation for Standardisation ( ISO ) is balloting its members on the issue in a vote that closes on Sunday .
ISO approval would encourage wider adoption of the Microsoft Open XML format by public - sector organizations .
Opponents of Open XML , which is the default file - saving format in Microsoft Office 2007 , say there is no need for a rival standard to the widely used Open Document Format ( ODF ) that is already an international standard .
They argue its 6,000 pages of code , compared with ODF ’s 860 pages , make it artificially complicated and untranslatable .
Microsoft and others point out that multiple standards are normal in the software and other industries and that competition makes for better products .
Microsoft says its format has higher specifications and is more useful than ODF .
“ More parallel standards makes for better standards .
It ’s good not to decide for a single standard too soon , ” Michael Groezinger , Microsoft ’s chief technology officer in Germany , told Reuters in an interview .
He declined to speculate on the outcome of the ISO vote but welcomed last week ’s decision of the German Institute for Standardisation -- an ISO member -- to give Open XML a conditional “ yes ” vote .
At the heart of the controversy are fears that Open XML is not as open as it claims to be , raising the specter that customers using the word - processing format could become reliant on Microsoft for access to their own documents .
XML , short for Extensible Markup Language , is a standard for describing data in a way that is supposed to allow it to be shared across various systems and applications .
“ The absolute nightmare scenario is that Microsoft says : ‘ Update your licenses or we ’ll turn off your access , ’ ” Georg Greve , president of the Free Software Foundation Europe , told Reuters in an interview .
“ Access to governmental data will completely depend on the existence of Microsoft , ” said Greve , who expects Microsoft to lose the ISO ballot in a close vote .
The Free Software Foundation is a U.S. - based non-profit organisation that campaigns for computer programs that can be freely used , modified and redistributed .
Microsoft ’s Groezinger denies any danger of bodies losing access to their own data .
He said Microsoft had handed over control of Open XML to standards - making body Ecma , which would make it available even in the event of Microsoft ’s demise .
Microsoft has also given guarantees not to pursue any patent claims against parties using , selling or distributing Open XML , although some have questioned whether those guarantees are sufficiently binding or comprehensive .
It has also collaborated with Novell NOVL.O to develop a tool to translate Open XML documents into ODF and vice versa .
But critics say the tool cannot provide a complete translation due to the higher complexity of the Microsoft format .
Open XML is unnecessarily bloated , partly because it packs in unrelated features that lead users to other Microsoft applications , FSF ’s Greve says .
“ This is a classic vendor lock - in strategy , ” he told Reuters .
“ It ’s not that new , it ’s not that ingenious but it ’s quite effective . ”
Given Microsoft ’s leading market position , Open XML will become a de facto standard regardless of the ISO decision .
“ The two standards may converge in the longer term , but all organizations should plan on them coexisting for at least the medium term , ” research group Gartner said in a recent report .
“ The problems associated with the need to translate between formats will continue and will diminish the value of XML . ”
Amazon has been highly - regarded in the developer circles over the past year with solutions that take advantage of Amazon 's scale and pass the savings down to the developer .
S3 and EC2 ( like S3 but for scalable servers ) have been widely adopted by coders for utter reliability , cost and not having to deal with the dirty work - maintaining servers and facing the issue of scaling when growth is vital .
Yesterday Amazon released a new service for developers to bounce off the walls with - Flexible Payment Services .
This is a godsend for thousands including solo developers trying to sell a simple app they 've made , people setting up online stores of their own , and the list goes on .
Up until now many companies had to work directly with VeriSign to process online payments or reluctantly deal with PayPal , which usually brings up horror stories of eBay transactions gone awry .
Above all , I think FPS is going to be widely adopted for its rock - solid micro-payments support .
More and more start - ups and online companies are offering small services to their users which cost almost nothing .
Unfortunately , getting the money for these small services has proved to be a big problem previously , with high credit card transaction and processing rates .
You have probably dealt with micro-payments many times before - iTunes Store songs , those 1 Facebook gifts and the like , although most people consider micro-payments as even cheaper items , within the cents range .
FPS can run a transaction as low as 1 cent .
As an example of something someone could build with FPS utilizing micro-payments support , I have been thinking about a simple system enabling blog readers to use an opt - in subscription / donate model ; readers would help support a blog with small donations or micro-payments .
Ideally , sending a micro-payment with Amazon FPS would be an easy , one - click process , encouraging users to donate whenever they read an article they enjoyed , et cetera .
The system could even be integrated into one 's comment system - " Hey , I really enjoyed your tutorial on XYZ , 1 is attached " .
Barriers of entry will be annihilated .
More people will be encouraged to pursue that idea they 've left on the back burner because they were unsure how to go about collecting payments .
PayPal should be worried .
As for another issue , I can say that people trust Amazon more than PayPal .
If you ran a simple random sample and gave those 5,000 people a word association test , I bet that a good percentage of people would pair PayPal with scam or fraud .
Do n't get me wrong , I have been using PayPal for years without any issue ; people just have a belief that PayPal is n't good with all of the " beware PayPal " type stories floating around .
However , you can't directly compare PayPal and Amazon FPS .
PayPal is a complete payment management / transfer service , where as FPS is more of a tool to build something to handle similar needs , albeit in a specific situation .
Although there will no doubt be someone trying to build a direct PayPal competitor based on FPS .
Here 's the main advantage of using FPS for your next store , service or web app - millions more people already have Amazon accounts than PayPal or Google Checkout accounts , making it tremendously easy for them to use your service .
They do n't have to make another account to pay for something .
Technically Speaking
A token is a unique , secure handle to the Payment Instruction .
A successful payment transaction requires three compatible tokens , one each for the sender , the recipient and the caller .
Amazon Flexible Payment Services is a boon for several reasons : no startup costs , monthly fees or minimums to get started and it 's Amazon - backed .
As such , they have a helpful Resource Center with helpful code libraries ( C# , Ruby , PHP and Java currently ) and sample applications ( Ruby , PHP and Java currently ) .
Security - wise , FPS is just as secure as S3 and other services that might be used in almost mission - critical situations ( doubtful that anyone would use S3 for anything mission - critical , it does n't have a Service Level Agreement ) .
With each payment transaction , you must get a short - lived security token from Amazon to allay the possibility of someone maliciously capturing the transaction and having their way .
Each application built on FPS is recommended to use ( their sample PHP application uses it ) an X.509 security certificate , which is then in turn used by OpenSSL .
In Short
Amazon 's recently released Flexible Payment Services will provide developers , small companies and large companies alike to handle money transactions with ease while maintaining complete control .
You will see many , many people build things around FPS solely for managing micro-payments .
That code monkey 3 doors down in your dorm can make a site and provide simple tech support for 75 cents a request , while that popular blogger could send out schwag to his readers , only asking for the price of a stamp and envelope .
A start - up could charge a dime for each message sent by non -pro account users within their social network , Pownce could charge 30 cents for each 10 MB that you go over your allotted storage space ; the possibilities are endless .
Would you take advantage of sending micro-payments through Amazon if a tech blog you read daily put up a micro-payments system up in lieu of bulky advertisements ?
What are your thoughts about FPS ?
Update : Snook believes that micro-payments with FPS only work or work best when using Amazon Payments ( which must have a balance in it before sending micro- payments ) instead of just someone 's bank account or credit card .
I think he 's right .
I applied for an FPS account and FYI they ask for things like DL# , bank info , credit card , address and business name .
Also , I have been messing with Amazon 's digital downloads sample micro-payments application .
If you decide to use it as well , be careful if putting it on your public server and placing your AWS keys in SampleApp/usecases /config/developer.ini as it can be publicly readable if you do n't give it the correct file permissions .

As the costs for fixing the state 's troubled corrections system rocket higher , California is headed for a dubious milestone -- for the first time the state will spend more on incarcerating inmates than on educating students in its public universities .
Based on current spending trends , California 's prison budget will overtake spending on the state 's universities in five years .
No other big state in the country spends close to as much on its prisons compared with universities .
But California has all but guaranteed that prisons will eat up an increasingly large share of taxpayer money because of chronic failures in a system that the state is now planning to expand .
Under a new state law , California will spend $ 7.4 billion to build 40,000 new prison beds , and that is over and above the current annual operating budget of more than $ 10 billion .
Interest payments alone on the billions of dollars of bonds that will be sold to finance the new construction will amount to $ 330 million a year by 2011 -- all money that will not be available for higher education or other state priorities .
" California is just off the charts compared with other states in corrections spending , " said Michael Jacobson , director of the Vera Institute of Justice in New York , a leading research organization .
" Budgets are a zero- sum game , essentially .
The money for corrections comes from other places .
The shame of it is that California could have improved crime rates and a better funded higher education system if they ran things better . "
In fact , even some supporters of the recent prison reform legislation , AB900 , say they harbor deep doubts about the corrections department 's ability to improve things , no matter how much is spent .
But they say there is no choice , and that the result is that Californians are going to have to accept throwing billions of dollars more at the problem , while trusting a corrections department that has a history of failure .
" I 'm not defending the damn department , " said Assemblyman Todd Spitzer , R- Orange , the chairman of a state Assembly committee overseeing the state 's prison construction efforts .
" The department is a shambles .
They could n't build their way out of a paper bag .
Everyone has a reason to be skeptical .
Everyone is holding their breath , hoping that this time they 're successful . "
Asked if the prison spending accurately reflected the state 's values and priorities , several politicians insisted it did not , and some suggested it was something of an embarrassment for a state that in other areas , such as environmental programs , likes to think of itself as a pioneer in smart policymaking .
" I 'll tell you what , it 's clearly not a statement of our priorities , " said Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez , D - Los Angeles .
" Our policies are hurting the economy of California .
This is a disservice to our economy . "
Núñez blamed the prison spending on a get - tough - on - crime mentality among politicians that equates more prison spending with safer streets , when that is hardly the case .
" A budget is a statement of priorities , " said Bill Shiebler , president of the University of California Student Association , which has been fighting sharp increases in state university tuition fees for several years .
" I do think our state 's got its priorities wrong .
The governor is burdening people who work the hardest with what are tax increases .
It seems they 're more interested in locking people up than giving people an opportunity in life . "
Michael Genest , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's finance director , said that he , too , was uncomfortable with the state committing such a large sum to prisons , but that mismanagement and failed rehabilitation programs in the past made it unavoidable .
" I do n't think it 's a good thing , " said Genest .
" It 's unfortunate . "
He said that one of the key drivers was the fact that the state pays the guards and other prison employees far more than any other state , a policy choice the state had made in past years .
In addition , he said , the porous border allowed too many lawbreakers from Mexico to enter the state , where they eventually ended up in prison .
But Genest defended the increases in spending as needed to institute better rehabilitation programs , which would eventually save money , although he said it was uncertain when or if they would show results .
" It 's not going to happen overnight , and no one can say how much it 's going to save , " said Genest .
" But it should eventually save money . "
According to the May revisions of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's budget , the state will spend $ 10 billion on prisons in fiscal 2007 - 08 , a 9 percent increase from last year .
Higher education spending will come to $ 12 billion , a nearly 6 percent increase .
Moving forward , the legislative analyst says , spending on higher education probably will grow around 5 percent a year , while prisons spending will grow by at least 9 percent annually .
Steve Boilard , a legislative analyst , said that actual spending on the state university systems is already at about parity with prisons spending .
The budgets , he said , for the University of California , the California State University and the community colleges come to $ 10.5 billion in fiscal 2007 - 2008 .
The rest of the higher education budget includes financial aid for student and other noninstructional programs .
Following the historic growth rates , in fiscal 2012 - 2013 , prisons spending will come to about $ 15.4 billion a year while overall higher education spending will come to $ 15.3 billion .
Some politicians are calling the new construction spending and new rehabilitation programs an investment that eventually will pay off in the form of reduced recidivism .
California has among the highest recidivism rates in the country , with 70 percent of released inmates ending up back in prison within three years .
But even advocates of reform say that payoff will be long in coming .
" We all have a wish that prison spending would take a smaller percentage of our budget , " said Spitzer .
" However , that 's a decade away , in my opinion .
For another decade we 're going to need large infusions of money to deal with this and our off - the - chart recidivism rates . "
California is alone among big states in spending so much on prisons .
Texas , for instance , will spend $ 4.5 billion on higher education in 2007 and $ 2 billion on prisons , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Florida will spend $ 3.9 billion on its universities and $ 2.1 billion on prisons , while New York has budgeted $ 3.5 billion on its universities and $ 2.2 billion on prisons .
According to the conference of legislatures , seven small states , such as Massachusetts , Connecticut and Delaware , spend nearly as much on prisons as higher education , but most states budget two or even three times as much for universities .
The new reform program , AB900 , includes about 40,000 new prison beds , about 8,000 of those for medical and mental health care .
Currently , there are about 173,000 inmates in the state prisons , which is about double the design capacity .
The legislative analyst projects that the population will grow by another 17,000 over the next five years .
Jacobson of the Vera Institute said one of the greatest problems in California is not just that it spends so much on prisons but that it gets such poor results .
New York state , for instance , is enjoying both a declining inmate population and declining crime rates .
" When you think about some of the alternatives for spending that kind of money , there are much better things you can do for public safety that would be a lot more effective , " he said .
WASHINGTON — Lately , the colorful , chaotic snack aisle at the grocery store has gotten even more cramped .
With a deluge of 100 - calorie packs of everything from Cheetos to beef jerky , food manufacturers have provided a seemingly healthier alternative to super - sized bags of snacks .
While portion control may help consumers control their cravings , it will also lighten their wallets .
According to a survey by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , 100 - calorie packs cost , on average , about two - and - a - half times as much per ounce as similar products in larger packages .
A comparison of 30 varieties of 100 - calorie packs found that the premium charged for those snacks ranges from a modest 16 percent to a whopping 279 percent .
“ Hundred - calorie packs are an ingenious way for companies to charge consumers more for less , ” said CSPI Executive Director Michael F. Jacobson .
“ Manufacturers get the best of both worlds — they make more money , and they look like they ’re helping people control their weight .
But consumers could save money by divvying up their regular box of Cheese Nips themselves if they are worried about downing the whole container .
Or better yet , they could skip the junk foods altogether and reach for a piece of fruit . ”
Shoppers may not notice the price differences since most varieties of 100 - calorie packs are priced similarly to a box of cookies or crackers , at about $ 3 per box .
However , when comparing the prices per ounce , the original items are by far the better value .
For example , a box of Keebler Right Bites Chips Deluxe 100 - calorie packs cost $ 2.50 , while a bag of Keebler Chips Deluxe Chocolate Chip Cookies runs $ 3 .
But the regular bag weighs four times as much , making the 100 - calorie packs three - and - a - half times more expensive per ounce .
Similarly , Goldfish 100 - calorie packs are triple the cost per ounce of a regular package , and 100 - calorie packs of Sun Chips are more than twice as expensive per ounce .
While some 100 - calorie packs are new concoctions inspired by traditional snack foods , such as Oreos Thin Crisps , others are simply smaller bags of foods like pretzels , almonds , or graham crackers .
According to the July 7 , 2007 New York Times , sales of 100 - calorie packs reached $ 200 million annually after just three years on the market .
Fancy That Marty Lederman
The Combatant Status Review Tribunal proceedings to determine whether detainees are " enemy combatants " are basically a farce .
Or so it appears from an affidavit filed by an Army officer involved in the proceedings , Lt. Col .
Stephen Abraham , a 26 - year veteran of military intelligence , Army reserve officer , and California lawyer .
Abraham explains that there was virtually no chance of decisionmakers being afforded access to possibly exculpatory information , even after repeated requests .
Moreover , they were pressured to find that detainees are " enemy combatants , " notwithstanding the lack of solid evidence .
" What were purported to be specific statements of fact lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively credible evidence , " Abraham attested .
There 's more .
Read the whole thing .
If most or all of this affidavit is true and representative of the CSRTs as a whole , well , then , it 's entirely understandable why the Administration is so fiercely committed to the argument that the Due Process Clause should not apply at Guantanamo .

Shanghai 's maglev train started commercial service in 2003
The state of Bavaria is to build the high - speed railway line from Munich city centre to its airport , making it Europe 's first commercial track .
Maglev trains use electric - powered magnets that enable them to float above their tracks , allowing for much faster speeds than traditional rail services .
The 1.85 bn -euro ( $ 2.6bn ; £ 1.3 bn ) project had faced financing problems .
However , the Bavarian state government said it had signed an agreement with rail operator Deutsche Bahn and industrial consortium Transrapid that includes the developers of the train - Siemens and ThyssenKrupp .
Technological symbol
Munich is following in Shanghai 's foosteps
The only regular maglev service at present is in China , where the floating train whisks travellers between Shanghai 's airport and the city 's financial district .
The maglev , which has a top speed of more than 500 km/h ( 310 m ph ) , is regarded as a symbol of German technological prowess .
However , the maglev project suffered a set back in September 2006 when a train collided with a parked maintenance vehicle on a test run in northern Germany , killing 23 people .
Japan has said it aims to launch its first maglev rail service by 2025 .
No date was given for the launch of the Munich service .
YouTube Becomes Battleground Between Creationists & Atheists Posted by Pile ( 7609 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Activists ]
Groups of atheists are up in arms due to the result of a fundamentalist Christian group firing off dozens of " copyright infringement claims " against their critics ' videos and YouTube accounts .
The result ?
Google / YouTube suspends first , and asks questions later and terminates a bunch of popular accounts of agnostics , atheists and others .
The only problem is the copyright claims seem to be completely unfounded .

We need as many people as we can get who care about honesty and our rights as Americans to stand up to this dishonest Christian regime designed to silence all critics because their views do n't stand up to scientific and public scrutiny .

How To Increase Web Traffic : 7 Reasons For Low Visitor Counts
Perhaps you ’re hoping to earn a little money from blogging .
You ’ve already picked a web host for your needs , out of a list of cheap web hosting services .
You ’ve got your blog up and running and now you ’re looking for ways to improve your sluggish web traffic which needs a big kick .
This topic has been covered countless of times on the net but I ’d like to approach it from the angle of someone who is learning the process .
So as I sat through filtering and sifting through articles on online marketing , all I can tell you is what worked for me .
Where ’s My Web Traffic ?
Reasons For Low Visitor Counts
There are techniques available that should help you gain traction fairly and honestly , albeit gradually .
Let ’s start by understanding why your traffic may be lousy ( interestingly , “ lousy ” is a relative term as one ’s poor showing may be manna to somebody else , but what I mean is that your traffic is stagnant ) :
You ’re not SEO optimized .
Your site is too slow .
You do n’t have enough quality links pointing to you .
You ’re not doing enough marketing nor are you making yourself known to your target audience .
You ’re not making your site available nor readable to search engine crawlers .
You are a victim of Google Panda ( the latest Google search algorithm update that evaluates site quality ) .
Your site or pages have incurred search engine penalties .
One or more of these issues may have affected your site , particularly if you ’re a new publisher .
Perhaps your site could use a bit more work .
Or , it ’s possible that you may have tripped Google and / or Bing guidelines .
I ’ve actually learned a few things from my own experiences and from the recommendations of experts and gurus of this well worn subject .
Allow me to elaborate on these points :
You ’re not SEO optimized .
Apply SEO techniques to your site .
You need to find the right keywords and add them to your HTML TITLE , META Keywords , META Description and Alt Tags .
You may want to use SEO tools like a keyword selector tool to help you with keyword analysis , but take care that you do n’t abuse the use of keywords .
Your site is too slow .
Users may turn away from your site if it takes too long to load , so improve its performance by watching where you put the javascript web service widgets you may have on your site or blog .
They take some time to render so place them at a point in your page where they can be rendered after everything else as much as possible .
Always add height and width parameters to images you use in your posts so that the browser can lay out the page without waiting for the image .
Also reduce the images ’ clarity to 40 % or less to make their footprint smaller , which you can do with an image editor .
And to see how awesome a job you ’ve done with page optimization , run your pages through a Web Page Optimizer and see how you stack up !
You do n’t have enough quality links pointing to you .
Quality links are desirable because these are supposedly what the search engines are using to “ rank ” your site .
Link directories are pretty passe nowadays , so pursue a natural link building process .
Perhaps you can drop your online calling card at somebody else ’s site by leaving them insightful and useful comments and pointers to your homepage .
In the beginning , I tried getting my site into free directories .
I even explored BlogExplosion and BlogMad as traffic generating ( or traffic trading ) sites but all these methods are now obsolete .
The best way to build links is to build a reputation first .
By networking naturally with others , you ’ll most likely receive solid , high quality links without having to be too persuasive .
You ’re not doing enough marketing nor are you making yourself known to your target audience .
Did anyone tell you that you need to write from 3 to 5 blog posts a week of good , substantive content ?
Well , they ’re not kidding ( and I initially thought they were ) !
And if you ’re doing news , you need to up that number due to time sensitivity .
Then you need to make your posts visible to social bookmarking or social networking communities like Twitter , Facebook and Google + .
Add social networking icons to your site to make it easy for readers to share your content with others .
Your site has technical problems .
The bots and spiders can choke on your site if it has HTML errors .
Use an HTML Validator religiously if you can .
Also , make your content available through feeds , but make sure that you are careful about syndication .
Be very careful as the web has evolved to frown upon reckless syndication techniques .
Too much content duplication or the wrong type of syndication can actually get your site in trouble with the main search engines .
Your pages are nowhere to be found but are indexed .
Your pages can rank poorly because of low quality content .
These days , Google has raised its standards for detecting which sites should be deserving of traffic .
Make sure you provide unique , useful and up to date content that will attract users and readers .
Google measures user engagement and looks upon the user metrics behind its SERPs ( search engine results ) to figure out which sites to present to users .
Your site may have incurred search engine penalties .
If you ’ve practiced black hat or poor SEO strategies , your site ( or its pages ) may have triggered penalties .
Correct your missteps and either file for a reconsideration request with the search engine that hit you with bad marks , or you can just wait for the penalties to expire ( which they do over time ) .
If you continue to break any guidelines , do n’t expect to see improvements in traffic .

Way back in 1997 , James Daly wrote an article titled " 101 Ways to Save Apple " , published in Wired Magazine ( there are actually a whole 101 points ) .
If you needed confirmation of the crazy turnaround the company has made since the Return of Steve one year later , this is it .
Some of the advice is laughable , ten years on , but it shows us what a pickle Apple had got itself into back in its dark days .
For instance .
1. Admit it .
You 're out of the hardware game .
Outsource your hardware production , or scrap it entirely , to compete more directly with Microsoft without the liability of manufacturing boxes .
Otherwise , it seems to be an oddly prescient article .
It 's almost as if Apple used it as a check list for recovery :
34 . Port the OS to the Intel platform 12 .
Build a fire under your ad agency .
People do n't need warm , fuzzy infomercials about the Mac family .
And who cares what 's on Todd Rundgren 's PowerBook ?
14 .
Do something creative with the design of the box and separate yourselves from the pack .
The original Macs stood out because of their innovative look .
62 . Build a computer that does n't crash .
( Ouch ! ) 83 .
Develop proprietary programs that run only on Macs .
Crow about them .
Spooky , no ?

This article is one in a series on Medications for Pain .
What are your choices ?
How do various medications work ?
What are the pros and cons ?
How about side effects ?
Antidepressants are medications originally used to treat depression or anxiety , and which are also good for pain .
Within this class , there are :
Tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , which include Amitriptyline ( Elavil ) and Nortriptyline .
, which include Amitriptyline ( Elavil ) and Nortriptyline .
SNRIs ( Serotonin - Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors ) , which include Cymbalta , Effexor ( specifically at higher doses ) , and Savella .
( Serotonin - Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors ) , which include Cymbalta , Effexor ( specifically at higher doses ) , and Savella .
SSRIs ( Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ) , which include Zoloft , Prozac , Lexapro , etc .
It ’s important to know that antidepressants work for pain even if you ’re not depressed or anxious .
They have an independent pain - reducing effect .
So if your physician recommends an antidepressant , that does n’t mean that your pain is all in your head , or that you ’re just anxious or depressed .
That being said , anxiety and depression often go along with chronic pain , unfortunately .
So if that ’s true for you , a good thing about these medications is that they also help depression , anxiety and PTSD ( Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ; PTSD can occur if there was a traumatic cause to your pain , such as a car or work accident ) .
As well , because sedation is a common side effect of someÂ antidepressants , they can help the sleep disturbance that accompanies pain .
Effect of Antidepressants :
All antidepressants work to change neurotransmitters in the brain .
Neurotransmitters are those chemicals by which nerves communicate with one another .
TCAs and SNRIs increase both serotonin and norepinephrine , while SSRIs only increase serotonin .
TCAs also affect many other chemical systems , so can cause many other side effects such as dry mouth , constipation , sedation , and cardiac and blood pressure effects .
It seems that the combination of serotonin and norepinephrine effect is what ’s crucial in decreasing pain .
Medical Studies :
TCAs : Out of 126 studies of TCAs for pain , 95 % of the studies showed that TCAs were effective for reducing pain .
: Out of 126 studies of TCAs for pain , 95 % of the studies showed that TCAs were effective for reducing pain .
SNRIs : Out of 10 studies , 100 % showed that SNRIs were effective .
: Out of 10 studies , 100 % showed that SNRIs were effective .
SSRIs : Of 39 studies , 33 % showed that SSRIs were effective .
So again , this demonstrates that the medications which affect both serotonin and norepinephrine work best at helping with pain .
Uses of Antidepressants :
Let ’s look at some examples of these medications for specific pain disorders .
Cymbalta is FDA - approved to treat the pain that can accompany diabetes , called Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy .
Savella is approved for Fibromyalgia .
Paxil is helpful for chronic daily headache and migraines .
We do know that SSRIs are generally not helpful for neuropathic ( nerve ) pain .
Common Side Effects :
Almost 2 - 1/2 years have passed since the Moon plunged completely into the Earth 's shadow .
But if you live in Europe , Africa , or the eastern half of North America , but sure to put a big circle on your calendar for Saturday , March 3 .
Top 10 Eclipse Facts
Unlike an eclipse of the Sun which often requires a long journey to the path of totality , those of the Moon can be observed from one 's own backyard .
The passage of the Moon through the Earth 's shadow is equally visible from all places within the hemisphere where the Moon is above the local horizon .
Moreover , coming as it does early on a Saturday evening , this eclipse should arouse wide interest among tens of millions of people in the eastern parts of the United States and Canada who can see it during normal waking hours .
Astronomy clubs might take this opportunity to alert schools and the mainstream media about their eclipse activities and amateur astronomy in general .
Why not consider throwing a neighborhood eclipse party ?

The timing
The beginning and ending of a lunar eclipse happens simultaneously for every viewer , unlike an eclipse of the Sun .
Hence the simple schedule below holds for all places from where the event is visible ( in the Western United States , the Moon wo n't rise until the event is largely over ) :
Time Zone : GMT AST EST CST MST Moon enters penumbra 20:18 ---- ---- ---- ----
Moon enters umbra 21:30 ---- ---- ---- ---- Totality begins 22:44 6:44 p.m. 5:44 p.m. ---- ---- Mid-totality 23:21 7:21 p.m. 6:21 p.m. ---- ---- Totality ends 23:58 7:58 p.m. 6:58 p.m. 5:58 p.m. ----
Moon leaves umbra 01:11 * 9:11 p.m. 8:11 p.m. 7:11 p.m. 6:11 p.m.
Moon leaves penumbra 02:24 * 10:24 p.m. 9:24 p.m. 8:24 p.m. 7:24 p.m .
* Denotes calendar date is March 4
Europe and Africa are in the best position ; the eclipse will happen during the late - night hours of March 3 - 4 , with the Moon high in the sky .
From Newfoundland and Labrador will see the Moon rise prior to its entrance into the umbra ( 6:00 p.m. Newfoundland Time ) .
For the rest of North America , the eclipse will already in progress when the Moon rises .
Unfortunately , for those living in the western United States and Canada , the eclipse will have pretty much ended by the time the Moon rises .
As a consolation , however , the next total eclipse later this year ( on Aug. 27 ) will favor these locations .
For many of us a total eclipse of the Moon can be enjoyed purely as a spectacle , a means of appreciating nature in an unfamiliar guise .
But many kinds of careful observations can have scientific interest .
Even with the unaided eye a lunar eclipse is pleasing to watch , but binoculars will certainly improve the view .
For visual observations , a small telescope is recommended .
You should use your lowest - power eyepiece .
The total phase
This week we will concentrate solely on viewing the Moon during the total phase of the eclipse .
During the 74 minutes that the Moon is completely immersed in the Earth 's dark umbral shadow , the big question will be how it will appear in the sky .
Some eclipses are such a dark blackish - gray that the Moon nearly vanishes from view .
At other eclipses it may seem to glow like a bright orange ember .
The reason that the Moon can be seen at all during totality is that sunlight is scattered and refracted around the edge of the Earth by our atmosphere .
If an astronaut were standing on the Moon 's surface during totality , the Sun would be hidden behind a dark Earth , appearing roughly four - times larger than the Sun and rimmed by a brilliant reddish ring of all the world 's sunrises and sunsets .
How bright this ring around the Earth appears is dependent on global weather conditions and the amount of dust suspended in the air .
A clear atmosphere on Earth means a bright lunar eclipse .
But if a major volcanic eruption has recently injected particles into the stratosphere , the eclipse will likely be very dark .
No such eruptions have happened in recent years , so the betting is that the Moon will appear fairly bright .
The Moon will track through the northern part of the Earth 's shadow .
The Moon 's orientation as seen from eastern Canada and the U.S. , means that its left portion should appear brightest , as that that will be the part of the Moon nearest to the shadow 's edge .
There may be a gradation in hue between the parts of the disk nearest and farthest from the shadow center .
A careful description of the colors seen on the eclipsed Moon and their changes is valuable .
The hues depend on the optical equipment used , usually appearing more vivid with the naked eye than in telescopes .
The French astronomer , Andre Danjon introduced the following five - point scale of lunar luminosity ( " L " ) to classify eclipses :
L = 0 : Very dark eclipse , Moon almost invisible , especially in mid-totality .
Very dark eclipse , Moon almost invisible , especially in mid-totality .
L = 1 : Dark eclipse , gray or brownish coloration , details distinguishable only with difficulty .
Dark eclipse , gray or brownish coloration , details distinguishable only with difficulty .
L = 2 : Deep red or rust - colored eclipse , with a very dark central part in the shadow , and outer edge of the umbra relatively bright .
Deep red or rust - colored eclipse , with a very dark central part in the shadow , and outer edge of the umbra relatively bright .
L = 3 : Brick red eclipse , usually with a bright or yellow rim to the shadow .
Brick red eclipse , usually with a bright or yellow rim to the shadow .
L = 4 : Very bright copper-red or orange eclipse , with a bluish very bright shadow rim .
Examine the Moon at mid-totality and also near the beginning and end of totality to get an impression of both the inner and outer umbra .
In noting an L observation , state the time and optical means used .
Impressive darkness
At mid-totality , the darkness of the sky is impressive .
Faint stars appear , and the surrounding landscape takes on a somber hue .
As totality ends , the eastern edge of the Moon begins to emerge from the umbra , and the sequence of events repeats in reverse order until the spectacle is over .
Another procedure is to estimate the stellar magnitude of the Moon during totality .
When it 's faintest , at mid-totality , the Moon may be similar in brightness to naked - eye planets or prominent stars .
To see the Moon and stars as comparable disks , some nearsighted observers need only remove their glasses .
Another technique is to view both the eclipsed Moon and comparison stars simultaneously through binoculars held backwards , so that the large objective lenses are nearest the eyes .
I would like to invite readers to e-mail me with their observations concerning the color and brightness of the eclipse .
Send me your L-estimate ( be sure to give your location , as well as note the time you made your observation , and what instrument , if any , you used ) .
Also try to make an estimation of the brightness of the Moon compared with bright stars and planets .
Editor 's Note : On Friday , March 2 , Joe Rao's weekly Night Sky column will go into greater details on the special circumstances of trying to view a lunar eclipse at moonrise .

Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York 's Hayden Planetarium .
He writes about astronomy for The New York Times and other publications , and he is also an on -camera meteorologist for News 12 Westchester , New York .
“ I know what it ’s like to be where they are — all of them , from Biden to Clinton , ” Mr. Dean said , pushing his fork through a platter of Caesar salad .
“ Because I ’ve been in all of their positions : bottom , middle and top . ”
A conversation today with Mr. Dean is a study in discipline compared with his offhand remarks that were prone to generate headlines four years ago .
He does not disagree with the assessment , saying he is “ unlike the old me . ”
Why such caution ?
“ You live and you learn , right ? ” he replies .
So a string of questions are answered with a fresh , yet telling , caution :
Should Al Gore get into the race ?
“ I ’ve never discussed that with him , and I do n’t plan to .
My bailiwick is to stay out of that stuff . ” ( Mr. Gore , of course , endorsed Mr. Dean four years ago . )
After 26 seconds of silence , he changes the subject and asks his lunch guests , “ Coffee , strawberry shortcake , anybody ? ”
If Democrats want the best nominee possible , why not weigh in ?
“ What I tell Democrats is do not vote with your head , vote with your heart . ”
Did that happen four years ago ?
“ I ’m not going to get into that — at all ! ”
At this point in the race , how do the candidates compare with those 2004 ?
“ They ’re starting to look presidential , which is how you win . ”
Pausing for a moment , he laughed .
“ I ’m not sure I ever looked presidential , ” he said .
And the campaign ?
“ It ’s not as hard - nosed as a race as it was four years ago .
The candidates are much more polite to each other . ”
While his advisers are in frequent contact with aides to the eight Democratic campaigns , Mr. Dean has spent little one - on - one time with candidates , with the exception of courtesy calls most of them paid to him when the race began .
Since then , Mr. Dean has largely watched from afar , overseeing a streamlining of the party ’s voter database and other technological upgrades at the committee .
Sagittarians are 38 % more likely to break a leg than people of other star signs -- and Leos are 15 % more likely to suffer from internal bleeding .

Leos , Sagittarians :
There ’s no need to worry .

They ’re illustrating a point -- that a scientific approach used in many human studies often leads to findings that are flat - out wrong .
Such studies make headlines every day , and often , as the public knows too well , they contradict each other .
One week we may hear that pets are good for your health , the next week that they are n’t .
One month , cellphone use causes brain cancer ; the next month , it does n’t .

“ It ’s the cure of the week or the killer of the week , the danger of the week , ” says Dr. Barry Kramer , associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md . It ’s like treating people to an endless regimen of whiplash , he says .
Take the case of just one item : coffee .
Drinking two or three cups per day can triple the risk of pancreatic cancer , according to a 1981 study .
Not so , concluded a larger follow - up study published in 2001 .
Coffee reduces the risk of colorectal cancer , found a 1998 study .
Not so , according to one published later , in 2005 .
“ I ’ve seen so many contradictory studies with coffee that I ’ve come to ignore them all , ” says Donald Berry , chair of the department of biostatistics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .

“ What about the man on the street ? ” asks Stan Young , a statistician at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences in Research Triangle Park , N.C. “ He reads about coffee causing and not causing cancer -- so many contradictory findings he begins to think , ‘ I do n’t trust anything these scientists are saying . ’ ”
These critics say the reason this keeps happening is simple :
Far too many of these epidemiological studies -- in which the habits and other factors of large populations of people are tracked , sometimes for years -- are wrong and should be ignored .
In fact , some of these critics say , more than half of all epidemiological studies are incorrect .
The studies can be influential .
Often , in response to them , members of the public will go out and dose themselves with this vitamin or that foodstuff .

And the studies also influence medical practice -- doctors , the critics note , encouraged women to take hormones after menopause long before their effects were tested in randomized clinical trials , the gold standard of medical research .
Some of epidemiology ’s critics are calling for stricter standards before such studies get reported in medical journals or in the popular press .
Young , one of the foremost critics , argues that epidemiological studies are so often wrong that they are coming close to being worthless .
“ We spend a lot of money and we could make claims just as valid as a random number generator , ” he says .
Epidemiology ’s defenders say such criticisms are hugely overblown .

They are “ quite simplistic and exaggerated , ” says Dr. Meir Stampfer , a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School .
What ’s more , some things simply cannot be tested in randomized clinical trials .
In certain cases , to do so would be unethical .
( Care to assign half the people in a trial to smoke cigarettes ? )
In other cases , a trial of adequate size and duration -- say , to test whether coffee drinking raises or lowers the risk of Parkinson ’s disease -- would have to control the habits of huge numbers of people for decades .
That would not only be hugely expensive but also virtually impossible .
Stampfer cites examples of findings of epidemiology that , he says , have stood the test of time : smoking ’s link to lung cancer , to name the most notable .

Watching for clues
In epidemiological studies ( also called observational studies ) , scientists observe what ’s going on -- they do n’t try to change it .
From what they observe , they reach conclusions -- for example , about the risk of developing a certain disease from being exposed to something in the environment , lifestyle or a health intervention .
There are different ways to do this .
Cohort studies follow a healthy group of people ( with different intakes of , say , coffee ) over time and look at who gets a disease .
They ’re considered the strongest type of epidemiological study .
Advertisement
Case - control or retrospective studies examine people with and without a certain disease and compare their prior life -- for how much coffee they drank , for example -- and see if people who got the disease drank more coffee in their past than those who did n’t .
Cross-sectional studies compare people ’s present lifestyle ( how much coffee they drink now ) with their present health status .
Epidemiological studies have several advantages :
They are relatively inexpensive , and they can ethically be done for exposures to factors such as alcohol that are considered harmful , because the people under study chose their exposure themselves .
But epidemiological studies have their minuses too , some of which are very well known .
Suppose a study finds that coffee drinkers are more likely to get a certain disease .
That does n’t mean coffee caused the disease .
Other , perhaps unknown , factors ( called “ confounders ” in the trade ) that are unrelated to the coffee may cause it -- and if coffee drinkers are more likely to do this other thing , coffee may appear , incorrectly , to be the smoking gun .

A much clearer picture of the role of coffee on disease could be found , in theory , via a randomized clinical trial .
One would divide a population into two , put one group on coffee and the other not , then follow both groups for years or decades to see which group got certain diseases and which did n’t .
The problem , however , is that such a study is very expensive and takes a long time , and it can be difficult to control people ’s lives for that length of time .
Despite their shortcomings , epidemiological studies are often taken seriously , so much so that they can change medical practice .
Such was the case after dozens of epidemiological studies , including one large , frequently cited one that came out of Harvard in 1991 , had shown that taking estrogen after menopause reduces the risk of women getting cardiovascular disease .
“ There was such a belief , ” even with the medical community , that hormone replacement became part of standard medical practice , says Dr. Lisa Schwartz , associate professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover , N.H. , even in the face of an increased potential risk of breast cancer .
In fact , some scientists and doctors said it would be unethical to do a randomized clinical trial to check if the hormone effect was real .
Advertisement
But in the hormone epidemiological studies , women choosing to take hormones may well have been healthier in other ways , Kramer says .
And that fact -- that they were healthier -- could explain the lower risk of heart disease , not the hormones .
“ To get hormone therapy , you have to go to a doctor and have to have insurance , ” Kramer says .
“ That means you are in the upper strata of society . ”
Eventually , a randomized clinical trial was conducted , as part of the so - called Women ’s Health Initiative .
Findings published in 2002 not only found no protection to the heart but actually reported some harm .
Epidemiology ’s detractors say they have no trouble finding other cases than hormones where frequently cited and sometimes influential epidemiology studies have later turned out to be wrong or exaggerated .

In 1993 , Harvard University scientists published two cohort studies reporting that vitamin E protected people from coronary heart disease .
One , the Nurses Health Study , followed over 87,000 middle - aged female nurses without heart disease for up to eight years .
It found that the 20 % of nurses with the highest vitamin E intake had a 34 % lower risk of major coronary disease than those with the lowest fifth of intake .
The other study followed almost 40,000 male health professionals without heart disease for four years -- and found a 36 % lower risk of coronary disease in those men taking more than 60 IU of vitamin E per day compared with those consuming less than 7.5 IU .
In the three years after these studies appeared , each was cited by other research papers more than 400 times , according to John Ioannidis , an epidemiologist at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Ioannina , Greece .
Vitamin E therapy for heart patients became widespread -- a 1997 survey published in the American Journal of Cardiology reported that 44 % of U.S. cardiologists reported routine use of antioxidants , primarily vitamin E .
The therapy was finally put to the test in a Canadian randomized clinical trial of about 2,500 women and 7,000 men aged 55 years or older who were at high risk for cardiovascular events .
Advertisement
The findings -- reported in 2000 -- showed that an average daily dose of 400 IU vitamin E from natural sources for about 4 1/2 years had no effect on cardiovascular disease .
Yet , Schwartz says , seven years after that finding , her patients continue to take vitamin E in the belief that it will protect their hearts .
“ I am still taking people off of vitamin E , ” she says of her patients , some of whom have heart disease .

Study of studies

In a provocative 2005 paper , Ioannidis examined the six most frequently cited epidemiological studies published from three major clinical journals between 1990 and 2003 .
He found that four of the six findings were later overturned by clinical trials .
Vitamin E did n’t protect the heart in men or women .
Hormone therapy did n’t protect the heart in women .
Nitric oxide inhalation did n’t help patients with respiratory distress syndrome .
Another finding turned out later to be exaggerated : Taking flavonoids reduces coronary artery disease risk only by 20 % , not by 68 % as originally reported .
The only finding of the six that stood the test of time was a small study that reported that a chemical called all - trans retinoic acid was effective in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia .
Advertisement
The studies that overturned each of these epidemiological findings , Ioannidis says , “ caused major waves of surprise when they first appeared , because everybody had believed the observational studies .
And then the randomized trials found something completely different . ”
To be fair , Ioannidis also tested whether the most frequently cited randomized studies held up .
He found that these had a much better track record .
Only nine of 39 oft - cited ones were later contradicted or turned out to be exaggerated when other randomized studies were done .
True , Ioannidis looked at only six studies .
But Young says he sees the same trend in his own informal counts of epidemiological claims .
“ When , in multiple papers , 15 out of 16 claims do n’t replicate , there is a problem , ” he says .
Belief can be costly , Young adds .
For example , one part of the large , randomized Women ’s Heath Initiative study tested the widely held belief -- based in large part on epidemiological studies -- that a low - fat diet decreases the risk of colorectal cancer , heart disease , or stroke .
Advertisement
The findings suggested that there was no effect .
" $ 415 million later , none of the claims were supported , ” Young says .
Other scientists , while more cautious than epidemiology ’s most outspoken detractors , agree that there are many flawed studies .
When Kramer first saw Ioannidis ’ number , “ I said to myself , ‘ It ca n’t be that bad , ’ ” he says .
“ But I ca n’t prove that it is n’t .
I know there are a lot of bad studies out there . ”
Ioannidis , Kramer says , is voicing what many know to be true .

Method in doubt
Why does this happen ?
Young believes there ’s something fundamentally wrong with the method of observational studies -- something that goes way beyond that thorny little issue of confounding factors .
It ’s about another habit of epidemiology some call data - mining .
Most epidemiological studies , according to Young , do n’t account for the fact that they often check many different things in one study .
“ They think it is fine to ask many questions of the same data set , ” Young says .
And the more things you check , the more likely it becomes that you ’ll find something that ’s statistically significant -- just by chance , luck , nothing more .
Advertisement
It ’s like rolling a pair of dice many times without anyone looking until you get snake eyes and then claiming you ’d only rolled it once .
Often , epidemiological researchers ask dozens , maybe hundreds of questions in the questionnaires they send to the people they study .
They ask so many questions that something , eventually , is bound to come out positive .
That ’s where the Canadian star sign study comes into play , Young says .
It was only because the authors deliberately asked a lot of questions -- to prove a point -- that it was able to come up with significant results for something that could n’t be true .
The study ’s lead author , statistician Peter Austin of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto , says that once he cleaned up his methodology ( by adding a statistical correction for the large number of questions he asked ) the association between Leos and internal bleeding and Sagittarians and leg - breaks disappeared .

On the defensive
Many epidemiologists do not agree with the critics ’ assertion that most epidemiological studies are wrong and that randomized studies are more reliable .
“ Randomized studies often contradict one another , as do observational studies , ” says Harvard ’s Stampfer , who is an author on both the frequently cited vitamin E and hormone replacement studies that Ioannidis says were later refuted .
Instead , Stampfer says , the two types of studies often test different things .
“ It ’s not an issue here that observational studies got it wrong and randomized trials got it right , ” he says , referring to the hormone replacement studies .
“ My view is that [ both ] were right and they were addressing different questions . ”
Advertisement
For one thing , the randomized studies on hormone replacement and vitamin E that Ioannidis cited in his 2005 paper looked at different populations than the observational studies they refuted , says Stampfer , who takes vitamin E himself .
In the hormone replacement case , the observational studies looked at women around the age of menopause .
The randomized trial looked at women who were mostly well past that age .
In fact , Stampfer says , a recent reanalysis of the Women ’s Health initiative data suggested a trend that hormone therapy may be less risky for younger than older women .
The effect was not statistically significant , but , Stampfer says , it ’s further support for the idea that hormones have different effects depending on when women start taking them .
And the vitamin E studies ?
The 1993 observational studies followed people who did n’t have heart disease .
The randomized study looked at people with known heart disease who were on many other medications .
All those meds could easily override the effect of vitamin E , says Dr. Walter Willett , a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health , who was a coauthor on the hormone and the vitamin E epidemiological studies .
Advertisement
And finally , the low - fat trial from the Women ’s Health Initiative .
It ’s not surprising , Willett and Stampfer say , that this gold - standard trial failed to find what epidemiology had -- that low - fat diets ward off heart disease , colorectal cancer and stroke .
The women in these trials did n’t stick to their diets .
“ The compliance with the low - fat diet was definitely far lower than anticipated , ” Willett says , “ and probably far worse than even acknowledged in the papers . ”
Such arguments do not sway epidemiology ’s detractors .
Each time a study does n’t replicate , “ they make a specific argument why the studies are different , ” Young says .
He concedes that epidemiology did uncover the truth about the risks of smoking -- but only because the effects are so strong .
" Even a blind hog occasionally finds an acorn , ” he says .
Advertisement
Yet epidemiologists warn that discarding results because of a correction for multiple testing may risk missing true and important effects -- especially in cases where there ’s a good biological reason suggesting an effect , such as in studies of drugs that have been shown to work in animal experiments .
And setting the bar too high might sometimes be dangerous , says Sander Greenland , a professor of epidemiology and statistics at UCLA .
“ Do you want to screen for medical side - effects with the attitude , ‘ So what if we miss side effects ? ’ ” he asks .
“ That ’s deadly .
That ’s ridiculous ! ”
The debate is unlikely to be resolved any time soon .
“ If you put five epidemiologists and five statisticians in a room and have this debate , ” Young says , “ and try to get each one to convince the other side , at the end of the day it will still be five to five . ”

Study guide for research
It can be hard to make sense of the blizzard of studies on vitamins , diet , lifestyle and health risks that roll off the presses almost daily .
It can be an even trickier call to decide whether to change one ’s habits as a result of the latest findings .
Here are a few tips from experts to help you assess the research .
* Replication .
Do n’t change your lifestyle just because of one study .
The next one might show the exact opposite .
You want to see studies replicated .
* Size of the effect .
If a study reports that eating 10 rutabagas daily lowers your risk of ingrown toenails by 0.05 % , that might not be a reason to go hog wild on rutabagas .
Advertisement
In the case of epidemiology studies , researchers suggest that you look for at least a doubling or a halving of an effect .
But also keep in mind that the absolute risk is important -- doubling the very rare risk of being struck by lightning , for example , is not very significant .
* Give randomized , controlled trials more weight .
Many experts consider these more reliable than observational studies .
* Statistical significance .
The finding should be statistically significant for you to pay attention to it .
A “ trend , ” although interesting , is n’t enough .
Advertisement
* Size of the study .
Bigger is better .
A study that only looks at 20 people is likely less reliable than one that includes 20,000 people .
* Length of follow - up .
Generally , the longer time a study tracks people , the more reliable the results will be , and the more likely it will be to detect an effect .
* Consistent findings .
The more precise the results within a study , the better .
Take , for example , a study that finds that a treatment extends life 50 days .
If the study ’s 95 % confidence interval ( a statistical measure of precision ) is a tight 45 to 55 days , it should be taken a lot more seriously than if the confidence interval is a loose zero to 100 days .
In the latter case , the actual life extension could easily be zero days .
* Where was it published ?
Some researchers say that top journals are more likely to reject most unreliable studies .
But beware : Such journals also tend to publish “ surprising ” studies that show something for the first time .

So , once again : Wait for other studies that show the same thing .

IF YOU found yourself in a cocktail bar with a Neanderthal man , what would he say ?
A good conversation is one of the great joys of being human , but it is not clear just how far back in the hominid lineage the ability to use language stretches .
The question of when grunts and yelps turned into words and phrases is a tricky one .
One way of trying to answer it is to look in the fossil record for evidence about what modern humanity 's closest relatives could do .
Svante Pääbo , of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , and his colleagues have done just that .
Dr Pääbo is an expert in extracting and interpreting the DNA of fossils .
As he reports in the latest issue of Current Biology , he and his team have worked their magic on a gene called FOXP2 found in Neanderthal remains from northern Spain .
The reason for picking this particular gene is that it is the only one known so far to have a direct connection with speech .
In 1990 , a family with an inherited speech disorder known as verbal dyspraxia drew the attention of genetics researchers .
Those researchers identified a mutation in FOXP2 as the cause of the dyspraxia .
Since then FOXP2 has been the subject of intensive study .
It has been linked to the production of birdsong and the ultrasonic musings of mice .
It is a conservative type , not changing much from species to species .
But it has undergone two changes since humans split from chimpanzees 6 m years ago , and some researchers believe these changes played a crucial role in the development of speech and language .
If these changes are common to modern humans and Neanderthals , they must predate the separation of the line leading to Homo sapiens from the one leading to Homo neanderthalensis .
Dr Pääbo's research suggests precisely that : the FOXP2 genes from modern humans and Neanderthals are essentially the same .
To the extent that the gene enables language , it enables ( or enabled ) it in both species .
There has been much speculation about Neanderthals ' ability to speak .
They were endowed with a hyoid bone , which anchors the tongue and allows a wide variety of movements of the larynx .
Neanderthal skulls also show evidence of a large hypoglossal canal .
This is the route taken by the nerves that supply the tongue .
As such , it is a requisite for the exquisitely complex movements of speech .
Moreover , the inner-ear structure of Homo heidelbergensis , an ancestor of Neanderthals , shows that this species was highly sensitive to the frequencies of sound that are associated with speech .
That Neanderthals also shared with moderns the single known genetic component of speech is another clue that they possessed the necessary apparatus for having a good natter .
But suggestive as that is , the question remains open .
FOXP2 is almost certainly not “ the language gene ” .
Without doubt , it is involved in the control and regulation of the motions of speech , but whether it plays a role in the cognitive processes that must precede talking remains unclear — jokes about engaging brain before putting mouth in gear notwithstanding .
The idea that the forebears of modern humans could talk would scupper the notion that language was the force that created modern human culture — otherwise , why would they not have built civilisations ?
But it would make that chat with a Neanderthal much more interesting .
Over the last half century , researchers have found that mineral surfaces may have played critical roles organizing , or activating , molecules that would become essential ingredients to all life -- such as amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) and nucleic acids ( the essence of DNA ) .
But which of the countless possible combinations of biomolecules and mineral surfaces were key to this evolution ?
This vexing question has stumped scientists for years because of the sheer volume of possibilities .
Now an interdisciplinary team of researchers led by Robert Hazen , of the Carnegie Institution 's Geophysical Laboratory and former president of the Mineralogical Society of America , has developed new protocols and procedures for adapting DNA microarray technology to rapidly identify promising molecule / mineral pairs .
Hazen 's Presidential Address in the November / December issue of American Mineralogist describes this work .
It sets out a first - of - its - kind comprehensive survey into research that has identified processes by which minerals may have prompted the transition from a geochemical world to a biological one almost four billion years ago .
Scientists understand several probable steps in the origin of life , notably how the first organic molecules could have formed .
In fact , prebiotic synthesis processes are now thought to have been so productive that the ancient Earth must have had far more different kinds of molecules than could have been used by early life .
One of the biggest questions in origins research , therefore , is how just the right blend of critical biomolecules was selected , concentrated , and organized from the diverse primordial " soup . "
Previous research by the Carnegie team and others has shown that many molecules , including amino acids , can adhere to mineral surfaces , prompting further organic reactions .
These findings have made surface / molecule interactions the subject of intense study .
Scientists suspect that organic material was likely introduced to Earth from many complementary sources .
Abundant biomolecules form in molecular clouds in deep space , and these extraterrestrial compounds must have rained down on the early Earth .
Other molecular synthesis was driven by lightning and ultraviolet radiation in the atmosphere or volcanic heat and chemical reactions in the deep oceans .
Some of these building blocks of life were attracted to specific mineral surfaces , where they collected , concentrated , and underwent further reactions .
" Some 20 different amino acids form life - essential proteins , " Hazen explained .
" In a quirk of nature , amino acids come in two mirror - image forms , dubbed left and right - handed , or chiral molecules .
Life , it turns out , uses the left - handed varieties almost exclusively .
Non-biological processes , however , do not usually distinguish between left and right variants .
For a transition to occur between the chemical and biological eras , some process had to separate and concentrate the left - and right - handed amino acids .
This step , called chiral selection , is crucial to forming the molecules of life . "
Like amino acids , some minerals have pairs of crystal surfaces that have a mirror relationship to each other , called left and right faces .
Calcite , one such mineral , is common today and was prevalent during the Archean Era when life first emerged .
In 2001 Hazen and colleagues performed the first experiments showing that the left - handed amino acid , aspartic acid , preferentially adhere to left - faced calcite .
That study confirmed previous theoretical suggestions of a plausible process by which the mixed right - and left - handed - amino acids in the primordial soup could be concentrated and selected on a readily available mineral surface .
The challenge since has been to determine which of the countless biomolecules / surface interactions are the most likely candidates to the first steps to life .
advertisement
" Crystal surfaces are complicated , " Hazen continued .
" They have crevices and craters , and are seldom flat .
We need to find which surface types are the best ' docking stations ' for different biomolecules .
However , there are hundreds of mineral surface types and thousands of plausible prebiotic molecules , making literally millions of possible biomolecule / mineral pairs .
It 's an overwhelmingly large number of possibilities . "
DNA microarrays provide a means to address this problem .
Microarrays are produced robotically to spot tens of thousands of microscopic droplets of DNA from as many genes onto a slide , enabling scientists to measure which genes are turned on .
This rapidly developing technology can be used to identify , for example , the genes involved in disease .
The high - throughput has revolutionized biotechnology research .
Hazen , working with Carnegie staff scientist Andrew Steele and his team , has developed modifications of this tool to study molecule / mineral interactions .
The scientists have devised protocols for cleaning mineral surfaces , spotting the surfaces with up to 96 different organic species , washing the surfaces to remove molecules that do n't adhere to a mineral surface , and locating the remaining adsorbed molecules .
To discover " which molecules stick and which do n't , " as Hazen says , the Carnegie scientists are also collaborating with a team at the Smithsonian Institution led by Edward Vicenzi to employ a workhorse of chemistry called Time - of - Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry ( ToF - SIMS ) .
The instrument effectively blasts a sample with ionized particles and fragments the surface - bound molecules and topmost mineral layer .
The mass spectrometer allows the researchers to determine what 's there .
" ToF - SIMS will also allow us to detect the organic molecules that bind most strongly to mineral surfaces , " commented Hazen .
" In many ways , Hazen 's approach cuts to the chase of addressing this problem , " said Patricia Dove , professor of geochemistry at Virginia Tech .
" By adapting the microarray approach from molecular biology , his research group can identify up to one million types of biomolecules very quickly to learn which have the strongest interactions with mineral surfaces .
It does n't stop there though - - another real advance lies in analyzing their experiments by the ToF - SIMS .
This eliminates the need for chemical tags whose own properties could influence the results . "
David Deamer , professor of chemistry and biochemistry at U.C. Santa Cruz , commented that " Bob Hazen is boldly asking a fundamental question related to the origin of life .
We know that organic compounds were present in the early Earth environment , but as dilute solutions of thousands of different species in the global seas .
How were specific kinds of organics selected to assemble into the first forms of life , and by what process were they sufficiently concentrated to initiate a primitive version of metabolism ?
We now know that minerals select specific organic compounds out of solution , and can even distinguish between subtle properties such as chirality , binding a left - handed amino acid in preference to one that is right handed .
These are very significant results that are guiding my own research as well as many other investigators in the field . "

Once Hazen and coworkers have identified molecule / surface pairs of interest with the DNA microarray and ToF - SIMS , an arsenal of other techniques can be used to look at the details of the interactions .
" What 's particularly rewarding about this research is that it's an interdisciplinary effort from different areas of science -- biology , chemistry and geology , " reflected Hazen .
" It marries them to search for an answer to a question that has intrigued humanity since the birth of consciousness : How did we get here ? "
This work was supported by the NSF Geobiology and Low - temperature Geochemistry program of the Division of Earth Sciences , the NASA Astrobiology Institute ( NAI ) , and the Carnegie Institution .
WASHINGTON
Maybe it ’s fitting that a woman who first sashayed into the national consciousness with an equation — “ two for the price of one ” — may have her fate determined by the arithmetic of dynasty .
The town is divided into two camps : those who think that , after 16 years of Hillary pushing herself forward , the public will get worn out and reject her , and those who think that , after 16 years of Hillary pushing herself forward , the public will get worn down and give in to her .
In his new book , “ The Evangelical President , ” Bill Sammon interviewed President Bush and his senior aides about the ’08 election .
Mr. Bush told the author that Hillary Clinton would beat Barack Obama , because she is “ a formidable candidate ” and better known — the better to raise money .
Despite all he has done to help Democrats , W. maintains that Republicans can hold the White House .
But just in case the Clinton dynasty once more succeeds the Bush one , the Texas president has been sending the New York senator messages to “ maintain some political wiggle room in your campaign rhetoric about Iraq , ” as Mr. Sammon puts it .
Tobacco smoking is the act of burning the dried or cured leaves of the tobacco plant and inhaling the smoke for pleasure or ritualistic purposes , for self - medication , or out of habit and to satisfy addiction .
The practice was common among Native Americans throughout North and South America , and was later introduced to the rest of the world via trade following European exploration of the Americas .
Anti-abortion zealots were handed a crushing defeat last year when the voters of conservative South Dakota -- supposedly fertile ground for their brand of wingnuttery -- rejected a draconian abortion ban at the ballot box .
The conservative talking point was that voters defeated the ban because it had no exceptions for rape , incest , or the health of the mother .
A new attempt to resuscitate the ban -- but with the exceptions -- in the SD Senate suffered a humiliating defeat today .
An abortion ban with exceptions for rape , incest and health of the mother was rejected Wednesday morning by legislative committee in Pierre .
The Senate State Affairs Committee just voted 8 to 1 to kill HB1293 without a vote of the full Senate .
Supporters of the bill can still force the bill out of committee with a one - third vote of the full Senate , but even key supporters of last year ’s ban spoke against the measure .
Sen . Brock Greenfield , R - Clark , called abortion “ a scourge on South Dakota , ” and he called HB1293 a “ noble effort . ”
But he also said the bill would not withstand a court challenge .
“ I do not believe there is any chance it will , ” he said .
Greenfield , who also is chairman of South Dakota Right to Life , is not on the committee , but he testified as an opponent to the new ban .
The anti-abortion movement is clearly reeling from the ballot box setback , if the chairman of the SD Right to Life operation is against it .
This could be an opening for groups from both sides of the issue to stop fighting over criminalizing abortion , and start focusing on ways to reduce demand -- poverty programs , sex ed , health care , etc .
The regional Planned Parenthood has taken a step in that direction :
Episode 1 of the highly anticipated 6th season of " 24 " has been leaked onto BitTorrent , even Jack Bauer could n't stop it .
For those unlucky chaps who do n't know , 24 is the wildly popular TV show that has fans the world over dying for each new episode .
The leak is the work of AsiaTeam , a Spanish language group known to regularly upload TV shows and movies to BitTorrent .
Several commenters on mininova are convinced that these are “ the real thing ” and not fakes .
A contact who says she downloaded the torrent just confirmed that it is in fact 100 % real .
From the screenshots ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) posted on mininova , it seems the AsiaTeam guys have not only episode 1 , but the entire Season 6 Premiere DVD that will be released on January 16th .
This DVD contains the the first 4 episodes ( screenshot ) of 24 season 6 , and a preview of episode 5 .
And just to spice things up , here ’s an exclusive :
Even though my colleague at TorrentFreak tells me it is completely normal in the world of BitTorrent for TV shows to be leaked , I am amazed that something like this could happen .
In July 2005 , the pilot episodes of 5 upcoming TV series were leaked onto BitTorrent .
Although many believed that it was ABC themselves who had leaked the episodes to get the hype going , it is unlikely that a mainstream content producer would do such a thing .
Many upcoming episodes of the TV series Prison Break , among others , have been routinely leaked onto the Internet , and in particular , BitTorrent .
We ca n’t link to the torrent for obvious reasons , but it ’s not hard to find .
update : episode 2 , 3 and 4 are out
President Bush plans to ask Congress next month for up to $ 50 billion in additional funding for the war in Iraq , a White House official said yesterday , a move that appears to reflect increasing administration confidence that it can fend off congressional calls for a rapid drawdown of U.S. forces .
The request -- which would come on top of about $ 460 billion in the fiscal 2008 defense budget and $ 147 billion in a pending supplemental bill to fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- is expected to be announced after congressional hearings scheduled for mid-September featuring the two top U.S. officials in Iraq .
Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker will assess the state of the war and the effect of the new strategy the U.S. military has pursued this year .
The request is being prepared now in the belief that Congress will be unlikely to balk so soon after hearing the two officials argue that there are promising developments in Iraq but that they need more time to solidify the progress they have made , a congressional aide said .
Hell in a nutshell :
$ 50,000,000,000 more .
On top of the $ 147,000,000,000 for the Iraq - Afghanistan supplemental .
On top of a defense budget of $ 460,000,000,000 .
Because Bush is confident that the Democrats wo n't stop him !
As I 've previously noted :
Of course , the new National Intelligence Estimate says , in effect , that the Bush strategy in Iraq has failed .
Similarly , nearly two - thirds of the more than a hundred experts surveyed for the Terrorism Index believe the surge has either failed , or even had a negative impact .
The Fund for Peace says Iraq is near a total collapse .
The Observer reported , a couple weeks ago , that fatigue is crippling our army .
But Bush telegraphed this .
He 's already made clear that the war wo n't end while he is playing president .
He loves his war .
It 's his identity .
It makes up for all his life 's failures .
It makes him tougher than the Old Man .
He 's the Commander Guy , a War President , The Decider .
He got to don a codpiece and a flight suit and ride shotgun onto an aircraft carrier .
He gave Tweety the vapors .
Now , he wants $ 50,000,000,000 more .
For a war that is lost .
For a war that continues to accomplish nothing but death and devastation .
Because he 's confident that the Democrats wo n't stop him !
Anyone want to prove him wrong ?

DoD Permanently Discontinues Procurement Of Global Positioning System Selective Availability
The Department of Defense announced today that it intends to stop procuring Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellites with the capability to intentionally degrade the accuracy of civil signals .
This capability , known as Selective Availability ( SA ) , will no longer be present in the next generation of GPS satellites .
Although the United States stopped the intentional degradation of GPS satellite signals by setting SA levels to zero in May 2000 , this action to permanently remove SA eliminates a source of uncertainty in GPS performance that has been of concern to civil GPS users worldwide for some time .
While this action will not materially improve the performance of the system , it does reflect the United States ’ strong commitment to users by reinforcing that this global utility can be counted on to support peaceful civil applications around the globe .
The decision to remove the capability from the next generation GPS satellites was approved by the President after a recommendation from DoD .
The move coincides with the U.S. Air Force ’s solicitation to purchase the next generation of GPS satellites known as GPS III .
GPS is a dual - use , satellite - based system that provides accurate positioning , navigation and timing information to users worldwide .
Originally developed by the Department of Defense as a military system , GPS has become a global utility .
It benefits users around the world in many different applications , including aviation , road , marine and rail navigation , telecommunications , emergency response , resource exploration , mining and construction , financial transactions and many more .

Col .
Don Snider , a longtime professor at West Point , sees a “ trust gap ” between junior and senior officers .
There has always been a gap , to some degree .
What ’s different now is that many of the juniors have more combat experience than the seniors .
They have come to trust their own instincts more than they trust orders .
They look at the hand they ’ve been dealt by their superiors ’ decisions , and they feel let down .
The gap is widening further , Snider told me , because of this war ’s operating tempo , the “ unrelenting pace ” at which soldiers are rotated into Iraq for longer tours — and a greater number of tours — than they signed up for .
Many soldiers , even those who support the war , are wearying of the endless cycle .
The cycle is a result of two decisions .
The first occurred at the start of the war , when the senior officers assented to the decision by Donald Rumsfeld , then the secretary of defense , to send in far fewer troops than they had recommended .
The second took place two years later , well into the insurgency phase of the war , when top officers declared they did n’t need more troops , though most of them knew that in fact they did .
“ Many junior officers , ” Snider said , “ see this op tempo as stemming from the failure of senior officers to speak out . ”
Paul Yingling did not set out to cause a stir .
He grew up in a working - class part of Pittsburgh .
His father owned a bar ; no one in his family went to college .
He joined the Army in 1984 at age 17 , because he was a troubled kid — poor grades and too much drinking and brawling — who wanted to turn his life around , and he did .
He went to Duquesne University , a small Catholic school , on an R.O.T.C. scholarship ; went on active duty ; rose through the ranks ; and , by the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf war , was a lieutenant commanding an artillery battery , directing cannon fire against Saddam Hussein ’s army .
“ When I was in the gulf war , I remember thinking , This is easier than it was at training exercises , ” he told me earlier this month .
He was sent to Bosnia in December 1995 as part of the first peacekeeping operation after the signing of the Dayton accords , which ended the war in Bosnia .
“ This was nothing like training , ” he recalled .
Like most of his fellow soldiers , he was trained almost entirely for conventional combat operations : straightforward clashes , brigades against brigades .
( Even now , about 70 percent of the training at the Captains Career Course is for conventional warfare . )
In Bosnia , there was no clear enemy , no front line and no set definition of victory .
“ I kept wondering why things were n’t as well rehearsed as they ’d been in the gulf war , ” he said .
Upon returning , he spent the next six years pondering that question .
He studied international relations at the University of Chicago ’s graduate school and wrote a master ’s thesis about the circumstances under which outside powers can successfully intervene in civil wars .
( One conclusion : There are n’t many . )
He then taught at West Point , where he also read deeply in Western political theory .
Yingling was deployed to Iraq in July 2003 as an executive officer collecting loose munitions and training Iraq ’s civil - defense corps .
“ The corps deserted or joined the insurgency on first contact , ” he recalled .
“ It was a disaster . ”
In the late fall of 2003 , his first tour of duty over , Yingling was sent to Fort Sill , Okla . , the Army ’s main base for artillery soldiers , and wrote long memos to the local generals , suggesting new approaches to the war in Iraq .
One suggestion was that since artillery rockets were then playing little role , artillery soldiers should become more skilled in training Iraqi soldiers ; that , he thought , would be vital to Iraq ’s future stability .
No one responded to his memos , he says .
He volunteered for another tour of combat and became deputy commander of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment , which was fighting jihadist insurgents in the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar .

The commander of the third regiment , Col. H. R. McMaster , was a historian as well as a decorated soldier .
He figured that Iraq could not build its own institutions , political or military , until its people felt safe .
So he devised his own plan , in which he and his troops cleared the town of insurgents — and at the same time formed alliances and built trust with local sheiks and tribal leaders .
The campaign worked for a while , but only because McMaster flooded the city with soldiers — about 1,000 of them per square kilometer .
Earlier , as Yingling drove around to other towns and villages , he saw that most Iraqis were submitting to whatever gang or militia offered them protection , because United States and coalition forces were n’t anywhere around .
And that was because the coalition had entered the war without enough troops .
Yingling was seeing the consequences of this decision up close in the terrible insecurity of most Iraqis ’ lives .
In this article , I ’ll take a look at the practical economics of trying to make a living writing short fiction in the U.S.
This topic regularly comes up on message boards and at conventions .
People usually speak in generalities ( “ You ca n’t make a living writing stories ! ” “ Can , too ! ” ) or cite specific - but - individual anecdotes without other data or analysis .
I ’m going to take the approach that it is possible to survive on the proceeds from short fiction ; the question then becomes , under what conditions can it be done ?
Let ’s start by looking at the U.S. federal government ’s standards for poverty .
The 2006 US poverty threshold for a single person is $ 9800 , which works out to $ 817 / month .
A person working 40 hours a week at a job that pays $ 6.85 / hour — which some rural school districts in Ohio are paying teachers , so it ’s not just burger wranglers bringing home this kind of paycheck — makes about $ 890 / month after taxes .
As millions of college students know , it ’s entirely possible to survive on $ 800 ( or even less ) each month if you ’re able to split costs with other people and you can approach your financial situation with some savvy creativity .
Let ’s assume , for this scenario , that you are living with a group of other people in a large house .
You are not anybody else ’s dependent for tax or other purposes ( meaning your costs are lowered but nobody ’s there to bail you out if you ca n’t make your share of the rent ) and you likewise do not have any dependents ( not even a goldfish ) .
You are not trying to pay off loans or other debts .
You live in a city and can use a bicycle , public transportation or carpools to get around so that you do n’t have the expense of maintaining a car .
You are willing to shop at thrift stores , get most of your books and CDs from your public library , and you ’re not above dumpster diving if the situation warrants it .
Furthermore , we ’ll assume that you are fundamentally healthy , do not have a drug / alcohol habit , and are not accident prone .
The budget we ’re going to work will not support your blowing $ 60 at the bar every Friday night , nor will it support the kind of health insurance that would actually keep you from going bankrupt should you actually get sick .
Under the above scenario , you could probably rent a room in a shared house in a student neighborhood for about $ 200 a month1 .
Your share of the utilities might come to $ 50 , your food about $ 250 , your transportation costs perhaps $ 45 , plus $ 55 for things like aspirin and shampoo and the occasional treat at the neighborhood coffee house .
This means that each and every month , you need at minimum $ 600 to survive .
At $ 600 per month , you ’d be under the federal poverty level and would qualify for food stamps , but getting food stamps as a freelancer is often an unreliable prospect at best so we ’ll pretend this option does n’t even exist .
But be aware that it could be an option , as might other forms of public assistance depending on where you live .
So , we know what you need to make ; now let ’s focus on how you ’re going to make it .
The SFWA / HWA - designated professional rate for fiction is $ 0.05 a word .
But most markets really do n’t pay that , and you might not have the luxury of shopping a story around much , so let ’s go with $ 0.03 / word .
At three cents a word , you ’d have to sell 20,000 words worth of stories every month at minimum without fail .
Working from the assumption that 30 % of your writing has to be rewritten / scrapped or simply does n’t sell for the required amount ( and this is a very generous assumption ) , that output increases to 28,600 .
But if you think about it as having to produce 954 words a day to make your minimum , it does n’t seem that bad ; most proficient writers can crank out a page an hour , so you ’re looking at 4 hours of butt - in - chair work each day .
By a similar calculation , if you wanted to upgrade your lifestyle and make $ 817 / month , you ’d have to write 1200 sellable words of fiction each day .
Things get much better if you ’re able to write children ’s stories and technical nonfiction .
You can get $ 0.25 / word for children ’s stories from the top markets ; a 1,500 - word story at that rate gets you $ 375 ; sell two of those and you ’ve earned your nut for the month .
Writers with scientific knowledge and good research skills can sell short technical articles for $ 0.50 or $ 0.60 a word ; a 1400 - word article that might take you three solid days to research and write would earn you $ 800 .
Sell one of those a month , and the pressure ’s largely off .
Sell two of those , and you ’re doing better than a 1st - grade teacher ’s aide in Delaware , OH .
You could get a cat !
( If your roommates will let you )
Things get even better if your fiction passes as literature in the eyes of the arts community and you can get yourself a grant every once in a while .
( Finding and landing grants is a specialized skill in itself , but a good first step is to check listings offered by your state and local arts groups ) .
However , things get considerably worse if you think about how long it takes some publishers to read and respond to your work , and that many fiction markets do n’t pay until the work is published .
If you send a sellable story out to market , it might be over a year before you see a check for it , even if it gets accepted by the very first place you send it to .
Having some savings to fall back on becomes very , very important when you think about the dry spells you might encounter .
Once you ’ve sold a stack of stories to decent publications and have started getting a name for yourself , a producer may notice one of your stories and buy the rights to it for film or television .
That ’s like winning the lottery , both in payout and probability .
More realistically , as a “ name ” story writer , you may be able to sell a collection .
Collections are hard to sell to publishers because publishers find them hard to sell to readers , but if you succeed you may get a fairly decent advance of anything from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars .
The advance for a story collection most often wo n’t be as good as what you ’d get if you sold a novel , unless you ’re clever and you ’ve written a bunch of short stories featuring the same characters and have strung them together to make your collection look enough like a novel that publishers and readers will accept it as such .
And that ’s the moral of this writeup : if you want a career as a fiction writer , you need to start writing books , and that means writing novels , Harlan Ellison ’s career notwithstanding .
Of course , you could always try to become a creative writing professor .
If you have the patience to teach and the temperament to deal with academia , a faculty position is a pretty sweet gig if you can find one .
If you have a Master ’s degree , solid literary publication credits and luck , you might be able to find a job at a community college .
If you want to teach at a large university , though , you ’ll need an MFA as well as lit credits and teaching experience .
MFA programs can be tough to get into2a , expensive , and will likely mean you have to move to a new state for school 2b .
Furthermore , they pump out many times more graduates than there are waiting faculty jobs .
But what if you do n’t want to ( or find that you can ’t ) write novels , do n’t want to teach ( or ca n’t do an MFA ) , and you do n’t have savings to fall back on ?
A part - time job that does n’t suck out your soul 3 can help tremendously .
Some part - time jobs at colleges and public libraries can come with health insurance benefits ; competition for these low - paid jobs can therefore be fierce , but they ’re worth looking for and applying to .
Also , check out your local Starbucks ; some stores offer health benefits for part - timers .
Having a job that does n’t devour your energy but which gets you out of your room ( and your own head ) a couple of times a week can be a huge mental health boost .
In short , you can survive as a short fiction writer if you ’re healthy , single4 , hard - working , prolific , and willing to cut a very low economic profile .
A few thousand dollars saved in the bank before you start wo n’t hurt , either .
1 : If you live in an expensive area , $ 200 for a room in a 5 - or 6 - bedroom house may require some very hard searching and willingness to compromise your personal standards when it comes to cleanliness , building integrity , housemate appeal , and neighborhood safety ; in very expensive places , it may be virtually impossible .
There are other alternatives that determined writers have taken , however .
I know of a young male writer who , for about a year , lived in an old van parked behind a friend ’s small house in California and wrote / submitted stories on a laptop connected to the household wireless network .
He showered at the gym at a nearby college and was able to cook his meals in the house .
Eventually he started making enough money that he was able to get a proper apartment .
2a : MFA programs can be particularly hard to get into if you ’ve actually been getting paid for your fiction and have consequently been tainted by genre .
2b : Locals need not apply to many MFA programs .
3 : The soul - sucking jobs are often well - paid but can cause despair that in turn causes chronic illness and writer ’s block ; if you suspect you might have a soul , it ’s best to avoid evil jobs if you can .
4 : Suffering for your art is noble ; making your family suffer for it is bullshit .

It is unclear whether Syria will enforce the rules for the Iraqis already in the country .
United Nations officials believe Syria is likely to continue its practice of not deporting citizens of other Arab countries whose immigration status is illegal .
Syria announced the new rules this summer and said they would take effect on Sept.
1 . But it postponed their implementation and continued to accept refugees until Oct.
1 . Under the old visa rules , Iraqis entered Syria without restriction and were allowed to remain for three months .
Damascus has avoided any announcement about the policy since it took effect , leaving refugees and United Nations officials in a haze of uncertainty .
Under the new rules , Iraqis must apply for visas at the Syrian Embassy in Baghdad .
Only academics , merchants with commercial interests requiring travel to Syria , and taxi and truck drivers qualify for visas .
The immediate effect has been to cut the flood of refugees to a trickle , no more than a hundred people a day , according to the United Nations .
Over the long term , it means that Iraqi refugees who overstay their three - month visas to Syria may have to make the dangerous trip back to Baghdad and apply to return under the new visa requirement , which disqualifies all but a handful .
Syrian officials have said they were responding to a longstanding request from the Iraqi government to close their border , according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity , following government policy .
They said the Iraqi prime minister , Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , told Syrian leaders on a state visit in August that the constant flow of refugees undermined the Iraqi government ’s effort to bring greater security to the country .
Calorie Restriction Boosts Cell Components Recycling
Calorie restriction extends life in most animals which have been studied well on calorie restricted diets .
Calorie restriction is the only consistent way to extend life in lab animals that has been found to date .
Some University of Florida scientists found that rats on low calorie diets might live longer because the calorie restriction causes cells to more rapidly chew up and recycle cellular components such as energy - producing mitochondria .
And a University of Florida study shows just how much the body benefits when it goes green ,  at least if you re a rat : Cutting calories helps rodents live longer by boosting cells  ability to recycle damaged parts so they can maintain efficient energy production .
 Caloric restriction is a way to extend life in animals .
If you give them less food , the stress of this healthy habit actually makes them live longer ,  said Christiaan Leeuwenburgh , Ph.D. , chief of the division of biology of aging in UFs Institute on Aging .
Understanding how the process works at the cellular level in rodents could help scientists develop drugs that mimic the process in humans , Leeuwenburgh added .
Some biogerontologists theorize that aging damaged mitochondria displace healthy mitochondria .
Then those damaged mitochondria spew out free radicals that damage cells .
These University of Florida researchers are speculating that if cells more aggressively chew up damaged mitochondria then those bad mitochondria wo n't take over and squeeze out healthier mitochondria .
Fortunately , younger cells are adept at reducing , recycling and rebuilding .
In this process , damaged mitochondria are quickly swallowed up and degraded .
The broken down pieces are then recycled and used to build new mitochondria .
However , older cells are less adept at this process , so damaged mitochondria tend to accumulate and contribute to aging .
Here is their core finding .
Calorie restriction accelerated autophagy , the recycling of damaged cellular components .
UF scientists studied 22 young and old rats , comparing those allowed to eat freely with those fed a low - calorie , nutritious diet .
The stress of a low - calorie diet was enough to boost cellular cleaning in the hearts of older rats by 120 percent over levels seen in rats that were allowed to eat what they wanted .
The diet had little or no effect on younger rats .
If drugs could be found that enhance autophagy ( the chewing up of damaged cellular components ) then those drugs might slow down the aging process by preventing bad damaged mitochondria from taking over cells and spewing free radicals into cells and into the environment around cells .
 Autophagy is a housekeeping mechanism that keeps cells free of damaged and thereby detrimental mitochondria and other toxic materials while recycling their building blocks  nutrients needed by the cell ,  said Stephanie Wohlgemuth , Ph.D. , a lecturer in UFs department of aging and geriatrics and the studys lead author .
 So if that process is maintained with age  or even increased  that can only be beneficial . 
Gene therapy that could fix mitochondrial DNA might some day deliver an even bigger anti-aging benefit by fixing damaged mitochondria that spew free radicals .
Everybody can give a good presentation , if she is willing to invest enough time .
Here are tips for giving technical presentations .
This means it ’s about cold , hard facts .
Most of these talks are bad and boooring .
A good presentation is hard work , no trick .
1 . Buy a book about rhetoric
It is not enough to read one article to give an interesting presentation .
Who wants to be a good speaker has to look into speaking .
You could start with the classical The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking .
2. Content is king
You need content .
If you do n’t have anything to say , keep quiet .
Many presentations are quite unsubstantial and need a flashy presenter .
This does n’t apply to us .
The content must be tailored to the audience .
What knowledge can you take for granted ?
Underestimate the knowledge , but never underestimate the intelligence of your audience !
Fill your presentation !
Every minute they listen to you , should be worth it .
Every sentence must be important .
You often hear the first n seconds are important .
They are not .
Nobody will leave the room after 60 seconds , but often i know after 60 seconds , whether the speaker intends to fill or use his time .
3. Slow and clear
We ’re talking technical presentations .
Not wedding oration , not sales pitch , not advertisement , not political speech .
This means to omit the filling stuff and go right to the core .
This should be also true for the other occasions , but it ’s essential here .
Do n’t say the same three times in a row with different phrasing .
It is better
to speak
slooowly
and clearly
one sentence
after another .
Do n’t read your content .
Not from paper , not from beamer , not from screen .
You have practiced enough to know your text by heart , have n’t you ?
4 . A good presentation has a climax
A good presentation has one - exactly one - climax .
Try to summarize your content into one sentence !
Now minimize that sentence !
It should have no comma and no “ and ” .
Imagine your audience would memorize only one sentence from your talk – what would that be ?
You can say this .
“ If you keep just one thing in mind from my talk , keep this : A good presentation is hard work , no trick . ”
A good presentation has one - exactly one - climax .
Do n’t fear repetitions in this case .
A good presentation has one - exactly one - climax .
The climax determines the rest of the content .
Thus if you have your climax , you have a criteria , where you could shorten your talk .
5 . Humor is permitted
Yes , you can joke .
A funny picture to lead to another topic is permitted , as long as it is n’t too much and on topic .
Do n’t laugh yourself !
A speaker better has a wry sense of humor .
6. Slide design
You can find good tips at Presentation Zen .
A nice rule of thumb is 6×6 , though i favor 1×6 .
Especially with a technical topic one is ensnared to use bullet points .
It does n’t help .
It does n’t stick .
As the speaker , you will read the list point by point , with some intermediary “ and ” and “ uh ” , and bore the audience .
Do it like Steve , not like Bill !
Animations ?
Cease and desist !
7. Darned technology
Beamers video projectors and laptops sometimes do n’t get along with each other .
Computers break .
Shit happens .
Show up early and test the real equipment !
Do n’t trust this test and always carry an USB stick and your slides in pdf form with you .
Live demos are risky because of this .
Sometimes it is worth this risk , sometimes it is not .
If it breaks , it ’s your fault .
Maybe it is n’t , but from the audiences point of view , it ’s only you on stage .
That directly leads to the next point :
8 . Do n’t apologize
Who is on stage does n’t apologize .
At least do n’t say more than a quick “ sorry ” .
It does n’t matter who or what is at fault .
It is the responsibility of the speaker to cope with it .
It only hurts your presentation in the end .
If you are quick - witted , you may joke about yourself , but return to the agenda as soon as possible !
9 . Practice , practice , practice
You ca n’t practice enough .
The only exception is that you sound like you have practiced more than enough .
If you have n’t practiced enough , you ca n’t watch your audience .
You can read people , whether they have understood , what you just said , or whether you should repeat that .
Eye contact happens automatically .
Even the “ uh ” will disappear .
A good presentation is hard work , no trick .
Probably it ’s the first time when the car hits the big sea anchor on the regular road in a big city , St. Petersburg .
An Intuitive Explanation of the Information Entropy of a Random Variable
Or : How to Play Twenty Questions
Daniel Shawcross Wilkerson
8 and 15 October 2006 , 26 January 2009
Abstract
Information Entropy is not often explained well , yet it is quite straightforward to understand and that understanding can be quite helpful in everyday life .
Here we explain Information Entropy from scratch using simple mathematics and examples from everyday life , in particular deriving from first principles the best method of playing the game " Twenty Questions " .
Twenty Questions
There is a popular game called Twenty Questions that works like this .
One person is the " Knower " and picks a point out of the probability space of all objects ( thinks of an object ) .
The other is the " Guesser " and asks the Knower to evaluate various random variables ( questions ) at that point ( answer the questions of the object ) .
The Guesser wins if he can guess the object the Knower is thinking about by asking at most Twenty Questions .
Here is a stupid way to play the game :
Knower : I got one .
Guesser :
Is it my left big toe ?
Knower : No. Guesser : Is it the Washington Monument ?
Knower : No. Guesser : Is it Aunt June ? ...
Anyone who has played this game can do better .
But can we examine rigorously how , and say precisely by how much , we can do better ?
Interestingness
When my telephone rings , I do the experiment of answering it : sometimes its a hot girl ; sometimes it is a telemarketer .
Even if we know which is more likely , we never know for sure .
I called a girl last night and she immediately exclaimed " we were just talking about you ! " ; we are quite surprised when the measurement of picking up the phone has even the slightest predictability , such as being the person about whom we were just speaking .
Picking up the phone is quite an interesting experiment to do .
On the other hand , there are also much less interesting experiments : we basically know how they are going to turn out .
When I turn the key in my car , it starts .
I have a well - maintained car and a great mechanic so it does n't surprise me when my car starts .
It is n't interesting enough to even enter into a discussion with another person when making plans with them : I do n't say " I 'll be there at 8 pm , as long as my car starts " ; I take it completely for granted .
Starting my car is not a very interesting thing to do .
Further we rely on our ability to predict the difference between interesting and un-interesting experiments .
In particular , we rely on most of our day consisting of rather un-interesting experiments , such a taking a step , consulting our pay - stub , or greeting a friend .
If all of these events were suddenly to be come interesting , we would be in trouble .
What if it was a coin - flip whether my car starts , the floor is there , my paycheck comes , or my old friend recognizes me ?
Life would be unlivable .
We are careful to know when an interesting experiment is coming : we put our attention on it , we plan for the various eventualities , it punctuates the otherwise more predictable parts of our life .
While we may consider some things in life to be predictable or known and others random , there is in fact no fundamental separation .
Each moment is an experiment .
Is there a way to measure which experiments are more interesting and which are less ?
Random variables
A Random Variable it is a mathematical abstraction for modeling what we call in the real - world a " measurement " , " observation " , or " experiment " .
The definition that mathematicians give is that it is a function of a set you do n't know anything about called the " probability space " ( they add a few other technical conditions that basically just make the math work ) .
You could think of the probability space as the complete state of the world beyond your knowledge .
That is , if my phone rings , to me whoever is at the other end of the line is random : although it might more often be one person than another , I really do n't know .
But to someone who has a god - like knowledge of the complete state of the universe , they know before I answer that it is my mom ( forget the problems resulting from quantum mechanics for the moment ) .
Another way to think about it is that mathematics is deterministic , so for us to be able to apply mathematics to this question , we have to squeeze all the randomness down into one thing , so we put it into the mysterious and unknowable " probability space " and then think of our random variables as being deterministic functions of it .
Information
A " bit " is a binary decision between two things .
If you ask for a milkshake and the waiter says " chocolate or vanilla " in theory he just wants one bit of information from you .
He might ask " whipped cream ? " ; he wants another bit .
" Sprinkles ? " ; another bit .
But notice that these two possibilities and another two and another two actually multiply for a total of eight .
That is , the total number of possibilities is two to the power of the number of bits ; here 2^3 = 8 :
chocolate no whipped cream no sprinkles , chocolate no whipped cream sprinkles , chocolate whipped cream no sprinkles , chocolate whipped cream sprinkles , vanilla no whipped cream no sprinkles , vanilla no whipped cream and sprinkles , vanilla whipped cream no sprinkles , vanilla whipped cream and sprinkles ,
Events
When a random variable has a particular value this is called an " event " .
That is , the set of possible world - states where the person calling me on the phone is my mom is an event ; when we are in one of those worlds we say the " mom is calling " event has occurred .
From the perspective of all possible worlds at once we say the subset of the probability space where it is mom that is calling is the event .
Note that this event really is a subset of the possible worlds space or probability space .
When mom is calling , the number of birds nesting in the Campanile tower on the Berkeley campus could be two , or it could be zero ; it does n't matter , because either way my mom is calling .
So an event consists of a whole subset of possible worlds .
Only some of the information about a given world is relevant : its membership in the event - set ; other information is not relevant .
A random variable as an information - losing filter
If we look at all possible values of a random variable , we notice that their events are a " partition " of the probability space .
That is , any possible world is in exactly one of them : the events cover the space and also do not overlap .
It is helpful to partition the idea of a " measurement " of a random variable into two steps :
Pick a point in the probability space .
Compute the random variable 's function of that point and return its value .
Now , note that a random variable can be thought of as an information - losing filter for the state of the world observed in step 1 .
That is , when we pick a point from the probability space , we do not get to find out all of that information about that point ; instead we only get to find out the value of the random variable function when computed on that point .
The particular value we get out of the random variable tells us that an event has occurred , but all we know from that is that the state of the world is one of the many points in that event - set , the set of points that would give that value .
That is , observing only the value of the random variable , some information about the state of the world has been lost .
Expected value
Suppose you play a game where you flip a fair coin and if it comes up heads you win a dollar and if it comes up tails you win nothing .
How much do you " expect " to win ?
I basically expect to win fifty - cents .
Now , that 's a bit odd , because I can't actually win fifty - cents !
However , what we mean is " expect on average of identical independent games played in the long run " .
We discuss further what that means exactly below , but for the moment your intuition will work rather well here .
The number fifty - cents is called the " expected value " .
We computed it as follows .
Consider each possible event ; Compute its value and its probability ; Multiply the value and probability ;
Add those up .
That is in the previous example we did this : ( 1/2 * $ 0 ) + ( 1/2 * $ 1 ) = $ 0.5 .
It can be shown in our mathematical model called probability theory that the amount you actually win of independent games played in the long run is in fact fifty - cents per play on average .
Such results are called " Limit Theorems " , the famous one being the Central Limit Theorem .
These are beyond the scope of this essay but most people do n't find this understanding of expectation so unintuitive , so we rely on intuition for our purposes here .
In general for a random variable that has a value that is a number ( so we can add and multiply it ) , the expected value is the sum for each outcome of the product of the probability of the outcome and the value of the outcome .
This is a useful number because in the long run , you do tend to get what you expect .
If we call our random variable R , we get the following formula .
Expected Value of R = Sum {over x} Prob ( R = x ) * Value(x )
Measuring information preserved by a random variable
Now we come to the main question : can we measure how much information is preserved by a random variable ?
Another way to say it is , how interesting is that random variable ?
If a random variable told us the whole state of the world , that would be pretty interesting ; we would get lots of information .
However if a random variable always said ' 0 ' , that would be pretty boring .
How do we measure this interestingness ?
Imagine a one meter wide by 10 cm high board tiled with colored rectangles .
Suppose our complete state of the world , or probability space , is a point somewhere on this board .
Our random variable is the color of the region that the point is in .
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+ | | | | | | A | B | C | D | | | | | | +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
Information about the point 's vertical position has no effect on the outcome , so we just ignore it ; it is part of the information that is irretrievably lost .
However , we do get some information about its horizontal position from the random variable output : the color .
Let 's say that the horizontal position of the point is represented by a string of zeros and ones as follows .
If the point is on the left half , the first digit in the string is zero , otherwise if it is on the right half , the first digit is one .
Once we are restricted to only one half of the board , we can repeat this process of naming which half of the half we are on and so on .
We may pin down the position of the point as narrowly as we like .
In mathematics one just assumes that this process can continue forever , but at small enough scales , quantum mechanics intervenes .
Let 's imagine we go out to ten digits , so or resolution would be 2^ - 10 m which is about 10 ^ - 3 = one thousandths of a meter or one millimeter .
So in reality a point is picked at the millimeter granularity , one in about a thousand possibilities , but we only get to find out one of four possibilities .
Information is clearly lost .
Information and probability of events
Further , the information we get when we do get a color is non-uniform .
Let 's consider each color and see how many bits of the real ten bit string we can recover .
D : all we find out is that the point is somewhere on the right .
This just tells us that the first bit of the point is ' 1 ' .
Only one bit of information is preserved .
A : we find out that the first bit is ' 0 ' and the second is ' 0 ' .
Two bits preserved .
B : the first bit is ' 0 ' , the second ' 1 ' , the third ' 0 ' .
Three bits .
C : the first bit is ' 0 ' , the second ' 1 ' , the third ' 1 ' .
Again , three bits .
Wow , sometimes we can get a whole three bits of information !
Recall however that we can't control a random variable : you never know which point from the probability space is going to happen .
What we really want to know is when played independently in the long run how much information do we expect to get on average ?
Have you ever heard " he has a six - figure income " ?
If you have ever referred to the magnitude of someone 's income by the number of figures it has then you already understand logarithm .
Basically , every time the number of figures in someone 's income goes up by one , we know that they make ten times more money .
That is , their income is an exponential function of their digits .
Reversing it , their digits are a logarithmic function of their income .
That 's all there is to the logarithm .
The logarithm base 10 of x , also written log_10 ( x ) , just means how many 10's you have to multiply together to get x .
For example , log_10 ( 100 ) = 2 , as two 10's multiplied give 100 .
Further , log_10 ( 10 ) = 1 , because you only need one 10 to make a 10 ( duh ! ) .
It is important to realize that log_ 10 ( 1 ) = 0 : if you want to multiply things together to get one , there is nothing to do !
When I was a little kid that one drove me crazy -- I ran around the house yelling at anyone who would listen : " No !
You can't get something from no multiplies at all ! "
It was straightforward once I realized that , in the context of multiplication , a sequence of multiplies " starts at " one , the multiplicative identity , rather than zero , the additive identity , so you get a one " for free " as it were .
What if x is not a power of 10 ?
Well first notice that if you multiply something by 3 twice , you almost get 10 -- that is the square root of 10 is 3.16 ....
So if you have to multiply by 3.16 then that only counts as multiplying by half of a 10 , so the logarithm of the product only goes up by 1 / 2 .
That is :
log_10 ( 31.6 ) = log_10 ( 10 * 3.16 )
= log_10 ( 10 ) + log_10 ( 3.16 ) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 .
Above , 10 is the base of the logarithm , but we could have just as easily used another number , such as 2 , and we would have written log_ 2 ( x ) instead .
You get the idea .
Entropy : Expected information
To compute expected information we need to know the information value of each color - event , which we computed in the previous section , and its probability .
Now note for a moment how we pick the point on the board : while some random variables may be non-uniform , the events may have different probabilities , the points in the probability space are always of the same value .
That is , the probability of an event is measured as the size of the part of the probability space that results in that event .
Therefore , when considering the probability of a color - event we can just consider what percentage of the board is covered by that color .
Let 's consider each color again and note the probability of its occurrence .
D : all we know is that the point is somewhere on the right .
This is half the board so there is a 1/2 chance of this .
A : one fourth of the board is covered , so the chance is 1/4 .
B : takes one eight of the board , so the chance is 1/8 .
C : again takes one eight of the board , so again the chance is 1/8 .
Noticing this , we can finally compute the expected number of bits of information we get about the point on the board just from observing its color .
Expected Value of Color = ( 1/2 * 1 ) + ( 1/4 * 2 ) + ( 1/8 * 3 ) + ( 1/8 * 3 ) = 1.75
This looks vaguely familiar ....
But wait , this looks very similar to the computation of information that we did above .
Each time a region of color got smaller by one half , two things happened together :
The number of bits of information we got when it did happen went up by one .
The chance that it did happen went down by a factor of 1/2 .
That is the information of an event x is the logarithm of one over its probability .
Information ( x ) = log_2 ( 1 / Prob( R = x ) )
So in general the expected information or " entropy " of a random variable is the same formula as the expected value with the Value filled in with the Information .
Entropy of R = Expected Information of R = Sum {over x} Prob ( R = x ) * Information ( x ) = Sum {over x} Prob ( R = x ) * log_2 ( 1 / Prob( R = x ) ) =
Sum {over x} - Prob ( R = x ) * log_2 ( Prob ( R = x ) ) = - Sum {over x} Prob ( R = x ) * log_2 ( Prob ( R = x ) )
How to play Twenty Questions
You should now be able to articulate clearly what is wrong with playing Twenty Questions the " stupid way " that we presented in the introduction : the Guesser is picking random variables ( questions ) that have very low entropy and so it getting very little information on average .
Let 's see why .
Consider a random variable with only two values with very unequal probabilities ; the technical term is " an unfair coin " but I do n't want to scare you with technical jargon .
Let 's say the probability of heads is one in a thousand .
We compute the entropy of flipping the coin once as follows :
Entropy = 1/1000 * - log_2( 1/1000 ) + 999/1000 * - log_2(999/1000 ) = 0.011407757737461138
That is , a very biased yes - no question has very little entropy : you might get lucky and find out a lot of information ( and win the game ) all at once , but mostly you will just hear a no , which has little information in it ( the object is not the Washington Monument ) .
Maximizing question entropy
The best way to play this game is , as most people figure out , to ask questions that are about a fifty - fifty chance of giving you a yes .
Computing the entropy of such a question we get
Entropy = 1/2 * - log_2( 1/2 ) + 1/2 * - log_2( 1/2 ) = 1.0
That is , if you ask a one - bit question that gives you a bit every time , you can expect to get one bit of information every time !
Hmm . Deep .
It is hard to know what question gives exactly a " 50 - 50 " chance of a yes or no ; however even if you ask a question that has a 1 / 4 chance of being yes , the entropy is almost 1 :
Entropy = 1/4 * - log_2( 1/4 ) + 3/4 * - log_2( 3/4 ) = 0.811
So even if you are picking questions that have only around a 1 / 4 chance of getting a " yes " answer , you will come close to asking questions with maximum entropy and you will do well .
If we knew the set of things that people select from when asked to " think of something " , we could compute questions that would come very close to giving us a yes or no ; we could do even better if we knew the probability of each thing in the set .
Someone seems to have done this and has built an electronic toy that does rather well at this game .
It figured out " apple " from me .
Having not made such a list the average person must rely on their intuition and experience about what general properties of things are about one half likely to get a " yes " and half to get a " no " .
A classic one is " Is it bigger than a breadbox ? "
Now that you know what makes a good question when you think of your own you know how to test them : about half games you play the answer should be yes and about half the time no .
Throw out questions that tend to always give the same answer .
How big of a universe can you distinguish among ?
Suppose you are getting 1 bit of information each time .
After Twenty Questions you can expect twenty bits of information .
How many possibilities can you distinguish between ?
2^20 = 2^10 * 2^10 =~ 10^3 * 10^3 = a thousand thousand = a million
Even if your questions are not so good and you expect only 0.811 bits , computing another way you have
2^( 20 * 0.811 ) = 76331.98 > 75 thousand
Seventy - five thousand is likely larger than the universe of different objects that your little sister can think of .
Epilogue
There is much more we could do with the Twenty Questions problem .
For example , once you know something about the goal object , you can ask better questions : if you find out that the object is inorganic , there is no point in asking if it reproduces sexually or asexually as only organic things reproduce .
The relative entropy of a question is the entropy given what you also already know .
Maximizing relative entropy at each step results in an end - to - end process called a decision tree .
Machine Learning
The precise study of how to make decisions with only incomplete information is deep .
Before modern computers , the calculations that could be done were limited ; the field of study that resulted is Statistics .
However now , with orders of magnitude more computational power , we can do a much better job ; we now have methods that in some situations do better than people .
For example in constrained circumstances computers can already do better at determining which experiment is most likely to yield the most information given what is already known .
[ New Scientist , 14 January 2004 " Robot scientist outperforms humans in lab " ]
An intelligent robot that could free genomics researchers from routine lab chores has proven as effective as a human scientist .
The robot not only performs genetics experiments , it also decides which ones to do , interprets the results and comes up with new hypotheses .
This new field is called Statistical Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning .
One day machines designed from these methods will cure your illness , drive your car , and design your house , maybe even tell you jokes .
We are n't there yet , computers can hardly see people or take dictation , but the progress is inexorable .
Compassion for yourself as machine
In the process we are learning just how difficult everyday tasks done by people really are .
We easily see objects , but it is a really non-trivial engineering task to write a program to just reliably see a corner of a shape in a photograph taken under real - world conditions [ Harris 's algorithm ] .
Now that I know how hard it is to get a machine to see a face or hear a word , I realize that it is hard for my brain as well .
I used to be unhappy when I made such mistakes , but now I just see the algorithm making choices given what it knows in the time it has .
So one surprising and helpful effect this discipline has had on me is just to have more compassion for the mistakes of myself as human being .

The newly appointed head of a drug intelligence unit in the attorney general ’s office was shot and killed Monday in a street ambush here that dealt a new blow to President Felipe Calderon ’s campaign against this nation ’s drug traffickers .
Officials said several assailants waited for Jose Nemesio Lugo Felix , director of the attorney general ’s “ Information Against Delinquency ” unit , trapping his SUV on a narrow street .
Such assassinations have become common in many border and port cities of Mexico but are rare in the nation ’s capital .
Lugo Felix had been appointed in April to head the unit specializing in the analysis of data about the activities of Mexico ’s drug cartels , officials said .
He was shot as he drove his vehicle during rush hour just outside an office of the attorney general in the southern Coyoacan district , a center of the city ’s arts community .
The method of the assault “ leads us to presume it was a planned execution , ” Victor Corzo , an official with the attorney general ’s office , told reporters .
“ It could be related to drug traffickers because he was someone who possessed information . ”
The slain official was a veteran anti-crime “ strategist , ” Corzo added .

The killing came as apparent drug - related violence continued unabated across the country .
Over the weekend , two journalists for the Azteca television network were reported missing and assumed kidnapped in the northern city of Monterrey .
An army captain was kidnapped and slain in Chilpancingo , the capital of Guerrero state , on the Pacific Coast .
Both regions have seen increasing violence as drug cartels fight one another for lucrative trade routes to the United States , while also battling the police and the army .
A report by the attorney general ’s office published Monday in the Mexico City newspaper Milenio said the drug war has intensified because the nation ’s two most powerful trafficking organizations are fighting over territory in six states : Guerrero , Michoacan , Oaxaca , Veracruz , Tabasco and Quintana Roo .
The rival traffickers are seeking to control rural areas where opium poppies and marijuana are grown , as well as key maritime shipping routes for Colombian cocaine that passes through Mexico on its way to the United States , the report said .

Lugo Felix had previously run a unit in the attorney general ’s office that investigated child and immigrant smuggling , authorities said .
His attackers used a red Pontiac to block his path , officials said .
Gunmen emerged from the car and opened fire , striking him three times in the head .
The assailants fled , abandoning the car , which turned out to be stolen , officials said .
In Monterrey , reporter Gamaliel Lopez Candanosa and cameraman Gerardo Paredes Perez have not been seen since Thursday , Azteca television said in a press release Sunday .
The two men were last seen after covering a Mother ’s Day event Thursday , the television network said .
Dozens of police officers and government officials have been killed in the Monterrey area in the last year .

Lopez Candanosa was a general assignment reporter who only occasionally covered the region ’s drug wars , officials said .
He reported in July on the discovery of a severed head and a threatening “ narco message ” in the city .
Mexico City newspaper El Universal said more than 1,000 people have been killed by organized crime groups this year .
The newspaper Reforma counted 758 killed as of May 1 .
The Mexican government does not release an official tally .
Also Monday , a federal police investigator was found shot to death in Tijuana .
Last week , a severed head was deposited at an army base in Veracruz , a day after Calderon ’s government announced it would send troops to the Gulf Coast state to combat the drug trade .
“ We ’ll keep on going when the federal forces get here , ” read a note left with the head .
It was signed “ Z - 40 , ” a reference to the Zetas , a band of enforcers working in behalf of the Gulf cartel .

On Thursday , four government bodyguards assigned to protect the children of the governor of Mexico state , Enrique Pena Nieto , were slain in Veracruz while escorting their charges on a beach vacation .
Veracruz Gov. Fidel Herrera said the act was similar to those that have become common in states where drug cartels are battling to control lucrative trafficking routes .
“ Just like in Sonora , Tamaulipas , Nuevo Leon , Michoacan and Guerrero , we are facing a national struggle , ” Herrera told reporters last week .
The first federal forces arrived in the state Saturday .
Veracruz is a new front in the nation ’s drug wars .
According to published reports , drug traffickers based in the northern Gulf Coast state of Tamaulipas , which borders Texas , are fighting rivals based farther west in the border state of Sinaloa .
Each wants control of smuggling routes along the Gulf of Mexico .
There are also reports that the Tamaulipas traffickers -- the Gulf cartel -- may be splitting into two rival groups .
Advertisement
Calderon has made the war on drugs the centerpiece of his presidency .
Last week , he created the Corps of Federal Support Forces , an army unit specializing in anti-drug efforts .
The unit will answer directly to his office .
Calderon sent army troops to Michoacan and Guerrero not long after taking office in December .
The army is seen by many here as one of the few security institutions still relatively immune to infiltration by drug traffickers .
At least 11 army troops have been killed this year .
Five soldiers were killed in an ambush in the town of Caracuaro , Michoacan , this month .
“ The sacrifice of these patriots will not be in vain , ” Calderon said at an event marking Cinco de Mayo .
“ In honor of their memory , their deaths will not go unpunished and we will redouble our offensive against the enemy . ”

The latest victim , Lugo Felix , had been on the job just a few weeks , a spokeswoman for the attorney general ’s office said .
“ To be honest , I think he was still getting his boxes unpacked , ” the spokeswoman said .

Millionaire , 84 , died fleeing Harris probate court Perry Whatley battles probate court to the end
When probate court threatened to take away his assets , Perry Whatley gave up and fled — and ultimately died far from his home
Prior to leaving Texas to flee his legal troubles , Perry Whatley expressed a desire to stay in Baytown .
" I 've lived in the same neighborhood for years , " he said , months before his death in Arizona .

Perry '' Bit " Whatley , 84 , a former Baytown refinery worker and lifelong Texan , spent his final days in self - imposed exile , a fugitive from a more than two - year - old fight with the state probate courts .
Whatley was living in Arizona when he died , but it was not where he wanted to be , away from his home , cut off from his family and his $ 2 million fortune .
It was an unlikely , but perhaps unavoidable , end for the retired machinist , a frugal man who had wisely invested his savings in Humble Oil , which became Exxon , then Exxon Mobil .
The investment made him a millionaire nearly twice over , and yet for 20 years after his retirement he lived a simple life in a simple Baytown bungalow until last summer , when he fled the jurisdiction of Harris County Probate Court .
Whatley died Feb. 14 in a rental home in Tempe in the company of his longtime caregiver , Dawn Johnson Whatley , 63 , whom he married in a bedside ceremony in January 2005 .
His wife was his sole heir .
The Whatleys , both seniors with serious health problems , abandoned their own home and went into hiding together last summer .
They left to avoid a hearing and , later , orders issued by Probate Judge Mike Wood that declared Whatley incapacitated , took away control of his assets and could have forced him into a nursing home .
Perry Whatley 's sad saga started out as a dispute between his niece and his new wife , two people who professed devotion to him and who also sought control over his fortune , his health care and his basic life decisions .
But the fight , taken to court in April 2005 by Whatley 's niece , morphed quickly into a twisted legal free - for - all and a near - infamous example for critics who claim Texas probate courts have run amok .
It also underscores how worries over a loved one — seemingly simple at first — can escalate into a costly and chaotic legal conflict .
It took decades for Whatley to make his money .
In less than two years , nearly $ 1.5 million has been spent on legal bills and court - authorized expenses for his probate case and related litigation , based on case documents .
And though Whatley is gone , the fight over what remains of his money is far from over .
To understand how the drama unfolded is to understand the fragile will of one old man and the determination of two women who loved him .
One is Jeannie Anderson , his niece from Baytown , his only brother 's daughter , the person he turned to after his first wife died , the one he gave power of attorney over his complex financial portfolio .
Whatley had no children of his own .
The other is Dawn Johnson , Perry Whatley 's longtime housekeeper and caregiver , a twice - divorced grandmother who also helped his first wife and his mother - in - law , both now deceased .
A few months after suffering a stroke in 2004 , Whatley revoked his niece 's power of attorney and turned increasingly to Johnson for advice .
In January 2005 , the two married in a home ceremony presided over by an ordained Baptist minister .
At the time , Whatley was bedbound by a hip injury , though later he graduated to a wheelchair .
Anderson was n't invited .
When she heard about the wedding weeks later , it alarmed her .
Anderson told the Houston Chronicle she did n't trust Johnson , who she believed had been trying to influence her uncle to give her gifts , including his own home .
In an interview last year , Whatley said he married because Dawn Johnson Whatley already was living with him as his caretaker and he ' ' was just used to being married . "
The two had known each other for a decade .
'' She 's always helped us , " he said .
'' She figured I needed help , and she helped . "
Whatley said his niece , though well - meaning , was trying to control too much and wanted to move him to a nursing home .
Anderson said she worried her uncle was being manipulated and his money was being spent too quickly — more than $ 100,000 had been spent in a few months .
Dawn Johnson
Whatley said she was simply paying for 24 - hour care and for renovations that would make Perry Whatley more comfortable .
Whatley 's niece decided to seek legal protection for her uncle .
In April 2005 , she asked the Harris County Probate Court to declare her uncle incapacitated and grant her legal guardianship .
Such a declaration would strip her uncle of his basic rights and give a guardian control over his money .
Whatley 's wife countered by saying no guardianship was necessary , but , if one should be imposed , she should be named .
That 's when the once - simple life of Perry Whatley started to careen out of control , when his future and his fate became an official court case .
'' It just goes down in the annals of probate history as one of those cases that just dumbfounded everyone , " Anderson told the Chronicle .
Soon after the filing of the guardianship case , the Whatleys withdrew $ 500,000 from an annuity , incurring an early withdrawal penalty .
They gave most of the money to their own newly hired attorneys to fight the guardianship .
Those attorneys now say the costs for the fight have grown to nearly $ 1 million .
In Harris County Probate Court , Wood , who also claimed he was trying to protect Whatley as a disabled Harris County resident , eventually authorized payments of $ 360,000 from Whatley 's money to four lawyers , three he appointed and one hired on behalf of Whatley 's niece .
They have not yet provided final accounting of how much of Whatley 's money was spent .
The judge openly attacked opposing attorneys as unorthodox renegades who abused the system and instigated Whatley 's disappearance .
In one court appearance last summer , he said he might have to order Whatley into court " in chains " and that it would be the fault of Whatley 's legal team .
However , Whatley 's hired attorneys remain adamant in their claims that Wood prejudged their client — without ever meeting Perry Whatley — and demonstrated his bias in a series of comments and rulings that threatened Whatley 's savings , his independence and his marriage .
Anderson has another view .
She believes those hired attorneys '' raped my uncle of his estate . "
Just a few months after the guardianship case began , Whatley 's privately hired lawyers say they began to suspect that the court had already made up its mind — even before hearing Whatley 's side .
The Whatleys left Texas for the first time on Sept. 13 , 2005 — days before their originally scheduled hearing date .
They apparently knew they were dodging the hearing but went to Boston anyway to seek special medical care for Whatley 's diabetes .
Harris County officials alerted Massachusetts authorities ; the Whatleys asked Massachusetts courts for help .
With the Whatleys still out of state , Wood , the probate judge , imposed a temporary guardianship on Sept. 29 , 2005 .
He ruled that Whatley was incapacitated based mostly on a court - appointed physician 's examination that concluded Whatley was impaired by dementia , diabetes , a broken hip and strokes .
Wood chose neither Whatley 's niece nor his wife and instead appointed attorney Mylus J. '' Jimmy " Walker Jr. as guardian .
Walker is a partner at Dinkins Kelly Lenox Lamb & Walker , one of the top- earning probate firms in Harris County probate court .
In court that day , Wood discussed the telephone conversation he'd had with a Massachusetts judge simultaneously reviewing the case .
According to transcripts , the Massachusetts judge told Wood that she had '' been advised she has no jurisdiction at all .
But she said that it would be appropriate , she thought , for me to order the temporary guardian to take possession and custody of Mr. Whatley and bring him back to Harris County . "
Still , neither judge had actually met Whatley .
Wood ordered Walker , the newly appointed guardian , to physically bring Whatley back to Texas .
With the Texas court order signed by Wood , Walker personally flew to Boston to retrieve Whatley and placed him in a Bellaire nursing home nearly 40 miles from Baytown .
At Walker 's request , Wood ordered payment of nursing home bills of $ 5,000 a month and , at first , $ 10,000 a month for '' extra supervision , " court records show .
His wife initially was not told of his whereabouts , though Wood later approved monitored visits .
Anderson , his niece , moved him back to a Baytown nursing home , where she felt he thrived .
Walker , though , continued to control her uncle 's money as guardian of his estate .
In the meantime , Whatley 's personal lawyers continued to do everything they could to stall or reverse Wood 's decisions .
They appealed to federal court .
They repeatedly tried to get Wood recused for bias .
They also challenged other judges assigned to hear the recusal motions against Wood .
Most of those efforts were unsuccessful .
They even filed a complaint against Wood to the state judicial conduct commission in March 2006 .
'' The bottom line is that Mike Wood had no jurisdiction to bring this horror into this couple 's life in their golden years , " Susan Norman , one of Whatley 's hired attorneys , wrote .
Norman herself was given a year 's probation by the State Bar for professional misconduct in September after she used a client 's credit card with permission but failed to promptly repay the debt .
In June 2006 , the Whatley legal team had its first big victory .
The 14th Court of Appeals issued an order in Whatley 's favor , saying Wood 's guardianship appointments were void because of the mishandling of one recusal petition , largely a paperwork error .
The decision stripped Whatley 's niece and Walker of their authority .
It also put hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal payments in limbo .
The same day , Dawn Johnson Whatley drove her blue handicapped van to a Baytown nursing home to bring Perry '' Bit " Whatley back home .
Just after he was wheeled inside , Whatley declared he had no complaints about the nursing home but that he was grateful to be back in his own living room .
He could eat home - cooked meals .
Pet his cat .
His brother could regularly visit .
The reprieve would not last .
Citing his own duty to protect Harris County 's elderly and disabled , Wood scheduled another guardianship hearing .
As the trial date approached , Wood insisted that the Whatleys be brought to court for him to question .
Whatley 's lawyers resisted .
In an interview with the Chronicle held at a church last summer , Dawn Johnson Whatley said she had been deeply troubled by the judge 's actions and words .
Perry Whatley seemed confused but said he , too , was upset about the probate court .
Whatley said he preferred to be in Baytown .
'' I 'd rather live here .
I 've lived in the same neighborhood for years . "
For a second time , the Whatleys left home .
Neither process servers , nor appointees nor other family members could find them .
For months , their lawyers refused to say where the Whatleys had gone .
' ' I have never in 35 years had lawyers say , ' I do n't know where my clients are , ' " Wood said in one courtroom confrontation .
Whatley 's attorneys decided to personally sue the judge , his appointees and others in an attempt to freeze spending of Whatley 's assets .
The lawsuit accused the judge and others of fraud , conspiracy and breach of fiduciary duties and asked for $ 15 million in damages .
Wood has called the suit frivolous and insisted he should be granted judicial immunity .
On Oct. 16 , back in a Texas probate court , Wood again declared Whatley incapacitated .
The judge relied on evidence from a four - hour trial that included a doctor who had examined Whatley twice , a nurse , Whatley 's niece and the guardian Wood had appointed , all of whom described Whatley as mentally and physically impaired .
For the first time , Wood also heard from Whatley himself .
In a written affidavit , the ex-Marine and Pearl Harbor survivor complained that the court 's appointee had deprived him of access to his bank accounts , his annuities , his cash and even his Social Security and retirement checks .
'' He has left me destitute , " Whatley said .
Afterward , Wood reappointed Walker .
But Walker was unable to find Whatley .
And because another judge froze most of Whatley 's remaining assets as part of the civil suit , Walker lacked control over Whatley 's money , though he did visit his empty home and change the locks .
Walker was among 11 attorneys present at a February hearing in the civil case in which one of Whatley 's attorneys unexpectedly announced that the vortex of contention — Perry '' Bit " Whatley — had died .
And though the guardianship matter ends , legal challenges continue .
His niece just wishes it would stop .
To her , it all seems meaningless with her uncle dead .
She fears '' Bit " Whatley spent his last days in confusion , likely wishing to go home to Texas .
She 's troubled that his wife did not call when Whatley lay dying .
'' She gave no one in my family the opportunity to say goodbye to my uncle . "
After two years of costly conflict , no one has won .
And an old man has died in Arizona more than 1,000 miles from home .

We recently learned that the gene MTH1 plays a role in defending the brain against oxidative DNA damage .
The Mth1 protein dephosphorylates an oxidized nucleotide ( 8 - oxo - dGTP ) , preventing 8 - oxo - dG incorporation into new DNA .
MTH1 -/- knockout mice suffer from increased levels of DNA damage and oxidatively induced cell death .
It appears that MTH1 also protects the heart from oxidative damage .
Ohtsubo et al. demonstrate that the frequency of MTH1 expression increases in the aortic and cardiac smooth muscle cells of hypertensive rats , whose cardiovascular tissue exhibits high levels of DNA damage :
… Little attention has been given to the biological significance of 8 - oxo - dG accumulation in cardiovascular tissues during the different stage of hypertension and its prevention .
We thus investigated the levels and localization of both 8 - oxo - dG accumulation and expression of MTH1 , which hydrolyzes 8 - oxo - dGTP to prevent its incorporation into DNA , in the thoracic aorta prepared from stroke - prone spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRSP ) and age - matched Wister–Kyoto rats ( WKY ) , aged 5 – 32 weeks .
… [ T ] he levels of nuclear 8 - oxo - dG in the aorta increased significantly in SHRSP , but not WKY , with aging .
Immunohistochemical study revealed that both TUNEL reactivity and 8 - oxo - dG immunoreactivity were increased in smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) and endothelial cells ( EC ) of the aorta with aging … .
The number of 8 - oxo - dG and TUNEL positive cells in EC , but not in SMC , was significantly higher in SHRSP than WKY at 32 weeks of age .
In contrast , the expression levels of Mth1mRNA and MTH1 protein in the aorta were similarly decreased both in SHRSP and WKY with aging .
However , the number of MTH1 expressing EC was remarkably increased in the older SHRSP compared to the younger ones or age - matched WKY .
Hypertension significantly increased not only 8 - oxo - dG accumulation but also the expression of MTH1 in EC of the aorta during aging .
While accumulation of 8 - oxo - dG in SMC of the aorta was slightly increased , the expression of MTH1 protein in SMC was rather decreased by hypertension .
We thus suggest that MTH1 may protect EC in the aorta from the oxidative damage increased by hypertension .
To summarize and restate : 8 - oxo - dG incorporation into DNA is higher in hypertensive rats , i.e. , the steady state levels of DNA damage are higher than in the healthy wildtype .
Both hypertensive and wildtype rats generally decrease MTH1 expression over the course of aging — but in the hypertensive animals , the number of cells expressing the gene increase
The interpretation favored by the authors is that MTH1 is behaving like a housekeeping gene in early life but a stress response gene in late life :
In young animals , basal levels of MTH1 expression protect the heart against oxidative DNA damage .
( Hypertensive animals presumably have a higher rate of oxidation ; hence the same level of protection still results in a higher level of 8 - oxo - dG incorporation . )
Over the course of normal aging , MTH1 expression goes down , resulting in less protection and higher levels of damage .
In older animals , the cells expressing MTH1 are presumably ones that have received the highest levels of oxidative damage , and are consequently inducing an anti-oxidant regulon that includes MTH1 .
That , as I say , is the author ’s interpretation .
I ’m perplexed by one issue :
If increased oxidative damage causes induction of an anti-oxidant regulon , it seems like wildtype and hypertensive animals should show a steady increase in MTH1 expression over the course of aging .
Determining whether MTH1 is truly protective will await studies in knockout mutants , the key question being whether MTH1 -/- animals develop hypertension ( in the same way that they precociously develop Parkinson ’s - like damage , as well as being more sensitive to stressors that cause this type of insult . )
A knockout mouse already exists , but I do n’t know whether the mouse models of hypertension are as well - developed as they are in the rat .
Nonetheless , a gene with a very specific biochemical function ( preventing incorporation of a specific oxidized nucleotide into DNA ) that might protect two wildly different ( and wildly important ) tissues from age - and disease - related damage is well worth further study .
MTH1 is a gene to watch .
I published a new page about the mechanism of the Buran ’s onboard computer and a little introduction on the onboard computers on the soviets spaceships .
A while back , I swore off using adding print statements to my code while debugging .
I forced myself to use the python debugger to see values inside my code .
I ’m really glad I did it .
Now I ’m comfortable with all those cute single - letter commands that remind me of gdb .
The pdb module and the command - line pdb.py script are both good friends now .
However , every once in a while , I find myself lapsing back into cramming a bunch of print statements into my code because they ’re just so easy .
Sometimes I do n’t want to walk through my code using breakpoints .
I just need to know a simple value when the script runs .
The bad thing is when I write in a bunch of print statements , then debug the problem , then comment out or remove all those print statements , then run into a slightly different bug later . , and find myself adding in all those print statements again .
So I ’m forcing myself to use logging in every script I do , no matter how trivial it is , so I can get comfortable with the python standard library logging module .
So far , I ’m really happy with it .
I ’ll start with a script that uses print statements and revise it a few times and show off how logging is a better solution .
Here is the original script , where I use print statements to watch what happens :
# This is a.py
def g( ) :
1 / 0
def f( ) :
print " inside f ! "
try :
g ()
except Exception , ex :
print " Something awful happened ! "
print " Finishing f ! "
if __name__ == " __main__ " : f()
Running the script yields this output :
$ python a.py
inside f!
Something awful happened !
Finishing f!
It turns out that rewriting that script to use logging instead just ai n’t that hard :
# This is b.py .
import logging
# Log everything , and send it to stderr .
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG )
def g( ) :
1/0
def f( ) :
logging.debug ( " Inside f ! " )
try :
g ()
except Exception , ex :
logging.exception ( " Something awful happened ! " )
logging.debug ( " Finishing f ! " )
if __name__ == " __main__ " :
f ()
And here is the output :
$ python b.py
DEBUG 2007-09-18 23:30:19,912 debug 1327 Inside f!
ERROR 2007-09-18 23:30:19,913 error 1294
Something awful happened !
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " b.py " , line 22 , in f
g ()
File " b.py " , line 14 , in g
1/0
ZeroDivisionError : integer division or modulo by zero
DEBUG 2007-09-18 23:30:19,915 debug 1327 Finishing f!
Note how we got that pretty view of the traceback when we used the exception method .
Doing that with prints would n’t be very much fun .
So , at the cost of a few extra lines , we got something pretty close to print statements , which also gives us better views of tracebacks .
But that ’s really just the tip of the iceberg .
This is the same script written again , but I ’m defining a custom logger object , and I ’m using a more detailed format :
# This is c.py
import logging
# Make a global logging object .
x = logging .getLogger ( " logfun " )
x.setLevel(logging.DEBUG )
h = logging .
StreamHandler ( )
f = logging .
Formatter ( " %( levelname )s %( asctime )s %( funcName ) s %( lineno ) d % ( message ) s " )
h.setFormatter(f )
x.addHandler (h )
def g( ) :
1/0
def f( ) :
logfun = logging.getLogger (" logfun " )
logfun.debug ( " Inside f ! " )
try :
g ()
except Exception , ex :
logfun.exception ( " Something awful happened ! " )
logfun.debug ( " Finishing f ! " )
if __name__ == " __main__ " :
f ()
And the output :
$ python c.py
DEBUG 2007-09-18 23:32:27,157 f 23
Inside f!
ERROR 2007-09-18 23:32:27,158 exception 1021 Something awful happened !
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " c.py " , line 27 , in f
g ()
File " c.py " , line 17 , in g
1/0
ZeroDivisionError : integer division or modulo by zero
DEBUG 2007-09-18 23:32:27,159 f 33 Finishing f!
Now I will change how the script handles the different types of log messages .
Debug messages will go to a text file , and error messages will be emailed to me so that I am forced to pay attention to them .
# This is d.py
import logging , logging .
handlers
# Make a global logging object .
x = logging .getLogger ( " logfun " )
x.setLevel(logging.DEBUG )
# This handler writes everything to a file .
h1 = logging .
FileHandler (" /var/log/myapp.log " )
f = logging .
Formatter ( " %( levelname )s %( asctime )s %( funcName ) s %( lineno ) d % ( message ) s " )
h1.setFormatter (f )
h1.setLevel(logging.DEBUG )
x.addHandler(h1 )
# This handler emails me anything that is an error or worse .
h2 = logging .
handlers .SMTPHandler(' localhost ' , ' [ email protected ] ' , [ ' [ email protected ] ' ] , ' ERROR log ' )
h2.setLevel(logging.ERROR )
h2.setFormatter (f )
x.addHandler ( h2 )
def g( ) :
1/0
def f( ) :
logfun = logging.getLogger (" logfun " )
logfun.debug ( " Inside f ! " )
try :
g ()
except Exception , ex :
logfun.exception ( " Something awful happened ! " )
logfun.debug ( " Finishing f ! " )
if __name__ == " __main__ " :
f ()
Lots of really great handlers exist in the logging .
handlers module .
You can log by sending HTTP gets or posts , you can send UDP packets , you can write to a local file , etc .
Finally , I ’d like to point out that Mike Pirnat has some excellent slides ( in PDF format ) on logging using the standard python library here .

Computer users were promised better and cheaper products yesterday after Microsoft lost a three - year European legal battle .
In a ruling described as a major victory by consumer groups , a Brussels court confirmed that the software giant must make it easier for rival systems to work with its Windows operating system .
It means that Microsoft must disclose its secret computer codes to enable rival companies ' gadgets such as media players to work seamlessly with Windows personal computers when downloading songs and videos .
The European Court of First Instance , the EU 's second - highest court , also ruled that the world 's biggest software company must pay a £ 343 million fine imposed in 2004 by the watchdog European Commission when it ruled that Microsoft abused its near - monopoly position to freeze out competitors .
Jim Murray of BEUC , a consumer organisation , said :
" The decision should bring more competition in the market and more incentive for other companies - and for Microsoft - to offer improved products and services at a competitive price . "
Extensive medical research shows that mothers ' milk satisfies babies ' nutritional needs far better than any manufactured infant formula .
It also protects babies against many common infectious diseases and certain inflammatory diseases , and probably helps lower the risk of a child later developing diabetes , lymphoma and some types of leukemia .
These conclusions appear in a major new review of the medical literature published this month entitled " Benefits and Risks of Breastfeeding . "
The article , published in the current issue of Advances in Pediatrics , surveys both risks and benefits associated with breastfeeding .
Many mothers and medical professionals may not understand that a great number of protective factors unique to human milk are provided by breastfeeding and how much breastfeeding 's benefits outweigh its rare but often well - publicized risks , said Dr. Armond Goldman , senior author of the paper and professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston .
In the United States , this misunderstanding of benefits versus risks -- in addition to social factors such as less generous maternity leave policies and poor preventive health care for much of the population -- has helped keep the rates of initiation and continuation of breastfeeding in the U.S. lower than those in most developed countries , Goldman said .
Coincidentally , the paper appeared online just before the Washington Post reported on Aug. 31 that lobbyists for the infant formula industry had succeeded in getting the federal Department of Health and Human Services to tone down a government - sponsored " attention - grabbing advertising campaign " in 2004 designed to convince mothers that their babies faced real health risks if they did not breastfeed .
A congressional investigation is examining the allegations in the Post report , which emphasized the low rate of breastfeeding in the U.S. compared with that of other industrialized nations .

In the Advances in Pediatrics paper , said Goldman , " we tried to clarify the benefits and risks , by putting together a definitive review of both sides of the issue . "
He added : " Substantially more physicians and members of the public should recognize that the overall benefits of breastfeeding are much greater and the overall risks are much less than are benefits and risks from feedings using commercial infant formulas . "
Goldman continued , " If you understand the potential risks , most can be identified during pregnancy or shortly after birth and can be prevented or minimized . "
UTMB professor of pediatrics David K. Rassin , a co-author of the paper ( with Baylor College of Medicine assistant professor of pediatrics Judy M. Hopkinson ) , said , " Although many of us assume that everyone knows breastfeeding is best for infants and the American Academy of Pediatrics has come out with really strong recommendations in favor of it , the prevalence of breastfeeding in the United States is only about 65 percent right now . "
Rassin elaborated : " Historically , we had a rapid increase from about 25 percent in the Sixties up to the area of 60 percent in the late Eighties , and it 's only very gradually crept up since then . "
" Within the United States , where we 've got clean water and do n't have a lot of the diseases associated with formula feeding in Third World countries , I think we still have this concept that there really is n't any difference between breastfeeding and formula feeding , " Rassin said .
" One of the points we tried to make in this article is that even in this country there are definitely some health risks associated with formula feeding -- they just tend to involve diseases that take a long time to emerge but may reflect lack of breastfeeding . "
In countries where clean water is unavailable to much of the population , statistics show that breastfeeding significantly reduces infant mortality .
However , in some areas , such as sub-Saharan Africa , the possibility of HIV transmission through breast milk makes the risk - benefit calculation more difficult , the paper 's authors note .
" Certainly in the U.S. at the moment , it would be recommended that an HIV - infected mom not breastfeed , " Rassin said .
" But if you look at a poor sub -Saharan African nation and try to balance off the high risks of a child dying because of a severe gastrointestinal infection from dirty water in formula versus the potential for getting HIV infection from the mom , it 's a tough call .
Probably , you would tend to say breastfeeding would be better in that circumstance than not breastfeeding . "
Other risks identified by the authors include an insufficient transfer of breast milk , leading to dehydration and growth failure in the infant ; certain vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin D in human milk ; the possibility that allergens consumed by the mother and passed to the nursing infant could cause adverse reactions ; the transmission of a serious infection during breastfeeding ; the exposure of an infant to certain toxic medications that are excreted in human milk ; and rare genetic defects in the infant that prevent the digestion and metabolism of the milk constituents lactose , galactose and phenylalanine .
Except for genetic disorders and some infectious diseases , the authors say , none of these risks absolutely precludes breastfeeding if preventive measures are taken .
In particular , Rassin said , making sure new mothers have learned proper breastfeeding technique is critical to ensuring babies get enough breast milk to keep them hydrated and growing .
" The way we manage newborns now , getting them out of the hospital in 24 or 48 hours , that 's not enough time to really get a mom established on breastfeeding , and moms need the appropriate support to begin the behavior , " Rassin said .
" It is a natural behavior , but it 's not always an easy behavior to get established -- in fact , it can be very difficult during the first couple of weeks . "
Goldman also emphasized the need for better physician education on breastfeeding .
" It 's important that physicians and others in the health care profession understand the benefits and risks of breastfeeding , recognize problems when they occur and help mothers with them , " Goldman said .
" Part of the difficulty is that there is insufficient time in most medical schools and most residency training programs in pediatrics , obstetrics or family medicine to more fully educate medical trainees about this important public health issue . "
Fine halo displays occur all over the world but the polar regions get the really exquisite ones .
Marko Riikonen of Finland photographed this extraordinary display while researching halos at the South Pole during the Antarctic summer of 98/99 together with Jarmo Moilanen and Marko Pekkola .
The great January 11th display was formed by low level diamond dust ice crystals and lasted 50 minutes .
There were a great many rare arcs and those from Parry oriented crystals were among the best , if not the best , ever photographed .
Marko Riikonen 's three fisheye images capture the sunwards sky , the whole sky centered on the zenith and halos in the anthelic direction opposite the sun .
Larger images are on the next three pages .
What happened in those 50 minutes is worth long and careful study .

BBC News , Jerusalem
Israel has carried out a number of raids in Nablus
The B'Tselem group said it had testimony from a 15 - year - old boy , his 24 - year - old cousin and also an 11 - year - old girl .
They said that soldiers had forced them to enter houses ahead of the troops during the raid in Nablus .
The use of human shields is illegal under Israeli and international law .
The Israeli defence force says it is investigating the allegations .
' Knowingly exposed '
The Israeli army occupied the Kasbah , or old town , in Nablus for five days at the end of last month .
It said it was hunting for militants and their weapons .
Soldiers conducted house - to - house searches .
They imposed a two - day curfew on tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians .
Amid Omeira , aged 15 , told B'Tselem that a group of soldiers used the barrels of their rifles to force him to enter a number of houses ahead of them .
His 24 - year - old cousin Samah told the group and the BBC of a similar experience , as did Jihan Dadush , aged 11 .
From their testimonies , B'Tselem says it believes the Israeli soldiers knowingly exposed Samah and the two children to danger as they expected to find armed men in the houses .
B'Tselem has accused Israel 's military authorities of not adequately informing soldiers about both Israeli and international laws which prohibit using civilians as human shields .
B'Tselem says the delay in investigating similar alleged incidents in the past suggests a leniency in the army 's attitude towards soldiers who use civilians in this way .
Steve Dekorte has some things he dislikes about git .
This post is how I work around these issues in my own git repositories .
Git has a heuristic for detecting binary files .
You can force other file types to be binary by adding a .gitattributes file to your repository .
This file contains a list of glob patterns , followed by attributes to be applied to files matching those patterns .
By adding .gitattributes to the repository all cloned repositories will pick this up as well .
For example , if you want all *. foo files to be treated as binary files you can have this line in .gitattributes :
*.foo - crlf - diff - merge
This will mean all files with a . foo extension will not have carriage return / line feed translations done , wo n't be diffed and merges will result in conflicts leaving the original file untouched .
Now when you pull from another repository that has changes to a . foo file you 'll see something like :
test.foo | Bin 32 -> 36 bytes
Note that it shows it is a binary file .
If you pull from another repository with changes to test .
foo you 'll get :
Auto - merged test.foo CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge conflict in test.foo
The file will be untouched and you can change it manually to be the correct version .
Either by leaving it untouched , or copying a new file over it .
Then you need to commit the merge conflict fix ( even if you left the file untouched ) :
git commit - a -m " Fix merge conflict in test.foo "
The cherry picking of patches works differently to Darcs .
There are a couple of ways of handling this , but I use ' git cherry - pick ' .
If you have a number of contributers with their own repositories that you regularly pull from you can set up remote tracking branches :
git remote add john http ://... git remote add mary http ://...
Now when you want John and Mary 's most recent patches you can fetch them :
git fetch john git fetch mary
This does not make any changes to your local branches .
It gets and stores their changes in a separate remote tracking branch .
If you want to see what John has changed , compared to yours :
git log -p master .. john / master
From there you can decide to pull in all John 's commits :
git merge john / master
If you want one commit , but not its dependencies then this is where ' cherry - pick ' is used .
Given a commit id , ' cherry - pick ' will take the patch for that commit and apply it to your current branch .
It 's used like :
git cherry - pick abcdefgh
This creates a commit with a different commit id than the original , but with the same contents .
It needs to be a different id as it does n't have the same dependencies as the original .
If you decide later you want all John 's commits and do a merge which includes the commit that you cherry picked from you might expect conflicts .
Git handles this case fine and does an automatic merge , noticing the patches are the same .
So it effectively gives you the same functionality as Darcs selective patch pulling , but not as nice a user interface .

The UK Daily Mail on Sunday reports that British MPs were surprised to hear a visiting Pentagon official declare : “ I hate all Iranians . ”
Debra Cagan , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Coalition Affairs to US Defense Secretary Robert Gates , made the comments this month to a meeting of six Members of Parliament .
She also accused Britain of “ dismantling ” the Anglo - US - led coalition in Iraq by pulling troops out of Basra too soon .
The report says that although the statement about Iranians was an aside , “ it was not out of keeping with her general demeanour . ”
“ She seemed more keen on saying she did n’t like Iranians than that the US had no plans to attack Iran , ” said one MP .
“ She did say there were no plans for an attack but the tone did not fit the words . ”
Another MP said : “ I formed the impression that some in America are looking for an excuse to attack Iran .
It was very alarming . ”
The Pentagon denied Ms. Cagan said she “ hated ” Iranians .
“ She does n’t speak that way , ” said an official .
But when The Mail on Sunday spoke to four of the six MPs , three confirmed privately that Cagain made the remark and one declined to comment .
The other two could not be contacted .
I have to hand it to Ms. Cagan for being much more honest on the subject than most officials .

Over the same period , the number of applications from whites fell by more than 10 % , and by almost 7 % among Hispanics .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) -
The chief executive and part owner of Alaska ’s largest oil - field services company and one of his vice presidents pleaded guilty on Monday to charges that they tried to bribe Alaska legislators to secure favorable state oil policies .
VECO Corp.
Chief Executive Bill Allen and Richard Smith , vice president for community affairs and government relations , pleaded guilty to charges of bribery , extortion and conspiracy .
If convicted on all counts , each face as much as 20 years in prison and fines of $ 750,000 .
The officials entered their guilty pleas in federal court in Anchorage on Monday after reaching plea agreements last week .
Arrested last Friday in Juneau were a current state legislator , Rep. Vic Kohring , and two former legislators -- Rep. Bruce Weyhrauch and former House Speaker Pete Kott .
All three Republicans were charged with seeking money and jobs from Anchorage - based VECO in exchange for pushing the company ’s preferred version of an oil - tax bill .
If convicted on all charges , the legislators each could face as maximum of 70 years in prison and fines of up to $ 1 million .
“ I own your ass , ” Allen told Kott , the former house speaker , according to the indictment released last Friday .
Allen and Smith admitted that they paid more than $ 400,000 in cash and benefits to lawmakers , including $ 243,250 over five years in so - called “ consulting ” fees to one state senator who never actually performed any consulting services outside his legislative office , according to documents filed in court .
“ Two corporate executives have admitted to bribing several Alaskan lawmakers with hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal benefits in exchange for official acts being taken on their behalf , ” Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher said in a U.S. Justice Department statement .
“ We will not only pursue corrupt public officials , but also individuals like Bill Allen and Richard Smith who venture to fill the coffers of our officials with corrupt payments in exchange for favors , ” Kenneth Kaiser , assistant director of the FBI ’s criminal investigative division , said in the Justice Department statement .
The offices of Anchorage - based VECO and six legislators were searched by the FBI last August and September in the probe .
The lawmakers targeted by the search included former Senate President Ben Stevens , an Anchorage Republican and the son of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens .
The younger Stevens reported in state financial disclosure documents that he was paid consulting fees by VECO , but he did not describe the work performed .
The investigation is ongoing , Justice Department officials said .
At the state capitol in Juneau Monday , current House Speaker John Harris , a Valdez Republican , said the investigation had cast a pall over the legislature .
“ I think we as a group here do not condone actions on behalf of legislators that cast a bad light on the institution , ” he said at a news conference .
He said Kohring would be stripped of his post chairing the House Special Committee on Oil and Gas but allowed to keep his other committee posts , for now .
“ In our system of government nobody is guilty until convicted by a jury of their peers , ” Harris said .
UK military operations in Afghanistan began in 2001
UK soldiers on patrol
The MoD said the soldiers , from 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment , were killed at around 1830 local time ( 1500 BST ) on Thursday .
It is understood they died when the planes dropped a bomb near their patrol in Helmand province .
Two other soldiers were also injured .
Next of kin have been informed .
The fighter planes had been called in to give air support to ground troops , the Ministry of Defence said .
Human error
Defence Secretary Des Browne said he was " very saddened " by the death of " three brave men who were tragically killed in what is believed to be a friendly fire incident " .
He said such incidents were " rare " and it would be thoroughly investigated .
The United States expresses its deep condolences to the families and loved ones of the soldiers who died
US Embassy statement
No easy fix for ' friendly fire '
High risks on battleground
" We will look at this incident very carefully and make sure the families , who are uppermost in our thoughts , know exactly what happened to their loved ones , " he said .
He added that US air support was very important and had often helped get British troops out of dangerous situations .
" We go to extraordinary lengths to ensure these things do n't happen but at the end of the day combat environments are very complex environments .
Human error is always a possibility , " he said .
The US Embassy in London said in a statement : " The United States expresses its deep condolences to the families and loved ones of the soldiers who died , and we wish those who were injured a speedy recovery . "
The MoD said all the soldiers had been taking part in a fighting patrol to disrupt Taleban activity to the north west of Kajaki , in Helmand province .
They came under attack from Taleban insurgents and during the firefight that followed , close air support was called in from two US F15 aircraft , according to the MoD .
Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Mayo , a spokesman for British troops in Helmand province told BBC Radio 4's The World at One : " During this patrol they came into contact with some Taleban from a number of firing positions .
" As they came under fire they then called in some close air support to assist them and an aircraft came in , it dropped a bomb and tragically this bomb killed three of the soldiers and injured two more . "
The three soldiers were declared dead at the scene .
The injured two were evacuated by helicopter to the medical facility at Camp Bastion .
Lt Col Mayo said one of the two was very seriously wounded and the other seriously wounded .
BBC Kabul correspondent Alastair Leithead said close air support was relied on by ground troops to provide cover , attack the enemy and to get them out of trouble .
" In the heat of battle when support is needed very quickly , nine times out of 10 it really does help to get troops out of very difficult positions , " he said .
Wing Commander Andrew Brookes , a defence analyst , said such air cover must be relied on unless more troops were deployed on the ground .
" In this case it was an F15 , an awesomely superb ground attack aeroplane but if you do n't want that you have to provide enough troops on the ground ... such as you do n't need to call on the Americans to pull your chestnuts out of the fire , " he said .
The only other case of British service personnel being killed by in friendly fire involving American military personnel in Afghanistan in still under investigation .
Royal Anglian fatalities
An inquiry was launched in December 2006 into the death of marine Jonathan Wigley , 21 , killed during an intense battle in Helmand province .
In February , Mr Browne told MPs that since 1990 , 12 UK service personnel had been killed in friendly fire incidents involving American military personnel in Iraq .
The three deaths on Thursday mean the total number of UK troops killed while on operations in Afghanistan since 2001 has risen to 73 .
Fifty have been killed in action .
The Royal Anglians , which have been based at Pirbright in Surrey for about five years , have been one of the regiments hardest hit by the fighting in Afghanistan .
There has now been a total of nine soldiers killed from the regiment .
It is one of the worst casualty rates since Operation Herrick , the campaign in Afghanistan , began in 2001 .
On 11 August the regiment 's Captain David Hicks was killed during an attack by the Taleban on his patrol base northeast of Sangin in Helmand province .
The regimental headquarters of the Royal Anglians is in Bury St Edmunds .
The regiment recruits mainly from the counties of Essex , Suffolk , Cambridgeshire and Norfolk .
One of the most bizarre objects in the Solar System has got to be Saturn ’s moon Hyperion .
From the pictures taken by Cassini , this tiny moon looks like a sponge you might buy at the Body Shop .
In a new research paper appearing in the July 5 issue of the journal Nature , scientists have mapped the surface of Hyperion , and found hydrocarbons , some of the building blocks of life .
And they also think they know why it has such a bizarre look .
The information was gathered by Cassini ’s ultraviolet imaging spectrograph and visual and infrared mapping spectrometer .
These two instruments are able to map mineral and chemical constituents of a surface .
In this case , the surface of Hyperion .
It found that most of the surface is a mix of frozen water and organic dust , as well as trace amounts of frozen carbon dioxide .
But the key discovery are these hydrocarbons ; combinations of carbon and hydrogen atoms .
When these molecules are embedded in ice and then exposed to ultraviolet radiation , new complex molecules can form that are present in life .
In addition to the surface analysis , Cassini also helped scientists work out why the moon has such a bizarre spongy appearance .
It all comes down to an extremely low density .
According to new calculations , the moon has only half the density of water .
Its low gravity means that normal processes , such as crater formation work differently than on more dense objects in the Solar System .
Objects that impact Hyperion plunge in , compressing the surface instead of blasting out the familiar looking craters .

A couple of wild nights in casinos are undoubtedly one of the best things that could happen to you if you ’re on a vacation .
I suggest you dress up for the occasion .
When you are making an appearance in a casino , a place that is as an extravagant and luxurious , you should make sure that you are dressed in a classy manner .
It is incredibly fun and entertaining if you walk into a casino with a mindset that you are ready to spend a couple hundred dollars to have some fun .
You will definitely find some of the best - tasting drinks and also world - class meals , in Las Vegas casinos .
You should make sure that you are responsible for your finances and also that you have a specified bankroll when you walk in .
You should also know what to expect when you walk in , because there are certain dress codes that you should be following .
The security guards will stop you if you are not dressed for the occasion .
If you are a male human being , it is actually quite simple free to dress .
All you need is a good shirt , a pair of pants and some nice shoes .
If you are in the mood , you can go ahead and wear a blazer .
You should be dressed formal , only if you are entering the formal dining rooms or the formal poker tables .
I have seen a lot of individuals walk in with a pair of shorts and a tank top , and I have also seen them get kicked out by casino security .
I ’m sure you do n’t not need that kind of humiliation on the casino floor .
I do n’t think that you should put too much thought into dressing , when you have something that works .
You should dress to impress , when you walk into a casino .
It should be a decent attire that is not provocative or inappropriate .
You can actually take some time to decide what you are going to adorn yourself with .
It should be something that would go with any occasion .
I highly suggest you check with the casino website , before you walk inside .
Most of the casinos will have some very strict rules as to their dress codes and also the age of entry .
It would interest you to know that the age of entry would be 21 years old .
If you are found to be less than 21 years of age , you will be asked to leave , or authorities will be called .
When and if you are denied entrance into a casino , I suggest you not force the security guards to let you inside , because they are not letting you in for a reason .
WARSAW ( Reuters ) - A prominent Polish cleric known for preaching against communism and for his anti-Semitic remarks said on Tuesday he planned to launch perfumes , clothing and cafes branded with his image .
Father Henryk Jankowski took part in strikes which led to the end of communism in 1989 as part of Solidarity movement .
He was later suspended from preaching for a year after insulting remarks about Jews .
Setting out his plans , Jankowski told the daily Dziennik newspaper that his initiative would “ do everyone good . ”
“ I am for it as long as it serves a good purpose .
If necessary I will also sing and dance , ” he said .
The money from the initiative would go to the “ Father Henryk Jankowski Institute , ” which says it supports charities and social projects .
Jankowski , who already has a wine branded with his image under the name “ Monsignore , ” said he would be on the panel for “ castings ” of waitresses for the 16 cafes he plans to open in major Polish cities .
Jankowski is admired by many Catholics for his role in supporting Solidarity .
Duck Hunt Created : 04/03/2007 | Updated : 11/10/2008 | By : Staff | Comments
Instructions : Move Fire History : Released in 1984 by Nintendo , Duck Hunt was one of the first games on the NES platform to use the ' light gun ' .
Gameplay :
The basic idea of this game is pretty simple - you 're a duck hunter armed with a pistol and your trusty dog .
You might have noticed that the version of Duck Hunt on this page has been modified .
There 's still the standard 1 or 2 ducks option ( Game A and Game B ) where you have three shots to shoot one or two ducks each round .
But there 's also a Game D called Dogs .
Game D is just wrong .
There 's a field of dogs running around in front of you and you are holding a machine gun .
Regardless of what game option you decide to play , you probably will want to turn on the MOUSE option .
It will make your game play much easier .
Features :
By the way , the sound effects are pretty much what you 'd expect for a game from the early 1980s - that is , awful by today 's standards - game play and graphics are simple - but it remains a classic and is fun to play every once in a while .
Enjoy !
NERD NOTE : Duck
Hunt was one of the two original pack - in titles for the first release of the game system ( the other was Gyromite ) .
The game was not often reviewed , but given positive reviews from players of the game .
Prior to the NES version , Nintendo had also made a Duck hunt game based on Laser Clay Shooting System , which was released in 1976 .
The CIA has received secret presidential approval to mount a covert " black " operation to destabilize the Iranian government , current and former officials in the intelligence community tell the Blotter on ABCNews.com .
The sources , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject , say President Bush has signed a " nonlethal presidential finding " that puts into motion a CIA plan that reportedly includes a coordinated campaign of propaganda , disinformation and manipulation of Iran 's currency and international financial transactions .
" I can't confirm or deny whether such a program exists or whether the president signed it , but it would be consistent with an overall American approach trying to find ways to put pressure on the regime , " said Bruce Riedel , a recently retired CIA senior official who dealt with Iran and other countries in the region .
A National Security Council spokesperson , Gordon Johndroe , said , " The White House does not comment on intelligence matters . "
A CIA spokesperson said , " As a matter of course , we do not comment on allegations of covert activity . "
The sources say the CIA developed the covert plan over the last year and received approval from White House officials and other officials in the intelligence community .
Officials say the covert plan is designed to pressure Iran to stop its nuclear enrichment program and end aid to insurgents in Iraq .
" There are some channels where the United States government may want to do things without its hand showing , and legally , therefore , the administration would , if it 's doing that , need an intelligence finding and would need to tell the Congress , " said ABC News consultant Richard Clarke , a former White House counterterrorism official .
Current and former intelligence officials say the approval of the covert action means the Bush administration , for the time being , has decided not to pursue a military option against Iran .
" Vice President Cheney helped to lead the side favoring a military strike , " said former CIA official Riedel , " but I think they have come to the conclusion that a military strike has more downsides than upsides . "
The covert action plan comes as U.S. officials have confirmed Iran had dramatically increased its ability to produce nuclear weapons material , at a pace that experts said would give them the ability to build a nuclear bomb in two years .
Riedel says economic pressure on Iran may be the most effective tool available to the CIA , particularly in going after secret accounts used to fund the nuclear program .
" The kind of dealings that the Iranian Revolution Guards are going to do , in terms of purchasing nuclear and missile components , are likely to be extremely secret , and you 're going to have to work very , very hard to find them , and that 's exactly the kind of thing the CIA 's nonproliferation center and others would be expert at trying to look into , " Riedel said .
Under the law , the CIA needs an official presidential finding to carry out such covert actions .
The CIA is permitted to mount covert " collection " operations without a presidential finding .
" Presidential findings " are kept secret but reported to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and other key congressional leaders .
The " nonlethal " aspect of the presidential finding means CIA officers may not use deadly force in carrying out the secret operations against Iran .

Still , some fear that even a nonlethal covert CIA program carries great risks .
" I think everybody in the region knows that there is a proxy war already afoot with the United States supporting anti-Iranian elements in the region as well as opposition groups within Iran , " said Vali Nasr , adjunct senior fellow for Mideast studies at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" And this covert action is now being escalated by the new U.S. directive , and that can very quickly lead to Iranian retaliation and a cycle of escalation can follow , " Nasr said .
Other " lethal " findings have authorized CIA covert actions against al Qaeda , terrorism and nuclear proliferation .
Also briefed on the CIA proposal , according to intelligence sources , were National Security Advisor Steve Hadley and Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams .
" The entire plan has been blessed by Abrams , in particular , " said one intelligence source familiar with the plan .
" And Hadley had to put his chop on it . "
Abrams ' last involvement with attempting to destabilize a foreign government led to criminal charges .
He pleaded guilty in October 1991 to two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress about the Reagan administration 's ill - fated efforts to destabilize the Nicaraguan Sandinista government in Central America , known as the Iran - Contra affair .
Abrams was later pardoned by President George H. W. Bush in December 1992 .
In June 2001 , Abrams was named by then National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to head the National Security Council 's office for democracy , human rights and international operations .
On Feb. 2 , 2005 , National Security Advisor Hadley appointed Abrams deputy assistant to the president and deputy national security advisor for global democracy strategy , one of the nation 's most senior national security positions .
As earlier reported on the Blotter on ABCNews.com , the United States has supported and encouraged an Iranian militant group , Jundullah , that has conducted deadly raids inside Iran from bases on the rugged Iran - Pakistan - Afghanistan " tri-border region . "
U.S. officials deny any " direct funding " of Jundullah groups but say the leader of Jundullah was in regular contact with U.S. officials .
American intelligence sources say Jundullah has received money and weapons through the Afghanistan and Pakistan military and Pakistan 's intelligence service .
Pakistan has officially denied any connection .
A report broadcast on Iranian TV last Sunday said Iranian authorities had captured 10 men crossing the border with $ 500,000 in cash along with " maps of sensitive areas " and " modern spy equipment . "
A senior Pakistani official told ABCNews.com the 10 men were members of Jundullah .
The leader of the Jundullah group , according to the Pakistani official , has been recruiting and training " hundreds of men " for " unspecified missions " across the border in Iran .

Mr Cheney said the US wanted to send Iran a clear message
Mr Cheney said the United States and the international community could not stand by as a " terror - supporting state " fulfilled its grandest ambitions .
He accused Tehran of practising delay and deception to buy time to pursue nuclear technology and of being an obstacle to peace in the Middle East .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes , not bomb - making .
The five permanent UN Security Council members and Germany will decide in November whether to impose tougher UN sanctions on Iran for continuing to enrich uranium .
' Delay and deception '
" The Security Council has twice imposed sanctions on Iran and called on the regime to cease enriching uranium , " Mr Cheney said in a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on Sunday .
The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course , the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences
US Vice - President Dick Cheney
" Yet the regime continues to do so and continues to practice delay and deception in an obvious attempt to buy time . "
Given the nature of Iran 's rulers and the trouble it is causing in the Middle East , Mr Cheney said , the US and other nations could not " stand by as a terror - supporting state fulfils its most aggressive ambitions " .
" The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course , the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences , " he added .
" The United States joins other nations in sending a clear message - we will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . "
There has been an escalation of criticism of Iran by the US administration over the past few weeks , the BBC's Sarah Morris in Washington says .
Last week , President George W Bush warned that a nuclear Iran could lead to another world war .
Mr Cheney 's speech comes a day after the resignation of top Iran nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani .
Correspondents say his departure is a sign that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's tougher stance towards the West may be gaining influence within Iran .

It ’s Nam — Again !

I recently read about a condition psychiatrists call " jamais vu . "
That ’s where one sees something very familiar , but the brain cannot identify it .
It ’s the opposite of " déjà vu . "
Both the White House and US military seemed gripped by " jamais vu . "
Many of the same political and military mistakes the United States made in the Vietnam War are being repeated in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But neither the White House , Pentagon , nor US field commanders seem to understand they are repeating errors from the past .
Today ’s much ballyhooed testimony to Congress by Gen. David Petraeus , commander of US forces in Iraq , will report the " progress " his troops are making in Iraq as part of the so - called " Surge " strategy .
This lame idea , worthy of World War I thinking , was developed by one of America ’s dimmer military minds , retired general Jack Keene , and sold to President George Bush .
Petraeus will tell Congress that despite serious problems , including Iraq ’s useless government , the US still needs to keep most of the current 170,000 US troops in Iraq , and hint at some minor , brigade - sized future troop reductions in the future .
" There ’s light at the end of the Iraq tunnel , " will be Petraeus ’ message .
The report will speak of important security successes in Baghdad and restive Anbar Province , where the US occupation has been bribing local sheiks with very large amounts of cash .
One can rent loyalty , but never buy it .
Gen .
Petraeus is a very smart , well - respected commander , but one suspects his report will unfortunately be the latest example of " jamais vu " syndrome .
And one heartily wishes that the general had the courage to stand up and tell Congress that his men were being killed and wounded in a war that has already been lost .
That wo n’t happen because US officers are taught to be relentlessly optimistic and toe the political party line .
American commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan keep proudly reporting how their men have occupied villages or towns , killed scores of " suspected terrorists " ( usually thanks to air attack ) , and forced the enemy to flee .
They issue glowing reports about the numbers of Baghdad neighborhoods they have pacified .
They do not seem to understand they are fighting a fluid guerrilla war in which territory and body counts mean very little .
Mao Zedong perfectly described the principles of such guerilla war : “ When the enemy advances , withdraw ; when he stops , harass ; when he tires , strike ; when he retreats , pursue . ”
The " successes " being reported from Iraq and Afghanistan are illusory .
We heard exactly the same story during the Vietnam War , when US military spokesmen trumpeted glowing daily reports about enemy body counts , strategic hamlets created , Vietcong tunnels blown up , hearts and minds won over , and smiling children waving little American flags .
While the US was " winning " all these little daily battles , Communists were winning the war .
Institutional memory rarely exceeds ten years .
Most of Vietnam ’s bitter lessons have been totally forgotten .
Guerilla wars are fought not for territory but for control of civilian populations .
Recent polls show that 80 % of Iraqis want US forces out .
Once again , US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have been sent into no -win wars by their poorly informed , badly advised civilian masters , and ordered to keep coming up with rosy progress reports , then blamed when these pointless wars are lost .
I have covered numerous guerilla wars in Africa , Central America and Asia in my time and have never seen western powers win a single one .
Yet Americans keep forgetting this hard lesson , and the great Gen. Douglas MacArthur ’s warning after the bloody Korean War , " never fight a land war in Asia . "
Petraeus ’s testimony is far more about US domestic politics than war in Iraq .
It is a key weapon in the game of political chicken President George Bush is playing with the Democratic - controlled Congress , which wants to withdraw US forces from Iraq in accordance with the wishes of a majority of Americans .
But Bush appears determined to keep the war going until his term expires so as to avoid blame for defeat in Iraq .
Congress is trying to lay all the blame for the war on Bush , get him to admit defeat , and evade its own shameful role in authorizing the trumped - up Iraq War .
But Congress is in a jam .
If US troops do withdraw , Iraq may fall into even worse chaos than it now suffers — which the next president , who polls suggest will be a Democrat — will inherit .
In an election year , Republicans will blast Democrats as " defeatists " for " cutting and running " and " losing Iraq . "
That ’s why worried leading Democrats are now backing off calls for total withdrawal and mumbling about partial pullbacks and " training Iraqi forces . "
Meanwhile , the administration keeps up the pretense there is a functioning government in Baghdad .
Washington refuses to admit Iraq has no real national government or army , and is an anarchic stew of competing Shia militias , tribal chiefs , death squads , a score of Sunni resistance groups , and Kurdish separatists who want their own independent state .
Iran is becoming the real power in eastern Iraq , and particularly so now that British troops are pulling out of the Basra region .
Iran ’s intelligence agency already pretty much controls one of the two main Shia parties and its militia , the Badr Brigades .
The US occupation is largely responsible for unleashing Shia ethnic cleansing that has created four million Iraqi refugees .
By using Shia death squads and militias to attack Sunni resistance forces , Washington poured gasoline on Iraq ’s ethnic fires .
History does not repeat itself , but men ’s mistakes and follies do .
The latest somber example is Iraq , where our memory of Vietnam is …" jamais vu . "

Arnold Schwarzenegger is n't as much fun as a Governor as he was in The Terminator ... just ask California 's teen drivers .
The former action movie star has signed a new bill -- which we told you about in August -- into law , making it illegal for anyone aged 16 or 17 to use a mobile phone , pager , laptop , or handheld computer while driving a vehicle .
Effective July 1 , 2008 ( the same day that California 's ban on non -hands - free mobile - use while driving takes effect ) , the state will begin to fine offenders $ 20 for their first incident , and $ 50 for each recurrent violation .
The law is targeting teen drivers due to the wealth of statistics that demonstrate young motorists are more likely to end up in car accidents which result in death .
According to reports , 13.6 - percent of all fatal accidents are caused by teenagers , and studies show that car crashes are the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 16 - 19 .
" The simple fact is that teenage drivers are more easily distracted , " said Schwarzenegger in a statement , adding , " We want to eliminate any extra distractions so they can focus on paying attention to the road and being good drivers . "
He then paused and remarked , " We just do n't want to say ' Hasta la vista , baby ' to young drivers anymore . "

ALBANY  Following in the footsteps of Connecticut 's Legislature , New York State lawmakers are expected to approve legislation allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes .
The Democrat - led Assembly could pass a medical marijuana bill as early as this week , according to the bill 's main sponsor .
The Republican - led Senate is expected to follow suit , lawmakers said .
It 's not clear if Governor Spitzer would support the bill .
As a candidate last year , Mr. Spitzer said he was opposed to the legalization of medical marijuana , but a spokeswoman for the governor indicated yesterday that he has not ruled out signing such a bill .
" We know that the issue is being discussed by the Legislature and a variety of proposals have been discussed , " a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer , Christine Anderson , said via e-mail .
" If they pass a bill , we 'll obviously take a look at it . "
Governor Rell of Connecticut , who is considering a medical marijuana bill that lawmakers sent to her desk earlier this month , has also given mixed signals about her position .
She has said it 's important to help seriously ill people alleviate their pain , but has expressed fear that legalizing the drug would undermine the message that recreational use of marijuana is dangerous .
New York would be the 13th state to approve a medical marijuana program and the fifth state to approve the use of the substance through legislative action .
Eight states have permitted medical marijuana by voter referendum .
In 2005 , New York lawmakers came close to approving a medical marijuana law .
They backed off after the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government can prohibit doctors from prescribing the drug .
Since the ruling , states have increasingly reasserted their right to permit use of the drug under certain conditions .
New York is moving closer to legalizing medical marijuana at a time when the movement appears to be gaining momentum .
In the last two months , in addition to the legislative action in Connecticut , New Mexico became the 12th state to legalize medical marijuana ; Vermont lawmakers voted to broaden their program , and Rhode Island lawmakers passed a bill making the state 's medical marijuana law permanent , and are expected to override Governor Carcieri 's veto .
" The issue has just started to reach critical mass , " a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project , Bruce Mirken , said .
" There 's a growing awareness among politicians that 's it 's not a scary issue . "
The bill introduced in the Assembly is similar to Rhode Island 's law .
It would allow the possession of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and up to 12 plants by a certified patient or designated caregiver .
Patients would be barred from purchasing marijuana and smoking it in public places .
A doctor could certify the use of marijuana for up to one - year intervals to a patient suffering from a life - threatening condition .
The doctor could certify the drug only if he or she believed that it would be more effective than other drugs .
Critics of medical marijuana say the dangers of using the drug outweigh any medical benefits .
Opponents also argue that there are available legal medicines that could offer similar relief .
There is a fear among some critics that legalizing the drug would make it easily available to people who are not authorized to use it and would make the drug seem safe .
" I think it 's wrong , " the chairman of the Conservative Party of New York , Michael Long , said .
" I do n't think there 's any way to keep track of what 's going on .
Who 's to say that marijuana is not being picked up by teenagers in the house ? "
Supporters contend that marijuana can offer relief to people suffering from cancer , glaucoma , AIDS , Crohn 's disease , hepatitis -C , and multiple sclerosis .
The prohibition , they say , has n't stopped sick people from seeking the drug but has driven up the cost , meaning they have to spend hundreds of dollars to obtain just one ounce .
They also argue that the drug is especially beneficial to sick people who do n't respond well to other medication and that smoking the plant is more effective than taking the synthetic and legal pill version made with THC , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana .
" It 's humane , and it 's good medicine , " a Democratic assemblyman of Manhattan who is the lead sponsor of the bill in the chamber , Richard Gottfried , said .
" There are thousands of New Yorkers who suffer from serious medical conditions who could have a better quality and longer life . "
A Senate Republican who in previous years has sponsored medical marijuana bills in the chamber , Vincent Leibell , said he 's optimistic that the house would back a marijuana bill , although one with a different wording from the Assembly version .
" I believe there 's support there , " he said .
Mr. Leibell said it 's likely that he would put forward a bill when the Assembly votes on its version .
The Senate majority leader , Joseph Bruno , who is a survivor of prostate cancer , has said he supports legalizing marijuana .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - More than 73,000 General Motors Corp workers walked off the job on Monday after marathon contract talks between the United Auto Workers union and GM stalled and the union called the first national strike since 1970 against the top U.S. automaker .
The strike marked an unexpected twist to the 10 - week round of contract talks seen as crucial to GM ’s survival as it restructures its loss - making U.S. operations and seeks to cut itself free from a health care obligation of over $ 50 billion .
Analysts said the automaker could ride out a short work stoppage with many predicting the two sides would still settle on a deal on wages and benefits that delivers many of the sweeping concessions GM has sought .
But the economic and political impact from the UAW - ordered shutdown of over 80 GM facilities across the United States was immediate .
The White House urged both sides to stay at the bargaining table .
The Teamsters union said it would honor the strike by not hauling GM vehicles for the duration of the walkout .
By Monday afternoon , the strike had already cost GM roughly 4,000 vehicles in lost production , according an estimate by CSM Worldwide , auto industry tracking company .
A protracted strike could force GM to burn through $ 8 billion a month , Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said .
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger , regarded as a pragmatist willing to break with the union ’s past practices , said GM had pushed the union into striking by not showing a willingness to meet it halfway on crucial issues such as job security .
“ You can be pushed off a cliff and that ’s what happened here , ” Gettelfinger said , speaking to reporters at a news conference at the union ’s Detroit headquarters .
The UAW and GM resumed negotiations on Monday afternoon , marking 21 days of unbroken contract talks between the two sides .
GM said it was “ disappointed ” in the UAW ’s decision to strike and wanted to reach a deal .
“ The bargaining involves complex , difficult issues that affect the job security of our U.S. work force and the long - term viability of the company , ” GM said in a statement .
WHO BLINKS FIRST ?
GM stock , which had traded sharply higher before the UAW strike , closed down 20 cents to $ 34.74 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday .
The shares have traded in a 52 - week range of $ 38.66 to $ 28.49 .
Many analysts said both GM and its major union had been weakened by the U.S. auto industry ’s long - running decline -- making it doubtful either side has the stomach for a protracted strike .
“ This could be a short - term impasse , or it could go on for a really long time and really be a serious blow , particularly to the union , ” said David Cole , chairman for the Ann Arbor , Michigan - based Center for Automotive Research .
GM , Ford and Chrysler are seeking concessions from the UAW to close a labor cost gap with Toyota Motor Corp and other Japanese automakers operating in the United States they say amounts to more than $ 30 per hour for the average worker .

Unless GM gets substantial concessions from the UAW , it could be forced to shut more of its U.S. plants and accelerate a restructuring that has already cut 34,000 UAW workers from its payroll in the past year , Cole said .
“ If there is no contract , there is no obligation .
It ’s an extremely dangerous gamble , ” he said .
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brett Hoselton said a short strike and the accompanying lost wages could soften up the UAW rank and file “ to accept more concessions , not fewer . ”
Negotiations between GM and the UAW included a GM proposal to cut its health - care costs by establishing a trust fund for retiree - related costs .

Under that plan , GM would shift responsibility for retiree health care to a new UAW - aligned trust fund known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association , or VEBA .
Wall Street analysts have said establishing a VEBA could cut GM ’s annual costs by $ 3 billion in exchange for a one - off payment expected to top $ 30 billion .
Gettelfinger said the UAW was “ more than willing ” to reach a VEBA deal with GM .
The problem , he said , was that GM had not closed the gap with the union on other issues such as wages , benefits and profit - sharing .
“ We are ready to go in and wrap up these negotiations , ” he told reporters , adding that the union would not call off its strike until it had a labor deal .
Expectations for a cost - cutting labor deal drove GM shares up almost 14 percent this month before Monday ’s trading .
The outcome of this round of talks is seen as crucial to efforts by the three Detroit - based automakers -- GM , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC -- to recover from combined losses of $ 15 billion last year and sales difficulties that have driven their share of the U.S. market below 50 percent .
By Monday afternoon , workers at GM factories across the United States were picketing with signs reading “ UAW on Strike ” and “ Hands Off My Pension . ”
A majority of GM ’s 73,000 UAW - represented workers would have to ratify any deal .
The last UAW strike against GM was in 1998 .
That walkout at two GM parts plants in Flint , Michigan , shut down GM production and caused sales to plummet .
The UAW has not called a national strike during contract negotiations since 1976 .
The last national strike against GM was in 1970 when the union won a pension guarantee for workers with 30 years of seniority .
Mathematicians vs. Cryptographers
Neal Koblitz publishes what is , honestly , a rant about the cryptography field .
The interesting part to me is when he talks about the uneasy relationship between mathematicians and cryptographers .
Cryptographers , he says , toss the term “ provable security ” around much too often , publish inconsequential papers far too often , and are generally sloppy about their research .
I ca n’t say I disagree with any of that .
Cryptographers come either from mathematics or computer science .
The former — like Koblitz — are far more rigorous than the latter , but the latter tend to come up with much more practical systems .

9/11 families outraged at insurance company 's ' evil eyes ' ad
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
Fox News reported on Monday that " a number of 9/11 families are upset " by an insurance company ad being run in the New York subways .
The ad shows the phrases " there 's another side of risk ... welcome to the upside ... risk makes the world go round " superimposed over a face whose eyes show two small vertical reflections of the photographer 's lights .
One 9/11 family member took the reflections as a deliberate image of the twin towers , calling it " irresponsible and despicable . "
However , the insurance company running the ad , which " lost 298 employees on 9/11 , " denies that the image was intentional .
The Fox hosts disagreed about the reflections , finally asking their viewers , " What do you think ?
Do you think it looks like the twin towers or do you think it looks like a couple of lightbulbs ? "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on June 11 .
Influential political forces on both sides of the Atlantic appear intent on starting a debate about whether or not to " contain " Russia .
The mere posing of the question suggests that for some almost nothing has changed since the Cold War .
What is a return to containment meant to achieve at a time when Russia has abandoned ideology and imperial aspirations in favor of pragmatism and common sense ?
What is the purpose of containing a country that is successfully developing and thereby naturally strengthening its international position ?
What is the point of containing a country that aspires to things as basic as international trade ?
It should be no surprise that Russia today is making use of its natural competitive advantages .
It is also investing in its human resources , encouraging innovation , integrating into the global economy , and modernizing its legislation .
Russia wants international stability to underpin its own development .
Accordingly , it is working toward the establishment of a freer and more democratic international order .
The new advocacy of containment may stem from a substantial gap between Russian and U.S. aspirations .
U.S. diplomacy seeks to transform what Washington considers " nondemocratic " govern - ments around the world , reordering entire regions in the process .
Russia , with its experience with revolution and extremism , cannot subscribe to any such ideologically driven project , especially one that comes from abroad .
The Cold War represented a step away from the Westphalian standard of state sovereignty , which placed values beyond the scope of intergovernmental relations .
A return to Cold War theories such as containment will only lead to confrontation .
In contrast to the Soviet Union , Russia is an open country that does not erect walls , either physical or political .
On the contrary , Russia calls for the removal of visa barriers and other artificial hurdles in international relations .
It espouses democracy and market economics as the right bases for social and political order and economic life .
Although Russia has a long way to go , it has chosen a path of development that entails unprecedented , and at times painful , changes .
Russian society has reached a broad consensus that these changes should be evolutionary and free of upheavals .
Ultimately , a mature democracy , with a vibrant civil society and a well - structured party system , will emerge from a higher level of social and economic development .
This requires a substantial middle class , which cannot come into being overnight .
It was only Russian tycoons who emerged overnight in the early 1990s – and those times are definitely over .
Frictional Energy
Countries dependent on external sources of energy criticize Russia for assuming its naturally large role in the global energy sector .
However , those countries should recognize that energy dependence is reciprocal , since hoarding is not a wise choice for an energy exporting country .
That is why Russia has never failed to fulfill any of its hydrocarbon - supply contracts with importing countries .
Russia does , however , consider energy to be a strategic sector that helps safeguard independence in its foreign relations .
This is understandable given the negative external reactions to Russia ’s strengthened economy and enlarged role in international affairs , in which Russia lawfully employs its newly gained freedom of action and speech .
It should not be criticized by those who frown on a stronger Russia .
The Russian government ’s energy policy reflects a global trend toward state control over natural resources .
Ninety percent of the world ’s proven hydrocarbon reserves are under some form of state control .
Such state control of energy resources is offset , however , by the concentration of cutting - edge technology in the hands of private transnational corporations .
Thus , there are incentives for cooperation between the parties , with each sharing the same objective of meeting the energy requirements of the world economy .
Russia is pursuing a foreign policy in striking contrast to the ideologically motivated internationalism of the Soviet Union .
Today , Russia believes that multilateral diplomacy based on international law should manage regional and global relations .
As globalization has extended beyond the West , competition has become truly global – nothing less than a paradigm shift .
Competing states must now take into account differing values and development patterns .
The challenge is to establish fairness in this complex competitive environment .
The logical approach is for countries to focus on their competitive advantages without imposing their values on others .
U.S. attempts to do the latter have weakened the West ’s competitive position .
As Eberhard Sandschneider , director of the Research Institute of the German Society for Foreign Policy , has put it , U.S. policies in recent years have " damaged tremendously the image of the West " in Asia and Africa .
He concludes that nothing , or almost nothing , has been done to make Western values attractive to Asian and African populations .
Russia can hardly be held responsible for that .
In his speech in Munich earlier this year , Russian President Vladimir Putin stated the obvious when he said that a " unipolar world " had failed to materialize .
Recent experience shows as clearly as ever that no state or group of states possesses sufficient resources to impose its will on the world .
Hierarchy might seem attractive to some in global affairs , but it is utterly unrealistic .
It is one thing to respect American culture and civilization ; it is another to embrace Americo - centrism .
The new international system has not one but several leading actors , and their collective leadership is needed to manage global relations .
This multipolarity encourages network diplomacy as the best way for states to achieve shared objectives .
In this system , the United Nations becomes pivotal , providing through its charter the means for collective discussion and action .
The Limits Of Force
In the twenty - first century , delay in solving accumulated problems carries devastating consequences for all nations .
One sure lesson is that unilateral responses , consisting primarily of using force , result in stalemates and broken china everywhere .
The current catalog of unresolved crises – Iraq , Iran , Lebanon , Darfur , North Korea – is a testament to that .
Genuine security will only be achieved through establishing normal relations and engaging in dialogue .
German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier hit the right note when he counseled that today ’s world should be based on cooperation rather than military deterrence .
Complex problems require comprehensive approaches .
In the case of Iran , resolving differences should lie in the normalization by all countries of their relations with Tehran .
Normalization would also help preserve the nuclear nonproliferation regime .
Regarding Kosovo , independence from Serbia would create a precedent that goes beyond the existing norms of international law .
Our partners ’ inclination to give way to the blackmail of violence and anarchy within Kosovo contrasts with the indifference shown to similar violence and anarchy in the Palestinian territories , where it has been tolerated for decades while a Palestinian state has yet to be established .
Eliminating the Cold War legacy in Europe , where the containment policy was dominant for too long , is especially pressing .
Creating division in Europe encourages nationalist sentiments that threaten the unity of the continent .
The current problems faced by the European Union , in particular , and European politics , in general , cannot be solved without Europe ’s maintaining constructive and future - oriented relations with Russia – relations based on mutual trust and confidence .
This ought to be seen as serving U.S. interests as well .
Instead , various attempts are being made to contain Russia , including through the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in violation of previous assurances given to Moscow .
Today , supporters of NATO enlargement harp on the organization ’s supposed role in the promotion of democracy .
How is democracy furthered by a military - political alliance that is producing scenarios for the use of force ?
Meanwhile , some are promoting the extension of NATO membership to the countries that comprise the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) as some sort of pass providing admittance to the club of democratic states whether these countries meet the democratic test or not .
One cannot help wondering whether this initiative is being pursued for the sake of moral satisfaction or again to contain Russia .
As far as the CIS is concerned , Russia has the capacity to maintain social , economic , and other forms of stability in the region .
Moscow ’s rejection of politicized trade and economic relations and its adoption of market - based principles testifies to its determination to have normalcy in interstate relations .
Russia and the West can cooperate in this region but only by forsaking zero - sum power games .
The drive to place missile defenses in eastern Europe is evidence of the U.S. effort to contain Russia .
It is hardly coincidental that this installation would fit into the U.S. global missile defense system that is deployed along Russia ’s perimeter .
Many Europeans are rightfully concerned that stationing elements of the U.S. missile defense system in Europe would undermine disarmament processes .
For its part , Russia considers the initiative a strategic challenge that requires a strategic response .
President Putin ’s offer to allow joint usage of the Gabala radar base in Azerbaijan , instead of those eastern European installations – as well as his proposal , made when meeting with President George W.Bush in Kennebunkport , Maine , in July , to create a regional monitoring and early warning system – provides a brilliant opportunity to find a way out of the present situation with the dignity of all parties intact .
As a starting point for a truly collective effort in this area , Russia is willing to take part , together with the United States and others , in a joint analysis of potential missile threats up to the year 2020 .
The desire to contain Russia clearly manifests itself as well in the situation surrounding the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ( or CFE Treaty ) .
Russia complies with the treaty in good faith and insists only on the one thing that the treaty promises : equal security .
However , the equal security principle was compromised with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact ; meanwhile , NATO was left intact and then enlarged .
In the meantime , attempts to correct the situation have come up against the refusal of NATO member countries to ratify the modernization of the treaty under various unrelated pretexts that have no legal justification and are entirely political .
The lesson to be drawn from the CFE Treaty stalemate is that any element of global or European security architecture that is not based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit will not prove to be sustainable .
After all , if we cannot adapt this old instrument to the new realities , is it not time to review the situation and start developing a new system of arms control and confidence - building measures , if we find that Europe needs one ?
Here again , frank discussion at Kennebunkport gave hope that there is way to move toward putting into force the adapted treaty .
Beyond The Cold War
It is time to bury the Cold War legacy and establish structures that meet the imperatives of this era – particularly since Russia and the West are no longer adversaries and do not wish to create the impression that war is still a possibility in Europe .
The path to trust lies through candid dialogue and reasoned debate , as well as interactions based on the joint analysis of threats .
At the moment , however , without reasonable grounds , Russia is excluded from such joint analysis .
Instead , it is urged to believe in the analytic abilities and good intentions of its partners .
Russians do not suffer from a sense of exceptionalism , but neither do they consider their analytic abilities and ideas inferior to those of others .
Russia will respond to safeguard its national security , and in doing so will be guided by the principle of " reasonable sufficiency . "
Meanwhile , it will always keep the door open for positive joint action to safeguard common interests on the basis of equality .
This is the only serious approach to national security concerns .
In his speech in Munich , President Putin invited all of Russia ’s partners to start a serious and substantive discussion of the current status of international affairs , which is far from satisfactory .
Russia is convinced that a friend / enemy attitude toward it should be a thing of the past .
If efforts are being undertaken to " counter Russia ’s negative behavior , " how can Russia be expected to cooperate in areas of interest to its partners ?
One has to choose between containment and cooperation .
This is relevant to Russia ’s accession to the World Trade Organization and the Asian Development Bank and to the unwarranted continuance of the 1970s Jackson - Vanik amendment , which denies Russia permanent normal trading relations with the United States .
U.S. - Russian relations still enjoy the stabilizing benefits of a close and honest working relationship between President Putin and President Bush .
Both countries and both peoples share the memory of their joint victory over fascism and their joint exit from the Cold War , which unites them in its own right .
Should equal partnership prevail in U.S. - Russian relations , very little will be impossible for the two nations to achieve .
The challenges are many – the struggle against international terrorism ; organized crime and drug trafficking ; the search for realistic climate protection ; the development of nuclear energy while strengthening nonproliferation efforts ; the pursuit of global energy security ; and the exploration of outer space .
Practical cooperation on these and other challenges should not be sacrificed on the altar of renewed containment .
At present , anti-Americanism is not as widespread in Russia as it is elsewhere .
But a return to containment , and the bloc - based thinking that accompanies it , could trigger mutual alienation between Americans and Russians .
The strains evident in the U.S. - Russian relationship call for a high - level working group charged with finding ways to further cooperation .
The presidents of Russia and the United States support the idea of such a group , headed by the former statesmen Henry Kissinger and Yevgeny Primakov .
Both sides should demonstrate a broad - minded and unbiased vision , one that represents Russia and the United States as two branches of European civilization .
Russia , the United States , and the European Union should work together to preserve the integrity of the Euro - Atlantic space in global politics .
For as Jacques Delors has said , whenever this troika " is divided by differences , whenever each party plays its own game , the risk of global instability greatly increases . "
So why not stand together and act in the spirit of cooperation and fair competition on the basis of shared standards and a respect for international law ?
At the Kennebunkport meeting in July , President Putin and President Bush demonstrated what teamwork can achieve .
They agreed to look for common approaches to missile defense and strategic arms reductions , and they launched new initiatives on nuclear energy and nonproliferation .
Russia and the United States have nothing to divide them ; along with other partners , they share responsibility for the future of the world .
It is not Russia that needs to be contained ; it is those who would deprive the world of the benefits that will come from a strong U.S. - Russian partnership .
It appears Susan Collins does n't want to risk having a career ending blooper , like George " Macacca " Allen .
One of her supporters posted this today on the Maine Web Report :
Markos Moulitsas ’s hate - site The Daily Kos , the foul - mouthed fem - blog FiredogLake , and other ‘ netroots ’ extremists like MoveOn.org , have become the dominant fundraisers for Tom Allen ’s senate campaign .
This may be good news for Allen financially , but allowing these fringe fanatics to take over his campaign is creating a political atmosphere that will undoubtedly be rejected by Maine voters come next November .
Tom Allen ’s involvement with these groups , particularly his participation in the website The Daily Kos , came onto the radar screen of Maine voters recently , as national media exposed a pattern of hateful , vulgar , and anti-semitic postings on the site .
Now Allen ’s extremist friends have landed on the ground in Maine , and are engaging in the same childish bullying campaign tactics that made Connecticut voters reject their attempts to unseat Senator Joe Lieberman in 2006 .
The comments have been very interesting on MWR , especially this one :
( click the image to go to the actual comment )
Ironically this comment is still published on the site , more than 18 hours after it first appeared .
What makes that so interesting is how Daily Kos is attacked in this article for a post which was deleted within minutes after it appeared .
So is it an " extremist " position to take interest in your political party and try to get your people elected , or would it be considered " extremist " to wish for innocent Americans to die in a terrorist attack just so your party could maybe gain support ?
Perhaps Susan Collins could answer that .
And throw some cash Tom Allen 's way if you can ...
It really bothers Collins team .
Two posts by Josh Marshall take on the timing of the decision to fire U.S. Attorney Carol Lam as she was prosecuting Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham .
According to the continuing excellent coverage by McClatchy ,
In an e-mail dated May 11 , 2006 , Sampson urged the White House counsel 's office to call him regarding " the real problem we have right now with Carol Lam , " who then the U.S. attorney for southern California .
Earlier that morning , the Los Angeles Times reported that Lam 's corruption investigation of former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , R - Calif. , had expanded to include another California Republican , Rep Jerry Lewis .
Noting this , Josh Marshall writes
What people tend to overlook is that for most White House 's a US attorney involved in such a politically charged and ground - breaking corruption probe would have been untouchable , even if she 'd run her office like a madhouse and was offering free twinkies to every illegal who made it across the border .
Indeed , when you view the whole context you see that the idea she was fired for immigration enforcement is just laughable on its face .
No decision about her tenure could be made without the main issue being that investigation .
It 's like hearing that Pat Fitzgerald was fired as Plamegate prosecutor for poor deportment or because he was running up too many air miles flying back and forth from Chicago .
He also expands on the timeline - turns out , it 's not just that Lam was looking at more members of Congress , but the number three guy at the CIA was under investigation and the head of the CIA had just resigned related to the Cunningham case .
There were a ridiculous number of high - ranking Republicans being investigated for just unbelievable corruption .
Plus hookers .
And yet the hubris of this administration is such that we 're expected to believe that she just was n't doing a good enough job on immigration .
But the thing is , the traditional media was ready to accept that , and would have done so without the confluence of Talking Points Memo and other blogs , a Congress willing to investigate , and the purge victims getting pissed off enough to speak out against the lie that they had been fired for poor performance .
As Digby writes
One of the silliest conventions of modern journalism is that the press can't tell a story if " the other side " is n't screaming about it .
Republicans are always screaming ( and often are the ones feeding the scandal to the press in the first place ) so it 's very easy to find that hook .
Democrats do n't have the institutional infrastructure to successfully manufacture scandals and are often slow off the mark in seeing real ones , so the press does n't feel they have any reason to pursue them .
( And I guess stories about crass political patronage , even in the justice department , just are n't considered news anymore .
That 's a sad comment all by itself . )
There 's some great reporting coming out now on this , and a few outlets like McClatchy and some California newspapers that covered Lam's " resignation " stand out as having seen the importance of the story early on .
But , once again , most of the traditional media had no interest in making rampant Republican corruption into a story until others stepped up and forced their hand .
For those that do n't know by now , about a year and a half ago , my life changed when I decided to become a Beachbody Coach .
At first , I did n't want to become a coach .
I thought it was a total scam to be honest .
How could someone get paid and earn an income by helping other people lose weight and get in shape ?
Made no sense to me .
But as I started to lose weight , and eventually lost 55 pounds with TurboFire , I decided that I owed to to myself to become a Beachbody Coach with the sole purpose of helping other people .
October 2nd , 2012 I decided I would become a Beachbody Coach .
Quickly , I started finding success .
I was n't exactly sure what I was doing that was working , but I was smart enought to write it all out .

Film - makers Debbie Melnyk and Rick Caine repeat the same mantra to anyone who presses them about their latest film and their political leanings .
No , they insist , they are not rightwing , pro-Bush Republicans .
If anything , they are " leftwing progressives " .
But perhaps the questions are n't surprising , given that in their film Manufacturing Dissent , the Toronto - based team takes on Michael Moore , the most commercially successful documentary film - maker in history , and question not only his character and work habits , but whether he has a cavalier attitude towards documentary ethics .
With Roger & Me , Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11 , Moore has emerged as a maker of documentary blockbusters , with his features routinely taking in well over $ 100 m ( £ 50 m ) worldwide .
And while challenging Moore in documentary form is not a new thing - past efforts include Michael Moore Hates America and Celsius 41.11 , two anti-Moore screeds that toured the festival circuit to mixed reviews - these earlier projects were created by film - makers with a decidedly rightwing bent , and thus their attacks could easily be dismissed as ideological bile .
Michael Moore Hates America , Michael Wilson 's 2004 documentary feature , echoes Manufacturing Dissent , in that both films include the desperate , frustrated quest by the film - makers to get Moore to sit down for an interview .
But any similarities between the other Moore refuseniks end there .
Melnyk and Caine have been making investigative documentaries for years and attest to being enthusiastic admirers of Moore 's - until they decided to make a film about him .
Manufacturing Dissent arrives at an intriguing moment for Moore : his new film Sicko - an attack on America 's ailing healthcare system - is screening to overwhelmingly positive reviews , with even the rightwing Fox News granting it a thumbs up .
But there 's something sick about Moore 's own fact - bending film - making techniques , at least according to Manufacturing Dissent .
The idea to profile Moore came after Melnyk and Caine made Citizen Black , a 2004 feature - length examination of Conrad Black .
That film , which toured the festival circuit and was ultimately broadcast on BBC's Storyville , was filmed just as Black 's fiscal fortunes began to unravel and as he was ousted as chairman of the publishing company Hollinger .
" We had made a film about someone whose politics were very at odds with our own , " says Melnyk , " and felt like someone closer to our outlook might be good for a change . "
At first , Melnyk and Caine got some funding from a Canadian TV station and assumed their documentary would be a standard biography of Moore .
They agreed with Moore 's stance on the American - led invasion of Iraq and felt that he had been gutsy to make the antiwar speech he delivered at the 2003 Oscar ceremony , where he accepted the best documentary award for Bowling for Columbine .
They were aware that Moore had become the personification of widespread repulsion with President George W Bush and his foreign policy , especially since Fahrenheit 9/11 - Moore 's assault on the president 's post - 9/11 policies - which took the Palme D'Or at Cannes in 2004 .
But Melnyk and Caine found themselves taking a page or two out of the Moore film - making book as they continued their research .
Like the frustrated quest for an interview with General Motors ' CEO Roger Smith in Moore 's 1989 debut feature Roger & Me , Melnyk and Caine decided to structure their film around their efforts to get Moore to sit down and answer a number of troubling questions .
Roger &
Me drew critical praise for melding the personal and the political , using Moore 's apparently down - to - earth persona to draw audiences in to the film 's larger theme : that of corporate malfeasance and indifference .
The film 's central conceit was that Smith was such a heartless , appalling person , he simply would not give a frustrated Moore the time of day , let alone an interview .
( The unsuccessful interview search has become a staple of Moore 's films , a recurring stunt in which he and a small film crew show up at a company 's headquarters , only to be told by exasperated receptionists and security staff that since they do n't have an appointment , an interview will not be possible . )
Melnyk and Caine 's quest becomes eerily familiar to anyone who has watched a Moore film , with security guards and even Moore 's sister being fiercely protective of the film - maker .
Melnyk says the research process felt a " little like losing our virginity " .
Suddenly , a man they had admired for years was taking on a new and sometimes unpleasant dimension .
As they pursue their interview , they go over a series of charges against Moore , some about his character and work habits , others about his attitude towards documentary film ethics .
The result is an occasionally disturbing portrait , though at times rather scattered .
At times , former co-workers and journalists appear to suggest that Moore is egomaniacal and self - aggrandising ; others make charges far more serious , contending that Moore often injects his non-fiction films with decidedly fictionalised segments .
Some of the interview subjects are former acquaintances or colleagues of Moore , who offer up negative anecdotes about the man .
Not surprisingly , perhaps , the activist and former independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader is not wild about Moore - the film - maker supported Nader 's 2000 presidential bid but then supported Kerry in 2004 , criticising Nader for enabling Bush 's victory .
Nader argues that Moore is confused , a man led astray by people in Hollywood .
Some of the talking heads even suggest that Moore may have wanted two terms of Bush , given that he has now made millions by tapping into anti-Bush sentiments .
If Gore or Kerry had been elected , they argue , Moore would have had far less to attack and probably would have a much diminished career .
But what is most troubling are the insinuations that Moore has fabricated things to fit his larger ideological framework .
In Roger & Me , one memorable TV news clip indicated that a town hall meeting in Flint , Michigan , organised by the ABC News programme Nightline , had to be shut down after their satellite truck was stolen by an unemployed resident .
The problem ?
" This never happened , " contends Caine .
" Nightline never planned a programme there , and a truck was not stolen .
The clip was fabricated . "
If this is true , it marks a serious breach of documentary film - making principles .
If Manufacturing Dissent does come close to a smoking gun , it is in the film - makers ' contention that Moore did actually get an extended interview with Roger Smith , undermining the central premise of Roger & Me. Melnyk and Caine back up their claim by including an interview with Smith , who discusses being interviewed by Moore for Roger & Me .
While promoting Sicko , Moore was questioned about this claim , and said : " Anybody who says that is a fucking liar .
If I 'd gotten an interview with him , why would n't I put it in the film ?
Any exchange with Roger Smith would have been valuable . "
Moore goes on to say that the interview he got with Smith took place years before he made the film and that his fruitless efforts to get another interview with Smith as depicted in the final cut are genuine .
But Caine and Melnyk stand by their assertions , providing evidence in print and in testimonials that contend that Moore spoke with Smith during the period he claims he could not get an interview with the CEO .
Moore did not return requests from the Guardian for an interview about his response to Manufacturing Dissent .
Even if Caine and Melnyk 's worst - case assessments of Moore are true , there are some who would argue that they should still leave the man alone .
They point out that Moore has been an important critic of Bush and the Iraq war , during a period when the American media seemed to cower at offering any real and thorough counterpoint to the Bush administration and its policies .
Indeed , many now argue that the lead - up to the invasion of Iraq is as much about the failure of American journalists to do their jobs as it is about sabre - rattling on the part of the military , and that Moore emerged as one of the rare , valiant voices of dissent .
In other words , if a few facts get trodden on or overlooked , Moore 's hyperbolic style should be forgiven , as he is pointing to crucial truths .
" I disagree completely , " says Caine .
" Documentary film - makers and journalists must operate on a basic premise : we should expose lies , not make them .
By distorting things , Moore is actually hurting the left and handing the right a huge club to wield .
Once people see that he 's distorted so many things , it allows them to dismiss the entire argument . "
Melnyk and Caine are backed up by respected documentary film - makers in Manufacturing Dissent , including Albert Maysles ( Gimme Shelter , Grey Gardens ) and Errol Morris ( The Fog of War ) , both of whom express their reservations about Moore 's tactics .
Maysles even goes so far as to suggest that Moore might actually hate America .
And while Melnyk and Caine do n't manage to get a lengthy , sit - down interview with Moore , they do meet up with him at one point .
Melnyk asks
Moore if there might be a point when they could conduct a longer interview ; Moore responds that he is too busy on his current publicity tour - which seems a believable answer .
The meeting effectively keeps the Moore mystique alive .
He praises Melnyk for being Canadian , and then offers her a hug , one that is executed uncomfortably before his handlers shuffle him along .
Given Melnyk and Caine 's filmography , it prompts an obligatory question : who was easier to deal with as a subject , Black or Moore ?
" Actually , Conrad Black was really quite gracious and polite .
He was much easier to deal with than Michael Moore . "
Manufacturing Dissent screens tonight and tomorrow at the Edinburgh film festival .
It is released on DVD in October .

The process , called airgap , enables trillions of microscopic vacuum holes to be placed between the copper wire in chips to act as an insulator .
It solves the problem of electrical energy leaking between wires , which creates unwanted heat .
IBM says the chips will run 35 % faster and consume 15 % less energy .
The company has developed a method of controlling the interaction between self - assembling molecules , called diblock copolymers , to create the vacuum holes .
Mr Edlestein , IBM
Fellow and chief scientist of the self - assembly airgap project , said : " We have managed to harness the kinds of processes we see in nature to make regular patterns - such as the layers of enamel on your teeth , or the shape of a seashell if you look under a microscope .
The process mimics the way snowflakes are developed
While the self - assembled polymers were developed back in 2001 , it is the first time anyone has been able to produce mass quantities and integrate them into a manufacturing process with high yields .
Dr Douglas Paul , senior research associate at Cambridge University , said : " The big breakthrough is getting it into a manufacturing process and producing 300 mm diameter wafers with the process working .
" This is never easy as the yields need to be near perfect for every single process stage and there are hundreds in a full wafer to get circuits to operate with the billion transistors or so now in production . "
The controlled interaction between the molecules creates a series of evenly - spaced dots - each one only 20 - nanometres in diameter .
One nanometre is about a million times smaller than the size of a pinhead .
As they state they expect it to be in chips in 2009 it still has a bit of work to go
Dr Douglas Paul , University of Cambridge
Those dots are then etched away in a chemical process , forming holes , which are then capped to create a vacuum .
For years , chip makers have used insulators such as the oxidised form of silicon , called silicon dioxide .
While effective , silicon dioxide cannot match the insulating properties of a vacuum .
The new chips will be used initially in IBM 's server machines - used by businesses and research groups - and the process will then be rolled out to the firm 's semiconductor partners .
Dr Paul said IBM 's claims of a 35 % speed increase was " quite a significant jump in performance just by changing one process in the fabrication of the chips " .
He added : " IBM will have test circuits to allow the performance to be measured but they have n't stated what the detailed performance they have got on their research website yet .
" As they state , they expect it to be in chips in 2009 ; it still has a bit of work to go . "
With my recent work on Fire , Adium , Perian , and A52 Codec , I have come to realize several misunderstandings concerning open source software .
Ask anyone involved in Open Source Software ( OSS ) , whether it be the users or the developers , and you will find there is often a disconnect between the two groups .
The users are upset with the elitist attitudes of the developers and the developer are upset with the whining of the users .
Why does this happen ?
The answer is simple , people are greedy .
The user ’s perspective is simple to relate .
The user is used to software made by a company .
If they should find a fault with such software , the company has people paid to calmly acknowledge the customer ’s concerns , and pass the information on to the developers who work to resolve it .
The user sees a kind response , and a fix or requested feature usually shows up in the next version or two .
When the user does the same to an open source developer , they often get a snide remark or no reply at all in return .
The user does n’t understand this , because the user does n’t understand OSS .
In order to truly understand OSS , one must look at the perspective of the developer .
Developers who works for a software company are paid to work , and so they are willing to work on projects they either dislike or even hate .
They do the work because the dislike / hatred for it is worth the compensation they receive .
The OSS developer does n’t have this compensation , and so the motivation is clearly something different .
The motivation for the OSS developer to release a program free of charge is typically a combination of one or more of the following reasons :
The software uses another piece of code or library which requires the work as a whole to be released under an open source license ( GPL being most notable here ) .
The developer hopes to interest more developers to join his efforts .
The developer fundamentally believes that all software should be free and is trying to lead by example .
Now , with these motivations in mind , consider the user ’s request for a feature which does not line up with the developer ’s interests .
The developer does not receive compensation for his work , so that leaves only altruism .
Stack the requests on top of one another , and the altruism is quickly depleted , leaving the developer to reply with a variant of the classic response “ Do it yourself ” or the kinder “ Patches welcome . ”
Upon seeing this response , the user tends to think , “ I do n’t know how to program , ” or , “ I do n’t have the time , ” and sees the developers response as elitist because they seem to be saying “ I am better than you , so go away . ”
The reality is the developer is really saying , “ I do n’t care about that .
If you want it , you will have to do it yourself , because I wo n’t . ”
It is like giving a random person a $ 20 bill , and he says that it should really be broken up into a ten , a five , 4 ones , 3 quarters , a dime , 2 nickels , and 5 pennies .
Do you proceed to go out of your way to find a bank and make change for him , or simply tell him that if he really wants change , he can do it himself ?
In my previous post , I mentioned the fiasco concerning the Perian beta .
A private build was posted on our download site ( without a link to it I should add ) , and macupdate posted it as an official build .
They refused to remove it when we asked , as so we just deleted it from the server .
Another user cursed at us , and posted the link to our semi-public betas .
His attitude showed that of a user who thinks he and others are entitled to something more that we were offering without giving anything in return .
This is like the stranger seeing you take out your wallet , pushing you over , taking your wallet , grabbing the $ 20 , and saying , “ What were you waiting for ? ”
Would you be inclined to give this person anything ever again ?
These are two examples of the greed users express .
There are many more .
Now , I must point out that these users are not representative of the whole , but they the most vocal .
Many of the users are quiet and the developers never hear a peep .
Only once in a blue moon does the developer hear from one who is truly appreciative .
Perhaps , if the users were more grateful for the work the developers put into their free software , then maybe the developer would produce more than they already have .
P.S. If you ask me to do something in OSS and I do n’t care about it , you will receive an estimate of payment , a no , or no reply at all .
I only make exceptions for friends , and OSS developers who work on programs I use .
Do n’t expect anything more from another OSS developers either .

6 back - to - back power outages hit the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco Tuesday afternoon causing major havoc with popular web services .
365 Main is down , along with craigslist , Technorati , Yelp , AdBrite and SixApart ( including TypePad , LiveJournal and Vox ) .
It caused some problems with servers used by Current TV , RedEnvelope and Second Life .
Pacific Gas and Electric ( PG&E ) is currently working on the issue .
It is now estimated that over PG&E 30,000 customers are with out power .
So the big question , where is the backup power at the data centers used by these services ?
UPS and diesel generators should normally help situation like this .
More coverage :
– O’Reilly Radar
– Robert Scoble
– OpenDNS
– GigaOm
Digg is still up .
Some services , like Technorati are starting to come back online .
SixApart has been providing updates via Twitter .
They are slowly bringing their services back up now .
See the SixApart status page for more info .
We ’re seeing several reports of a chaotic scene at 365 Main , with a line of sys admins forming outside the door waiting to get in to work on their servers .
According to PG&E , the outage was caused by an underground explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street .
The funny thing is that The Onion predicted all of this a couple of weeks ago .
How ironic , 1UP , is also down .
The Associated Press is reporting that the Netflix downtime is not related to the power outage in San Francisco .
I ’ve updated the post accordingly .
USA Today runs their blogs on TypdPad , so they were down as well because of the outage .
Automattic sys admin ( and former Laughing Squid sys admin ) Barry Abrahamson has a great write - up on why data centers should have better power redundancy and what they have done with WordPress.com to help it survive possible outages like this .
What ’s amazing about this is that there has still been no public response from 365 Main on their website .
It seems like they should at least acknowledge the issue .
Lori just informed us that 365 Main has provided a summary of what happened , including a FAQ , where they address questions about the backup generators and how many customers were affected .
* At 1:49 p.m. on Tuesday , July 24 , 365 Main ’s San Francisco data center was affected by a power surge caused when a PG&E transformer failed in a manhole under 560 Mission St .
While back - up electrical infrastructure is installed in the facility to defend against power surges , an initial investigation has revealed that certain 365 Main back - up generators did not start when the initial power surge hit the building .
On - site facility engineers responded and manually started affected generators allowing stable power to be restored at approximately 2:34 pm across the entire facility .
*
As a result of the incident , continuous power was interrupted for up to 45 minutes for certain customers .
We ’re certain 3 of the 8 colocation rooms were directly affected , and impact on other colocation rooms is still being investigated .
Due to the complexity and specialization of data center electrical systems , we are currently working with Hitec , Valley Power Systems , Cupertino Electric and PG&E to further investigate the incident and determine the root cause of why certain generators did not start .
All generators will continue to operate on diesel fuel until the root cause of the event has been identified and corrected .
Generators are currently filled with over 4 days of fuel and additional fuel has already been ordered .
*
We will apply knowledge gained in this investigation to all 365 Main facilities to help prevent this type of incident from happening again .
Rusty Hodge of SomaFM has a write - up on what he thinks happened at 365 Main .
Oh and as you might of heard incorrectly , it was n’t some drunk guy going crazy in the data center .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Joey " Jaws " Chestnut unseated the six - time defending champion in Nathan 's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest on Wednesday , eating 66 hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes .
Chestnut -- veins throbbing in his forehead -- wolfs down a dog on his way to the title and a world record Wednesday .
Six - time winner Takeru Kobayashi of Japan , nursing a sore jaw after wisdom tooth surgery , scarfed down 63 hot dogs .
Last year , he edged out Chestnut by nearly two dogs , eating a then - record 53 and three - quarters to Chestnut 's 52 .
Chestnut , who hails from San Jose , California , set a record with Wednesday 's feat of eating 66 hot dogs , the event 's organizers said .
Not since Joe Frazier defeated Muhammad Ali in the 1971 bout coined the " Fight of the Century " have two contestants battled so hard .
Perhaps .
At one point , Kobayashi expelled some of his half - mashed hot dogs from his mouth ; those did not count in his total .
Chestnut toiled beside him , a vein throbbing in his forehead and his face bright red .
Watch how the wiener - off went down »
" My body worked for me , " Chestnut said in an interview after the contest .
Kobayashi , 29 years old and weighing in at 154 pounds , was listed as questionable prior to the event .
He was receiving acupuncture treatment Wednesday morning to relieve pain in his jaw after wisdom tooth surgery .
Video from Tuesday 's weigh - in showed that he could open his mouth only half way .
Chestnut , 23 , weighing 215 pounds , had broken Kobayashi's 2006 record by downing 59 ½ hot dogs at a qualifying contest in Phoenix last month .
Chestnut claims the " Coveted Mustard Yellow International Belt " and wins a one - year supply of hot dogs from Nathan's , the sponsor of the annual event , which has been held on the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn since 1916 .
Organizers said 50,000 people attended Wednesday 's contest .
Chestnut is a civil engineering student at San Jose University .

Powell : ' I tried to avoid this war ' RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 8 , 2007 Print This Email This
It was revealed today that prior to the Iraq war , then - Secretary of State Colin Powell spent two and a half hours trying in vain to convince President George W. Bush not to invade .
" I tried to avoid this war , " Powell told the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado , reports Sarah Baxter in the Sunday Times .
Powell said he walked Bush through the risks of becoming an occupying force in an Arab country .
The sectarian violence in Iraq has escalated to the point of civil war , said Powell , and one that US forces cannot resolve .
Baxter points to plans being drawn up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to begin a slow troop reduction to pre-" surge " levels as signs that " the views of Powell and other critics of the war are finally being heard in the Pentagon , if not yet in the White House . "
Powell also asserts that any reduction in US troops must be accompanied by diplomatic measures with Syria and Iran , writes Baxter .
However , Powell may have a hard time convincing the anti-war public of his message .
" It 's really too late for Mr. Powell to redeem his reputation now , " comments Kevin Robbins of New York , on the Sunday Times web site .
" He could have resigned and gone public at the time rather than signing on to the whole fiasco . "
While " Fernandez " from San Francisco sarcastically jibes , " A whopping 2.5 hours .
Wow . "
Excerpts follow : # Speculation is growing that Gates will demonstrate his commitment to withdrawing US forces by moving a combat brigade of up to 3,000 troops out of Iraq as early as October and continuing to reduce their numbers month by month from their current strength of 160,000 to presurge levels of around 130,000 by the summer of 2008 .
... A senior defence source said it would be possible to reduce the number of American forces to roughly 50,000 - 70,000 by election day in November 2008 .
" You are going to have to have some people left behind to provide stability and security for the country and take on the terrorists , " the source said .
...
The general and former joint chiefs of staff added : " Shi'ites will ultimately prevail because they are 60 % of the population and their militias can be pretty violent .
They will prevail also because they are determined not to be ruled again by the Sunnis .
" The Sunnis are struggling for power and survival and its going to be resolved by a test of arms .
It s going to be very ugly . "

And now for something completely different .
Yamaha has just announced that it will be bringing a bevy of new motorcycle and scooter models to the upcoming Tokyo Motor Show .
One of the more interesting concepts , which we 'll roughly refer to as a motorcycle , is the Tesseract .
Piaggio has a success on their hands in the form of the MP3 , which is capable of leaning into turns despite the third wheel .
Yamaha has one - upped that with its Tesseract , though , by adding yet one more whee , l bringing the total count to four .
And yet , nobody would confuse this machine with a car !
Again , following Piaggio's lead with its impending hybrid MP3 , Yamaha has made this concept a hybrid , boasting both a V - Twin engine of undisclosed size along with an electric motor .
Yamaha claims that the machine is about the same width as a standard motorcycle , meaning lane - splitting could feasibly remain an option and parking should n't be too difficult .
The Tesseract has also been equipped with a mechanism to keep the machine upright when stopped or when parked , once again , like the MP3 .
As for the styling ?
It 's , uh ... different !
Imagine a Transformer half transformed and you 'll be pretty darn close .
And we love it !

CAMP LIBERTY , IRAQ , Sept. 27  An Army sniper is taught to kill people “ calmly and deliberately , ” even when they pose no immediate danger to him .
“ A sniper , ” Army Field Manual 23 - 10 goes on to state , “ must not be susceptible to emotions such as anxiety or remorse . ”
But in a crowded military courtroom seemingly stunned into silence on Thursday , Sgt. Evan Vela all but broke down as he described firing two bullets into an unarmed Iraqi man his unit arrested last May .
In anguished , eloquent sentences , Sergeant Vela , a member of an elite sniper scout platoon with the First Battalion , 501st Infantry Regiment , quietly described how his squad leader , Staff Sgt. Michael A. Hensley , cut off the man ’s handcuffs , wrestled him to his feet and ordered Sergeant Vela , standing a few feet away , to fire the 9 - millimeter service pistol into the detainee ’s head .
“ I heard the word ‘ Shoot , ’ ” Sergeant Vela recalled .
“ I do n’t remember pulling the trigger , ” he said .
“ I just came through and the guy was dead , and it just took me a second to realize the shot had come from the pistol . ”

New results suggest that defiance toward their mothers when children are very young , may reflect confidence and early autonomy .
Researchers worked with 119 mothers and their 14 - to 27 - month - old children using play time interactions as a means of study .
Although high levels of defiance at slightly older ages may be problematic , the research shows that at this age , defiance is part of healthy development .
At very young ages , children 's defiant behavior toward their mothers may not be a bad thing .
This defiance may in fact reflect children 's emerging autonomy and a confidence that they can control events that are important to them .
Those are the findings of a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan .
To understand how very young children react to being controlled by their parents , the researchers videotaped 119 mostly middle - class mothers as they interacted with their 14 - to 27 - month - old children .
Mothers were asked to have their children avoid a set of attractive toys and , when play time was over , to get their children to help them clean up those toys they had been allowed to use .
Based on the taped interactions , the researchers coded children 's behaviors , categorizing them as being defiant , ignoring requests , or being willingly compliant .
Children were most likely to be defiant and least likely to ignore requests when their mothers were sensitive and had few symptoms of depression , and when children were positively interested in their mothers during the interaction .
Children of sensitive mothers also tended to be highly cooperative .
Children with mothers who had symptoms of depression were more likely to ignore requests and less likely to respond with defiance .
One reason that some children of mothers with such symptoms develop poorly , the researchers suggested , may be that these children do not develop confident assertion with their mothers , learning instead to be overly passive in the face of obstacles .
These results imply that , at ages when parents first ask children to conform to requests and commands , active resistance is not a sign of problems in child development or in relations between parents and children .
To the contrary , at these very young ages , children 's active resistance may reflect a healthy confidence in their ability to control events and natural , although immature , attempts to do so .
" Although a year or two later , high defiance may be a problem , we found that at this age defiance appeared to be a positive development , " according to Theodore Dix , associate professor of human development and family science at the University of Texas at Austin and the study 's lead author .
" It increased with age and was associated with variables research has shown predict favorable outcomes for children . "
This study was funded , in part , by the National Science Foundation .
The study is published in the July / August 2007 issue of the journal Child Development , Vol. 78 , Issue 4 , Autonomy and Children 's Reactions to Being Controlled : Evidence That Both Compliance and Defiance May Be Positive Markers in Early Development by Dix , T , Stewart , AD ( University of Texas at Austin ) , Gershoff , ET ( University of Michigan ) , and Day , WH ( University of Texas at Austin ) .
Iterators are used in some programming languages to generalise the for loop .
They were introduced by CLU in the 1970s and have been adopted by Python and Lua , amongst others .
They are traditionally a special kind of function that has yield statements that return successive values in the iteration .
This function is called at the start of the loop , and when it yields , the loop body is run .
Each time round the loop the function is resumed until it yields again .
The iterator 's activation frame is typically on top of the stack .
This seems a bit backwards to me , because it leads to contortions to maintain the iterator 's state between yields , e.g. using an auxiliary object or first - class closures .
( See the first example here . )
I think it 's simpler to desugar a for loop like this :
for varlist in iterator ( arglist ) do statements loop
into
iterator ( ( varlist ) : do statements end , arglist )
That is , you turn the loop body into an anonymous function which is passed to the iterator function .
Instead of yielding , the iterator just calls the body function .
The iterator can then be written as a normal loop without contortions to keep state between yields .
( Pretty much like this , in fact . )
What makes this slightly interesting is how to desugar break , continue , and return statements inside the loop .
A continue becomes just a return from the anonymous function , but the others have to escape from the iterator function as well as the anonymous function .
This could be done with exceptions or continuation passing .

Got rbST in your milk ? / Dairy co-op bows to pressure to stop use of hormone
milk25_160_mac.jpg
Areias begins the 5 pm milking of his 282 cows .
A very large dairy co-op , California Dairies , is encouraging members not to produce milk with a synthetic bovine growth hormone , called rBST , since major customers are demanding milk they buy be free of the synthetic hormone .
Safeway , Starbucks and Costco are among those customers .
The synthetic hormone boosts milk production in cows and was approved by the FDA in 1993 .
The vote by the board of directors of California Dairies was not unanimous .
Board member and Los Banos diaryman Dennis Areias voted against dumping rBST , and is still in favor of using the supplemental hormone , while he understands the market forces .

Richard Cotta , CEO of California Dairies Inc. , the nation 's second - largest dairy cooperative , is guided by a simple business philosophy : " If you want milk with little blue dots , you 'll have it , as long as you are willing to pay for it . "
So , when a string of major customers , including supermarket giant Safeway , came to his co-op saying they would no longer accept milk from cows treated with a genetically engineered growth hormone , the co-op bowed to the inevitable .
In January , California Dairies ' board voted to ask its members not to inject synthetic bovine growth hormone into their cows .
If they do , their milk will have to be segregated and they 'll pay a surcharge .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" Consumer demand is obvious , " Cotta said .
The action by a co-op that ships 50 million pounds of milk every day is part of a sweeping , consumer - driven agricultural makeover , in which suppliers are forced to adapt to a changing marketplace .
Demand for natural foods is rising , while increasing numbers of consumers are avoiding products that rely on antibiotics or growth hormones .
And food retailers are listening .
Recombinant bovine somatotropin , or rbST , was approved by the Food and Drug Administration 14 years ago .
Injected every two weeks into cows , it sustains lactation by stimulating cows ' appetites so they eat more and produce more milk , perhaps an extra 5 quarts per day .
The hormone supplements the natural bovine somatotropin ( bST ) , or bovine growth hormone , produced in a cow 's pituitary gland .
St. Louis ' Monsanto Co. , which developed the synthetic hormone known by the trade name Posilac , says the increased milk output translates to an average increase in net profit for dairies of $ 100 a year per cow .
The synthetic hormone may have been used in 20 to 30 percent of the nation 's cows since it became available in January 1994 , according to some estimates .
But what may be a significant value to dairies can't compete against the growing attractiveness of the natural foods movement .
" Many customers have called to ask us to eliminate the use of hormones , " said Teena Massingill , a spokeswoman at Safeway , which is based in Pleasanton .
" Our goal is to provide customers products they want , " she said .
Safeway eliminated rbST in its Northern California milk brands , Lucerne and Dairy Glen , in 2004 .
Safeway stores in Washington , Montana , Idaho and Texas are also rbST - free , as are its Genuardi 's stores in Pennsylvania .
Indeed , the vast majority of milk sold in Northern California is rbST - free , Cotta said .
Southern California was slower to change but is catching up , he added .
Safeway 's Vons stores in Southern California recently told California Dairies it wants milk it orders from the co-op to be rbST - free by Aug .
1 . Costco has made a similar order .
Starbucks spokeswoman Sanja Gould in Seattle said the company is already rbST - free in stores in Northern California , New England , New Mexico , Montana , Oregon , Washington , Idaho and Alaska .
That represents 37 percent of its dairy volume .
The company will be free of bovine growth hormone in other markets as supply becomes available , Gould said .
Two North Bay dairies , Straus Family Creamery , an organic producer , and Clover - Stornetta Farms , are rbST - free .
So are Save Mart 's brands , Sunnyside Farms and Bayview Milk .
Other notable national dairy - based companies that are rbST - free include Tillamook , a 150 - dairy farmer cooperative in Oregon , and Ben & Jerry 's Homemade Ice Cream in Vermont .
" We think its use is a step in the wrong direction toward a synthetic , chemically intensive , factory - produced food supply , " Ben & Jerry 's said in a statement .
For farmers , rbST can mean money in the bank .
Dennis Areias , a third - generation dairyman who milks 282 cows at Den - K Holsteins on the outskirts of Los Banos ( Merced County ) , figures it could add $ 30,000 or so to his net sales each year based on current prices .
Areias is one of three California Dairies board members who voted against discouraging rbST usage .
In an interview in the pounding rain at his farm last week , he said he will continue to use Posilac .
Putting " rbST - free " on labels is a marketing ploy , he insisted .
It creates a milk category between organic and regular that brings a higher price with no reward for the farmer , he complained .
Milk may be labeled as rbST - free in the United States provided that it 's specified that federal tests have shown no significant difference between milk from cows treated with rbST and those that have n't been treated .
" The guy in the middle has figured out a marketing thing , where he can print something on a box about being rbST - free , cause a little concern or question , and he is going to generate more money in the marketplace , " the 50 - year - old dairyman said , his voice rising with indignation .
" This is an FDA - approved product and now they are telling us we can't use it and the ladies buying the milk are getting shafted every time they pay a penny more , " Areias said .
" Whether it 's organic , rbST - free or regular , it 's all exactly the same . "
Some consumer groups , including Food & Water Watch in Washington , D.C. , vehemently disagree , despite an FDA finding that milk from cows treated with the hormone is completely safe .
They note that , after extensive debate , the European Union , Japan , Canada and Australia did not approve rbST .
The reasons included questions about human and animal safety , as well social and economic considerations .
Europeans worried about putting small farmers at a disadvantage , milk surpluses and the possibility of consumer backlash , according to a Canadian study .
Posilac has been approved in such countries as South Africa , Brazil , Colombia , Korea , Costa Rica , Egypt , United Arab Emirates , Honduras , Israel , Jamaica , Kenya and Mexico .
Patty Lovera , Food & Water
Watch 's food program director , pointed to research that shows injections of rbST increase another hormone , insulin - like growth factor 1 , or IGF - 1 , in cows .
Too much IGF - 1 in humans is linked with increased rates of colon , breast and prostate cancer .
Food & Water
Watch says synthetic hormone use also increases the rate of mastitis , a bacterial udder infection .
That in turn leads to increased use of antibiotics , whose overuse is already a serious problem in the livestock industry .
Meanwhile , belief is spreading quickly that growth hormones induce puberty in humans earlier than normal , said Laurie Demeritt , a consumer marketing specialist at the Hartman Group in Bellevue , Wash .
She encountered the theory while doing a survey last year in which 61 percent of consumers said their main reason for buying organic foods was to avoid products that relied on antibiotics or growth hormones .
In other market research , the Natural Marketing Institute 's 2006 Health & Wellness Trends Database found that 53 percent of primary grocery shoppers said they were looking for dairy , meat and poultry products that are free of antibiotics .
The same number said they shop for products free of hormones .
Monsanto spokesman Andrew Burchett said the company does not believe there is a mass movement against hormones .
" We do not see a broad - based consumer demand for farmers to give up Posilac , " Burchett said .
" In the absence of deceptive labels and advertising , consumers consistently say buying milk is based on price , expiration date and fat content . "
Regarding the early puberty theory , he said , " We have seen activists that oppose the technology allude to things that have no basis in fact . "
Monsanto's product supplements the bovine somatotropin that is a naturally produced protein in the pituitary glands of cattle and helps adult cows produce milk .
Many experts say the decreased use of Posilac simply reflects business decisions .
" From a public health standpoint , I am unaware of any hard - core science that shows a public health risk , " said Dr. James Cullor , director of the UC Davis Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center in Tulare .
" It 's really kind of sad , " added Michael Marsh , the CEO of Western United Dairymen , a trade association in Modesto .
" It will lead to more smaller farms going out of business .
Posilac is another tool the small farmer uses to compete with every larger agribiz . "
Nevertheless , California Dairies has made its decision .
" It 's no different than shopping for a car , " said CEO Cotta .
" If you want a red car and all they have is green , you go to the next lot . "
rbST
Pros
-- Increases milk production .
-- Boosts farm income .
-- May lower retail milk prices , according to farmers .
Cons

At the agency ’s product testing lab , which operates out of a former missile defense radar station in Gaithersburg , Md. , the impact of the tight budgets is apparent .
One lab worker used a magnifying glass and a mechanical stop watch to help conduct a fabric flammability experiment — the same equipment she has used for three decades .
The toy laboratory , down the hall , is an office so cramped that the only space dedicated to a drop test to see if toys will break into small pieces and cause a choking hazard is the spare space behind the office door .
“ This is the toy lab for all of America — for all of the United States government ! ” said Robert L. Hundemer , the one agency employee who routinely tests toys , as he held up his arms in the air .
“ We do what we can . ”
New Initiatives
Spurred by the recalls of flawed Chinese - made products , Democrats in Congress , consumer advocates and even industry groups are demanding that the commission be given more power and money to do its job .
Congress has begun by adopting budgets that allow for modest funding increases for the agency next year .
The Bush administration proposed more cuts , which would have forced the agency ’s staff to shrink still more .
Mr. Stratton stepped down last year to take a job as a product safety lawyer in Washington law firm and the president has yet to replace him .
In March , Mr. Bush nominated Michael E. Baroody , but he withdrew after lawmakers attacked his record as a longtime lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers .
The vacancy has prevented any action on proposed regulations or mandatory recalls .
The agency , for example , found a Chinese - made A.T.V. unsafe but could not take it off the market .
Eager for action , several environmental and business groups are pushing for new mandatory standards .
The Sierra Club , backed by toymakers , is seeking a ban on lead in children ’s jewelry , which the agency has agreed to consider .
And cigarette lighter manufacturers , finding themselves at a competitive disadvantage to Chinese companies that ignore the voluntary standard , are seeking safety rules for lighters .
The consumer commission , though , has declined so far to move ahead , saying the 90 injuries and 10 deaths linked to fires caused by defective lighters were not enough to justify the mandate .
The big chill between Rudy Giuliani and ex-wife Donna Hanover was on full display yesterday when both attended their daughter Caroline ’s high school graduation – but sat as far apart as possible and never spoke .
When the commencement speaker , Sen. Charles Schumer , noted Giuliani ’s presence and the audience broke into applause , Hanover and her son , Andrew Giuliani , sat stone - faced and did n’t clap .
But Hanover and Andrew jumped up and cheered when the Harvard - bound 17 - year - old Caroline received her diploma from the tony Trinity School , while Giuliani and his wife , Judith , did n’t even crack a smile .
During the two - hour graduation , the Giulianis could be seen whispering to each other and peering over at a happy Hanover and her husband , Edwin Oster , sitting 30 yards away .
Rudy and Judith Giuliani avoided his children and ex-wife by arriving minutes before the ceremony began , entering through a side entrance , and they ducked out 10 minutes before it ended .
Hanover , Andrew and a group of family friends arrived at least an hour early to secure the best seats at the Crenshaw Church on West 96th Street and Central Park West .
The Republican presidential front - runner ’s strained relationship with his children burst into public view earlier this year
after Andrew told a reporter that he was estranged from his father and had a “ problem ” with his stepmom , Judith .
The former mayor did not attend Andrew ’s high school graduation and has reportedly missed many of Caroline ’s high school performances .
At the graduation yesterday , Andrew did not acknowledge his father and stepmother and would not say whether the couple would join them later .
“ We plan to celebrate privately with friends and family .
We ’re all so proud of her and it ’s really Caroline ’s day , ” said Andrew , wearing a Yankees tie .
When reporters asked Hanover whether she would celebrate with Giuliani , she grimaced , then gushed at how happy she was for her daughter .
The Giulianis also wouldnot comment .

Some people simply do not believe that stress can be beaten by exercise .
This is mainly due to the misconception many have about what exercise is .
Mention the word ‘ exercise ’ and many people immediately think of spending hours in the gym , dragging their sweaty , tired body home afterwards .
The thought alone is enough to drive anyone ’s stress levels through the roof , never mind reduce it !
Understanding what exercise is , as well as why and how it is beneficial in relieving stress can change your outlook .
This could encourage you to do some exercise , which in turn can lead to a longer , healthier , less stressful life .
Although we all experience a little stress every now and then , excessive stress can cause serious health problems if not taken care of .
Stress can manifest itself in a number of ways :
Headaches
Backache
Fatigue
Weight gain or loss
Anxiety
Depression
Insomnia
If not relieved , continued stress can lead to undesirable behaviors such as under or over eating , excessive smoking as well as the abuse of alcohol , other substances and medications .
This can affect health and relationships negatively and lead to even more stress .
Stress can also cause high blood pressure , which thickens arterial walls .
Eventually blood flow to the heart is inadequate and can result in a heart attack .
The immune system can also be negatively affected by stress causing other illnesses .
Exercise is a natural stress reliever which , done the right way , has no negative side effects and can lead to better health and relationships .
Any form of physical activity is considered exercise .
You therefore do not have to join a gym or do strenuous exercises to get the benefits .
You do not even need any exercise equipment .
Taking your dog for a walk is considered exercise and will do just fine .
How and why is exercise beneficial ?
Stress is caused by so - called “ stress hormones ” like cortisol .
Exercise produces the feel - good hormone called endorphins .
If you are feeling good , how can you feel stressed out ?
Instead of thinking about your problems , while exercising , you are concentrating on the effort you are putting into the exercise .
Problems take a back seat for a while .
Your mind relaxes and your mood improves .
Exercise helps us improve our bodies and with that comes better self - esteem .
With exercise comes improved health .
Your immune system is strengthened and your body is able to fight colds and flu and other illness more effectively .
Exercises such as boxing and martial arts can be a wonderful outlet for frustration .
If you do decide to join a gym , you might just meet some very nice people .
Having a supportive circle of friends can do wonders .
What is the best exercise ?
Walking , cycling , spinning or a Pilates class ?
One exercise is not necessarily better than another .
What you should remember is that any exercise is better than no exercise at all .
People differ and what is enjoyable to one person might in fact cause stress in another !
The point is to do some physical activity on a regular basis .
This is best achieved doing something you like .
Exercise such as yoga , swimming and other cardio workouts are wonderful stress relievers .
Put your favorite music on and dance !

A few exercise tips
Go for a good checkup before starting any exercise program .
Find an exercise or exercise routine you enjoy .
For instance , if you dislike running , do n’t do it !
If you force yourself to do something you do not enjoy , chances are you will give up and go back to being a couch potato .
Start slowly and build up from there .
Â
Trying to do 60 minutes of exercise if you are unfit is looking for trouble .
Try to do your exercises with a friend .
That way you can motivate one another
Set goals .
Knowing what you want from your exercise routine could help you stick to it .
Last , but not least .
Do not think of exercise as another daily chore .
Focus on all the benefits you are gaining ( less stress and that good - looking body ) and enjoy yourself !

Confession time : I did n’t start planning my retirement when I was young .
I did n’t give it much thought , because when you ’re in your 20s , retirement seems like something you can worry about much later .
Sure , you hear advice about how it ’s much better to start early , and compound interest and all that — it makes sense , but it does n’t seem as urgent as making that car payment .
Now in my mid-30s , though , retirement is a very real issue .
I know it ’s not too late to start planning , so just in the last couple of years I started seriously thinking about what I need to do , and how to get started .
Now , if you are someone with your retirement plans all set and ready to go , this article will be way too basic for you .
Skip it .
This is aimed at people like myself who never really gave retirement a thought .
It ’s aimed at people in their 20s who really should start now and can do so with some simple steps .
It ’s aimed at people in their 30s and 40s who need to start now ( although it ’s not too late ) .
You can do these things today , without too much effort .
Read up on them , make a call , get started !
1. Max Out Your 401( k ) .
Probably the easiest and best thing you can do to get your retirement plan going .
It ’s easy , especially if you are an employee , as you are probably already enrolled in a 401 ( k ) .
All you have to do is fill out a form to increase it to the maximum contribution .
And if your employer matches a certain percentage of your contributions , that ’s free money right off the bat .
Best of all , you get tax breaks up front on your 401 ( k ) contributions , saving you a ton of money .
2. Start now .
Even if you ’re really late in getting started ( as I was ) , it ’s important to start right away .
Even if it ’s just a little at a time .
Yes , we ’re talking about the magic of compound interest , which means that if you start now with a small contribution , it ’s better than starting later with a larger contribution .
Make your money work for you .
Even if you just cut out a few small expenses , and used that savings to start investing in retirement , it makes a big difference .
And starting small has another benefit : as you watch your investments grow , you become motivated by your success to invest even more .
3 . Track your earnings .
You do n’t have to check stock prices every day , or anything , but simply checking on your 401 ( k ) and other investments once a year or every 6 months will do wonders .
Check on your earnings , and use online calculators to see if you ’re on track .
If not , you can make adjustments , such as increasing your contributions .
4. Roth IRA ( or other secondary investment ) .
It ’s best to have multiple investments , instead of just 401 ( k ) , which might not be sufficient for your retirement needs .
Probably the best secondary investment for most people is the Roth IRA , if you ’re eligible for it ( and most of us are ) .
I wo n’t get into the details of it ( read the Wikipedia article for more ) , but the main point is they are structured to save you on taxes .
There are maximum limits for contributions which change each year ( $ 4,000 in 2007 and $ 5,000 in 2008 ) , and if you can contribute the maximum , you should .
5. Life insurance .
This is n’t really necessary for retirement , of course , but is more of a safety net for your family .
Why should you worry about it ( if you have a spouse or children ) ?
Because it gives you that financial security needed to invest your money for retirement .
The next two items are for the same reason .
6. Disability insurance .
If tragedy strikes and you ’re not able to work , what happens to your retirement contributions ?
Well , they go down the drain if you do n’t have disability insurance .
Get insurance that covers 60 % of your current income to be safe .
7. Emergency fund .
The recommended 3 - 6 months of expenses for an emergency fund is a good guideline , but if you do n’t have any emergency fund , you should save up at least $ 1,000 ( to start with ) .
Without an emergency fund , you will cut off your retirement contributions anytime an emergency comes up .
You absolutely need to start saving an emergency fund today if you want to prepare for retirement .
Set up regular transfers to a savings account today .

1 Productive capacities .
2 Difference between the observed production for 2007 and the predicted value ( in mbpd ) , the value in bold indicates the best forecast ( i.e. the oldest with the lowest difference .
There was a big revision this month for almost the monthly estimates :
There was also a mistake in the May production from Canada that briefly went up by almost 1 mbpd !
Overall , we can see that production for crude oil and condensate has been revised up around May 2005 and June 2006 but revised down for the first quarter of 2006 and 2007 .
NGPL production has been revised down for almost all the months since 2003 .
However , the cumulated amount of revisions do not exceed 0.5 mbpd .
The cumulative change in production estimates are shown on Figure 3 .
The 2005 annual production for all liquids has been revised up by 0.5 mbpd since initial estimate .
The following results are based on a linear or non-linear fit of a parametric curve ( most often a Logistic curve ) directly on the observed production profile :
Next update probably in December .

For almost 75 years , astronomers have believed that the Universe has a large amount of unseen or ‘ dark ’ matter , thought to make up about five - sixths of the matter in the cosmos .
With the conventional theory of gravitation , based on Newton ’s ideas and refined by Einstein 92 years ago , dark matter helps to explain the motion of galaxies , and clusters of galaxies , on the largest scales .
Now two Canadian researchers at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics suggest that the motion of galaxies in a distant cluster is more easily explained by a Modified Gravity ( MOG ) theory than by the presence of dark matter .
Graduate student Joel Brownstein and his supervisor Professor John Moffat of the University of Waterloo present their results in a paper in the 21 November edition of Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
The two scientists analysed images of the ‘ Bullet Cluster ’ of galaxies made using the Hubble Space Telescope , Chandra X-ray and Spitzer infrared observatories and the Magellan telescope in Chile .
The Bullet Cluster consists of two merging clusters of galaxies and lies at a distance of over 3 billion light years in the direction of the southern constellation of Carina .
This arsenal of instrumentation gave them maps of the 150 million degree hot gas between the galaxies and show the effect of gravitational lensing , where the gravity of an intervening object – here the Bullet Cluster - deflects the path of light emitted by a more distant galaxy .
Previous studies suggested that the Bullet Cluster clearly demonstrates the presence of dark matter .
But when Brownstein and Moffat compared the observed gravitational lensing and distribution of gas with that predicted using MOG theory , they found no evidence for this .
In other words , it is more natural to explain the appearance of this cluster using a revised theory of gravitation than by including dark matter .
MOG theory emerges from a generalization of relativity that eluded even Einstein , has been developed by Moffat for nearly thirty years and is now yielding astronomical and cosmological results .
The theory has been used to successfully explain the movement of stars in over 100 galaxies and the motion of galaxies in more than 100 clusters .
MOG theory may also explain the apparent anomalous deceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes , launched in the early 1970s and now more than 12000 million km from the Sun .
The two physicists are enthusiastic about their findings .
Brownstein comments , ‘ Using Modified Gravity ( MOG ) theory , the ‘ normal ’ matter in the Bullet Cluster is enough to account for the observed gravitational lensing effect .
In time , better observations will lead to higher resolution pictures of the systems we are studying .
Continuing the search for and then analysing other merging clusters of galaxies will help us decide whether dark matter or MOG theory offers the best explanation for the large scale structure of the Universe . ’
Professor Moffat adds ,
‘ If the multi-billion dollar laboratory experiments now underway succeed in directly detecting dark matter , then I will be happy to see Einsteinian and Newtonian gravity retained .
However , if dark matter is not detected and we have to conclude that it does not exist , then Einstein and Newtonian gravity must be modified to fit the extensive amount of astronomical and cosmological data , such as the bullet cluster , that cannot otherwise be explained . ’

Turkey Says Israeli Aircraft Dropped Fuel Tanks Near Turkey - Syria Border
Turkish authorities say they believe Israeli aircraft dropped two fuel tanks found last week near Turkey 's border with Syria .
Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan called the incident " unacceptable . "
He warned against acts that cause tensions , saying they could harm peace and stability in the region .
He spoke during a news conference in Ankara Monday with his Syrian counterpart , Walid al - Moallem .
Syria last week said its air defenses fired at Israeli aircraft that had violated its airspace and dropped munitions on Syrian territory .
The Israel military refused comment .
At Monday 's news conference , the Syrian foreign minister called the alleged violation an " intentional , hostile attack . "
Both countries have demanded an explanation from Israel .
Babacan says Israel has pledged to provide information in the shortest time possible .
Turkey is one of the few Muslim countries with close ties to Israel .
Peace talks between Syria and Israel have been frozen since 2000 .
Some information for this report was provided by AFP , AP and Reuters .
Massive Jupiter is undergoing dramatic atmospheric changes that have never been seen before with the keen " eye " of NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope .
Jupiter 's turbulent clouds are always changing as they encounter atmospheric disturbances while sweeping around the planet at hundreds of miles per hour .
But these Hubble images reveal a rapid transformation in the shape and color of Jupiter 's clouds near the equator , marking an entire face of the globe .
The planet is wrapped in bands of yellows , browns , and whites .
These bands are produced by air flowing in different directions at various latitudes .
Lighter - hued areas where the atmosphere rises are called zones .
Darker regions where air falls are called belts .
When these opposing flows interact , storms and turbulence appear .
Between March 25 and June 5 , Hubble 's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 captured entire bands of clouds changing color .
Zones have darkened into belts and belts have lightened and transformed into zones .
Cloud features have rapidly altered in shape and size .
The image at left shows a thin band of white clouds above Jupiter 's equator .
The white color indicates clouds at higher altitudes in Jupiter 's atmosphere .
In the image at right , the band 's white hue has turned brown , showing clouds deep within the planet 's atmosphere .
The whole band appears to have merged with the one below it .
In the same cloud band above the equator , the small swirls in the left - hand image have morphed into larger wave - like features in the right - hand photo .
Dominating the band is a dark streak that resembles a snake .
This serpent - shaped structure is actually a small tear in the cloud deck , which gives astronomers a view deep within the atmosphere .
Below the equatorial region , the brownish upside - down shark fin in the left - hand image disappears in the photo at right .
Appearing instead are brownish tongue - shaped clouds with a stream of white swirls below them .
These global upheavals have been seen before , but not with Hubble 's sharp resolution .
Astronomers using ground - based telescopes first spied drastic atmospheric transformation in the 1980s .
Another major disturbance was seen in the early 1990s , after Hubble was launched into space .
The telescope , however , did not have the resolution to view the upheaval in fine detail .
These higher - quality Hubble images may help astronomers understand how such global upheavals develop on Jupiter .

At first glance the Samsung DuoS looks nowhere near as interesting as the recent Serenata or Armani phones , but you 'd be wrong .. because as far as we know , the Samsung DuoS ( or SGH - D880 ) is the first mobile phone two support two different SIM cards simultaneously .
At the moment , if you want two SIM cards in your phone then it 's awfully tricky .
The process often involves cutting SIM cards down or somehow squeezing in an add - on bit of hardware .
The Samsung DuoS gets around this by having two SIM slots in the back , and both SIMs are active at the same time .
Now , you probably either see the plus points of this dual - SIM arrangement straight away , or you do n't .
Just in case you do n't - the advantage is that one phone can act as a home or business device , or perhaps the second SIM card can be on a network from a different country that you visit often , or perhaps the tariff on one SIM card is designed for data and the other for voice .
Or maybe you 're a secret agent or something , but if you find yourself carrying two phones for whatever reason , then the SGH - D880 / DuoS might be exactly what you need .
The SIM cards can be on different networks , and even for different countries .
Bear in mind that this is only a tri-band GSM phone , so data rates are limited to GPRS and EDGE and there are no 3G capabilities .
Samsung have designed the interface to be as simple to use as possible and users can name each SIM whichever way they like , so they do n't have to stick with " SIM 1 " or " SIM 2 " .
This switching is n't just for voice calls , but it allows separate ringtones , text messages , email configuration and other settings .. so the DuoS really is like having two phones in one .
The DuoS even has two signal strength indicators .
Apart from the two SIM card slots , the Samsung SGH - D880 / DuoS is a pretty decent phone .
There 's a 2.3 " 240x320 pixel display , 3 megapixel camera with autofocus , FM radio , stereo Bluetooth , microSD expandable memory , a multimedia player and USB 2.0 connection .
Because the dual network connections draw more power than a single one , the battery in the SGH - D880 is a large 1200 mAh ( milliAmpere hours ) rather than a more typical 800 mAh cell .
It 's a pretty normal size for a phone at 104 x 51 x 19 mm , although we do n't know how much the D880 weighs .
At the moment , the Samsung DuoS / D880 has only been confirmed for release in Russia later this month .
It 's a relatively expensive device at 18,000 rubles ( around £ 350 or € 510 ) before tax .
Expect to have to pay the full price without any discount , because no carrier will want to subsidise a handset that another carrier will use and locking the device to a single network would be pointless .
We think that the Samsung DuoS is a very clever idea , and are frankly a bit surprised that it has taken a manufacturer this long to come up with something like this .
It 's quite possible that the SGH - D880 will be a very popular phone when it hits the market , and perhaps we will see more dual - SIM phones emerging during 2008 .

Australian and US scientists successfully launched a supersonic scramjet engine at an Outback test range Friday , as they work on a device that could revolutionise air travel .
The researchers said a rocket carrying the scramjet reached speeds of mach 10 -- ten times the speed of sound -- after blasting off at the Woomera range in South Australia Friday .
They said it reached an altitude of 530 kilometres ( 330 miles ) before the scramjet was successfully deployed following re-entry to the Earth 's atmosphere .
An exchange with New York Post reporter on witch - hunt of school principal
By Bill Van Auken
15 September 2007
Chuck Bennett , a reporter who wrote a series of articles for the New York Post that furthered a smear campaign against Debbie Almontaser , the principal of the Khalil Gibran Academy , a new New York City public school offering courses in Arabic and Arab culture , has written to the World Socialist Web Site complaining that we misrepresented his journalistic efforts by accusing him of “ ambush ” journalism .
( See “ New York City : Right - wing Zionist witch - hunt ousts principal of new Arabic school ” )
Bennett penned an article headlined “ City Principal is ‘ Revolting , ’ ” which centered not on the school or its curriculum , but on an utterly spurious attempt to tie Almontaser to a T - shirt produced by a group providing video production training to young Arab - American women .
This group happened to have been granted office space in a building run by a Yemeni- American cultural organization where Almontaser is a board member .
The T - shirt bore the logo “ Intifada NYC . ”
The principal ’s attempt to provide a reasoned answer to Bennett ’s insistence that she explain the meaning of the word “ Intifada ” was then used by the Post to launch a ferocious witch - hunt , referring to her as the “ Intifada Principal . ”
The campaign by the Post proved crucial in whipping up a right - wing furor — joined by various Democratic officials and United Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten — against the school and Almontaser , forcing her to resign .
What follows is Bennett ’s complaint and a reply by Bill Van Auken of the World Socialist Web Site .
* * *
Your account of my interview with Almontaser is wrong .
In no way whatsoever was she “ ambushed . ”
It seems you are lifting material from an incorrect article in The Jewish Week .
My interview with Almontaser was conducted in the presence of a press secretary from the Dept. of Education .
Please contact her .
She will confirm that from the beginning Almontaser was aware that the focus of the interview was about the Intifada T - shirts .
In fact , it was the first question .
I ’d appreciate a corrected version be included online .
Thank you .
Chuck Bennett
NY Post

Dear Mr. Bennett :
The World Socialist Web Site would have had no problem making a factual correction to its September 1 story , “ New York City : Right - wing Zionist witch - hunt ousts principal of new Arabic school , ” by Steve Light , had your version of the interview with Principal Almontaser been confirmed by the Department of Education press secretary .
Though , it must be added , whether your question about T - shirts came first or last hardly would have affected our political assessment of the foul and reactionary ambush journalism practiced by the New York Post and you , in particular , in this episode .
In fact , the press secretary failed to corroborate your version of the encounter with Almontaser , saying only , “ I do not want to speak about this issue on the record / ...
Do n’t make any assumptions about this . ”
Given this response , we see no reason to alter our story .
We have also spoken in the meantime to people familiar with Principal Almontaser ’s account of the interview , who report that she repeatedly protested your questioning her about the T - shirt as inappropriate , something that finds no reflection in your article in the Post .
Your complaint seems to suggest that you have somehow been misrepresented by the WSWS or that your journalistic integrity has been called into question unjustly .
To this , I can only say : Come off it , Mr. Bennett .
After all , you do write for the New York Post .
Your article was entirely in keeping with the sleazy journalistic standards and reactionary politics of your boss , Rupert Murdoch .
No doubt your piece on Principal Almontaser and the Khalil Gibran Academy made the “ dirty digger ” proud .
Your article generally falls under the category of a right - wing hit job .
Its inspiration came from the protracted campaign waged by a group of Republican and Zionist ideologues who have seized upon the school to promote their virulently anti-Arab and anti-Islamic agenda .
This group includes Daniel Pipes , a political columnist for the Post , who is listed as a member of the national advisory board of Stop the Madrassa , the front group that organized the smear campaign against the school .
Pipes is best known for organizing McCarthyite - style witch - hunts against American academics who dare to question US support for Israel .
Also on the board is Frank Gaffney , the right - wing columnist and former Pentagon official who is one of the most prominent advocates of war with Iran .
The involvement of these elements has nothing to do with educational concerns .
Their sole interest was to distort the aims of the new school — which were the same as dozens of other New York City public schools teaching courses in languages ranging from Russian to Chinese , Spanish and Creole — in order to turn it into a grotesque caricature , an Islamist “ madrassa ” that supposedly posed some kind of terrorist threat .
That ’s where you and the Post came in , turning the poisoned political invective of Stop the Madrassa into a lurid — and utterly irrelevant — story about “ terrorist ” T - shirts being worn by young women learning how to make videos .
Without ever talking to the group that produced the T - shirts , you determined that they represented a “ glorification of Palestinian violence ” and a “ call for a Gaza - style uprising in the Big Apple . ”
Then , of course , you demanded that Principal Almontaser take responsibility for them .
It is a measure of the putrid and right - wing atmosphere dominating America ’s political and educational establishments — an atmosphere that Murdoch ’s Post and Fox News have played no small part in generating — that Almontaser ’s failure to issue a categorical denunciation of the T - shirts could be used to force her out of her job .
In point of fact , the group that produced the shirts , Arab Women Active in Art and Media , explained that its use of the word was in keeping with the literal Arabic meaning of “ shaking off , ” which it said referred to the “ ‘ shaking off ’ of discrimination and prejudice and an embracing of our roles as producers rather than simply objects of the mass media and public discourse . ”
Needless to say , this explanation never found its way into any of your articles .
And if it had referred to the Palestinian Intifada , what of it ?
Millions of Palestinians and people all over the world are justifiably proud of the Palestinian youth with slingshots who confronted Israeli tanks in the fight against an illegal occupation and the conditions of poverty and oppression that it has imposed .
The openly racist agitation by the Post against Almontaser was pursued by its columnists , while you handled the supposedly “ straight news ” angle .
Thus , one had the always ineffable Andrea Peyser referring to Almontaser as “ the hijab - wearing principal of a taxpayer - funded school ” and accusing her of having “ issued a fatwa against the kids of New York . ”
The “ news ” stories were nothing more than a setup for this kind of vicious character assassination .
And they were anything but apolitical .
The fact that they were largely crafted by the right - wing Zionist elements behind the Stop the Madrassa front group is evident .
Interestingly , you gave the last quoted comment in your August 6 story to one Pamela Hall , whom you describe as “ a Manhattan mom opposed to the academy on the grounds that it violates separation of church and state . ”
She is reported to have commented , “ Intifada is a war .
Is n’t that what Arafat had ? ”
You did n’t bother to inform the Post ’s readers that this “ mom ” is a right - wing activist , not only a member of Stop the Madrassa , but also the New York head of an anti-Islamic and anti-immigrant outfit known as United America Committee , which is allied with the Minutemen and has gained a certain notoriety for provocative stunts like hanging Osama bin Laden in effigy outside mosques and staging a counter - protest against New York ’s annual Muslim - American Day parade .
Such telltale details expose the articles as hack - jobs done in direct partnership with the radical pro-Zionist right .
So , frankly Mr. Bennett , we are not interested in your protest that you were misrepresented by the World Socialist Web Site .
Misrepresentation , slander and witch - hunting are clearly both the Post ’s and your own stock - in - trade .
If you want to change that , try doing it in the pages of Murdoch ’s newspaper .
We , for our part , will continue to do our best to expose and denounce the lies pouring out of the media sewer that employs you .

A muslim dentist made a woman wear Islamic dress as the price of accepting her as an NHS patient , it is alleged .
Omer Butt is said to have told the patient that unless she wore a headscarf she would have to find another practice .
Later this month , Mr Butt will appear before a General Dental Council professional misconduct hearing , which has the power to strike him off .
It is claimed that the 31 - year - old dentist asked to speak to the woman in private after she turned up for an appointment at his clinic in Bury .
According to the charges , he questioned her on whether she was a Muslim and told her that if he was to treat her she would have to wear Islamic dress .
He is also said to have read out a number of religious rules to her .
He then told his nurse to give the patient her own headscarf to wear , the accusation says .
It is not known whether the woman was a Muslim .
The charges to be heard by the General Dental Council say that Mr Butt undermined public confidence in his profession by discriminating against a patient and failed to act in her best interests .
Mr Butt is the older brother of former Islamic extremist Hassan Butt , who once declared he had ' no problem ' with terror attacks on Britain and who said that September 11 " served the pleasure of Allah " .
He has since recanted and now calls for all Muslims to abandon violence .
The dentist also featured in immigration hearings involving an asylum seeker suspected of providing a safe house for Kamel Bourgass , an Algerian terrorist jailed for life for stabbing PC Stephen Oake to death in Manchester in 2003 .
Mr Butt , the immigration hearing was told , was introduced by his brother to the asylum seeker , who at various points claimed three different identities .
The tribunal was told that Mr Butt was " a respectable and responsible person who wishes to help devout and practising Muslims in difficulty " .
He " did not regard the use of false names as unusual for asylum seekers " .
The headscarf incident is alleged to have happened in 2005 , at a time when between 4,000 and 8,000 people in Bury were unable to find an NHS dentist .
According to the charges , Mr Butt " asked to speak to Patient A in private .
" In the course of conversation with Patient A you : ( a ) asked whether she was Muslim ; ( b ) told her words to the effect that , in order to receive treatment from you , she needed to wear appropriate Islamic dress ; ( c ) quoted to her parts of the Ahadith . "
The Ahadith is a series of instructions on behaviour attributed to Prophet Mohammed but not written as part of the Koran .
The charge continues : " You told Patient A that , if she did not wear a headscarf , she would need to register with another dentist .
You instructed your dental nurse to give Patient A her headscarf .
" The dental nurse took Patient A to another room where she was given the nurse 's headscarf to wear .
" In seeking to impose an Islamic dress code on Patient A in order for treatment to be provided you undermined public confidence in the profession by discriminating against Patient A . "
If the charges are upheld , the Porsche - driving dentist will be found guilty of serious professional misconduct .
Penalties can range from a public warning to suspension and being struck off .
Tory MP Sir Paul Beresford , a former minister and a dentist , said : " When a patient comes to see me I have no concern with their religion .
I do not ask Muslim patients to read the Bible .
" My practice tries to respect religious belief .
For example , during Ramadan we try to help Muslim patients by making sure they do not have to swallow water when they are fasting .
We do not ask patients to become Christians . "
Women staff at Mr Butt 's Bury practice do not routinely wear headscarves while at work .
One female patient said : " I think it is a pretty outrageous thing to ask but I have never felt as if I am being discriminated against at this practice as a Western woman .
" If I was then I would certainly make a full complaint .
If it is true then it shows a reverse prejudice bordering on racism . "
Mr Butt was involved in another controversial incident earlier this year when police stopped his Porsche 911 and said they could not read its customised number plate .
The dentist recorded the subsequent search of the car on his mobile phone and passed the video to the BBC , which broadcast it on a local news bulletin .
It shows Mr Butt asking an officer : " Are you a racist ? "
The dentist was then arrested for racially aggravated behaviour .
There were no charges , and a complaint against the police by Mr Butt is still being considered .
Mr Butt was unavailable for comment yesterday .
Staff at his practice said he was on holiday .
Couple : HIV 2 Year Old Barred from Pool Pair upset to learn RV park would not allow foster son to use facilities .
July 8 , 2007  --
A couple says their vacation was ruined when an RV park owner told them they were n't welcome after discovering their 2 - year - old foster son had the HIV virus .
Last week , Dick and Silvia Glover went to the Wales West RV Park in Silver Hill , Ala. , with their foster son Caleb .
When the boy was banned from using the pool and showers , the Glovers said they were offered an uncomfortable and painful choice :
They could either keep Caleb out of the water or leave .
" We were n't sure if somebody could get the virus if the child upchucked on them or from blood or what , " said Ken Zadnichek , the park 's owner .
" We did n't know what the risk was .
That 's why we asked for something from their doctor or the county health department . "
Dick Glover said the request for a doctor 's note made it clear Caleb was unwelcome .
An Alabama newspaper quoted Zadnichek as saying , " I 'm not responsible for their feelings .
I 'm responsible for the well - being of everybody in the park .
If their feelings got hurt , I 'm sorry .
That 's the way it 's got to be . "
Upset and dismayed , the couple left with its son .
" Here we are paying for the facilities , but there 's certain ones our son can't use , " Dick Glover said .
Glover said today on " Good Morning America Weekend Edition " that he could understand where Zadnichek was coming from , but added Zadnichek should have been more informed about HIV and AIDS .
" Little Caleb , he was innocent as can be , " Glover said .
" It was not he 's fault he was born with AIDS . "
Silvia Glover said it never occurred to her Caleb 's HIV status would be an issue .
In fact , the matter came up in a casual conversation with a desk clerk when she told the attendant of her plans to adopt the toddler .
The Glovers said they chose the location because of their son's love of trains .
Wales
West features steam and diesel locomotives -- similar to ones used by the mining industry in Wales -- on a railway that circles a small lake .
Complicating matters is the fact that 69 - year - old Dick Glover suffers from advanced non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
He is expected to have 18 months to live .
Silvia Glover said some Americans are not educated enough about HIV .
" They do n't know near enough , especially that children are totally innocent and represent no danger to the public , " she said .
Medical experts said the HIV virus is unable to spread through casual contact .
" There 's absolutely no way you can get HIV from a pool or a shower casual contact using the same facilities , " said David Little , director of South Alabama CARES , an AIDS education and outreach organization that serves 12 counties in south Alabama .
" It just does n't happen . "
The Glovers said Caleb is a happy child who they just wanted to please because his life expectancy is only seven years .
A wealth of human history lies submerged in ancient cities at the bottoms of lakes , seas and oceans of the world .
Some of these urban centers were sent into the water via earthquakes , tsunamis or other disasters thousands of years ago .
Many rui have just recently been rediscovered , by accident or through emergent technological innovations .
Some have even caused scientists to question the history of human civilization .
( Check out our complete collection of Underwater and Oceanic Oddities . )
Alexandria , Egypt :
Off the shores of Alexandria , the city of Alexander the Great , lie what are believed to be the ruins of the royal quarters of Cleopatra .
It is believed that earthquakes over 1,500 years ago were responsible for casting this into the sea , along with artifacts , statues and other parts of Cleopatra ’s palace .
The city of Alexandria even plans to offer underwater tours of this wonder .
Bay of Cambay , India : A few years back discovered the remains of a vast 9,500 year old city .
This submerged ruin has intact architecture and human remains .
More significantly , this find predates all finds in the area by over 5,000 years , forcing historians to reevaluate their understanding of the history of civilazation in the region .
The find has been termed Dwarka , or the ‘ Golden City , ’ after an ancient city - in - the sea said to belong to the Hindu god Krishna .
Kwan Phayao , Thailand :
In itself perhaps not unusual , a 500 year old Thai temple sits at the bottom of lake Phayao .
What makes this case strange is that the lake was actually made intentionally about 70 years ago , and that there has been recent discussion of potentially restoring the temple at the cost of billions of dollars .
However , the ruins serve as a habitat for fish that many have argued should remain untouched .
Yonaguni - Jima , Japan : Discovered by a dive tour guide some twenty years ago , controversies have arisen around a mysterious pyramids found off the coast of Japan .
These structures seem to have been carved right out of bedrock in a teraforming process using tools previously thought unavailable to ancient cultures of the region .
Havana , Cuba :
A team of scientists continues to explore megalithic ruins found in the Yucatan Channel near Cuba .
They have found evidence of an extensive urban environment stretching for miles along the ocean shore .
Some believe that the civilization that inhabited these predates all known ancient American cultures .
So far , only computer models of this mysterious underwater city exist .
North Sea , Europe : A lost natural landscape was found recently under the North Sea , once occupied by human hunter - gatherers over 10,000 years ago .
What were once rivers , lakes and oceans are now all at the bottom of the sea , only made known through digital mapping .
Scientists theorize that this amazingly well - preserved landscape was at the heart of an ancient civilization spread across Europe .
Atlantis , Antarctica ?
Over a hundred years ago , a museum curator in Istanbul made a remarkable discovery .
Examining an ancient map on gazelle skin , he found a location marking a mountain chain where Antarctica is today .
This map is , amazingly , one of many pieces of evidence people have used to try and claim that , in fact , Antarctica is the fabled lost continent of Atlantis .
Other evidence includes the recent discovery ( via sonar technology ) of land under Antarctica as well as the mapping systems used by ancient cartographers , which suggest Atlantis might have been located far from the Mediterranean Sea .

When suspected Al Qaeda operative Jose Padilla was whisked from the criminal justice system to military custody in June 2002 , it was done for a key purpose – to break his will to remain silent .
As a US citizen , Mr. Padilla enjoyed a right against forced self - incrimination .
But this constitutional guarantee vanished the instant President Bush declared him an enemy combatant .
For a month , agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been questioning Padilla in New York City under the rules of the criminal justice system .
They wanted to know about his alleged involvement in a plot to detonate a radiological " dirty bomb " in the US .
Padilla had nothing to say .
Now , military interrogators were about to turn up the heat .
Padilla was delivered to the US Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston , S.C. , where he was held not only in solitary confinement but as the sole detainee in a high - security wing of the prison .
Fifteen other cells sat empty around him .
The purpose of the extraordinary privacy , according to experts familiar with the technique , was to eliminate the possibility of human contact .
No voices in the hallway .
No conversations with other prisoners .
No tapping out messages on the walls .
No ability to maintain a sense of human connection , a sense of place or time .
In essence , experts say , the US government was trying to break Padilla 's silence by plunging him into a mental twilight zone .
Padilla was not the only Al Qaeda suspect locked away in isolation .
Although harsh interrogation methods such as water - boarding , forced hypothermia , sleep deprivation , and stress positions draw more media attention , use of isolation to " soften up " detainees for questioning is much more common .
" It is clear that the intent of this isolation was to break Padilla for the purpose of the interrogations that were to follow , " says Stuart Grassian , a Boston psychiatrist and nationally recognized expert on the debilitating effects of solitary confinement .
Dr. Grassian conducted a detailed examination of Padilla for his lawyers .
Padilla is on trial in Miami on charges that he became a willing recruit and attended an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan .
Padilla denies the allegations .
Jury deliberations in the three - month trial are expected to begin this week .
Although the issue of Padilla 's treatment in the brig arose briefly in the Miami case , no judge has ruled on its legality .
According to defense motions on file in the case , Padilla 's cell measured nine feet by seven feet .
The windows were covered over .
There was a toilet and sink .
The steel bunk was missing its mattress .
He had no pillow .
No sheet .
No clock .
No calendar .
No radio .
No television .
No telephone calls .
No visitors .
Even Padilla 's lawyer was prevented from seeing him for nearly two years .
For significant periods of time the Muslim convert was denied any reading material , including the Koran .
The mirror on the wall was confiscated .
Meals were slid through a slot in the door .
The light in his cell was always on .
Those who have n't experienced solitary confinement can imagine that life locked in a small space would be inconvenient and boring .
But according to a broad range of experts who have studied the issue , isolation can be psychologically devastating .
Extreme isolation , in concert with other coercive techniques , can literally drive a person insane , these experts say .
And that makes it a potential instrument of torture , they add .
Interrogators say the whole point of an interrogation is to overcome a detainee 's will to resist .
Some try to build rapport .
Others prefer a tougher approach .
" These are interrogations , they are not job interviews .
So there has to be a certain amount of unpleasantness about it , " says David DeBatto , a retired Army counter - intelligence agent and former interrogator .
" You have to set the tone and the atmosphere .
Some of that can include sensory deprivation , which means [ the subject ] is in a closed room , there is no sound , and he stays in there for various amounts of time . "
At that point , the interrogator must make a crucial judgment .
" The question is : How long is too long ?
Is it a day ?
Is it a week ?
Is it a month ? " Mr. DeBatto says .
When then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved isolation as an aggressive interrogation technique for use at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , Defense Department lawyers included a warning .
" This technique is not known to have been generally used for interrogation purposes for longer than 30 days , " the April 2003 memo reads in part .
Longer than that required Mr. Rumsfeld 's approval .
By April 2003 , Padilla had already spent 10 months in isolation at the brig .
Ultimately , he was housed in the same cell , alone in his wing , for three years and seven months , according to court documents .
" I 'm not a psychologist , but if he is not profoundly psychologically disturbed from that experience then he is a stronger man than me , " says Steven Kleinman , a retired US Air Force Reserve colonel and former interrogator .
Padilla was visited by a military psychologist upon his arrival at the Charleston brig in early June 2002 .
The brief screening report says Padilla was not experiencing any mental - health concerns .
But he did n't see another psychologist again for nearly two years , according to a report filed by psychologist Patricia Zapf of New York , who examined Padilla and his brig records at the request of Padilla 's lawyers in his ongoing trial .
When the screening reports resumed in mid-2004 , Padilla 's mood is described as " anxious " and later as " elevated . "
There is no indication that he was given a full psychological evaluation , Ms. Zapf 's report says .
" In my opinion , it appears unusual that someone held in solitary confinement for upwards of three years would not have undergone a more thorough and regular evaluation of [ his ] mental state . "
The new Army Field Manual bars the use of isolation to achieve psychological disorientation through sensory deprivation .
" Sensory deprivation is defined as an arranged situation causing significant psychological distress due to a prolonged absence , or significant reduction , of the usual external stimuli and perceptual opportunities , " the manual states .
" Sensory deprivation may result in extreme anxiety , hallucinations , bizarre thoughts , depression , and anti-social behavior .
Detainees will not be subject to sensory deprivation . "
Despite the tough words , the field manual offers only a general prohibition .
So - called coercive interrogation methods – including isolation – have been specially authorized for certain units in the military and the Central Intelligence Agency .
The technique is not new .
The Soviets used isolation and sensory deprivation to identify and discredit political dissidents .
US prisoners of war confessed to nonexistent war crimes in the Korean War after similar treatment .
Fear of " brainwashing " prompted the CIA and Defense Department to underwrite research in the 1950s and '60s into the impact of isolation and sensory deprivation .
The findings were included in a 1963 CIA handbook , later declassified .
The book discusses the possible use of such techniques , including isolation .
But it warns of the " profound moral objection " of applying " duress past the point of irreversible psychological damage . "
That 's what happened in Padilla 's case , says Grassian .
" It is clear from examining Mr. Padilla that that limit was surpassed . "
He has " undergone a profound , tremendously prolonged psychological stress involving extended periods of utter isolation and deprivation , " the psychiatrist writes .
Grassian 's report concludes : " Given the extensive research on this issue , much of it funded by the United States government , it follows necessarily that the United States government was well aware of the likely consequences of its conduct in regard to Mr. Padilla . "
Officials have repeatedly said that the US does n't use torture .
" The Department of Defense policy is clear – we treat all detainees humanely , " says Navy Cmdr. J.D. Gordon , a Defense Department spokesman .
" The United States operates safe , humane , and professional detention operations for unlawful enemy combatants who are providing valuable information in preventing further terrorist attacks . "
He adds that no direct evidence has been presented that Padilla was tortured .
In preparing his report , Grassian studied the daily activity log maintained by staff members working at the brig .
He discovered a particularly intense period of isolation from late November 2002 to early April 2003 .
Padilla has referred to this period as the " terrible time . "
" It was not unusual for Mr. Padilla to go four , five , or six days without even brief [ visual checks ] by the brig staff , who were , in any event , under instruction not to converse with him , " Grassian writes .
Other than the brief checks by brig guards , Padilla went through stretches of 34 days , 17 days and 15 days without any human contact , the report says .
" And when he did have such contact , it was inevitably with an interrogator , " Grassian says .
That was by design .
Vice Adm. Lowell Jacoby , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , revealed a portion of the government 's interrogation strategy in a 2003 court affidavit .
" The Defense Intelligence Agency 's approach to interrogation is largely dependent upon creating an atmosphere of dependency and trust between the subject and interrogator , " he wrote .
" Anything that threatens the perceived dependency and trust between the subject and interrogator directly threatens the value of interrogation as an intelligence - gathering tool . "
Admiral Jacoby wrote the affidavit to urge a New York federal court not to allow Padilla to consult his lawyer .
Grassian , the psychiatrist , disagrees with Jacoby 's suggestion that Padilla 's isolation would build trust : " What the government is attempting to do is create an atmosphere of dependency and terror . "
The issue is much larger than the Padilla case .
This weekend , the American Psychological Association will meet in San Francisco .
A vocal part of the group is urging the APA to embrace a ban on detention and interrogation work by its members .
Psychologists should use their knowledge and expertise for healing , they say .
Others counter that using one 's professional expertise to help protect the country is an honorable motive .
In addition , some say the presence of psychologists at detention and interrogation centers can help prevent abuses before they arise .

Clearly You People Thought I Was Kidding
Well , who ’s laughing now ?
And now , an actual phone call :
Me ( to Krissy ) :
So , would you mind if I tape bacon to the cat ?
Krissy :
That ’s a fairly interesting question .
What ’s the purpose here ?
Me : I put taping bacon to the cat on a list of things I said I was going to do today and people seemed to be skeptical .
Krissy :
You said you were going to tape bacon to the cat on the Whatever .
Me : Yeah .
Krissy ( audible sigh ) :
Since you are going to do it , and take a picture of it , all I ask is that you take the bacon off right after .
All right ?
Me : Okay .
Krissy :
You ’re a strange , strange , strange man .

This article , from the September 1985 Free Market ( that is , the Age of Volcker ) , is also timely for the Age of Bernanke .
It was a scene familiar to any nostalgia buff : all - night lines waiting for the banks ( first in Ohio , then in Maryland ) to open ; pompous but mendacious assurances by the bankers that all is well and that the people should go home ; a stubborn insistence by depositors to get their money out ; and the consequent closing of the banks by government , while at the same time the banks were permitted to stay in existence and collect the debts due them by their borrowers .
In other words , instead of government protecting private property and enforcing voluntary contracts , it deliberately violated the property of the depositors by barring them from retrieving their own money from the banks .
All this was , of course , a replay of the early 1930s : the last era of massive runs on banks .
On the surface the weakness was the fact that the failed banks were insured by private or state deposit insurance agencies , whereas the banks that easily withstood the storm were insured by the federal government ( FDIC for commercial banks ; FSLIC for savings and loan banks ) .
But why ?
What is the magic elixir possessed by the federal government that neither private firms nor states can muster ?
The defenders of the private insurance agencies noted that they were technically in better financial shape than FSLIC or FDIC , since they had greater reserves per deposit dollar insured .
How is it that private firms , so far superior to government in all other operations , should be so defective in this one area ?
Is there something unique about money that requires federal control ?
The answer to this puzzle lies in the anguished statements of the savings and loan banks in Ohio and in Maryland , after the first of their number went under because of spectacularly unsound loans .
" What a pity , " they in effect complained , " that the failure of this one unsound bank should drag the sound banks down with them ! "
But in what sense is a bank " sound " when one whisper of doom , one faltering of public confidence , should quickly bring the bank down ?
In what other industry does a mere rumor or hint of doubt swiftly bring down a mighty and seemingly solid firm ?
What is there about banking that public confidence should play such a decisive and overwhelmingly important role ?
The answer lies in the nature of our banking system , in the fact that both commercial banks and thrift banks ( mutual - savings and savings - and - loan ) have been systematically engaging in fractional - reserve banking : that is , they have far less cash on hand than there are demand claims to cash outstanding .
For commercial banks , the reserve fraction is now about 10 percent ; for the thrifts it is far less .
This means that the depositor who thinks he has $ 10,000 in a bank is misled ; in a proportionate sense , there is only , say , $ 1,000 or less there .
And yet , both the checking depositor and the savings depositor think that they can withdraw their money at any time on demand .
Obviously , such a system , which is considered fraud when practiced by other businesses , rests on a confidence trick : that is , it can only work so long as the bulk of depositors do not catch on to the scare and try to get their money out .
The confidence is essential , and also misguided .
That is why once the public catches on , and bank runs begin , they are irresistible and cannot be stopped .
We now see why private enterprise works so badly in the deposit insurance business .
For private enterprise only works in a business that is legitimate and useful , where needs are being fulfilled .
It is impossible to " insure " a firm , even less so an industry , that is inherently insolvent .
Fractional reserve banks , being inherently insolvent , are uninsurable .
What , then , is the magic potion of the federal government ?
Why does everyone trust the FDIC and FSLIC even though their reserve ratios are lower than private agencies , and though they too have only a very small fraction of total insured deposits in cash to stem any bank run ?
The answer is really quite simple : because everyone realizes , and realizes correctly , that only the federal government  and not the states or private firms  can print legal tender dollars .
Everyone knows that , in case of a bank run , the U.S. Treasury would simply order the Fed to print enough cash to bail out any depositors who want it .
The Fed has the unlimited power to print dollars , and it is this unlimited power to inflate that stands behind the current fractional reserve banking system .
Yes , the FDIC and FSLIC " work , " but only because the unlimited monopoly power to print money can " work " to bail out any firm or person on earth .
For it was precisely bank runs , as severe as they were that , before 1933 , kept the banking system under check , and prevented any substantial amount of inflation .
But now bank runs  at least for the overwhelming majority of banks under federal deposit insurance  are over , and we have been paying and will continue to pay the horrendous price of saving the banks : chronic and unlimited inflation .
Putting an end to inflation requires not only the abolition of the Fed but also the abolition of the FDIC and FSLIC .
At long last , banks would be treated like any firm in any other industry .
In short , if they ca n’t meet their contractual obligations they will be required to go under and liquidate .
It would be instructive to see how many banks would survive if the massive governmental props were finally taken away .

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
Eric Traut , one of Microsoft 's chief operating system design engineers , gave a fascinating demo ( WMV ) recently at the University of Illinois , where he talked about where the Windows core is going and ended with a sneak peek at the kernel of the next version of Windows , known by the exciting codename of " Windows 7 . "
The demo showed what Windows would look like if it was literally stripped down to the core , showing the kind of work that is going on to optimize the aging NT kernel .
Traut runs a team of about 200 software engineers at Microsoft that is responsible for the core kernel scheduling , memory management , boot sequence , and virtualization technology such as Virtual PC and Virtual Server .
The latter technologies are becoming more and more important as servers get more powerful and gain more and more CPU cores , and it was clear from the demonstration that Microsoft is placing significant effort into integrating virtual machine technology into everything that they do .
The release of Virtual PC as a free download last year was just the beginning : Windows Server 2008 will ship with significant VM enhancements , and Windows 7 will only carry on from there .
Windows 7
Why " Windows 7 " ?
The number is based on Microsoft 's internal operating system numbers : the first version of Windows NT , 3.1 , was given the same number as the " Classic " Windows when it was released in 1992 .
Since then there has been NT 4 , Windows 2000 ( NT 5 ) , Windows XP ( NT 5.1 ) , and Windows Vista ( NT 6 ) .
You can check these numbers by typing " ver " at a command prompt on any of these operating systems .
Windows 7 core running in a VM .
Note the snazzy ASCII startup screen .
Traut ran a stripped - down version of Windows 7 called " MinWin " that included only the core kernel : for the first time Windows NT has been seen running naked , without even a GUI to dress itself .
It ran only a miniature web server that would display simple HTML pages , including some dynamically - generated pages that showed the task list and other properties of MinWin itself .
Thirteen tasks were running , most of which would be familiar to anyone who has opened Task Manager : smss.exe , csrss.exe , and svchost .
exe were all there , plus the mini web server httpsrv.exe .
The OS ran under Virtual PC , and this allowed Traut to show the audience exactly how many resources it was consuming : about 25 MB on disk ( compare with 14GB for a full Vista install ) and 40 MB of RAM .
The OS booted up in about 20 seconds inside Virtual PC .
Still not quite as lightweight as , say , AmigaOS or QNX , but remarkably small for Windows .
Traut admitted that he would " still like to see it get smaller . "
A virtual future
Traut , like most good engineers , is honest about the pros and cons of code that he works on .
" I fully admit that there are some major problems in the Windows OS that are driving some of these [ improvements in the core and virtual machine technology ] " he said , in full self - deprecating mode .
He reviewed some of the reasons one might want to run older operating systems in a VM , such as backwards compatibility and resource management .
The idea , of course , has been around for a long time — Windows NT 3.1 ran older 16 - bit programs in a VM called " Windows on Windows " or " WOW " for short .
The technology has improved since then , however .
Windows Server Virtualization , like VMWare ESX and Xen on Linux , will run in what is called " Hypervisor " mode , where a host OS is not needed .
This greatly improves performance and can take full advantage of new on - chip VM hardware from companies like Intel .
Parts of this technology will appear as " Viridian " as an add - on for Windows Server 2008 .
Traut does n't believe virtual machines are a panacea , however ; he said that sometimes they could be used as a " crutch " to solve a problem that could be better addressed by improving the core of the operating system itself .
However , in server applications , VMs are clearly an idea whose time has come .
Powerful servers that can run multiple OSes at once can blur the line between traditional PC hardware and big-iron mainframes and increase the power of an existing datacenter .
Compatibility is another big advantage of VMs .
Traut showed , just for fun , Windows versions 1.03 , 2.11 , " Classic " 3.1 , and NT 4.0 , running under Virtual PC .
Few people need to run applications that are designed for these ancient operating environments , but the point was to demonstrate how VMs can solve even the trickiest of compatibility problems by simply running the entire OS that the application was written for .
If you do n't want to sit through the entire one - hour presentation , istartedsomething .com has a handy nine - minute excerpt with the MinWin demo .
The Aggregate Magic Algorithms
There are lots of people and places that create and collect algorithms of all types ( here are a few WWW sites ) .
Unfortunately , in building systems hardware and software , we in The Aggregate often have found it necessary to do relatively obscure low - level things very efficiently .
Many of the tricks we 've devised or collected either require assembly language coding or are not entirely portable when coded in HLLs like C , but these techniques are still valuable because they can yield significant performance improvements over the more obvious ways of doing things .
None of the following coding tricks came from proprietary sources ; further , we believe that each of the tricks we did not invent is essentially " standard engineering practice " in the specialized niche where it applies .
Thus , although we have not conducted patent searches , etc. , to confirm it , we believe that these are tricks that freely can be used for any purpose .
Of course , The Aggregate accepts no responsibility for your use of these tricks ; you must confirm that the trick does what you want and that you can use it as you intend .
That said , we do intend to maintain this page by adding new algorithms and / or correcting existing entries .
If you have any comments , please contact Professor Hank Dietz .

Absolute Value of a Float
IEEE floating point uses an explicit sign bit , so the absolute value can be taken by a bitwise AND with the complement of the sign bit .
For IA32 32 - bit , the sign bit is an int value of 0x80000000 , for IA32 64 - bit , the sign bit is the long long int value 0x8000000000000000 .
Of course , if you prefer to use just int values , the IA32 64 - bit sign bit is 0x80000000 at an int address offset of +1 .
For example :
double x ; /* make x = abs( x ) */ *( (( int *) &x ) + 1 ) &= 0x7 fffffff ;
Alignment of Pointers
Alignment of pointers is a pretty common problem , and there are several relevant tricks , so , at the suggestion of Jean - Charles Meyrignac ( who also provided an example of the upward alignment described below ) , I 've added a little description here .
It is fairly obvious that the downward alignment of an address a to a multiple - of - b boundary , where b is a power of 2 , is simply ( a & ~ ( b - 1 ) ) .
Of course , ~ ( b - 1 ) is also - b , so ( a & - b ) also works ( the difference is usually nothing ; if b is a constant , most compilers will fold the first into the second form ) .
For upward alignment , we simply add b- 1 : ( ( a + ( b - 1 ) ) & - b ) .
Of course , there are a few complications .
First , languages like C , which allow pointer arithmetic , generally scale pointer offsets by the size of the target object -- which would keep our math from working .
It used to be that casting a pointer as a ( char *) would turn - off this scaling , but with long char and such out there , a cast as ( void * ) is probably a safer bet .
Unfortunately , C does n't define bitwise operations on pointers of any flavor , so you 'll need to cast to an appropriately - large integer type before doing a bitwise AND .
Secondly , aligning an address does n't help unless you allocated a large enough chunk of memory so that you can treat your data structure as starting at the aligned address .
In general , if you wish to create a b - aligned data structure with c bytes , you would do something like : a= ( ( typeof ( a ) ) ( ( ( int ) ( ( ( void *) malloc ( c + ( b - 1 ) ) ) + ( b - 1 ) ) ) &- b ) ) .
Please excuse my use of the GCC typeof ( ) .
Anyway , this is particularly useful for cache - line alignment of data structures .
One little annoyance : you can't call free ( a ) ; you 'll need to keep a copy of the original block address for that .
Average of Integers
This is actually an extension of the " well known " fact that for binary integer values x and y , ( x+y ) equals ( ( x&y ) + ( x|y ) ) equals ( ( x^y ) +2*( x&y ) ) .
Given two integer values x and y , the ( floor of the ) average normally would be computed by ( x+y ) / 2 ; unfortunately , this can yield incorrect results due to overflow .
A very sneaky alternative is to use ( x&y ) + ( ( x^y ) / 2 ) .
If we are aware of the potential non-portability due to the fact that C does not specify if shifts are signed , this can be simplified to ( x&y ) + ( ( x^y ) > > 1 ) .
In either case , the benefit is that this code sequence cannot overflow .
Bit Reversal
Reversing the bits in an integer x is somewhat painful , but here 's a SWAR algorithm for a 32 - bit value :
unsigned int reverse ( register unsigned int x ) { x = ( ( ( x & 0xaaaaaaaa ) >>
1 ) | ( ( x & 0x55555555 ) << 1 ) ) ; x = ( ( ( x & 0xcccccccc ) >>
2 ) | ( ( x & 0x33333333 ) << 2 ) ) ; x = ( ( ( x & 0xf0f0f0f0 ) >>
4 ) | ( ( x & 0x0f0f0f0 f ) << 4 ) ) ; x = ( ( ( x & 0xff00ff00 ) >>
8 ) | ( ( x & 0x00 ff00 ff ) << 8 ) ) ; return ( ( x >> 16 ) | ( x << 16 ) ) ; }
It also is possible to re-write this algorithm to use 4 instead of 8 constants , thus saving some instruction bandwidth .
On my 1.2GHz Athlon ( a Thunderbird ) , the difference is too small to measure reliably .
Here 's the other version :
unsigned int reverse ( register unsigned int x ) { register unsigned int y = 0x55555555 ; x = ( ((x >>
1 ) & y ) | ( ( x & y ) << 1 ) ) ; y = 0x33333333 ; x = ( ((x >>
2 ) & y ) | ( ( x & y ) << 2 ) ) ; y = 0x0f0f0 f0 f ; x = ( ((x >>
4 ) & y ) | ( ( x & y ) << 4 ) ) ; y = 0x00 ff00 ff ; x = ( ((x >>
8 ) & y ) | ( ( x & y ) << 8 ) ) ; return ( ( x >> 16 ) | ( x << 16 ) ) ; }
Comparison of Float Values
IEEE floating point has a number of nice properties , including the ability to use 2's complement integer comparisons to compare floating point values , provided the native byte order is consistent between float and integer values .
The only complication is the use of sign + magnitude representation in floats .
The AMD Athlon Processor x86 Code Optimization Guide gives a nice summary on Page 43 .
Here 's a set of C routines that embody the same logic :
# define FasI ( f ) ( *( ( int *) & ( f ) ) ) # define FasUI ( f ) ( *( ( unsigned int *) & ( f ) ) ) # define lt0 ( f ) ( FasUI ( f ) > 0x80000000U ) # define le0 ( f ) ( FasI ( f ) <= 0 ) # define gt0 ( f ) ( FasI ( f ) > 0 ) # define ge0 ( f ) ( FasUI ( f ) <= 0x80000000U )
Comparison to Mask Conversion
In many cases , it is useful to convert the result of a comparison , which is either 0 or some non-zero bit pattern , into either a " clean " 0 or - 1 bit mask .
For many systems , this can be efficienty done by C code that simply uses the logic operators and negation : -( x!=0 ) or -!!x .
This is a very well known and old method , really a direct consequence of ( and partial motivation for ) the C concept of conditional results being integers .
However , for some compilers and instruction sets ( especially SWAR targets ) , the code generated for logicals is terrible , sometimes even including conditional branches !
Where this obvious coding does n't work well , here are some alternatives .
If the messy non-negative integer value is x , the sanitized version is :
( ( ( int ) ( - x ) ) >> ( WORDBITS - 1 ) )
To remove the constraint that the messy value be non-negative , use :
( ( ( int ) ( x | - x ) ) >> ( WORDBITS - 1 ) )
Logically , this works because the shift by ( WORDBITS - 1 ) replicates the sign bit to create a mask -- be aware , however , that the C language does not require that shifts are signed even if their operands are signed , so there is a potential portability problem .
Additionally , one might think that a shift by any number greater than or equal to WORDBITS would have the same effect , but many instruction sets have shifts that behave strangely when such shift distances are specified .
Of course , the opposite condition can be tested using :
( (( int ) ~( x | - x ) ) >>
( WORDBITS - 1 ) )
If you prefer the C - standard 0 or 1 comparison result , simply use the unsigned shift :
( ( ( unsigned int ) ( x | - x ) ) >> ( WORDBITS - 1 ) )
The opposite condition can be obtained using :
( ( ( unsigned int ) ~( x | - x ) ) >>
( WORDBITS - 1 ) )
Dual - Linked List with One Pointer Field
Normally , a dual - linked circular list would contain both previous and next pointer fields and the current position in the list would be identified by a single pointer .
By using two current pointers , one to the node in question and the other to the one just before / after it , it becomes possible to store only a single pointer value in each node .
The value stored in each node is the XOR of the next and previous pointers that normally would have been stored in each node .
Decoding is obvious .
Unfortunately , using this trick in C is awkward because the XOR operation is not defined for pointers .
Divide Rounding
Joe Ibershoff , one of my students , pointed - out that integer divide normally yields the floor , but both ceiling and round - to - nearest are easy and useful .
I thought these were fairly well - known tricks closely related to the Alignment of Pointers magic , but perhaps they are n't so obvious ...?
He points out that Ceiling ( a /b ) is ( a+b - 1 ) / b and RoundToNearest ( a /b ) is ( a + ( b / 2 ) ) / b .
Of course , these tricks also work if divide is implemented in less obvious ways , such as shifts or shift - and - subtract sequences .
GPU Any
A basic SIMD operation , " any " is a logical - OR reduction that returns true if any of its inputs are true .
On SIMD hardware , this is usually very easy ... but not so on GPUs ( Graphics Processing Units ) .
NVIDIA 's CUDA has recently added hardware support , but there is a more portable way that is just as fast .
The p_any ( flag ) operation within a block can be accomplished by :
if ( flag ) sharedtemp = serial ; /* maskable store */ __syncthreads ( ) ; /* optional with right block size */ p_any = ( sharedtemp == ( serial + + ) ) ;
We first publically announced this at SC08 , and we 're pretty sure we invented it .
The trick is that NVIDIA 's hardware seems to take constant time to resolve N threads storing into the same object , i.e. , it picks a winner .
This behaviour is not documented , but has been experimentally observed ; this p_any ( flag ) will run on any of the CUDA hardware , and takes essentially the same time as the atomic any that was added to later CUDA hardware .
There are actually quite a few useful operations that can be built using variations on this trick ....
GPU SyncBlocks
The most fundamental aggregate function ( or you might call it a collective communication ) is a barrier synchronization .
On SIMD hardware , this is usually implicit ... but not so on GPUs ( Graphics Processing Units ) .
Within a Block , NVIDIA 's CUDA provides a barrier called __syncthreads ( ) .
Across Blocks -- if you are running a number of Blocks that the GPU can timeshare rather than batch process -- you can synchronize using this :
/* First , sync within each Block */ __syncthreads ( ) ; /*
Pick a representative from each ( here , 1D ) block */ if ( threadIdx.x == 0 ) { /*
Get my barrier number */ int barno = barnos [ block Idx.x ] + 1 ; int hisbarno ; int who = ( blockIdx.x + 1 ) % gridDim.x ; /* Check in at barrier */ barnos [ blockIdx.x ] = barno ; /*
Scan for all here or somebody passed */ do { /*
Wait for who */ do { hisbarno = barnos [ who ] ; } while ( hisbarno < barno ) ; /* Bump to next who */ if ( ++ who >= gridDim.x ) who = 0 ; } while ( ( hisbarno == barno ) && ( who != blockIdx . x ) ) ; /*
Tell others we are all here */ barnos [ blockIdx.x ] = barno +
1 ; } /* Rejoin with rest of my Block */ __syncthreads ( ) ;
The above code assumes that barnos [ ] is a volatile ( forced memory access ) array in GPU global memory that is initialized to 0 .
The type can be either int or float ; it is not critical because either way wrap - around will take longer than GPUs will let one kernel run by default .
Cost is O ( number of Blocks ) if all arrive at the same time , but O ( 1 ) for the last to arrive if there is any temporal skew .
The O ( 1 ) behavior is due to counting by 2 per barrier ; if all Blocks typically arrive roughly simultaneously , the algorithm can be simplified to count by 1 .
The OpenCL version of this algorithm has been tested on both NVIDIA and ATI GPUs with good performance .
This algorithm also is the obvious basis for efficient within - a- kernel reductions and scans ....
We first publically showed various GPU variants of this algorithm at SC08 , and it was published within the MS thesis of two of Dietz 's students in July 2009 and September 2009 .
Actually , it is a trivial variation on the lockless shared memory barrier that we developed for SHMAPERS and published over a decade ago .
( In fact , it took less time to synchronize four processors in a Sun server than for one of those processors to execute a single atomic memory instruction ! )
I note the dates because late in 2009 somebody else published and claimed to have invented what is an inferior variant of this algorithm and did not cite us ....
Gray Code Conversion
A Gray code is any binary coding sequence in which only a single bit position changes as we move from one value to the next .
There are many such codes , but the traditional one is computed such that the K th Gray code is K^( K > > 1 ) .
The well - known algorithm for conversion from Gray to binary is a linear sequence of XORs that makes it seem each bit must be dealt with separately .
Fortunately , that is equivalent to a parallel prefix XOR that can be computed using SWAR techniques in log time .
For 32 - bit Gray code values produced as described above , the conversion from Gray code back to unsigned binary is :
unsigned int g2 b ( unsigned int gray ) { gray ^= ( gray >> 16 ) ; gray ^= ( gray >> 8 ) ; gray ^= ( gray >> 4 ) ; gray ^= ( gray >> 2 ) ; gray ^= ( gray >> 1 ) ; return ( gray ) ; }
Integer Constant Multiply
Given an integer value x and an integer or floating point value y , the value of x*y can be computed efficiently using a sequence derived from the binary value of x .
For example , if x is 5 ( 4 + 1 ) :
y2 = y + y ; y4 = y2 + y2 ; result = y + y4 ;
In the special case that y is an integer , this can be done with shifts :
y4 = ( y << 2 ) ; result = y + y4 ;
Integer Minimum or Maximum
Given 2's complement integer values x and y , the minimum can be computed without any branches as x +((( y - x ) >>( WORDBITS - 1 ) ) &( y- x ) ) .
Logically , this works because the shift by ( WORDBITS - 1 ) replicates the sign bit to create a mask -- be aware , however , that the C language does not require that shifts are signed even if their operands are signed , so there is a potential portability problem .
Additionally , one might think that a shift by any number greater than or equal to WORDBITS would have the same effect , but many instruction sets have shifts that behave strangely when such shift distances are specified .
Of course , maximum can be computed using the same trick : x -((( x-y ) >>( WORDBITS - 1 ) ) &( x - y ) ) .
Actually , the Integer Selection coding trick is just as efficient in encoding minimum and maximum ....
Integer Power
Given an integer value x and an integer or floating point value y , the value of y to the x power can be computed efficiently using a sequence derived from the binary value of x .
For example , if x is 5 ( 4 + 1 ) :
y2 = y * y ; y4 = y2 * y2 ; result = y * y4 ;
Integer Selection
A branchless , lookup - free , alternative to code like if ( a < b ) x=c ; else x=d ; is ( (( ( a - b ) >> ( WORDBITS - 1 ) ) & ( c^d ) ) ^ d ) .
This code assumes that the shift is signed , which , of course , C does not promise .
Is Power of 2
A non-negative binary integer value x is a power of 2 iff ( x & ( x - 1 ) ) is 0 using 2's complement arithmetic .
Leading Zero Count
Some machines have had single instructions that count the number of leading zero bits in an integer ; such an operation can be an artifact of having floating point normalization hardware around .
Clearly , floor of base 2 log of x is ( WORDBITS - lzc( x ) ) .
In any case , this operation has found its way into quite a few algorithms , so it is useful to have an efficient implementation :
unsigned int lzc( register unsigned int x ) { x |= ( x >> 1 ) ; x |= ( x >> 2 ) ; x |= ( x >> 4 ) ; x |= ( x >> 8 ) ; x |= ( x >> 16 ) ; return( WORDBITS - ones ( x ) ) ; }
Least Significant 1 Bit
This can be useful for extracting the lowest numbered element of a bit set .
Given a 2's complement binary integer value x , ( x& - x ) is the least significant 1 bit .
( This was pointed - out by Tom May . )
The reason this works is that it is equivalent to ( x & ( ( ~x ) + 1 ) ) ; any trailing zero bits in x become ones in ~x , adding 1 to that carries into the following bit , and AND with x yields only the flipped bit ... the original position of the least significant 1 bit .
Alternatively , since ( x & ( x - 1 ) ) is actually x stripped of its least significant 1 bit , the least significant 1 bit is also ( x ^( x & ( x - 1 ) ) ) .
Log2 of an Integer
Given a binary integer value x , the floor of the base 2 log of that number efficiently can be computed by the application of two variable - precision SWAR algorithms .
The first " folds " the upper bits into the lower bits to construct a bit vector with the same most significant 1 as x , but all 1's below it .
The second SWAR algorithm is population count , defined elsewhere in this document .
However , we must consider the issue of what the log2 ( 0 ) should be ; the log of 0 is undefined , so how that value should be handled is unclear .
The following code for handling a 32 - bit value gives two options : if LOG0UNDEFINED , this code returns - 1 for log2 ( 0 ) ; otherwise , it returns 0 for log 2 ( 0 ) .
For a 32 - bit value :
unsigned int floor_log2 ( register unsigned int x ) { x |= ( x >> 1 ) ; x |= ( x >> 2 ) ; x |= ( x >> 4 ) ; x |= ( x >> 8 ) ; x |= ( x >> 16 ) ; #ifdef LOG0UNDEFINED return ( ones32(x ) - 1 ) ; #else return ( ones32( x >>
1 ) ) ; #endif }
Suppose instead that you want the ceiling of the base 2 log .
The floor and ceiling are identical if x is a power of two ; otherwise , the result is 1 too small .
This can be corrected using the power of 2 test followed with the comparison - to - mask shift used in integer minimum / maximum .
The result is :
unsigned int log2 ( register unsigned int x ) { register int y = ( x & ( x - 1 ) ) ; y |= -y ; y >>= ( WORDBITS - 1 ) ; x |= ( x >> 1 ) ; x |= ( x >> 2 ) ; x |= ( x >> 4 ) ; x |= ( x >> 8 ) ; x |= ( x >> 16 ) ; #ifdef LOG0UNDEFINED return ( ones ( x ) - 1 - y ) ; #else return ( ones ( x >>
1 ) - y ) ; #endif }
Next Largest Power of 2
Given a binary integer value x , the next largest power of 2 can be computed by a SWAR algorithm that recursively " folds " the upper bits into the lower bits .
This process yields a bit vector with the same most significant 1 as x , but all 1's below it .
Adding 1 to that value yields the next largest power of 2 .
For a 32 - bit value :
unsigned int nlpo2 ( register unsigned int x ) { x |= ( x >> 1 ) ; x |= ( x >> 2 ) ; x |= ( x >> 4 ) ; x |= ( x >> 8 ) ; x |= ( x >> 16 ) ; return ( x+1 ) ; }
Most Significant 1 Bit
Given a binary integer value x , the most significant 1 bit ( highest numbered element of a bit set ) can be computed using a SWAR algorithm that recursively " folds " the upper bits into the lower bits .
This process yields a bit vector with the same most significant 1 as x , but all 1's below it .
Bitwise AND of the original value with the complement of the " folded " value shifted down by one yields the most significant bit .
For a 32 - bit value :
unsigned int msb32 ( register unsigned int x ) { x |= ( x >> 1 ) ; x |= ( x >> 2 ) ; x |= ( x >> 4 ) ; x |= ( x >> 8 ) ; x |= ( x >> 16 ) ; return( x & ~( x >> 1 ) ) ; }
Natural Data Type Precision Conversions
For integers used to represent natural data types , simply shifting right works well for conversion to a lower precision , but shifting left is not very effective for converting to a higher precision .
The problem is simply that if the " new " bits are taken to be 0s , the maximum value will never be attained .
Likewise , if taken to be any fixed non - 0 value , the value zero will never be obtained .
A good answer to this problem is to replicate the existing bit pattern in the " new " bits , truncating or repeating the pattern if more bits are needed .
For example , a 10 - bit raw pixel value ( e.g. , from my Canon G1 ) called x can be extended to a 16 - bit value by the expression ( ( x < < 6 ) | ( x > > 4 ) ) .
This way , both the maximum and minimum values are reachable , with good linearity throughout the entire range .
Polynomials
It is fairly obvious , but x0+x1*x+x2*x*x+x3*x*x*x+... always can be rewritten as the usually faster equivalent x0+x *( x1+x *( x2+x *( x3+x *(... ) ) ) ) .
There are various accuracy and other issues , but this sort of obvious transformation should not be overlooked .
Population Count ( Ones Count )
The population count of a binary integer value x is the number of one bits in the value .
Although many machines have single instructions for this , the single instructions are usually microcoded loops that test a bit per cycle ; a log - time algorithm coded in C is often faster .
The following code uses a variable - precision SWAR algorithm to perform a tree reduction adding the bits in a 32 - bit value :
unsigned int ones32 ( register unsigned int x ) { /* 32 - bit recursive reduction using SWAR ... but first step is mapping 2 - bit values into sum of 2 1 - bit values in sneaky way */ x -= ( ( x >> 1 ) & 0x55555555 ) ; x = ( ((x >> 2 ) & 0x33333333 ) + ( x & 0x33333333 ) ) ; x = ( ((x >>
4 ) + x ) & 0x0f0f0f0f ) ; x += ( x >> 8 ) ; x += ( x >> 16 ) ; return( x & 0x0000003f ) ; }
It is worthwhile noting that the SWAR population count algorithm given above can be improved upon for the case of counting the population of multi- word bit sets .
How ?
The last few steps in the reduction are using only a portion of the SWAR width to produce their results ; thus , it would be possible to combine these steps across multiple words being reduced .
One additional note : the AMD Athlon optimization guidelines suggest a very similar algorithm that replaces the last three lines with return ( ( x * 0x01010101 ) >> 24 ) ; .
For the Athlon ( which has a very fast integer multiply ) , I would have expected AMD 's code to be faster ... but it is actually 6 % slower according to my benchmarks using a 1.2GHz Athlon ( a Thunderbird ) .
Why ?
Well , it so happens that GCC does n't use a multiply instruction - it writes out the equivalent shift and add sequence !
Same Within Tolerance
Sometimes it is necessary to test if two integers , a and b , have the same value within a given tolerance , c .
The obvious test would be something like ( ( a > b ) ? ( a - b ) : ( b - a ) ) < c , which is n't horrifically inefficient , but does involve a conditional branch .
Alternatively , abs ( a - b ) < c would do ... but again , it takes some cleverness to implement abs ( ) without a conditional jump .
Here 's a branchless alternative .
If ( a - b ) > 0 , then ( b - a ) < 0 ; similarly , if ( a - b ) < 0 , then ( b - a ) > 0 .
Both can't be greater than 0 simultaneously .
Suppose that ( a - b ) > 0 .
Subtracting ( ( a - b ) - c ) will produce a negative result iff a and b are within c of each other .
Of course , our assumption requires ( b - a ) < 0 , so ( ( b - a ) - c ) simply becomes more negative ( assuming the value does n't wrap around ) .
Generalizing , if either ( ( a - b ) - c ) > 0 or ( ( b - a ) - c ) > 0 then the values of a and b are not the same within tolerance c .
In other words , they are within tolerance if :
( ( ( a - b - c ) & ( b - a- c ) ) < 0 )
This test can be rewritten a variety of ways .
The < 0 part is really just examining the sign bit , so a mask or shift could be used to extract the bit value instead .
For example , using 32 - bit words , ( ( ( a - b - c ) & ( b - a - c ) ) > > 31 ) using unsigned >> will produce the value 1 for true or 0 for false .
It is also possible to factor - out t=a-b , giving :
( ( (t - c ) & ( - t - c ) ) < 0 )
Which is really equivalent to abs ( t ) < c .
Once again , an excellent alternative computation has been provided by Jean - Charles Meyrignac , who observed that checking if v is in the interval [ i .. j ) , which one might normally compute by ( v> =i && v<j ) , can instead be done as ( ( unsigned int ) ( v - i ) < ( j - i ) ) .
Checking if a and b are the same within c is thus basically checking ( ( unsigned int ) ( a - b+ c ) < ( c+c ) ) .
Well , almost .
It actually considers one more value to be in the range than it should ... and it does odd things when values wrap around .
Still , often close enough ....
Shift - and - Add Optimization
Rather obviously , if an integer multiply can be implemented by a shift - and - add sequence , then a shift - and - add sequence can be implemented by multiplying by the appropriate constant ... with some speedup on processors like the AMD Athlon .
Unfortunately , GCC seems to believe constant multiplies should always be converted into shift - and - add sequences , so there is a problem in using this optimization in C source code .
Sign Extension
Although many instruction sets provide single machine instructions that implement sign extension of 2 's - complement integers , I 've been sent a number of tricks for sign extension .
I 've included them here because sign extension instructions generally work only on the data sizes directly understood by the processor , whereas these methods work on any bit precisions .
The most obvious method assumes that you have a signed right shift : to extend an a - bit number x to b bits , shift left by b-a , then signed shift that value right by b-a bits .
I believe this has been widely known and used for many years -- I know I did n't invent it , but used it decades ago .
Jean - Charles Meyrignac suggested a shiftless variation that basically does a 1 - bit add to flip high bits : if n is 2 to the a , simply compute ( ( ( x | - n ) + ( n / 2 ) ) ^ ( n / 2 ) ) .
This version has been posted here for some time ....
However , in August 2010 , Joe Zbiciak sent me a little email with a much cleaner shiftless sign extension : ( ( x ^ n ) - n ) where n is the value of the top bit position in the number to be extended .
Thus , to sign - extend an 8 - bit value x , compute ( ( x ^ 128 ) - 128 ) .
It really could n't be much simpler or more obvious ... at least once you 've been told how to do it . ;-)
Swap Values Without a Temporary
Given two binary integer values , x and y , the values can be exchanged without use of a temporary by :
x ^= y ; /* x ' = ( x^y ) */ y ^= x ; /* y' = ( y ^(x^y ) ) = x */ x ^= y ; /* x ' = ( x^y ) ^x = y */
It should be obvious that this can be done with various operators and their inverses , but xor has the unusual property that it is it 's own inverse .
For example , here it is with modular add and subtract :
x += y ; /* x ' = ( x+y ) */ y = x - y ; /* y' = ( x+y ) -y = x */ x -= y ; /* x ' = ( x+y ) - x = y */
This works on machines that do n't have xor instructions .
It even would also appear to work for floating point values , but where there is a significant difference in magnitude between x and y , there can be a serious loss of accuracy in the value with the smaller magnitude .
For example , if x has a much greater magnitude than y , then ( x+y ) ==x and we end with y=0 .
The interesting thing is that you can losslessly swap floating - point values by treating them as integers and using xor .
SIMD Within A Register ( SWAR ) Operations
Before we coined the name SWAR in Fall 1996 , we already had defined a complete set of basic operations and described how they could be implemented with good efficiency .
On February 4 , 1997 , we posted this fairly complete overview document and there also are slides from a seminar presentation I gave at Purdue .
These methods were used in our SWARC compiler and were detailed in a number of our publications throughout the 1990s .
We had n't posted them on this page because they were so prominently published elsewhere .
However , much to our surprize , United States Patent 7039906 , " Compiler for enabling multiple signed independent data elements per register , " was filed October 20 , 2000 and was issued to IBM on May 2 , 2006 !
By our reading , this patent appears to seriously overlap my and Randy Fisher 's earlier published work -- much of which was cited by the patent examiner .
I am posting this note here so that people who happen to hear about the IBM patent will not be discouraged from using the prior art technologies developed by us , which , by being cited in the patent , are explicitly not covered by the patent .
Trailing Zero Count
Given the Least Significant 1 Bit and Population Count ( Ones Count ) algorithms , it is trivial to combine them to construct a trailing zero count ( as pointed - out by Joe Bowbeer ) :
unsigned int tzc( register int x ) { return ( ones ( ( x & - x ) - 1 ) ) ; }
Other People 's Magic
The following are generally good sources of magic algorithms :
The only thing set in stone is our name .
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday March 11 2007
It is a question that few thought a man aiming to be America 's first black President would ever have to answer : did your family once own slaves ?
But that question is now likely to be asked of Senator Barack Obama , who is bidding for the 2008 presidential nomination of the Democratic Party , in part on the appeal of his bi-racial background .
As the son of a black Kenyan father and a white Kansan mother , Obama has seemed to embody a harmonious vision of America 's multiracial society .
However , recent revelations have thrown up an unexpected twist in the tale .
Obama 's ancestors on his white mother 's side appear to have been slave owners .
William Reitwiesner , an amateur genealogical researcher , has published a history of Obama 's mother 's family and discovered that her ancestors have a distinctly shadowy past .
Reitwiesner traced Obama 's great - great - great - great - grandfather , George Washington Overall , and found that he owned two slaves in Kentucky : a 15 - year - old girl and a 25 - year - old man .
He also found out that Obama 's great - great - great - great - great - grandmother , Mary Duvall , also owned a pair of slaves listed in an 1850 census record .
They were a 60 - year - old man and a 58 - year - old woman .
In fact , the Duvalls were a wealthy family whose members were descended from a major landowner , Maureen Duvall , whose estate owned at least 18 slaves in the 17th century .
The news comes at a time when Obama is engaged in a fierce battle with Senator Hillary Clinton to woo black voters in their bids to get the Democratic presidential nomination .
It also comes ahead of appearances by both Clinton and Obama today in Selma , Alabama , to mark the anniversary of a famous 1965 civil rights march .
This is hardly the best time to be exposed as the descendant of slave owners .
Reitwiesner has posted his research , which he warns is a ' first draft ' , on his website , wargs.com .
However , the news is unlikely to be a serious political problem for Obama , despite the fact that some black commentators have accused him of not being a real black American .
Nor is he likely to be alone in finding out that his white ancestors once owned the ancestors of his fellow black Americans .
America , like Britain , is caught in the grip of a frenzy of genealogical research .
Dozens of websites have sprung up , allowing fast and easy access to all sorts of historical records and prompting many Americans to research their family trees .
That can throw up some very surprising results .
In fact , last week Obama was not even the only black politician to find out some unusual personal history .
The civil rights campaigner , the Reverend Al Sharpton was stunned to discover his slave ancestors were owned by the late politician Strom Thurmond , who once ran for President on a staunchly racist segregationist platform .
The pair might even be related .
The news prompted Sharpton to issue a statement about his private agony at the revelation .
' Words cannot fully describe the feelings I had when I learned the awful truth .
Not only I am the descendant of slaves , but my family had to endure the particular agony of being slaves to the Thurmonds . '
Obama 's campaign team have handled the news of his family 's slaving past a bit more casually and a lot less emotionally , issuing a statement saying such a family background was ' representative of America ' .
That is certainly true .
Slavery was the economic bedrock of the American economy in the South before the Civil War .
It would come as no surprise that anyone tracing their family roots back to the pre-war South would find that his descendants had owned slaves .
But more edifying discoveries can come from looking at the past too .
Another of Obama 's ancestors , his great - great - great - grandfather , Christopher Columbus Clark , fought for the Union army in the Civil War .
As a result Obama can also lay claim to relatives who risked their lives to end slavery .
' While a relative owned slaves , another fought for the Union , ' said Obama spokesman Bill Burton in a statement .
Perhaps it is just another case of Obama 's complex past showing that he can have it both ways .

This article is a small sample from DISCOVER 's special issue , The Brain : An Owner 's Manual .
“ Can machines think ? ”
In 1950 mathematician Alan Turing pondered this question and invented an elegant game to answer it :
Let a human chat via Teletype with a computer and another human ; if the person ca n’t determine which is the computer , then it meets Turing ’s standards for “ thinking . ”
In recent years Turing ’s game has taken on a life of its own in cyberspace , thanks to artificial intelligence inventors worldwide who have produced dozens of “ chatbots ” that anyone can talk to .
Most chatbots rely on fairly simple tricks to appear lifelike .
Richard Wallace , creator of the top - ranked chatbot ALICE ( Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity ) , has handwritten a database of thousands of possible conversational gambits .
Type a comment to ALICE , and it checks the phrase and its key words for a response coded to those words .
In contrast , Jabberwacky , another top-rated Internet bot produced by Rollo Carpenter , keeps track of everything people have said to it , and tries to reuse those statements by matching them to the writer ’s input .
Neither chatbot has long - term memory , so they respond only to the last sentence written .
Nonetheless , these simple gambits can produce surprisingly intelligent - seeming conversations .
That ’s because they rely on a trick of human psychology :
We humans tend to attribute much more intelligence to the systems than is actually there .
If it seems partly aware , we assume it must be fully so .
Some users have chatted with ALICE and Jabberwacky online for hours , apparently not knowing — or perhaps not caring — that they ’re fake .
But could one chatbot fool another chatbot ?
What would one say to another in private ?
To find out , we arranged a conversation between these two chatbots .
To get each snippet of chat rolling , we seeded it by posing a question from one bot to the other .
After that , they were on their own .
What follows is the unaltered text of what each said — the sound of two machines talking .
ALICE : Are you alive ?
Jabberwacky : Perhaps .

A teenage science student has been banned from applying for a training programme with the Environment Agency because she is white and English .
The recruitment agency handling the scheme told Abigail Howarth , 18 , that there was no point in her submitting an application because of her ethnic background .
But bizarrely she could have applied if she had been white and Welsh , Scottish or Irish .
Scroll down for more
Abigail , who wanted to join the Agency 's flood management programme , saw an advert in a local newspaper offering positions in the Anglia region where she lives , complete with a £ 13,000 - a- year tax - free grant .
It made no mention of the ban on white English applicants , merely noting that candidates from ethnic minorities , such as " Asian , Indian ' and " White Other , e.g. Irish , Welsh , Scottish ' , were encouraged to put themselves forward .
Abigail , of Little Straughton , Bedfordshire , said : " I was really disappointed .
To be told being " White English " ruled me out in my home county shocked me .
I know why there are positive action training schemes to assist those who are genuinely discriminated against but when it 's broken down to this level it seems crazy to me .
" I really wanted to work for the agency and I was very excited - followed by feeling very disappointed .
" I would not have minded had I been beaten for the position by somebody better able than me . "
Scroll down for more
Abigail , who is awaiting the results of A - Levels in environmental science , geography and geology , emailed PATH National Ltd , the company handling applications .
She asked : " Am I correct in assuming that as I am English ( White ) I need not apply as the preference is for the minorities you have listed , or can I apply anyway ? '
Three days later , PATH recruitment officer , Bola Odusi , replied : " Thank you for your enquiry unfortunately the traineeship opportunity in < _> sic ] targeted towards the ethnic minority group to address their under representations in the professions under the Race Relations Act amended 2000 . "
Such a policy may breach Race Relations legislation as employers must prove ethnic groups are under - represented before using positive discrimination strategies .
The Environment Agency admitted it had ' no evidence that white Welsh , Scottish or Irish workers were under - represented ' in the Anglia region .
South West Bedfordshire Tory MP Andrew Selous said : " I think this is complete nonsense and the Environment Agency should be taking the best people , irrespective of their background .
" This is obviously borne out of some idiotic quota system .
Abigail should have been able to apply and been judged on her own merits .
I will raise this when I have a meeting with the Environment Agency next month . "
PATH National 's organisational development manager , Mary McDowell , said : " The " White Welsh " , " White Irish " and " White Scottish " is a technicality in law - if they are a minority , they are entitled to places on these schemes - they are not part of the majority group , which is " White English " .
" The " White English " in this area are the majority group and hence could not apply .
" That is the way the law is laid .
This is a chance for people who might be less employable to gain experience , just experience .
Public - sector organisations have a duty to ensure they reflect the make - up of the society they serve . "
The Environment Agency says 387 of its 12,000 workers claim BME ( Black and Minority Ethnic ) status .
A spokesman added : " The Commission for Racial Equality has confirmed we are acting legally . "
A CRE spokeswoman said : " The Commission will be checking with the Environment Agency to clarify the current situation regarding their positive action initiatives .
" Positive action can only be used to encourage or train particular under - represented groups . "
Dwight Eisenhower warned us against George Bush and the kind of government he would bring to Washington when a president who pursues an obsessive war combines with those who pursue the obsessive profits and corruptions that surround his war .
George Washington warned us about George Bush and the unwise foreign entanglements that could corrupt our system and so gravely damage our country .
James Madison warned us about the threats to our liberty from factions that seek to dominate our democracy and fears that are created and exploited in the cause of eroding our freedoms .
Jesus Christ warned us about a society where the hungry become more hungry , the poor become more poor , the ill become more pained â€ ” all while others gorge themselves on their greed and bloat themselves on their unjust enrichments .
Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Franklin and Paine warned us about those who claim the king is law , reminded us that in our land the law is king , and warned us about those whose search for total power would destroy the democratic checks and balances that God inspired them to leave for us .
Lincoln gave his life for his prayer to bind our wounds after a hard and bitter war , while Bush creates a hard and bitter war that he uses to rip and tear and exploit the wounds he creates in his sick and demented partisan strategies .
Only one president in the history of our land would even think about hosting a national political convention that insults our veterans with demented jokes about the Purple Heart , to attack an opponent awarded bronze and silver stars for valor .
There is darkness and bitterness and truth in these words , but make no mistake , those who have done these deeds are being swept from power by a good and noble America that now sees through this sick and tired act and demands a return to the first principles of Americanism and the common sense of American national interests .
2006 was our Lexington and Concord that saved the country from two more years of a one - party state .
2008 will be our Yorktown , inaugurating a new era of patriotic renewal and reform that will be reminiscent of the great eras of the American past and the great hope of our American future .
To achieve the vision , we must understand the problem and mobilize for the solution .
George W. Bush has created a terrorism - industrial complex even more sinister and deadly that than the military - industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us so wisely against .
What kind of president hosts secret meetings in the White House with profit - bloated business and campaign contributors who make vast fortunes by polluting the planet and profiting from his miserable war ?
What kind of president initiates a preemptive war , creates an Occupation Authority that promotes corruption as vast as anything ever dreamed of during the Roman Empire , covers up massive torture at Abu Ghraib , keeps open the universally condemned prison at Guantanamo , allows tens of billions of dollars to be stolen or wasted during this occupation , sends underpaid troops to war while he fails to provide them the equipment they need to survive , holds gala fundraisers serving champagne and caviar to those who make vast profits from this tragic venture , then attacks the patriotism of his opponents , claims to do this in the name of God , escalates these wrongs in the name of democracy , angers and alienates the entire free world , wonders why our enemy is succeeding , and clings with some pathological obsession to this miserable and failed policy ?
Even the Supreme Court of the United States trends to what can only be described as a revival of the logic that gave America the old segregation , in line with a politics that at times veers towards the racism born of the partisanship of a neo -confederacy .
Bigoted ads are run by radical Republican leaders against Harold Ford .
Bigoted lines are uttered against Barack Obama while lies masquerading as news about a 6 - year - old Barack are broadcast as fact in the conservative media .
From the beginning until this day , radical Republican leaders in the Senate have supported these travesties and tragedies almost without exception while obstructionist Republican leaders of the Senate launch filibuster after filibuster at virtually every attempt to seek the truth or change the policies that escalate the tragedy .
On this day , while the radical Republicans in the Senate filibuster Jim Webbâ€™s effort to restore rationality to rotations of heroic and beleagured troops , we learn that our troops have not gotten their urgently requested armored vehicles because of continuing corruptions endemic to this terrorism - industrial complex , we learn that American blood shed to buy the government government time has been insulted by an Iraqi government that does not meet even basic benchmarks , we learn that al Qaeda regained its pre-Sept.
11 strength to capitalize on the catastrophes caused by the partisan president who so shamelessly exploited that very tragedy , we learn of the latest presidential claim of executive privilege to cover up the latest abuse of executive power , and there is more , but the day is not long enough , nor the space here great enough , to list every wrongdoing and failure for even this one 24 - hour period .
Make no mistake , things have been done to America in these recent years that are unwise , unjust , unconscionable , unacceptable and un-American by those who pursue their partisanship , their profiteering , their perjury , their pardons and their power , waving the flag as their banner and pointing to God as their justification .
Make no mistake , the hourglass is running out of sand for the darker impulses of this destructive vision of our national politics and the destructive policies that will be tolerated no more by our people .
Let the radical Republicans learn the lesson or face the consequences : 2006 was our Lexington and Concord .
2008 will be our Yorktown .
2009 will inaugurate the next great chapter in a great country that will say no to what is happening today .

The White House said Friday that , like Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office , President Bush ’s office is not allowing an independent federal watchdog to oversee its handling of classified national security information .
An executive order that Bush issued in March 2003 -- amending an existing order -- requires all government agencies that are part of the executive branch to submit to oversight .
Although it does n’t specifically say so , Bush ’s order was not meant to apply to the vice president ’s office or the president ’s office , a White House spokesman said .
The issue flared Thursday when Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) criticized Cheney for refusing to file annual reports with the federal National Archives and Records Administration , for refusing to spell out how his office handles classified documents , and for refusing to submit to an inspection by the archives ’
Information Security Oversight Office .
The archives administration has been pressing the vice president ’s office to cooperate with oversight for the last several years , contending that by not doing so , Cheney and his staff have created a potential national security risk .

Bush amended the oversight directive in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to help ensure that national secrets would not be mishandled , made public or improperly declassified .
The order aimed to create a uniform system for classifying , declassifying and otherwise safeguarding national security information .
It gave the archives ’ oversight unit responsibility for evaluating the effectiveness of each agency ’s classification programs .
It applied to the executive branch of government , mostly agencies led by Bush administration appointees -- not to legislative offices such as Congress or to judicial offices such as the courts .
“ Our democratic principles require that the American people be informed of the activities of their government , ” the executive order said .
But from the start , Bush considered his office and Cheney ’s exempt from the reporting requirements , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in an interview Friday .

Cheney ’s office filed the reports in 2001 and 2002 but stopped in 2003 .
As a result , the National Archives has been unable to review how much information the president ’s and vice president ’s offices are classifying and declassifying .
And the security oversight office cannot inspect the president and vice president ’s executive offices to determine whether safeguards are in place to protect the classified information they handle and to properly declassify information when required .
Those two offices have access to the most highly classified information , including intelligence on terrorists and unfriendly foreign countries .
Waxman and J. William Leonard , director of the Information Security Oversight Office , have argued that the order clearly applies to all executive branch agencies , including the offices of the vice president and the president .

The White House disagrees , Fratto said .
“ We do n’t dispute that the ISOO has a different opinion .
But let ’s be very clear :
This executive order was issued by the president , and he knows what his intentions were , ” Fratto said .
“ He is in compliance with his executive order . ”
Fratto conceded that the lengthy directive , technically an amendment to an existing executive order , did not specifically exempt the president ’s or vice president ’s offices .
Instead , it refers to “ agencies ” as being subject to the requirements , which Fratto said did not include the two executive offices .
“ It does take a little bit of inference , ” Fratto said .
Steven Aftergood , director of the Federation of American Scientists ’ government secrecy project , disputed the White House explanation of the executive order .

He noted that the order defines “ agency ” as any executive agency , military department and “ any other entity within the executive branch that comes into the possession of classified information ” -- which , he said , includes Bush ’s and Cheney ’s offices .
Cheney ’s office drew criticism Thursday for claiming that it was exempt from the reporting requirements because the vice president ’s office is not fully within the executive branch .
It cited his legislative role as president of the Senate when needed to break a tie .
At a Friday news conference , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said constitutional scholars could debate that assertion .
But , she said , Cheney ’s office is exempt from the requirements because the president intended him to be .

Cheney ’s office did not comment Friday .
Several security experts said they were not aware that the president had exempted his own office from the oversight requirements .
But they said it fit what they saw as a pattern in the administration of avoiding accountability , even on matters of national security .
“ If the president and the vice president do n’t take their own rules seriously , who else should ? ” said Tom Blanton , director of the National Security Archive , a nongovernmental research institute at George Washington University in Washington that lobbies for open government .
Advertisement
“ If they get a blank check , it ’s a recipe for disaster .
I ca n’t think of a quicker way to break down the credibility of the entire security - classification system . ”
Blanton noted that the White House had acknowledged that a substantial number of in - house e-mails had disappeared in recent years , at a time when investigators wanted to review them for possible evidence of inappropriate leaks of classified information .
“ If there are all these great safeguards in place , then where are the e-mails ? ” Blanton asked .
Waxman , chairman of the powerful House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , wrote an eight - page letter to Cheney on Thursday in which he complained that the vice president had refused to adhere to the executive order .
Waxman , citing the criminal investigation of Cheney ’s office related to the leak of a CIA agent ’s identity , suggested that the vice president ’s office was a national security risk .
Advertisement
He also accused Cheney or his staff of trying to have the archives ’ watchdog unit abolished after its director , Leonard , pressed for more oversight and for a legal opinion from the Justice Department as to whether the executive order applied to the vice president ’s office .
Perino denied that attempts were made to abolish the unit .
A spokeswoman for the archives , Susan Cooper , would not comment Friday on whether the archives ’ watchdog unit ever tried to inspect the president ’s executive office or obtain annual classification reports .
Fratto said that he was not aware of such an effort but that it would be rebuffed .
“ I ’m not going to get into hypotheticals , but the executive order does not grant them that authority , ” Fratto said .
Advertisement
He noted that the oversight requirements did , however , apply to the National Security Council , the president ’s principal forum for considering national security and foreign policy matters with his senior national security advisors and cabinet officials .
Fratto said that the White House and Cheney ’s office had a legal obligation to adhere to the executive order ’s guidelines regarding the proper handling of classified documents , even if they did n’t have to submit to oversight by an outside agency .

We received a few reports from users of our Erlang - based RabbitMQ message broker who saw sharp decreases in throughput performance when putting the broker under heavy load .
We subsequently reproduced these results in our lab .
This is not what we expected to see – while some performance degradation is inevitable when running a system at its limits , we had carefully designed RabbitMQ to make such degradation are small and gradual .
So clearly the system was behaving in ways we had not anticipated .
We eventually tracked down the problem .
Take this example program , which sets up a chain of three processes : a producer sending N messages to a consumer which for every message it receives performs M request / response interaction with an echo process .
The interaction between the consumer and echo process follows the same pattern as what happens under the covers of Erlang ’s gen_server : call : a message is sent to the recipient and the caller then waits for a reply using a selective receive , i.e. a receive matching on a specific pattern unique to the expected response , which distinguishes the response from any other messages the caller may have in their incoming message queue .
The interaction between the producer and consumer comes in two flavours .
When WithAck = false the producer sends messages to the consumer completely asynchronously .
By contrast , when WithAck = true the producer waits for an acknowledgment to every message before proceeding .
The consumer sends that acknowledgment as soon as it is has received the message .
Which version is faster ?
One would think that the asynchronous version is faster than the synchronous version since the former does not have to carry out the additional work of sending / receiving acknowledgments .
Wrong .
Eshell V5.5.5 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > mqueue : timed_run( 10000 , 10 , false ) .
4892400 2 > mqueue: timed_run( 10000 , 10 , true ) .
85830
This has the producer sending 10000 messages , and the consumer calling the echo process 10 times for each message .
The synchronous version outperforms the asynchronous version by a factor of 57 !
How does this huge discrepancy arise ?
The culprit is the consumer ’s message queue , or , more precisely , its length .
Firstly , the asynchronous version of the above test may result in 10000 messages needing to be enqueued , i.e. in the worst case scenario when the consumer does not start any work until the producer has finished sending all messages .
However , surely queuing up 10000 messages should n’t take nearly five seconds ?
Indeed it does n’t , as a few experiments quickly confirm .
The root cause for the excessive time taken by the asynchronous version is the selective receive performed when waiting for the echo response .
A selective receive scans the message queue until it finds a match .
The echo response will typically be at or near the end of the queue , since it will only have been sent a short while after the echo request .
So if the message queue contains a lot of messages from the producer , every time the consumer is waiting for the echo response it has to scan over all these messages .
If there are N messages in the consumer ’s message queue and it performs M calls to the echo process for each of them , this results in M * N * ( N+1 ) / 2 match operations , i.e. a time complexity that is quadratic in the number of messages .
Could Erlang do something smarter here ?
One possibility is to use a richer data structure for the message queue , optimised for pattern matching .
That is difficult in the general case since patterns can be of arbitrary complexity and cannot always be determined statically .
Still , one could envisage a message queue data structure that dynamically optimises itself for matching against the kinds of patterns thrown at it .
Another option is to allow processes to have several , independently addressable message queues , as in , e.g. , the join calculus and various other process algebras .
Replies to calls could then be sent to a secondary , usually empty , queue .
I wonder what an encoding of the join calculus into Erlang would look like …
Meanwhile the lesson is : if you make synchronous calls inside a process you ’d better make sure its message queue is short .
PS : The latest release of RabbitMQ , fixing the problem originally reported , is available for download here .
While I rummage around the brain for something more controversial to blog ( that ’s nevertheless not too controversial ) , here , for your reading pleasure , is a talk I gave a couple weeks ago at Google Cambridge .
Hardcore Shtetl - Optimized fans will find little here to surprise them , but for new or occasional readers , this is about the clearest statement I ’ve written of my religio- ethico - complexity - theoretic beliefs .
What Google Wo n’t Find
As I probably mentioned when I spoke at your Mountain View location two years ago , it ’s a funny feeling when an entity that knows everything that ever can be known or has been known or will be known invites you to give a talk — what are you supposed to say ?
Well , I thought I ’d talk about “ What Google Wo n’t Find . ”
In other words , what have we learned over the last 15 years or so about the ultimate physical limits of search — whether it ’s search of a physical database like Google ’s , or of the more abstract space of solutions to a combinatorial problem ?
On the spectrum of computer science , I ’m about as theoretical as you can get .
One way to put it is that I got through CS grad school at Berkeley without really learning any programming language other than QBASIC .
So it might surprise you that earlier this year , I was spending much of my time talking to business reporters .
Why ?
Because there was this company near Vancouver called D - Wave Systems , which was announcing to the press that it had built the world ’s first commercial quantum computer .
Let ’s ignore the “ commercial ” part , because I do n’t really understand economics — these days , you can apparently make billions of dollars giving away some service for free !
Let ’s instead focus on the question : did D - Wave actually build a quantum computer ?
Well , they apparently built a device with 16 very noisy superconducting quantum bits ( or qubits ) , which they say they ’ve used to help solve extremely small Sudoku puzzles .
The trouble is , we ’ve known for years that if qubits are sufficiently noisy — if they leak a sufficient amount of information into their environment — then they behave essentially like classical bits .
Furthermore , D - Wave has refused to answer extremely basic technical questions about how high their noise rates are and so forth — they care about serving their customers , not answering nosy questions from academics .
( Recently D - Wave founder Geordie Rose offered to answer my questions if I was interested in buying one of his machines .
I replied that I was interested — my offer was $ 10 US — and I now await his answers as a prospective customer . )
To make a long story short , it ’s consistent with the evidence that what D - Wave actually built would best be described as a 16 - bit classical computer .
I do n’t mean 16 bits in terms of the architecture ; I mean sixteen actual bits .
And there ’s some prior art for that .
But that ’s actually not what annoyed me the most about the D - Wave announcement .
What annoyed me were all the articles in the popular press — including places as reputable as The Economist — that said , what D - Wave has built is a machine that can try every possible solution in parallel and instantly pick the right one .
This is what a quantum computer is ; this is how it works .
It ’s amazing to me how , as soon as the word “ quantum ” is mentioned , all the ordinary rules of journalism go out the window .
No one thinks to ask : is that really what a quantum computer could do ?
It turns out that , even though we do n’t yet have scalable quantum computers , we do know something about what they could do if we did have them .
A quantum computer is a device that would exploit the laws of quantum mechanics to solve certain computational problems asymptotically faster than we know how to solve them with any computer today .
Quantum mechanics — which has been our basic framework for physics for the last 80 years — is a theory that ’s like probability theory , except that instead of real numbers called probabilities , you now have complex numbers called amplitudes .
And the interesting thing about these complex numbers is that they can “ interfere ” with each other : they can cancel each other out .
In particular , to find the probability of something happening , you have to add the amplitudes for all the possible ways it could have happened , and then take the square of the absolute value of the result .
And if some of the ways an event could happen have positive amplitude and others have negative amplitude , then the amplitudes can cancel out , so that the event does n’t happen at all .
This is exactly what ’s going on in the famous double - slit experiment : at certain spots on a screen , the different paths a photon could ’ve taken to get to that spot interfere destructively and cancel each other out , and as a result no photon is seen .
Now , the idea of quantum computing is to set up a massive double - slit experiment with exponentially many paths — and to try to arrange things so that the paths leading to wrong answers interfere destructively and cancel each other out , while the paths leading to right answers interfere constructively and are therefore observed with high probability .
You can see it ’s a subtle effect that we ’re aiming for .
And indeed , it ’s only for a few specific problems that people have figured out how to choreograph an interference pattern to solve the problem efficiently — that is , in polynomial time .
One of these problems happens to be that of factoring integers .
Thirteen years ago , Peter Shor discovered that a quantum computer could efficient apply Fourier transforms over exponentially - large abelian groups , and thereby find the periods of exponentially - long periodic sequences , and thereby factor integers , and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem , and thereby snarf people ’s credit card numbers .
So that ’s one application of quantum computers .
On the other hand — and this is the most common misconception about quantum computing I ’ve encountered — we do not , repeat do not , know a quantum algorithm to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time .
For “ generic ” problems of finding a needle in a haystack , most of us believe that quantum computers will give at most a polynomial advantage over classical ones .
At this point I should step back .
How many of you have heard of the following question : Does P=NP ?
Yeah , this is a problem so profound that it ’s appeared on at least two TV shows ( The Simpsons and NUMB3RS ) .
It ’s also one of the seven ( now six ) problems for which the Clay Math Institute is offerring a million - dollar prize for a solution .
Apparently the mathematicians had to debate whether P vs. NP was “ deep ” enough to include in their list .
Personally , I take it as obvious that it ’s the deepest of them all .
And the reason is this : if you had a fast algorithm for solving NP - complete problems , then not only could you solve P vs. NP , you could presumably also solve the other six problems .
You ’d simply program your computer to search through all possible proofs of at most ( say ) a billion symbols , in some formal system like Zermelo - Fraenkel set theory .
If such a proof existed , you ’d find it in a reasonable amount of time .
( And if the proof had more than a billion symbols , it ’s not clear you ’d even want to see it ! )
This raises an important point : many people — even computer scientists — do n’t appreciate just how profound the consequences would be if P=NP .
They think it ’s about scheduling airline flights better , or packing more boxes in your truck .
Of course , it is about those things — but the point is that you can have a set of boxes such that if you could pack them into your truck , then you would also have proved the Riemann Hypothesis !
Of course , while the proof eludes us , we believe that P≠NP .
We believe there ’s no algorithm to solve NP - complete problems in deterministic polynomial time .
But personally , I would actually make a stronger conjecture :
There is no physical means to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time — not with classical computers , not with quantum computers , not with anything else .
You could call this the “ No SuperSearch Principle . ”
It says that , if you ’re going to find a needle in a haystack , then you ’ve got to expend at least some computational effort sifting through the hay .
I see this principle as analogous to the Second Law of Thermodynamics or the impossibility of superluminal signalling .
That is , it ’s a technological limitation which is also a pretty fundamental fact about the laws of physics .
Like those other principles , it could always be falsified by experiment , but after a while it seems manifestly more useful to assume it ’s true and then see what the consequences are for other things .
OK , so what do we actually know about the ability of quantum computers to solve NP - complete problems efficiently ?
Well , of course we can’t prove it ’s impossible , since we ca n’t even prove it ’s impossible for classical computers — that ’s the P vs. NP problem !
We might hope to at least prove that quantum computers can’t solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time unless classical computers can also — but even that , alas , seems far beyond our ability to prove .
What we can prove is this : suppose you throw away the structure of an NP - complete problem , and just consider it as an abstract , featureless space of 2n possible solutions , where the only thing you can do is guess a solution and check whether it ’s right or not .
In that case it ’s obvious that a classical computer will need ~ 2n steps to find a solution .
But what if you used a quantum computer , which could “ guess ” all possible solutions in superposition ?
Well , even then , you ’d still need at least ~ 2n / 2 steps to find a solution .
This is called the BBBV Theorem , and was one of the first things learned about the power of quantum computers .
Intuitively , even though a quantum computer in some sense involves exponentially many paths or “ parallel universes , ” the single universe that happened on the answer ca n’t shout above all the other universes : “ hey , over here ! ”
It can only gradually make the others aware of its presence .
As it turns out , the 2n / 2 bound is actually achievable .
For in 1996 , Lov Grover showed that a quantum computer can search a list of N items using only √N steps .
It seems to me that this result should clearly feature in Google ’s business plan .
Of course in real life , NP - complete problems do have structure , and algorithms like local search and backtrack search exploit that structure .
Because of this , the BBBV theorem can’t rule out a fast quantum algorithm for NP - complete problems .
It merely shows that , if such an algorithm existed , then it could n’t work the way 99 % of everyone who ’s ever heard of quantum computing thinks it would !
You might wonder whether there ’s any proposal for a quantum algorithm that would exploit the structure of NP - complete problems .
As it turns out , there ’s one such proposal : the “ quantum adiabatic algorithm ” of Farhi et al. , which can be seen as the quantum version of simulated annealing .
Intriguingly , Farhi and his collaborators proved that , on some problem instances where classical simulated annealing would take exponential time , the quantum adiabatic algorithm takes only polynomial time .
Alas , we also know of problem instances where the adiabatic algorithm takes exponential time just as simulated annealing does .
So while this is still an active research area , right now the adiabatic algorithm does not look like a magic bullet for solving NP - complete problems .
If quantum computers ca n’t solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time , it raises an extremely interesting question : is there any physical means to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time ?
Well , there have been lots of proposals .
One of my favorites involves taking two glass plates with pegs between them , and dipping the resulting contraption into a tub of soapy water .
The idea is that the soap bubbles that form between the pegs should trace out the minimum Steiner tree — that is , the minimum total length of line segments connecting the pegs , where the segments can meet at points other than the pegs themselves .
Now , this is known to be an NP - hard optimization problem .
So , it looks like Nature is solving NP - hard problems in polynomial time !
You might say there ’s an obvious difficulty : the soap bubbles could get trapped in a local optimum that ’s different from the global optimum .
By analogy , a rock in a mountain crevice could reach a lower state of potential energy by rolling up first and then down … but is rarely observed to do so !
And if you said that , you ’d be absolutely right .
But that did n’t stop two guys a few years ago from writing a paper in which they claimed , not only that soap bubbles solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time , but that that fact proves P=NP !
In debates about this paper on newsgroups , several posters raised the duh - obvious point that soap bubbles can get trapped at local optima .
But then another poster opined that that ’s just an academic “ party line , ” and that he’d be willing to bet that no one had actually done an experiment to prove it .
Long story short , I went to the hardware store , bought some glass plates , liquid soap , etc. , and found that , while Nature does often find a minimum Steiner tree with 4 or 5 pegs , it tends to get stuck at local optima with larger numbers of pegs .
Indeed , often the soap bubbles settle down to a configuration which is not even a tree ( i.e. contains “ cycles of soap ” ) , and thus provably ca n’t be optimal .
The situation is similar for protein folding .
Again , people have said that Nature seems to be solving an NP - hard optimization problem in every cell of your body , by letting the proteins fold into their minimum - energy configurations .
But there are two problems with this claim .
The first problem is that proteins , just like soap bubbles , sometimes get stuck in suboptimal configurations — indeed , it ’s believed that ’s exactly what happens with Mad Cow Disease .
The second problem is that , to the extent that proteins do usually fold into their optimal configurations , there ’s an obvious reason why they would : natural selection !
If there were a protein that could only be folded by proving the Riemann Hypothesis , the gene that coded for it would quickly get weeded out of the gene pool .
So : quantum computers , soap bubbles , proteins … if we want to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time in the physical world , what ’s left ?
Well , we can try going to more exotic physics .
For example , since we do n’t yet have a quantum theory of gravity , people have felt free to speculate that if we did have one , it would give us an efficient way to solve NP - complete problems .
For example , maybe the theory would allow closed timelike curves , which would let us solve NP - complete and even harder problems by ( in some sense ) sending the answer back in time to before we started .
In my view , though , it ’s more likely that a quantum theory of gravity will do the exact opposite : that is , it will limit our computational powers , relative to what they would ’ve been in a universe without gravity .
To see why , consider one of the oldest “ extravagant ” computing proposals : the Zeno computer .
This is a computer that runs the first step of a program in one second , the second step in half a second , the third step in a quarter second , the fourth step in an eighth second , and so on , so that after two seconds it ’s run infinitely many steps .
( It reminds me of the old joke about the supercomputer that was so fast , it could do an infinite loop in 2.5 seconds . )
Question from the floor :
In what sense is this even a “ proposal ” ?
Answer :
Well , it ’s a proposal in the sense that people actually write papers about it !
( Google “ hypercomputation . ” )
Whether they should be writing those papers a separate question …
Now , the Zeno computer strikes most computer scientists — me included — as a joke .
But why is it a joke ?
Can we say anything better than that it feels absurd to us ?
As it turns out , this question takes us straight into some of the frontier issues in theoretical physics .
In particular , one of the few things physicists think they know about quantum gravity — one of the few things both the string theorists and their critics largely agree on — is that , at the so - called “ Planck scale ” of about 10 - 33 centimeters or 10 - 43 seconds , our usual notions of space and time are going to break down .
As one manifestation of this , if you tried to build a clock that ticked more than about 1043 times per second , that clock would use so much energy that it would collapse to a black hole .
Ditto for a computer that performed more than about 1043 operations per second , or for a hard disk that stored more than about 1069 bits per square meter of surface area .
( Together with the finiteness of the speed of light and the exponential expansion of the universe , this implies that , contrary to what you might have thought , there is a fundamental physical limit on how much disk space Gmail will ever be able to offer its subscribers … )
To summarize : while I believe what I called the “ No SuperSearch Principle ” — that is , while I believe there are fundamental physical limits to efficient computer search —
I hope I ’ve convinced you that understanding why these limits exist takes us straight into some of the deepest issues in math and physics .
To me that ’s so much the better — since it suggests that not only are the limits correct , but ( more importantly ) they ’re also nontrivial .
Thank you .
What is a Hacker ?
A hacker is someone who thinks outside the box .
It ’s someone who discards conventional wisdom , and does something else instead .
It ’s someone who looks at the edge and wonders what ’s beyond .
It ’s someone who sees a set of rules and wonders what happens if you do n’t follow them .
A hacker is someone who experiments with the limitations of systems for intellectual curiosity .
I wrote that last sentence in the year 2000 , in my book Secrets and Lies .
And I ’m sticking to that definition .
This is what else I wrote in Secrets and Lies ( pages 43 - 44 ) :
Hackers are as old as curiosity , although the term itself is modern .
Galileo was a hacker .
Mme .
Curie was one , too .
Aristotle was n’t .
( Aristotle had some theoretical proof that women had fewer teeth than men .
A hacker would have simply counted his wife ’s teeth .
A good hacker would have counted his wife ’s teeth without her knowing about it , while she was asleep .
A good bad hacker might remove some of them , just to prove a point . )
When I was in college , I knew a group similar to hackers : the key freaks .
They wanted access , and their goal was to have a key to every lock on campus .
They would study lockpicking and learn new techniques , trade maps of the steam tunnels and where they led , and exchange copies of keys with each other .
A locked door was a challenge , a personal affront to their ability .
These people were n’t out to do damage — stealing stuff was n’t their objective — although they certainly could have .
Their hobby was the power to go anywhere they wanted to .
Remember the phone phreaks of yesteryear , the ones who could whistle into payphones and make free phone calls .
Sure , they stole phone service .
But it was n’t like they needed to make eight - hour calls to Manila or McMurdo .
And their real work was secret knowledge :
The phone network was a vast maze of information .
They wanted to know the system better than the designers , and they wanted the ability to modify it to their will .
Understanding how the phone system worked — that was the true prize .
Other early hackers were ham - radio hobbyists and model - train enthusiasts .
Richard Feynman was a hacker ; read any of his books .
Computer hackers follow these evolutionary lines .
Or , they are the same genus operating on a new system .
Computers , and networks in particular , are the new landscape to be explored .
Networks provide the ultimate maze of steam tunnels , where a new hacking technique becomes a key that can open computer after computer .
And inside is knowledge , understanding .
Access .
How things work .
Why things work .
It ’s all out there , waiting to be discovered .
Computers are the perfect playground for hackers .
Computers , and computer networks , are vast treasure troves of secret knowledge .
The Internet is an immense landscape of undiscovered information .
The more you know , the more you can do .
And it should be no surprise that many hackers have focused their skills on computer security .
Not only is it often the obstacle between the hacker and knowledge , and therefore something to be defeated , but also the very mindset necessary to be good at security is exactly the same mindset that hackers have : thinking outside the box , breaking the rules , exploring the limitations of a system .
The easiest way to break a security system is to figure out what the system ’s designers had n’t thought of : that ’s security hacking .
Hackers cheat .
And breaking security regularly involves cheating .
It ’s figuring out a smart card ’s RSA key by looking at the power fluctuations , because the designers of the card never realized anyone could do that .
It ’s self - signing a piece of code , because the signature - verification system did n’t think someone might try that .
It ’s using a piece of a protocol to break a completely different protocol , because all previous security analysis only looked at protocols individually and not in pairs .
That ’s security hacking : breaking a system by thinking differently .
It all sounds criminal : recovering encrypted text , fooling signature algorithms , breaking protocols .
But honestly , that ’s just the way we security people talk .
Hacking is n’t criminal .
All the examples two paragraphs above were performed by respected security professionals , and all were presented at security conferences .
I remember one conversation I had at a Crypto conference , early in my career .
It was outside amongst the jumbo shrimp , chocolate - covered strawberries , and other delectables .
A bunch of us were talking about some cryptographic system , including Brian Snow of the NSA .
Someone described an unconventional attack , one that did n’t follow the normal rules of cryptanalysis .
I do n’t remember any of the details , but I remember my response after hearing the description of the attack .
“ That ’s cheating , ” I said .
Because it was .
I also remember Brian turning to look at me .
He did n’t say anything , but his look conveyed everything .
“ There ’s no such thing as cheating in this business . ”
Because there is n’t .
Hacking is cheating , and it ’s how we get better at security .
It ’s only after someone invents a new attack that the rest of us can figure out how to defend against it .
For years I have refused to play the semantic “ hacker ” vs. “ cracker ” game .
There are good hackers and bad hackers , just as there are good electricians and bad electricians .
“ Hacker ” is a mindset and a skill set ; what you do with it is a different issue .
And I believe the best computer security experts have the hacker mindset .
When I look to hire people , I look for someone who ca n’t walk into a store without figuring out how to shoplift .
I look for someone who ca n’t test a computer security program without trying to get around it .
I look for someone who , when told that things work in a particular way , immediately asks how things stop working if you do something else .
We need these people in security , and we need them on our side .
Criminals are always trying to figure out how to break security systems .
Field a new system — an ATM , an online banking system , a gambling machine — and criminals will try to make an illegal profit off it .
They ’ll figure it out eventually , because some hackers are also criminals .
But if we have hackers working for us , they ’ll figure it out first — and then we can defend ourselves .
It ’s our only hope for security in this fast - moving technological world of ours .

The provision is part of four so - called annexes that are to be debated with the draft oil law in Parliament .
Any objection to one or more of the annexes will stall passage of the law .
“ We are worried about these ideas put into the annexes , ” Mr. Salih said in an interview in Erbil , the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan .
“ It worries us a lot . ”
If the law and the annexes go to a vote before Parliament , a rejection by the Kurdish bloc alone , which holds 58 of 275 seats , would not doom the law .
But Parliament operates by consensus , and members say it is almost certain that no law regarding oil will pass without the approval of the Kurds .
A senior Shiite Arab legislator , Sheik Jalaladin al - Saghir , said the concerns raised by the Kurds amounted to a bargaining tactic .
“ I think it ’s a maneuver , ” he said , adding that he believed the Kurds “ will move forward to pass the law since everybody needs it . ”
Contributing a further layer of complication , a Sunni Arab legislator said Wednesday evening that the main Sunni Arab bloc , which has 44 legislative seats , objected to any discussion of the law in Parliament at this time .
“ Acceleration in presenting it is inappropriate since the security condition is not encouraging , ” said the legislator , Saleem Abdullah .
He said Sunni Arabs were also worried that the law would give foreign companies too large a role in the country ’s oil industry .
Sunni Arab political leaders supported cabinet approval of the draft law , but appear ambivalent now .
White House officials have said passage of the oil law is one of four major benchmarks they would like the Iraqi government to meet before fall .
During a visit to Baghdad last month , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told the Iraqi prime minister , Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , that Mr. Bush would weigh Iraq ’s commitment to meeting the goals when he decided at the end of the summer whether to extend the recent troop increase .
Differences on benchmarks for the Iraqi government are a central issue in the spending - bill talks between Mr. Bush and Democrats .
Democrats , conceding they are unable to use the bill to force the withdrawal of troops , hope to write new benchmarks into the legislation , with consequences if the goals are not met .

Local Default crisis is evicting renters Tenants forced out by foreclosures Rafael Matos , 47 , is fighting eviction from his home of almost five years after a bank took possession of the house in Dorchester that his former landlord once owned .
The other two tenants in the building left quietly , Matos said .
( mark wilson / globe staff ) Rafael Matos , 47 , is fighting eviction from his home of almost five years after a bank took possession of the house in Dorchester that his former landlord once owned .
The other two tenants in the building left quietly , Matos said .
( mark wilson / globe staff )
The foreclosure crisis increasingly is claiming the homes of people who never made the mistake of taking out an unaffordable mortgage : renters .
Hundreds of tenants in foreclosed buildings have been evicted or are facing eviction by mortgage companies that do not want to be landlords .
In Boston Housing Court , about 20 eviction cases a week involve tenants who live in foreclosed properties , according to housing lawyers .
Chief clerk Bob Lewis said the volume of such cases has increased " certainly more than 100 percent since last year . "
Through mid-August this year , 1,376 multifamily properties in Massachusetts had been foreclosed , according to new research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston .
There were 750 multifamily foreclosures in Massachusetts in 2006 .
The one - two punch of foreclosure and eviction often thrusts three or more families into a sudden housing search .
The foreclosures are concentrated in lower - income neighborhoods .
The evicted renters are often already struggling to afford the state 's expensive housing .
Rafael Matos , 47 , received an eviction notice in July from a company that represented the new owner of the three - decker off Dudley Street in Dorchester where he has lived for almost five years .
The other two tenants in the building left quietly , Matos said .
But Matos , a restaurant cook , is fighting the company in court .
" I pay my rent on time and I have to leave this place ? " he said .
" Come on .
How am I going to find a new apart ment ? "
Matos is a tenant at will .
He can be evicted on short notice .
But even having a lease is no protection against a post - foreclosure eviction .
Under Massachusetts law , foreclosing owners are not required to honor leases signed by the former owner .
Tomorrow , US Representative Barney Frank said he plans to introduce federal legislation on foreclosures that includes a provision that tenant leases remain in effect after foreclosure , and that tenants without leases must receive 90 days notice before eviction .
" Banks will no longer be able to put their convenience ahead of people 's ability to live , " said Frank , who chairs the House Committee on Financial Services .
" We have asked lenders , saying , ' You really should n't do this . '
Now the next step is to make it mandatory . "
Meanwhile , the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill in July that includes a provision preserving leases .
A similar House bill does not include that provision .
The two bills dealing with foreclosure - related issues await reconciliation .
The mortgage industry says its members are not equipped to act as landlords .
The companies that are the new owners of these houses are typically investment vehicles that were set up to hold pools of mortgages .
They have Wall Street firms that act as trust agents for them , and servicing companies that collect loan payments and do related administrative work .
They do not have local agents to handle calls about broken plumbing .
The firms say that it is also easier to sell a building vacant .
The industry said that the new owners are also the victims of landlords who did n't pay their loans .
But several of the housing lawyers contend that many of the new property owners are specialized investment trusts that buy troubled loans with the intention of foreclosing , evicting , and then reselling the property .
Thursday is eviction day at Boston 's Housing Court , a day devoted to cases brought by landlords seeking eviction orders against tenants .
Last week , Judge Jeffrey M. Winik pressed the companies seeking evictions to give tenants as much time as possible to find new housing .
Marie Nicole Metayer , a mother of three , was given until the end of February to find a new home for her family .
William Auton , a lawyer representing the Bank of New York , said the bank was " showing a heart " by giving her a few extra months to move out .
The judge said Metayer would barely have enough time to find a new apartment , because she must find a landlord that accepts federal Section 8 housing vouchers .
Metayer , who signed a one - year lease in April for her apartment in Dorchester , said afterward that she was stunned to be looking for housing again .
Most tenants do not get the benefit of judicial intervention .
The new owners of foreclosed properties routinely send notices to tenants ordering them to vacate within 90 days , said lawyers involved in housing issues .
Often the order is sweetened with a cash incentive for leaving quickly , known as " Cash for Keys , " generally $ 500 to $ 1,500 .
Many tenants take the money and go .
The Boston Fed found that 29 percent of the 4,756 foreclosures in Massachusetts through mid-August this year involved multifamily buildings , although only 10 percent of the state 's residential properties are multifamily .
The number of foreclosures , and the number of multifamily foreclosures , both are on pace to double last year 's totals .
While the proposed state and federal legislation would provide more protection for tenants with leases , tenant advocates want greater protections for at - will tenants , too .
They would like to see a prohibition on " no fault " evictions , meaning landlords would have to demonstrate a reason , such as failure to pay rent .
In the meantime , these advocates fight eviction orders with procedural delays , such as contending that tenants cannot be evicted if landlords have failed to repair code violations .
Such violations are common with foreclosed properties .
Landlords who fall behind on mortgage payments often stop spending on maintenance well before the actual foreclosure .
And utilities paid by the landlord are sometimes cut off after the foreclosure , either because the new owner is not aware the bills need to be paid or , advocates contend , to encourage tenants to leave .
Matos , for example , lost power for two days .
His former landlord stopped paying the electricity bill .
Matos had to get his own account .
His new landlord is an investment pool called " Carrington Mortgage Loan Trust 2005 - OPT2 . "
It was created by Citigroup Inc. in May 2005 to hold $ 75 million in mortgages the bank had purchased from lenders .
Bear Stearns & Co. sold shares in the trust to investors , who receive the payments from those mortgages , and Deutsche Bank manages the trust .
So who decided to evict Matos ?
The paperwork said Deutsche Bank , which is listed in county records as the formal owner of the building after the landlord defaulted in May .
But a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said that was a technicality ; the company was simply acting on behalf of the trust , which has terms that dictate what the bank must do in the event of foreclosure .
Tenant advocates say this diffusion of responsibility is no excuse .
" If they [ Deutsche Bank ] have done these agreements , then presumably they could do a different kind of agreement , " said Maureen E. McDonagh , a lawyer representing Matos .
" They choose not to . "
City Life , an advocacy group in Jamaica Plain , has pledged to block the door of any apartment where Deutsche Bank attempts to complete an eviction .
A company spokesman said Deutsche Bank had mailed a letter to the servicing companies that manage the mortgages in its various portfolios , asking them to show compassion when possible .
It also asks them to make clear in legal filings that Deutsche Bank is not the acting party .
" Deutsche Bank is n't involved in these evictions , " said spokesman John Gallagher .
Matos , the only person left in his apartment building , wants to stay , but does not know where to send the rent money .
His eviction hearing is scheduled for Oct. 30 .

I recently worked for an energy policy organization in Minnesota , and my colleagues and I worked to get a renewable energy standard passed there .
We touted the economic benefits it would bring , like the investment in clean technologies , strengthening rural economies , innovation , entrepreneurship , and the possibility of the state to become a clean energy exporter .
All this , in addition to cutting global warming emissions , made a renewable energy standard a no - brainer , and it passed â€ “ after many years of debate â€ “ with flying colors this past February .
But has an RES really changed the landscape of Minnesota and the 24 other states with a similar policy ?
The U.S. Public Interest Research Group ( USPIRG ) looked into it and found that huge strides have been made in states that have implemented a renewable energy standard .
In fact , all 25 states are reducing emissions , creating jobs , and fueling a clean energy economy .
â€ œReaping the Rewardsâ€ found that in 2006 , more than 66 percent of the nationâ€™s renewable energy was expected to built in states with an RES .
In 2007 , that number jumped to 70 percent .
Clearly , cleantech businesses and investment are going where the rules of the game are clear , the regulatory support is strong , and the stateâ€™s economy is open for business .
The global warming impacts are huge as well : RES states will cut emissions by a total of 8.4 million metric tons per year â€ “ thatâ€™s like taking more than 1.5 million cars off the road .
About 1.2 billion gallons of water will be saved because of the decreased reliance on fossil fuels .
Texas has seen some of the greatest impacts of an RES .
Besides adding 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy , Texas landowners receive about $ 9.5 million in royalty payments from wind farm operators .
Now that we can prove the positive , local effects of an RES , itâ€™s time for a national renewable energy standard .
The House took a step this year when it passed a measure calling for 15 percent renewable energy , but the Senate to follow suit right away .
A coherent national policy will help drive America to forefront of the burgeoning cleantech market at a time when the rest of the world is already clamoring to get there .

After all the brouhaha in New York this week , this seems like a good time to have us a little chat about free speech .
Not restricted free speech .
Not partial free speech .
Not pseudo- , semi- , counterfeit , limited free speech .
Not free speech on Wednesdays between 2 and 3 p.m. EDT .
Not free speech zones and not free speech reserved for the people we like and kept from the ones we do n’t .
No , my friends , I ’m talking about your total , unfettered , full - throated , in your face , front row death metal rock concert , spitting in the wind , 24/7 , every square inch of your big white furry butt , gushing like runoff from a rain gutter off a cantilevered roof during a force five hurricane in the tropics free speech .
There ’s no whining about who gets to speak at what college .
We ’re supposed to be setting an example .
Does n’t matter out of which holes the free speech is coming .
The mouths of an opposition politico or the biggest little two - bit dictator in the world or the personification of Lucifer himself replete with red horns and forked tail and cloven hooves .
But let ’s leave the vice president out of this one .
Everybody gets to say his piece .
That ’s the deal .
Even if half the world considers that “ piece ” total BS .
Face it , half of what we believe usually turns out to be total BS .
Beliefs have this nagging tendency to mutate over time .
It was n’t long ago they burned people as witches for not thinking the world was flat .
Was n’t it Cardinal Richelieu who said treason is just a matter of dates ?
The same way it is better to let 100 guilty people go free than convict one innocent person , it ’s better we let 100 cretinous , fool , toad , buttwipes reveal themselves as boneheads , just so a safe platform for the idealistic visionary is guaranteed .
Given enough rope , idiots are notoriously susceptible to hanging themselves from the noose of their own ridiculousness .
And yes , Mr. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , I ’m talking about you .
Admittedly , you got a lousy intro at Colombia University , but when you agree to a Q & A , the general routine is to answer the questions you get asked .
And yeah , OK , the crowd laughed at you , and no , you ca n’t execute them like the gays you say your country does n’t have .
Our crowds enjoy free speech too .
Democracy is a bitch , is n’t it ?
And next time , for crum ’s sake , wear a tie .
If free speech is n’t what this country is all about , what the hell are we fighting for ?
Free speech ai n’t free .
Oh wait a minute .
Yeah , it is .
As we witnessed at the U.N. when both Presidents Bush and Ahmadinejad got to exercise their rights on the same day .
Think of it :
On one hand you got a religious fanatic who sponsors secret prisons and has antagonized the entire world and on the other hand you got an Iranian .
And you know why I get to say that ?
That ’s right .
I think you ’re finally getting the hang of it .

British Troops in Iraq Withdraw From Last Base in Basra
British troops in Iraq have started withdrawing from their last base in the volatile southern city of Basra , in preparation for handing security there over to Iraqi forces .
About 550 troops were reported pulling out of Basra Palace Sunday , to join 5,000 other personnel at a British air base on the outskirts of the city .
Britain's Defense Ministry said the withdrawal should be completed this week .
A statement said transferring Basra Palace to the Iraqis has long been Britain 's intention .
The statement also said Britain expects to hand over all security responsibilities in Basra province sometime in the coming months .
In other news , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki set up a panel to investigate last week 's clashes at a Shi'ite religious festival in the city of Karbala that left more than 50 people dead .
A statement from Mr. Maliki 's office said the panel will be neutral and unbiased .
Before the announcement , radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr warned he would take unspecified action if the Iraqi government fails to probe the violence in Karbala .
Last week , he ordered a freeze on activities of his Mahdi Army militia .
Iraqi officials have said gunmen loyal to al - Sadr took part in the Karbala fighting - a charge the Mahdi Army denies .
Iraqi authorities say they have detained more than 260 people for questioning about the clashes .
In violence Sunday , a car bomb in Baghdad 's Kadhimiyah district killed four people and wounded seven .
Some information for this report was provided by AFP , AP and Reuters .
An international team including scientists from the London Centre for Nanotechnology ( LCN ) have just published findings in the journal ' Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ' ( PNAS ) demonstrating the dramatic effects of quantum mechanics in a simple magnet .
The importance of the work lies in establishing how a conventional tool of material science -- neutron beams produced at particle accelerators and nuclear reactors -- can be used to produce images of the ghostly entangled states of the quantum world .
At the nano scale , magnetism arises from atoms behaving like little magnets called ' spins ' .
In ferromagnets -- the kind that stick to fridge doors -- all of these atomic magnets point in the same direction .
In antiferromagnets , the spins were thought to spontaneously align themselves opposite to the adjacent spins , leaving the material magnetically neutral overall .
The new research shows that this picture is not correct because it ignores the uncertainties of quantum mechanics .
In particular , at odds with everyday intuition , the quantum - mechanical physical laws which operate on the nano - scale allow a spin to simultaneously point both up and down .
At the same time , two spins can be linked such that even though it is impossible to know the direction of either by itself , they will always point in opposite directions -- in which case they are ' entangled ' .
With their discovery , the researchers demonstrate that neutrons can detect entanglement , the key resource for quantum computing .
One of the lead authors of the work , Professor Des McMorrow from the LCN , comments : " When we embarked on this work , I think it is fair to say that none of us were expecting to see such gigantic effects produced by quantum entanglement in the material we were studying .
We were following a hunch that this material might yield something important and we had the good sense to pursue it . "
The researchers ' next steps will be to pursue the implications for high temperature superconductors , materials carrying electrical currents with no heating and which bear remarkable similarities to the insulating antiferromagnets they have studied , and the design of quantum computers .
Tom DeLay : Scandals take GOP off the message that ' we 're winning the war in Iraq ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 30 , 2007

In the wake of sex scandals involving Senators Larry Craig ( R - ID ) and David Vitter ( R- LA ) , NBC's Today Show invited disgraced former Congressman Tom DeLay to discuss the perceptions of corruption afflicting the Republican Party .
" Do we have a party embroiled in scandal , or do we have two bad apples ? " host Matt Lauer asked DeLay .
" I hate to say this , Matt , but you just showed the problem , " replied DeLay .
" The double standard .
...
You listed a whole lot of scandals that involved Republicans but you did n't mention one Democrat . "
" The Democrats re-elect the people with their problems .
Republicans kick them out , " DeLay asserted , establishing a theme he would repeat several times during the interview .
He cited as evidence recent earmarking allegations against Rep. Alan Mollohan ( D - WV ) and the bribery investigation of Rep. William Jefferson ( D - LA ) , along with the 1990 reprimand of Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) resulting from his involvement with a gay escort and the 1983 censure of Rep. Gerry Studds ( D - MA ) for an incident with an underage page in 1973 .
" It takes us off our message , and I grant you that , " DeLay continued .
" It takes us off the fact that we 're winning in the war in Iraq , that the president 's going to stop the Democrats from raising taxes and increasing spending ... "
DeLay refused to answer questions about what Craig ought to do next or whether he might be able to ride out the storm , telling Lauer , " You asked me to come on to talk about GOP and politics , not about this man 's personal life . "
He returned instead to his earlier point that " the double standard in the media 's amazing .
The feeding frenzy , the sharks in the water that 's going on right now .
Where is the frenzy on Alan Mollahan ? "
" I 'm not going to let it end with that assumption , " said Lauer , objecting to the charge of a double standard .
" I think it 's unfair . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on August 30 .
When things happen , they sometimes leave a smear on the windshield of the car of life .
I 'm here to help investigate what that smear is , and if possible , to take a sample to catalog it for future study .
Until we get the results from this analysis , we 'll need to postpone final judgment .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
A report released by a congressionally ordered mental health task force suggests that the military ’s handling of mental health problems in its ranks is even worse than Mother Jones previously reported ( with little to no cooperation from the DoD , by the way ) .
According to NPR , 40 percent of troops returning from Iraq or Afghanistan have some sort of psychological problem .
Nearly a quarter show signs of serious mental health disorders .
It gets worse : Soldiers reporting psychological problems are not only not helped , but actually get punished for their illnesses .
Some are sent to clean the latrines ; others , in an image disturbingly resonant of Abu Ghraib , must sit in a corner wearing a dunce camp for long periods of time .
At one army base , many soldiers were kicked out of the services following psychological complaints .
The Pentagon does n’t spend enough on mental health services , nor does it train troops , officers or even mental health care providers adequately .
Believe it or not , even military doctors are n’t well trained about the links between war and PTSD .
For reasons NPR ’s correspondent does n’t address , since the War on Terror began , the few mental health specialists the DoD has “ have been leaving the Army , the Marines , and the Air Force in droves . ”
Problem is , neither the soldiers nor their demons miraculously disappear after they are released with inadequate or no treatment .
The Pentagon is outsourcing their care — to you and me and the rest of us who oppose the war in Iraq .
We are hypocrites , too , he says .
One of the book ’s examples of consumers ’ hypocrisy has to do with canned tuna .
J. W. Connolly , former president of Heinz U.S.A. , which was the parent company of StarKist , explains that “ consumers wanted a dolphin - safe product , ” but “ if there was a dolphin - safe can of tuna next to a regular can , people chose the cheaper product .
Even if the difference was a penny . ”

With such vignettes culled from the news media , Mr. Reich disembowels proponents of corporate “ social responsibility . ”
He shows that companies like Wal - Mart are operating legally yet being shamed into incurring social costs that their competitors are not .
Critics ’ campaigns are a misleading diversion , he argues , because they confuse businesses with what they can never be : public interest bodies .
Public - relations skirmishes are no substitute for democracy .
The ritual scolding of corporations in front of Congressional committees , Mr. Reich says , goes hand in hand with Congress ’s failure to pass follow - up laws that reward businesses for safeguarding the environment or walking away from deals with serial human rights abusers .
Washington is all about the money , he writes .
In 2005 , the Census Bureau listed seven suburban counties around the capital as among the 20 richest in the country .
And it ’s not just Republicans cashing in on their service .
“ Upon leaving office , ” he notes , “ more than half of the senior officials in the Clinton administration became corporate lobbyists . ”
Would - be analysts of this trend , Mr. Reich says , have it backward ; government is not historically bigger now , relative to gross domestic product , and politicians are not more corrupt .
Rather , market competition is greater , which means that public policy contests — over organic labeling , for example — have more than ever become just brawls among business rivals .
Here , however , we arrive at a cul - de-sac .
Mr. Reich argues that the “ most effective thing reformers could do is to reduce the effects of corporate money on politics and enhance the voices of citizens . ”
But he also writes of the lock that corporations have and how “ the system cannot repair itself from the inside . ”
So he opts for consciousness - raising .
The public and the media , he writes , must understand the obscured truths laid bare in his book and demand change .
In passing , Mr. Reich comes out in favor of decoupling health insurance from employers and raising the minimum wage to about half the average worker ’s wage .
He mentions runaway C.E.O. pay but offers no prescriptions .
Next week marks the sixth anniversary of 9/11 , the day when America realized that terrorists could strike here — and that from now on , there would be a never - ending demand for quart - sized plastic bags at the airport .
There were other , more serious ramifications , of course , as shown in September 11 , 2001 : The First 24 Hours , an exhibit that runs through the month at the Aurora History Museum .
And on September 11 , the museum will host a performance of Ken Clinton 's " The Recovery Suite , " a musical timeline of the day 's events in five movements for handbells and French horn .
Some of the memorials to 9/11 are considerably more modest .
In fact , one 25 - pound piece of a girder from the World Trade Center is on display in the finance office of Denver International Airport .
After the tragedy , New York City started donating pieces of the wreckage to almost anyone who asked , as long as they agreed not to sell the piece for profit — or to sue the city for any harmful substances that might have contaminated the memorabilia .
Walt Bigelow , a senior accountant at DIA , was one of those who asked , and he was given two sections of a steel girder , which he packed into his car and drove home to Denver back in 2002 .
Info 9/11
DIA management decided it might not be politic to display reminders of the tragedy at the airport , though , so Bigelow donated the larger section to the Denver Firefighters Museum , where it 's currently on display .
( If finances allow , the museum plans to add an exhibit detailing the efforts of local firefighters who went to New York City 's aid . )
The other piece has been in Bigelow 's office ever since .
Now , about those underground tunnels at the airport ...
Zombie alert :
In the thirty years since Westword first hit the streets , we 've written about Florence 's maximum - security federal prison , known as ADX , more times than prison officials would like to admit ( " The Caged Life , " August 16 ) , and about undead zombies more than we 'd care to admit ( " Things to Do in Denver When You 're [ Un ] dead , " August 23 ) .
But only an author with a creative - writing degree could combine them in a novel — and use a fake Westword story and author to pull it off .
That 's what zombie - genre author David Wellington has done in Monster Nation , published by Thunder 's Mouth Press in 2004 .
( Sorry , Off Limits is three years behind on zombie reading . )
The book begins with the following tidbit from a fictional March 15 , 2005 , article in Westword Weekly : " 'MY BROTHER WAS ALREADY DEAD !'
Clifton
Thackeray made some outrageous claims while he was being held in a Fort Collins lockup on suspicion of involvement in a truly bizarre and grizzly [ sic ] murder .
Last Saturday he attempted to hang himself with his belt .
What really happened that night in the mountains ?
Our Harry Blount investigates . "
For the record , Westword has no Harry Blount and no issue dated March 15 , 2005 .
So we went to Wellington , who sent the following e-mail .
" As for the reference — I lived in Denver from 1996 - 2002 and was an avid reader of Westword , both for the listings it provided and the quality of the reportage .
I chose it to give the novel a little verisimilitude , especially for any reader who ever lived in Denver or spent much time there .
Many other real world newspapers and news organs are used ....
The story and its author are completely fictional , my own creation . "
Now , about those tunnels at DIA ...
Sitting across from his teacher , Edgar Martinez repeated the word he could n’t quite pronounce : “ situation . ”
“ Sit - oo - a - shun , ” he said .
“ What happens with the tu ? ” asked the teacher , Lisa Mojsin , hired to help Martinez reduce his accent .
“ Chu , ” Martinez responded .

“ Yes , like chewing your food , ” Mojsin said , saying the word slowly : “ Sit - chew - a - shun . ”
“ Wow -- that is another new one for me , ” said Martinez , 37 , who emigrated from Mexico as a teenager and lives in Los Angeles .
“ I wish they had taught me this 20 years ago . ”
In classes and private tutoring sessions throughout the nation , immigrants and others are focused on sounding more American ( think prime - time news anchor ) .
They are practicing their vowels and reciting problem words .
Koreans struggle to say “ zero ” instead of “ jero . ”
Hindi speakers practice saying “ available ” instead of “ awailable . ”
And Spanish speakers from Mexico and Central America strive to say “ something ” rather than “ somesing . ”
Accent reduction classes have been around for years , but linguists and teachers say an increasingly multilingual workforce is prompting a surge in enrollments .
The American Speech - Language Hearing Assn. reports a 15 % increase from 2005 to 2006 in the number of inquiries .
Private tutors said they answer calls almost daily from prospective students , when just a few years ago the phones rang only periodically .

Author Amy Gillett said that sales of her book and CD set , “ Speak English Like an American , ” have tripled in the last few years , from 1,500 copies after its 2004 release to nearly 5,000 .
Some courses report waiting lists ; others have brought in additional instructors to meet the demand .
Judy Ravin , president of the Accent Reduction Institute in Ann Arbor , Mich. , said she has hundreds of students , including employees of General Motors and Cisco Systems , who follow her program , “ Lose Your Accent in 28 Days . ”
“ As our workforce becomes more and more global , ” she said , “ these classes are becoming more and more popular . ”
Accent reduction students said they are self - conscious about how they sound and whether their accents are limiting their job opportunities or stunting their social lives .

Jennie Lo , 43 , of Culver City said her accent has been an embarrassment since she arrived in the United States from Taiwan in 1988 .
Sometimes people could n’t even understand her when she said her name .
While in college in Oklahoma , Lo said she did n’t make many friends , fearing that no one could make out her words .
One reason she works as a fashion pattern designer is because she can go entire days without talking to anybody .
But when her daughter noticed the Chinese accent , Lo took action .
At first , she tried watching more English - language TV and listening to language tapes in the car .
But those did n’t go far enough .
“ It was a handicap , ” she said .
“ I could n’t say the things I wanted to say . ”
Lo is now taking accent reduction classes near Culver City and hopes to apply for a manager position at work .

“ I just want to feel good about myself , ” she said .
“ If I really work hard , if I practice every day , I ca n’t be perfect .
But I can be better . ”
The classes range in cost .
Mojsin charges $ 100 per hour for an individual lesson .
A 13 - week session with Dee Anne Barker , who teaches accent reduction classes in Santa Barbara , can range from $ 1,200 to $ 2,500 .
Many of the teachers are trained speech pathologists or therapists .
Some linguists are critical of accent reduction classes because they give students false hope that they will lose their accents .
Eliminating an accent is difficult , experts said .
Dennis Baron , a linguistics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , said he thinks taking courses is a waste of money .
Calming an accent , he said , takes years of interaction with native English speakers .
“ When we speak to somebody else , we tend to accommodate our pronunciation to theirs , ” he said .

Speech teachers said the goal for their clients is n’t to eliminate accents but simply to improve communication in English .
A successful class is one that helps students be understood , they said .
“ At the end of the class , will someone still have an accent ?
Yes , ” Ravin said .
“ What they wo n’t have is a language barrier . ”
Ravin and other instructors said their students ’ motivations are driven by a dual desire to assimilate and to be understood .
They are reluctant to ask for dates or make work presentations .
They fear phone calls from American friends and interviews with prospective bosses .
They universally loathe the questions : “ Pardon ? ” “ What did you say ? ” “ Can you repeat that ? ”
Martinez , who graduated from college in the U.S. , said he often led training sessions as an Herbalife distributor and worried that people were listening to his accent more than his message .

“ As soon as you sound foreign , people do give you a different reaction , ” he said .
“ People do judge you if you have an accent .
I ’ve experienced it . ”
Martinez said he did n’t expect to lose his accent entirely but just to speak more clearly .
Since he began classes , Martinez said he learned that he had been making the same mistakes for two decades , including switching the “ s ” and “ z ” sounds and mispronouncing the “ th ” sound .
After just a few months , he noticed a difference in his accent and comfort level .
“ Every carpenter needs to polish up the furniture he is building , ” Martinez said .
“ It was always the issue for me , knowing I did n’t sound like a normal person .
. . .
Maybe it was all in my head , but now that I am confident , that has all disappeared . ”
Though there is a general tolerance for linguistic diversity , experts said , English - only and anti-immigrant movements have made even some legal immigrants and naturalized citizens who sound different feel unwelcome .

“ The mainstream takes its resentment against immigrants and picks something visible , like accent , ” Baron said .
Accents can lead to stereotypes , linguists said .
If someone speaks with an accent associated with an Asian language , people may assume they work as engineers or computer scientists .
If someone speaks with certain Spanish accents , people may think they are recent immigrants working in landscaping or the hospitality industry .
Some accents are more desirable than others , said UC Berkeley linguistics professor Robin Lakoff .
For example , a French accent evokes images of romance and elegance .
A British accent -- the “ Queen ’s English ” version -- suggests superiority and sophistication .
An Australian accent brings to mind adventure and fun .
“ Whatever the nationality suggests to us , the accent does too , ” Lakoff said .

A distinctly American accent , Lakoff said , is one that has no Southern drawl , no Midwestern twang , no Brooklyn bellow .
Truth be told , she said , it ’s how Californians speak .
Basically , the American accent takes all the distinct regional dialects and flattens them , she said .
Under U.S. labor law , employers can make job decisions based on accent only if it interferes with work , such as in teaching or telemarketing .
Every year , a small number of people who believe they are victims of accent - related job discrimination take their complaints to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
William Chen , who attends classes with Mojsin and emigrated from China almost 10 years ago , said he believes that his inability to speak clearly cost him at least one job opportunity .
And in his personal life , he often felt nervous conversing in English .
For many years ,
Chen spent most of his time near his home in Monterey Park .
Advertisement
“ I just stayed in the Chinese community and spoke Chinese , ” he said .
About six months ago , Chen , 33 , decided he was tired of not being understood .
He started taking classes and working on his intonation and rhythm .
Chen said he has made some progress but still has a long way to go .
But not everyone has a lot of time .
Carla Meyer , a Los Angeles - based dialect coach for actors , said clients sometimes come to her with just a few weeks , or days , to prepare for a role .
She has been coaching for about 25 years , working with actors , including Ewan McGregor , Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen , on developing specific regional American accents , such as rural Georgian or Long Island .
Advertisement
Adopting a specific American accent for a film or TV show can be very difficult , she said , in part because the actor must be able to express a wide range of emotions in the new dialect .
Most of Meyer ’s clients are already at an advantage because they are from England , Australia or New Zealand and were raised speaking English .
She helps them become conversational and casual in American English , shortening the phrase “ let me ” to “ lemme ” and softening words such as “ pretty ” to a more everyday , phonetically sounding “ priddy . ”
“ In business , the challenge is to be understood , ” Meyer said .
“ For the lion ’s share of our clients , it ’s to have real ease and comfort in using American for every kind of emotional experience . ”

The parents of “ American Taliban ” John Walker Lindh , who is serving a 20 - year sentence in the country ’s toughest federal prison , stepped up their request for his release Wednesday by noting that the first U.S. war crimes tribunal in Guantanamo Bay recently resulted in a sentence of nine months for an Australian detainee held in U.S. custody since late 2001 .
“ John has been in prison for more than five years , ” said his mother , Marilyn Walker .
“ It ’s time for him to come home . ”
Lindh ’s lead lawyer , James J. Brosnahan of San Francisco , called the effort “ a simple cry for justice . ”
Lindh , who grew up in Marin County , left the United States when he was 18 to study Islam .
In 2001 he was in Afghanistan , serving as a soldier for the Taliban army fighting the Northern Alliance .
Advertisement
Soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , he was taken into custody by U.S. military forces and returned to the United States ; the government contended that he had been trained at an Al Qaeda terrorist camp .
He was immediately branded the American Taliban by the tabloids , at a time when many Americans wanted revenge for the terrorist attacks .
In a plea deal with federal prosecutors in 2002 , all terrorism charges were dropped .
In the end , Lindh pleaded guilty to being a soldier for the Taliban and carrying a rifle and hand grenades while doing so .
At the time , federal prosecutors said they thought the sentence was appropriate , given that Lindh had faced life in prison with no parole if convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and aiding Al Qaeda .
Advertisement
Lindh , now 26 , is in the federal Supermax prison in Florence , Colo .
His family and lawyers think that with the passage of time , there is a new opportunity to persuade President Bush to reduce the 20 - year sentence .
In addition , they said , the ruling last week that Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks of Australia will be freed after serving another nine months has moved them to seek what they consider equal justice .
Hicks was captured about the same time as Lindh in Afghanistan ; unlike Lindh , Hicks was convicted of providing material support to terrorists .
Advertisement
“ The Hicks result is again evidence that John ’s sentence should be commuted , ” Brosnahan said .
Lindh ’s family began asking Bush for clemency in 2004 , when Yaser Esam Hamdi -- a U.S. citizen who was captured in Afghanistan at the same time -- was deported to Saudi Arabia , where his family lives .
Brosnahan said the family and his legal team thought a reduction in Lindh ’s sentence was appropriate because of the leniency that others were receiving .
“ It ’s a matter of fundamental justice , ” he said .
Advertisement
Margaret Love , who served as the U.S. pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997 , noted that clemency petitions that cited other cases did not always prevail .
She added that Bush , as governor of Texas and as president , has not been one to show mercy for criminal offenders .
“ This president has shown very little interest in pardoning , ” she said .
“ And that ’s peculiar because that ’s the one power that ’s really unlimited .
He has stretched the other powers of the presidency beyond the breaking point .
But this one power that really is all his , with no checks except the popular will , he ’s shown very little interest in it . ”
She said that under Bush , about 900 pardon requests remained pending , along with thousands of commutation petitions .
Also hurting Lindh ’s chances is the death of CIA operative Johnny “ Mike ” Spann , who was killed in a riot in the Afghan prison where Lindh was being held .
His father , Johnny Spann , would have preferred a life sentence and thinks Lindh should at least do 20 years .
He said Wednesday that he opposed any commutation of the sentence .
Advertisement
“ I would encourage President Bush not to , and I hope to hell he never considers it , ” Spann said .
His son ’s efforts to question Lindh days before his death were shown worldwide on a CNN video .
Spann said those involved in the riot were “ guilty of murder .
That ’s the way I feel about it . ”
Nevertheless , Lindh ’s parents remain hopeful .
They emphasized that their son was repentant and had acknowledged that while he traveled abroad to study Islam , he was too young and naive to understand what the Taliban and other terrorist groups were about .
His father , Frank Lindh , said , “ We love our son very much . ”

Story Highlights • NEW : White House spokeswoman says 5 million official e-mails may be missing
• White House admits it should have kept e-mails on private GOP system
• Chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee doubts e-mails are deleted
• Committee investigating whether U.S. attorneys ' firings were politically motivated
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Millions of White House e-mails may be missing , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino acknowledged Friday .
" I would n't rule out that there were a potential 5 million e-mails lost , " Perino told reporters .
The administration was already facing sharp questions about whether top presidential advisers including Karl Rove improperly used Republican National Committee e-mail that the White House said later disappeared .
The latest comments were a response to a new report from a liberal watchdog group , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , alleging that over a two - year period official White House e-mail traffic for hundreds of days has vanished -- in possible violation of the federal Presidential Records Act .
( Watch CREW 's comments on the missing messages )
" This story is really now a two - part issue , " CREW 's Melanie Sloan told CNN .
" First there 's the use of the RNC e-mail server that 's inappropriate by White House officials and secondly we 've also learned that there were between March of 2003 and October of 2005 apparently over 5 million e-mail that were not preserved and these are e-mail on the regular White House server . "
Perino stressed there 's no indication the e-mails were intentionally lost , but she was careful not to dispute the outside group 's allegations .
" I 'm not taking issue with their conclusions at this point , " Perino said .
" We 're checking into them .
There are 1,700 people in the Executive Office of the President . "
White House : ' We screwed up '
Perino 's disclosure about the White House e-mail comes a day after she admitted that the White House " screwed up " by not requiring e-mails from Republican Party and campaign accounts to be saved and was also trying to recover those e-mails .
Perino said 22 aides in the political arm of the president 's office use party or campaign e-mail accounts , which were issued to separate official business from political work .
Some of those accounts were used to discuss the December firings of eight federal prosecutors , a shake - up that has triggered a spreading controversy on Capitol Hill .
Congressional investigators have questioned whether White House aides used e-mail accounts from the Republican Party and President Bush 's re-election campaign for official government business to avoid scrutiny of those dealings .
Sen . Patrick Leahy , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , accused the White House of trying to hide messages on the Republican Party system related to the firing of the U.S. attorneys , which has stirred up a hornet 's nest on Capitol Hill .
" You can't erase e-mails , not today , " said Leahy , D - Vermont .
" They 've gone through too many servers .
They can't say they 've been lost .
That 's like saying , ' The dog ate my homework . ' " ( Watch Leahy compare e-mails to Nixon tapes )
Leahy said the e-mails would have remained on party or campaign computer servers , and he compared the situation to the famous 18½ - minute gap in one of the Watergate tapes .
" They 're there , " he said .
" They know they 're there , and we 'll subpoena them , if necessary , and we 'll have them . "
Perino told reporters that the e-mails from those accounts should have been saved , but said policy has not kept pace with technology .
She said computer experts were trying to retrieve any records that have been deleted .
" We screwed up , and we 're trying to fix it , " she told reporters .
E-mails sought by special prosecutor also missing
Patrick Fitzgerald , the special prosecutor in the CIA leak case , disclosed last year that some White House e-mails in 2003 were not saved as standard procedure dictated .
In a January 23 , 2006 , letter to the defense team of former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Fitzgerald wrote : " We advise you that we have learned that not all e-mail of the Office of Vice President and the Executive Office of President for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the White House computer system . "
Robert Luskin , personal attorney for Rove , told CNN Friday that he " has no reason to doubt " Fitzgerald 's assertion that some White House e-mail was missing .
" You 're quite right , " Luskin said in a telephone interview .
" There was a gap there . "
Democrats charge this raises questions about whether the public has gotten the full story on everything from the CIA leak case to the fired U.S. attorneys controversy .
" The biggest problem here is really that here is a White House that is deliberately violating an existing statute that requires them to preserve all records , " said Sloan .
" And we have significant evidence now both from the RNC e-mail and the White House e-mail that are missing that the White House was using every means possible to avoid complying with the law . "
Luskin said it was " foolish speculation " for CREW -- which serves as counsel to former ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife , Valerie Plame , in a private suit against Rove and other Bush officials -- to suggest that the gap in White House e-mail helped Rove avoid indictment in the CIA leak case .
Luskin said Fitzgerald told him that Rove was cleared in the case because he " did nothing wrong . "
Luskin added that until this month , Rove believed his RNC e-mail was being archived and did nothing wrong .
" Rove has always understood from very early on in the Bush administration that RNC and campaign e-mail were being archived , " said Luskin .
" He was absolutely unaware until very , very recently that any e-mails were lost .
And he never asked that e-mails be deleted or asked for the authority to delete e-mails . "

Documents reveal Iraq convoy sent out despite threat
Documents reveal that an Iraq convoy was doomed almost from the start , according to an article in Monday 's L.A. Times .
" Senior managers for defense contractor KBR overruled calls to halt supply operations in Iraq in the spring of 2004 , ordering unarmored trucks into an active combat zone where six civilian drivers died in an ambush , according to newly available documents , " T. Christian Miller writes for the paper .
The article continues , " Company e-mails and other internal communications reveal that before KBR dispatched the convoy , a chorus of security advisors predicted an increase in roadside bombings and attacks on Iraq 's highways .
They recommended suspension of convoys . "
The firm 's regional security chief , citing " tons of intel , " warned beforehand , " [ I ] think we will get people injured or killed tomorrow , " however , he also said , " Big politics and contract issues involved . "
Excerpts from article :
#
KBR was under intense pressure from the military to deliver on its multibillion - dollar contract to transport food , fuel and other vital supplies to U.S. soldiers .
At Baghdad 's airport , a shortage of jet fuel threatened to ground some units .
After consulting with military commanders , KBR 's top managers decided to keep the convoys rolling .
" If the [ Army ] pushes , then we push , too , " wrote an aide to Craig Peterson , KBR 's top official in Iraq .
The decision prompted a raging internal debate that is detailed in private KBR documents , some under court seal , that were reviewed by The Times .
One KBR management official threatened to resign when superiors ordered truckers to continue driving .
" I cannot consciously sit back and allow unarmed civilians to get picked apart , " wrote Keith Richard , chief of the trucking operation .

Actor Owen Wilson 's recent suicide attempt shocked many people .
Wilson , star of a string of comedy hits including " Zoolander " and " Wedding Crashers " is rich , famous , and has been honored with an Academy Award nomination .
He also has been depressed for months .
While Wilson 's attempt was unexpected , it is not that uncommon .
Overall , the public greatly underestimates the incidence of suicide .
About 30,000 people die by suicide each year in America .
It is the ninth leading cause of death in this country , and higher for men than women .
And it 's not just an American problem .
Suicide is the second - leading cause of death for Canadian youth and young adults .
Worldwide , there are an estimated 10 million to 20 million attempted suicides each year .
In fact , the suicide rate is higher than the homicide rate : Nearly a third more people die at their own hands than die at other people 's hands ( the murder rate in America is about 6 per 100,000 ; for suicides it 's 10.8 ) .
So for every two murders you hear about , three other people killed themselves .
One reason that people believe homicide is much more common than suicide is because of the news media 's selective coverage .
Most people hear about the vast majority of deaths ( such as accidents , homicides , and suicides ) not from personal experience but from the news .
Yet while murders make daily news , suicides and suicide attempts are often not considered newsworthy unless the victim is famous ( such as Wilson , musician Kurt Cobain , or comedian Richard Jeni ) or is part of a group ( such as the Heaven 's Gate cult ) .
There may be another reason why journalists are reluctant to cover suicide stories :
They can lead to copycats , or what is called " suicide contagion , " where others who are considering suicide are prompted to kill themselves from seeing news reports .
While not common , it does happen , and helps to keep the true cost of suicides out of the public 's mind .
Benjamin Radford is managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine .
He is co-author of " Hoaxes , Myths , and Manias : Why We Need Critical Thinking " ( 2003 ) .
This and other books are noted on his website .
Judge Reggie B. Walton , who presided over the trial , has great leeway in fixing a sentence because federal guidelines are no longer as binding as they once were .
But they still provide a recommended time range that is reached by a complicated calculation .
The probation office calculated the range as 15 to 21 months , Mr. Libby ’s lawyers said .
“ Distinguished public servant .
Generous mentor .
Selfless friend , ” begins the court filing in which Mr. Libby ’s lawyers asked that he be spared prison .
“ This is the rich portrait of Mr. Libby that emerges from the description of him in more than 160 heartfelt letters submitted to the court on his behalf . ”
“ There is no denying the seriousness of the crimes of which Mr. Libby was convicted , ” the lawyers wrote .
“ At the same time , there is no denying the kind of person Mr. Libby is and the contributions he has made to his country . ”
While the two sides have offered starkly different proposals for Mr. Libby ’s sentence , another question to be decided by Judge Walton may be equally important .
If he sentences Mr. Libby to prison , he has to decide whether he should begin serving his time immediately or be allowed to remain free pending his appeal .
The issue could bear on whether Mr. Libby receives a presidential pardon .
Mr. Libby ’s lawyers and other supporters have said President Bush should issue a pardon , and if Mr. Libby is sent to jail on Tuesday , that decision would have to be put immediately in front of the president if a pardon were to have any value .
The White House has not commented on the possibility of a pardon .

Lately whenever I see a reference to General David Petraeus , it makes me wonder about the history of the Praetorian Guard .
Yes , I know the names are spelled differently — but I just ca n’t help putting them together .
Am I the only one afflicted with this impulse ?
It just seems too weird to go without mentioning .
Not only is the U.S. re-enacting the decline and fall of the Roman Empire , but the name of the top military commander in the outer reaches of the empire practically screams out for such comparisons .
In the next few days there will be constant references to Gen .
Petraeus leading up to his anticipated report on the splendid “ progress ” we are making in Iraq .
This seems like a good time to see what Wikipedia says about the Praetorian Guard .
Here are some excerpts ( with hyperlinks omitted ) :
The term “ Praetorian ” came from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the field — the praetorium .
It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as bodyguards of the tent or the person … .
In time , this cohort came to be known as the cohors praetoria , and various notable figures possessed one , including Julius Caesar , Mark Antony and Augustus ( Octavian ) … The group that was formed initially differed greatly from the later Guard , which would assassinate emperors ….
With the right amount of money , or at will , they assassinated emperors , bullied their own prefects , or turned on the people of Rome .
In 41 Caligula was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard .
The Praetorians placed Claudius on the throne , daring the Senate to oppose their decision ….
It seems painfully obvious to me that the Praetorian Guard has been in charge of the U.S. for many decades .
We 've had an assassination of a U.S. President .
With the right amount of money , or a commitment to open the U.S. Treasury to military plundering , the Praetorians can elect Presidents too .
Is it any wonder that American voters were only given a choice between two pro-war , Yale educated , Skull and Bones initiates in 2004 ?
Is it any wonder that Cong .
Ron Paul is the only Presidential candidate that credibly opposes the war in 2007 ?
The Wikipedia article on Gen. Petraeus also provides disturbing facts that only reinforce the historical theme of the Roman Empire .
Take for instance his stint at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and International Affairs at Princeton University .
The sad legacy of Woodrow Wilson has been recounted again and again at LRC , so I will simply provide a sampling for those who want to look here , here or here .
The bio on General " Praetorian " gets even more interesting for those who want to predict the future , and not merely recount history .
As noted by Wikipedia :
On the other hand , Lawrence Korb has called him “ the most political general since General [ Douglas ] MacArthur ” and said that “ [ he ] is very ambitious ” ( adding “ and there ’s nothing wrong with that ” ) .
It 's not entirely crazy to imagine that General " Praetorian " could become President " Praetorian " .
Think about it .
It was n't too long after the U.S dropped nukes on Japan that the country elected a former General named " Ike " as President .
And now it 's no longer considered MAD for the Pentagon to openly test proxies for theatre tactical nukes right outside Las Vegas .
Of course , the " credible " candidates for President all refuse to take the nuclear option " off the table " with respect to Iran .
The past is prologue .
Heck , even our very first President was a General .
Maybe W will simply declare himself Caesar for life , only to be deposed by his own " Petraeus " Guard .
Caesar Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex , and Caesar Washington warned us against entangling alliances and foreign adventures .
But the fate of the Republic seems to have been written from the very beginning .
Certainly our founders were conscious of the fate of ancient Rome even as they adopted the fasces as a symbol of our national power .
And yes , it 's the same symbolism from which Italian fascism derived its name .
Guard !
Guard !
Arrest the President .
And the General too !
Oh , never mind .

Perhaps smarting from how bad they came across in the Max Blumenthal videos of CPAC and the Young Republicans convention ( and even they are minimally self - aware enough to have figured out that they looked really , really bad ) , there were some conservatives looking to make the netroots look equally hack -y at the Yearly Kos convention .
So predictably , Malkin , Drudge and the NRO ( I wo n't link to them because they deserve your scorn , not your hits ) trumpeted that a soldier was censored by Kossacks trying to speak in defense of the military .
Because , you know , liberals do n't support the troops like the right does .
( / snark )
Such a tired and vastly unsubstantiated meme .
Here 's the exchange in question :
So technically , what the right wingers said is what happened .
However , here is where they are fundamentally dishonest ( * gasp ! * Malkin , Drudge and PajamasMedia , dishonest ?
Shocking , I know ) : the sergeant in question was told repeatedly that he would be in violation of the UCMJ if he made any kind of political speech in uniform .
You can't hear it from the video here , but according to witnesses , the sergeant ADMITTED HE KNEW HE WAS BREAKING THE RULES :
Soltz , who is still a Captain in the Reserves , at that point had heard all he wanted to hear .
As an officer , he took it upon himself to reprimand the sergeant for breaking the Uniform Code of Military Justice , left the stage , and went to confront the soldier .
In fact , if he had n't reprimanded the soldier , he could have been seen as condoning the act - and none of us wanted to do that . [..]
The bottom line is this :
The sergeant in uniform was completely out of line as far as the military is concerned .
The fact that he did what he did reflected on the entire Army and I think that 's what upset Jon the most .
In the Pajamas Media video of the scene , even the sergeant readily admits that he was breaking the rules .
And that 's not what the Army is about .
So this was n't about stifling dissent .
It was about an intruder who had no respect for the Kossacks who'd paid to attend , as well as no desire maintain military bearing while in uniform .
The whole account is here .
So for the right - wingers who want to crow about this ... let it be known what really happened .
Wait , stop the internet !
Remember when I said the most massive black hole had been discovered ?
Sorry , that record has been broken by an even more “ most massive black hole ” .
16 times the mass of the Sun ?
Please .
This new one raises the bar with a mass of 24 to 33 times the mass of our Sun .
As with the previous black hole , located in the nearby galaxy M33 , this newly announced black hole is in a binary system .
It ’s located in the nearby dwarf galaxy IC 10 , 1.8 million light - years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia .
Since it ’s orbiting another star , astronomers were able to calculate its mass – 24 - 33 solar masses .
The discovering team , led by Andrea Prestwich of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics used NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to study IC 10 .
They observed that the galaxy ’s brightest X - ray source , IC 10 X - 1 , varied in brightness .
This led them to believe that a star was periodically passing in front of a black hole , briefly obscuring it from view .
Follow up observations with NASA ’s Swift satellite confirmed that the black hole was being eclipsed by the companion star , and gathered enough data that astronomers could work out the orbital period , and thus the masses of both objects .
A black hole this massive is surprising .
Astronomers calculate that massive stars should throw off most of their gas before detonating as supernovae .
No black hole should be able to exceed 15 times the mass of the Sun .
In the case of IC 10 X - 1 ; however , it ’s blown past that theoretical limit .
Of course , it could have detonated as its largest size , and then consumed material from its companion article .
But according to their calculations , it could only have gained 1 or 2 solar masses over the years .
So how did it get so large ?
It probably started life with about 60 times the mass of the Sun .
Since its host galaxy is deficient in any heavier elements , it was probably composed largely of hydrogen and helium .
The heavier elements are actually easier to blow away from the star on the solar wind , so it maintained most of its mass right up until the end .

How to be a fearless negotiator
Michael C Donaldson | September 05 , 2007 09:17 IST
W elcome to the Wish - Want - Walk method of negotiating .
This book is designed to take the angst out of any negotiation in which you will take part .
The Wish - Want - Walk method of negotiating works from the bedroom to the boardroom and all around the world .
The Wish - Want - Walk method has three simple steps :
Conjuring up your Wish result for this negotiation ;
Understanding your
Want ( where you think the negotiation is most likely to end up in light of everything you know about the market and the person you are negotiating with ) ;
Setting your Walk Away point .
When you have your Wish , Want , Walk firmly in your head before you start negotiating , you know that the deal will have to fall within those parameters or you will not agree .
No matter how the person on the other side of the table may scream or bully or put you down , it is not going to change your Wish , Want , Walk .
You know that you are a not going back to the office with a deal that is outside the Wish - Want - Walk plan that everybody agreed to before the negotiation started .
When you have made your plan beforehand , you may have to waste some time enduring bad behaviour , but you wo n't make a bad deal .
If you stick to your Wish , Want , Walk , that can't happen .
You might have thought that you really wanted this deal , but now you have an independent reason not to do the deal with this individual .
He or she behaves badly .
That creates a toxic atmosphere .
You do n't want that person in your life .
You know now that for the deal to be attractive to you , you will have to close it at the top of your Want or even closer to your Wish , because of the nature of the person across the table .
Your Personal Action Plan
Wish , Want ,
Walk will not keep your blood pressure down and will not make these nightmare situations be the way you want to spend your afternoons .
Here is exactly what you should do in these situations :
Ask questions
Listen
Take a break
These are the three silver bullets you can use in response to unacceptable behaviour .
They work their magic in a nonthreatening manner .
You will see why as you read on .
In the face of unacceptable behaviour , the first thing to do is ask questions and listen carefully to the answers .
In most instances , you will be well served to do some probing .
Find out whatever you can about the statement that surprised you .
Showing some genuine interest in the statement can evoke a further explanation .
The person already is talking .
Get him or her to talk some more .
It is a powerful tool .
Later , you can review the responses that have been provided .
Questions are like trowels in the garden .
They help you dig up information , examine the soil , and find out what will make the garden grow .
Asking questions produces much more solid results than trying to make an instantly brilliant definitive statement that leaves the other person without a response , flat - footed , befuddled , and running from the room screaming for help .
Only in the movies do those ready responses flow so freely from the lips .
Of course , a highly paid scriptwriter had months to come up with the lines that the actor says so spontaneously on screen .
You do n't have that kind of time .
Forget the clever quip .
It 's not going to happen .
Questions get you past the awkward moment when the other party ahs stepped over the line .
They form a break in the dialogue .
The answers should give you some information that will help you build a consensus in spite of the other party 's bad behavior .
When you have asked any questions that come to mind at these awkward moments and listened to the response all the way through , take a break .
Do n't try to be brilliant .
Do n't come back until you are ready .
I call this pushing the pause button .
In a negotiation , the pause button works exactly like the pause button on a DVD player .
It freezes everything in place so that we can step away from the negotiation .
We can see the picture clearly from every angle .
We can leave the room .
We can take a break that is as long or short as we need .
We can get ready to resume negotiating .
It is our internal pause button that helps us maintain our emotional distance .
It is the pause button that prevents us from falling in love with the process so that we lose sight of our Wish , Want , Walk .
Everybody has a pause button .
Some people just forget to use it or do n't even think about using in a negotiation .
One you realize what a lifesaver it can be in a negotiation , you will never leave home without it .
In every negotiating seminar , we go around the room and talk about the best way to create a break .
People use a wide range of techniques to give themselves room to breath .
Some people tell a joke , some " need to go to the bathroom , " and some " need to make a phone call . "
The list is endless .
What is your favourite pause button ?
Take a moment to think about your own pause buttons .
At seminars , participants list a variety of techniques to break things up from telling jokes to asking for a bathroom break - now who could refuse that ?
I like to take a break without labeling it in any way .
That way , there is no mistake that the reason for the break is the conduct of the other party , not some artificial reason .
Whatever works for you to interrupt the flow is what you should do .
Do not try to deal with the problem before you take a break .
You will not come up quickly with that devastating statement that turns your opponent into a withering mass of Jell - o .
Do n't even try .
This is also an opportunity to use a tool I 've occasionally found effective .
It 's difficult for some people , but you might want to try it next time you are across the table from a person who is misbehaving .
Sometimes , when someone lies , bullies , curses , or screams , I call him or her on it .
I tell that person coolly that this behaviour is unacceptable and that if it continues , our negotiations will be suspended .
Calling a person on bad behaviour usually stops it -- not always but often enough to make this technique useful .
Remember , that person would n't be negotiating with you if you did n't have something he or she wanted .
These people can rein in their unacceptable behaviour if they are convinced that it is in their best interest to do so .
If you try this technique , you must take a break if the behaviour continues .
You can not make idle threats during a negotiation without threatening the entire negotiation and any deal that grows out on it .
Wish , Want ,
Walk will not insulate you from unpleasant experiences in the negotiating room , but it will help you deal with those situations .
IT helps you by giving you a framework you can rely on .
You simply wo n't be pushed past your Walk regardless of the trick or tactic or tirade .
If you find yourself in such a position , do n't try to be a hero .
Ask some questions .
Listen to the answers .
Then take a break .
You are not gong to change the person on the other side .
Your job is to close the deal as soon as possible .
Maybe you can send someone else to negotiate with this person next time , but if you do , be sure to warn your replacement .
If you have n't been in one of these tight spots during a negotiation , maybe you are just blessed .
But then , why would you be reading this chapter ?
Or maybe you are a screamer yourself , and you do n't mind or notice when someone else screams .
If that is the case , your problem is beyond the scope of this book , but I hope - for your sake - that you are working on the problem .

If you grew up on a farm , the first thing you were taught about fertilizer is that you can't use waste from anything that eats meat .
Cows okay .
Humans bad .
Researchers in Finland disagree and say that human urine is virtually sterile , free of bacteria or viruses and naturally rich in nitrogen and other nutrients .
Urine fertilization is rare today though they say it was common in ancient times .
Maybe in Finland .
In the new study , Surendra K. Pradhan and colleagues collected human urine from private homes and used it to fertilize cabbage crops .
Then they compared the urine - fertilized crops with those grown with conventional industrial fertilizer and no fertilizer .
The analysis showed that growth and biomass were slightly higher with urine than with conventional fertilizer .
There was no difference in nutritional value of the cabbage .
" Our results show that human urine could be used as a fertilizer for cabbage and does not pose any significant hygienic threats or leave any distinctive flavor in food products , " the report concludes .

While I do not always end up managing to put each of the following tips into practice , I do make a big effort to do so each day .
This is a list of my favorite tips to improving your life .
All it takes is a little bit each day and you will see wondrous changes .
Feel free to add your own tips to the comments .
10 . Get off to a Good Start
This means getting up early and eating breakfast .
You will have much more energy throughout the day to follow the rest of these tips if you do !
If you are so inclined , you can even include a little exercise in your morning routine .
If you live with other people you can try to use this opportunity to get everyone together at the table to eat in the mornings .
This is a nice way to start the day and a good way to ensure open lines of communication in a very busy household .

9. Keep a Schedule
It is a very good idea to write down the tasks you need to achieve in each day .
As you complete them , tick them off .
You should not , however , feel like you are bound to your list .
If you do n’t manage to do everything , it does n’t matter – move any incomplete tasks from today on to tomorrow ’s list .
This is also a great help if you are a procrastinator .
8 . Take a Break and have Fun
If you spend too much time in front of the computer , at your desk , or doing whatever it is that your occupation requires , you should take a break .
This does n’t mean you have to take time off work – it just means you should try to make better use of your non -work time to do something fun .
I always have difficulty pulling myself away from the computer and as a result I do n’t go out as often as I should on the weekend or in the evening .
But every time I do – I wonder why I have n’t done it sooner .
This is a good way to develop new interests , and friends and to break up the monotony of everyday life .
7. Be Generous
Generosity has a tendency to come back .
By generosity I am not referring only to money .
You can be generous with your smiles , your advice , and many other things .
Always try to find a way to help others .
One day you may be in great need and people you know will be more likely to come to your aid when they know that you would do the same for them .
You might know someone that could use help around the home from time to time – not only are you doing a good thing by helping them out , but you may also make a great new friend .
6 . Accept the things you ca n’t Change
When something bad happens in our lives , we try to fix them or change them .
But sometimes we can’t .
Often this leads us to spend hours moping and falling in to depression .
If you can make yourself accept the things you cannot change – you will become a much happier person .
Acceptance of these situations also allows us to start finding a way to cope much faster .
For example , you may realize that you have only $ 10 left in your bank account that has to last the next 2 weeks .
Instead of getting down about it , accept that you have no money and work out a way to survive on that amount .
You can save yourself from wasting hours in a bad mood by just getting on with life .
You will find much more serenity in life following this tip .

5. Learn a New Language
Learning another language is one of the best ways to improve your grasp on English .
In my own experience , learning French at high school taught me so much more about grammar than English class ever did .
In addition , when I later started studying Ancient Greek , I learnt a lot about the roots of English words – something I have found very useful in writing in the years since .
As well as improving your knowledge of English , if you learn a living language you increase the number of places you might like to visit – or make those holidays much more enjoyable by being able to speak to the natives in their own tongue .
4. Break the Chain
If you have a lot of patterns in your life , try breaking them – do something different every day .
Let ’s say you always order the same meal at your regular Friday night restaurant .
Why not try something else this Friday ?
Not only do you get to broaden your experiences of life , you open up many doors for the future .
Not long ago I would never eat oriental foods or seafood .
Then one day I decided that I would just try it .
Seafood is now one of my favorite foods and I would hate to be without it .
Because I discovered that I love Thai and Chinese food , I can eat in any restaurant I want .
That first step also meant that I am now willing to try absolutely any food ( except maybe the ones on the Top 10 most Disgusting Foods list ) .
My disliking for those foods had a much greater impact as well – I would only holiday in countries that had foods I felt safe with .
Since then I have been to Oriental countries and loved it .
3. Face the Fear
Every day you should do something you do n’t want to do – or feel uncomfortable doing .
This varies in degrees for everyone , but we all have little things we can start out with .
For example , you may not go to the gym because you fear everyone looking at you – do it anyway !
In no time you will be so much more confident that you abolish the fear entirely and can move on to the next fear – maybe even something bigger .
Living a fearless life gives you a confidence that is visible to others .
Instead of building walls around ourselves , we should be tearing them down .
2. Forget Goals – Live for the Now
Lists of this nature almost always tell you to set and write goals .
I am going to tell you the opposite .
A very wise psychotherapist once told me that if you set a goal , and achieve it , you are often left with an empty feeling because the goal is not what you thought it would be .
Not only does it not satisfy , you inevitably end up missing out on so much life by striving to reach something in the future .
Having said this , I do n’t think you should ignore the future – it is worth having some idea of what you might like to one day achieve – but do n’t focus all of your energy on getting it .
A good example of the difference is this : I have a goal to live in France .
I spend 10 years trying to save up all my money so I can acheive that goal .
In the meantime I am so busy scrimping and saving , that I ca n’t afford to go out with friends , I ca n’t afford to live in a nice home , and I am miserable because I am not living in France .
On the other hand , if I simply decide that one day I would like to live in France , the idea is in my mind , but I continue to live and enjoy my life .
In living my life , I am happy now and not focused on a distant goal .
If it happens , great .
If it does n’t happen , I have n’t failed at anything .
But who knows what wonderful things may happen in my life in the meantime ?
A very good fictitious example of this can be found in the film American Beauty .
1. Do n’t Procrastinate
This is one I struggle with a lot in my own life .
This has been a great challenge for me as I work from home , but taking this job has really helped me to stop putting things off and take control of my life .
The feeling after completing a task you would normally put off is a great high – and certainly a much healthier one than some of the other highs in our lives .
When you put something off , you are putting yourself into time - debt .
You have to pay that debt back and almost always you end up having to do that at the most inconvenient time .
By putting off writing an article for the site , for example , I end up having to write one at 7 at night when I would rather be watching a movie and having a drink !
Your life will become so much more organized if you follow this rule .
Bonus : Read the List Universe every day
Scientific studies have proven that people who read the List Universe every day live much happier and fuller lives .
Okay – I made that up – but do it anyway !

IT was one of those stories lost in the newspaper ’s inside pages .
Last week a man you ’ve never heard of — Charles D. Riechers , 47 , the second - highest - ranking procurement officer in the United States Air Force — killed himself by running his car ’s engine in his suburban Virginia garage .
Mr. Riechers ’s suicide occurred just two weeks after his appearance in a front - page exposé in The Washington Post .
The Post reported that the Air Force had asked a defense contractor , Commonwealth Research Institute , to give him a job with no known duties while he waited for official clearance for his new Pentagon assignment .
Mr. Riechers , a decorated Air Force officer earlier in his career , told The Post : “ I really did n’t do anything for C.R.I .
I got a paycheck from them . ”
The question , of course , was whether the contractor might expect favors in return once he arrived at the Pentagon last January .
Set against the epic corruption that has defined the war in Iraq , Mr. Riechers ’s tragic tale is but a passing anecdote , his infraction at most a misdemeanor .
The $ 26,788 he received for two months in a non-job does n’t rise even to a rounding error in the Iraq - Afghanistan money pit .
So far some $ 6 billion worth of contracts are being investigated for waste and fraud , however slowly , by the Pentagon and the Justice Department .
That does n’t include the unaccounted - for piles of cash , some $ 9 billion in Iraqi funds , that vanished during L. Paul Bremer ’s short but disastrous reign in the Green Zone .
Yet Mr. Riechers , not the first suicide connected to the war ’s corruption scandals , is a window into the culture of the whole debacle .
Through his story you can see how America has routinely betrayed the very values of democratic governance that it hoped to export to Iraq .
Look deeper and you can see how the wholesale corruption of government contracting sabotaged the crucial mission that might have enabled us to secure the country : the rebuilding of the Iraqi infrastructure , from electricity to hospitals .
You can also see just why the heretofore press - shy Erik Prince , the owner of Blackwater USA , staged a rapid - fire media blitz a week ago , sitting down with Charlie Rose , Lara Logan , Lisa Myers and Wolf Blitzer .
Speaking of the September 11th 2001 attacks Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska said , “ This is the second Pearl Harbor .
I do n't think that I overstate it , " .
The Bush administration and it ’s supporters wanted Americans to be afraid , cooperative and compliant .
That is still what they want .
There has been quite a bit of discussion lately about Bush and Cheney declaring martial law and canceling the 2008 election .
I personally do n’t think they could pull it off , but the bits and pieces of information that have come out certainly makes the suggestion seem to have some merit .
Many of these have been outlined is a recent article by Harvey Wasserman & Bob Fitrakis .
Some of the evidence that points toward a non-electoral power grab :
5 ) The ability to declare almost anyone an “ enemy combatant ” which then precludes them from exercising their habeus corpus rights is also troubling in this regard .
There are many other facts that are also troubling , but there is one thing that is critical , which is missing from the proposed scenarios .
The Third “ Pearl Harbor Type Event ” .
I do n’t see increased illegal immigration , or progressives protesting in the streets , or any of the normal things that happen in the country every day would provide the cover they would need to pull off a non-electoral power grab .
That leaves another large terrorist attack , or other national emergency , to present itself at just the right time .
Bush ca n’t count on bin Laden for this one .
Since Bush and FEMA apparently do n’t consider a category 4 hurricane destroying a major US city as a national emergency , I think we can safely say it would have to be a massive “ terrorist attack ” , in order to be elevated to an election - canceling event .
Al Qaeda has no current incentive to attack the US , because it would give Bush more power and prestige .
So if Bush and Cheney can’t count on terrorists to give them the excuse they need , they will have to come up with an excuse of their own .
I personally am not much of a conspiracy theorist .
However , if you are then you need to round out this coup plot to make it believable and workable .
You also need all the pieces of the puzzle in place if you are going to try and thwart the plan .
As such , you will need to try to determine based on their actions and public statements what type of third Pearl Harbor event they might be planning .

Alkaline water has been making waves among health and wellness enthusiasts because of the number of benefits people can get from drinking it regularly .
Despite some doubts about its effectivity , there are countless testimonies from people who experienced its benefits firsthand , including a few well - known celebrities who made it a part of their diet .
Can your family in Singapore also enjoy the benefits of alkaline water ?
Here are the reasons why you need to try alkaline water .
Alkaline Water has a Higher pH
If you recall from your chemistry class , pH stands for the number of hydrogen ions in a substance such as water .
It measures the alkalinity or the acidity of the substance , with zero being highly acidic and 14 as alkaline .
Regular drinking water has a neutral pH of 7 .
So , if you are wondering how to make alkali water and increase its pH level , it is simply by running the water through an alkaline water ionizer , which you can buy from a reseller Here in Singapore .
Once it has passed through the water filter , it will now contain pH level of 8 or 9 , which is considered a healthier level of pH than in tap water .
Alkaline Water Gives Better Hydration
Unlike medications , there is nothing wrong with drinking processed water ; in fact , water can help keep your body hydrated .
Alkaline water , however , has been shown to improve hydration better than drinking regular drinking water , because research showed that there was more alkaline in the blood and urine of people who drank alkaline water .
Alkaline Water Can Help Soothe Acid Reflux
One of the benefits of drinking alkaline water is its ability to help reduce instances of acid reflux due to high levels of acid in the stomach and from the food you eat .
Ideally , you would need alkaline water with a pH of 8 to neutralize the acids in your tummy .
As a result , your stomach can break down food more easily and increase the ability to absorb the necessary nutrients from the food you eat .
Although the body already does a good job of regulating the alkalinity and acidity of the blood , stomach , and the byproducts of the food and drinks you take into your system , there are still factors that will help your body keep the pH of your blood within a healthy range .
Alkaline Water has Antioxidants
More accurately , alkaline water can help your metabolism and energy distribution because it has antioxidant properties or anti-disease and anti-aging properties that rejuvenates the skin , cleanses the colon , supports the immune system , and lubricates the joints and muscles .
You will feel younger and healthier just by drinking alkaline water , because it frees your bodies from harmful free radicals .
Alkaline Water Improves Blood Pressure Alkaline water can improve blood circulation because you ’re more hydrated and it contains minerals such as sodium that will help in the distribution of oxygen in the different organs .
Better circulation not just promotes cell growth , but you will also feel healthier overall .
The sodium in the alkaline water specifically , can help control the blood pressure if you ’re on a low - sodium diet .
Alkaline Water Makes Bones Stronger
Although further studies still need to be done , the evidence is promising when it comes to alkaline water ’s effect on the bones .
Some researchers claim that the higher the level of acid in the body , the more likely it is for the bones to weaken over time .
This corresponds to studies about people who consume food with more potassium than those with higher acid diet load .
The former had stronger bones and were less likely to develop osteoporosis .
These suggest that alkaline water can possibly increase the markers of bone health among families who drink it regularly .
Alkaline Water Can Help
You Lose Weight Alkaline water has been shown to help people lose weight or maintain an ideal weight , because the fat cells that the body needs for protection are no longer needed .
This comes from the theory that claims the body needs fat cells to regulate or defend itself from acid .
This claim needs more proof , however , but the results in some tests are promising .
It ’s also not that difficult to figure out the role of water when it comes to losing weight , because the body needs to stay hydrated all the time to reduce the tendency to feel hunger .
Alkaline Water Side Effects are Mild Like any food , drink , and medicine , alkaline water also has side effects .
If you or one of your family members is taking medication regularly , do not forget to consult your doctor in Singapore before purchasing an alkaline water ionizer for your home .
Alkaline water is considered generally safe , but doctors caution the public not to substitute it for drinking water .
Just like having an acidic stomach could be harmful to you , the high pH from alkaline water could also cause some problems .
Always check the labels on the bottled alkaline water and purchase only the best alkaline water ionizer that you can find in Singapore .
Alkaline Water Sources
Alkalinized water using the alkaline water ioniser machine is not the only source for alkaline water .
You could also change regular drinking water from the tap using water filter , water additives , and faucet attachments .
There are also bottled alkaline water sold at stores in Singapore perfect for those who are training as athletes , because it contains all the necessary minerals to replenish lost nutrients .
Alkaline water is also not that different from natural mineral water because their sources are identical .
Alkaline water , however , can come from two sources ; electrolysis or ionization and adding minerals and alkaline ingredients .
The former can be done using the alkaline water ionizer which separates the constituents of water into alkaline and acidic elements .
Adding minerals to distilled water can be done using lime , lemon , baking soda , pH drops , and others .

Security June 01 , 2018
One of the most recent advancements in modern technology has to be the creation of the CCTV camera system .
Here in Singapore , you may have noticed CCTV installations in public places , installed to prevent crime and uphold peace on the island .
There are many benefits to CCTV technology , such as added security , to the point that we can see much of it used here in Singapore , in offices , houses , and public places .
But as with any piece of helpful technology , CCTV camera systems have its own drawbacks , due to irresponsible usage .
If you ’re thinking about installing a CCTV system in your home or office , you might be thinking about weighing the pros and cons of a CCTV camera .
After all , there are a lot of valid concerns against a CCTV system .
Here we look at all the advantages and disadvantages of a CCTV system , to guide your choice on whether to purchase one or not .
Pros
1. Heightened monitoring
The main purpose of a CCTV system is giving you the ability to see everything that happens in an area .
With the push of a button , an officer can easily rewind the tape to aid in an investigation , have a secured doorway control program in Singapore , or a mom could check the feed to check up on the family cat .
Rather than just lessening crime , there are also other practical things that a monitoring system can let you do , both in the workplace and in the home .
In a company workplace , an office camera can boost productivity .
With the ability to monitor your employees , you have an accurate record as well as evidence about the daily habits of your employees .
You can also monitor the punctuality of your employees .
With a CCTV camera , you have a record of when an employee arrives or leaves .
With video evidence , which can give you a good idea of why an employee is habitually late and how best to avoid it .
At home , a CCTV system can help you locate items that have been misplaced .
Short of proving that someone came in and stole an item , you can use a monitoring system to prove if it was you who misplaced an item , or if someone else in the house took it for themselves .
No more walking around trying to trace your steps , making a mess while trying to look for your keys or wallet .
You could easily check the records to find them in no time .
You can also check up on other members of the family , including pets .
2 . Maintain records
If something interesting happened in your own backyard , you always have a record of it .
Whether it ’s a crime or simply something that you would like to be reminded of , such as the face of a new neighbor , you could easily consult your CCTV records .
Since a CCTV can organize information systematically , you would n’t even have to worry too much about going through records and will be able to find your clip easily .
IP CCTV such as Singapore http://www.secureoffice.sg/cctv/
can even give you more access to your records .
Since an IP camera is designed to be accessed over the internet , you can check your records even if you ’re on the road , and view footage in real - time .
3 . Lessen crime
In the UK , CCTV has been shown to reduce crime by up to 50 % , closing half more cases than they would have without the use of a security camera .
CCTVs can undoubtedly help reduce crime rates not just in public areas , but also in private spaces , such as homes and offices .
While the UK often use more expensive IP CCTV , you may still lessen crime with a good analog camera .
An analog camera is still a good alternative especially if you ’re tight on budget , or if you ’re simply securing a small private space , like a home or office .
While an IP camera has a few benefits over analog , such as heightened resolution and remote access , it may be a bit too much for the average homeowner .
Cons
1 . Can make people uncomfortable and breach privacy
Here in Singapore , there are a lot of people who are not comfortable with a security camera , and it ’s not hard to see why .
Having your actions monitored 24/7 can make people feel anxious .
It may raise issues of trust and privacy , especially in private spaces .
In professional environments as well as within homes , it can stir controversy and be offensive to the people being monitored .
2 . Vulnerable
Even the most expensive IP camera is n’t 100 % safe .
As with any piece of technology , there are still vulnerabilities in a CCTV system , which can be a huge deterrent to anyone planning to invest in a system .
Criminals , with enough determination and know - how , can disable or access your CCTV system .
However , it should be noted that there are still a lot of steps you can take to keep your system safe from tampering , such as getting your model from a trusted manufacturer or making sure that all connections are closed off and secure .
3 . Unable to stop crime
While CCTV systems have been shown to lessen criminal activity and raise the probability of wrong - doers being caught , CCTV cameras are still just that : cameras .
It can only record the crime as it happens .
It will be unable to do anything about it , unlike an alarm system which can alert the proper authorities .
Therefore , CCTV cameras are n’t very effective in stopping crime as it happens ; you will need to pair it with other security systems , such as an alarm system , to make sure that you are fully protected from crime .

Do you love your coffee but hate having to line up or waiting too long for your favorite energy boost ?
If so , you might consider hiring a mobile coffee caterer to get the most out of your coffee breaks .
When it comes to coffee , you need not just quality , but also quantity and service – and these are some of the few reasons why you need a coffee catering service for all your needs .
What ’s in a Coffee Break ?
A great coffee break is one that you can get without having to wait in line for too long to get your cup of mocha , cappuccino , or latte .
Instead , the time spent waiting is time spent enjoying the experience of a warm cup of exceptional coffee .
And when you ’re sipping a cup of great coffee , you ’ll know that there ’s no need for sugar or other kinds of artificial sweeteners to get the full , rich taste of freshly roasted and ground coffee beans that you know and love .
Great coffee breaks with a cappuccino serving push cart in Singapore should also be in a light , roomy environment where people can walk around , stretch their legs , and chat .
Breaks can also be refreshing with a side helping of dessert , especially if people will be getting hungry and tired during the event .
Why Get a Coffee Cart ?
Fast service is key to making sure events go as smoothly as possible , especially if they take a while .
And along with fast service comes quality and quantity to ensure that everyone gets an amazing blend – all of which are things a mobile coffee catering service can offer .
Having a coffee cart also spices any gathering , whether it ’s public or private .
Here are a few events that can surely benefit from having a coffee catering service : • Conferences – A good coffee break keeps everyone awake and alert , and when access to great coffee is nearby , it also keeps delegates from wandering off too far or waiting too long in line .
For large events with a hundred or more delegates , you may need to hire two baristas to make sure that everyone consistently gets an amazing specialty drink .
• Public Events –
It ’s always good to attract a crowd with a mobile coffee cart .
Because attendees and event organizers will always be on their feet all the time , having a trusted mobile coffee cart not only makes the event better , but it also grabs guests ’ attention longer .
It also helps you as an exhibitor to include a coffee push cart along with your exhibition , as it helps build brand awareness with clients by tying quality coffee , and by extension quality services and products , to your brand and logo .
• Gala Dinners – Adding freshly - brewed espresso to any fancy gala dinner automatically gives it an added aura of luxury .
Rather than your standard coffee - maker and tea , these energizing beverages when served hot and fresh can truly improve the mood and make any gala dinners something new entirely .
• Weddings – Hiring a coffee push cart is n’t just for public events .
In fact , there ’s nothing quite like ending a wedding ceremony with great cup of coffee to give your guests a night to remember .
Of course , drinks are n’t the only things coffee carts can offer .
When you have guests , delegates , or clientele that are tired and hungry from a long day , coffee catering also provides a sweet side treat to go along with the fresh roast .
When you hire a coffee caterer , you get more than just the cart .
You can also choose to rent an automatic coffee machine if you ’re looking for some great - tasting blends while not pushing it on your budget .
Renting an automatic coffee machine from the coffee cart of your choice is now easier than ever because of their new self - cleaning feature – all you have to do is top the beans and throw away the grounds once the container is full .
Hiring and Payment Plans
Hiring a coffee cart business for your event is a lot easier when the business itself is flexible enough to meet your requirements .
To get started , you will need to provide the following factors before you can get a quote : • Event duration –
The minimum call is one hour , but this can vary depending on the type of business you request from .
It also depends on how long you will need the mobile coffee going for the rest of the day , or if you need it for more than one day .
•
Number of people or cups –
You may need to hire more than one barista if you plan on serving a large amount of people for a public event , gathering , conference , or especially an exposition where you need to draw in a large number of people .
• Location –
Most mobile catering services that serve coffee are happy to travel to any location in Singapore as long as the catering service has access to two 13 - amp power sockets ( normal power outlets used in most households and offices ) .
If you ’re not sure how you can get a quote for the mobile catering , you can usually look up the caterer ’s contact details on their website , as well as their types of coffee , the coffee machines they use , etc .
There ’s every reason to spice up your public and private gatherings with a mobile coffee caterer .
With high - quality beans , top - of - the - line coffee machinery , and amazing expert baristas bringing coffee to your event , a great experience will always be coming with every cup .

Saigon apartment rental can be a daunting task .
After all , Saigon is one of the biggest cities in Vietnam , and there can be so many rental choices to choose from , all of which have a lot of considerations you have to keep in mind of .
How will you choose between all the districts of Ho Chi Minh City ?
Will you choose to rent apartment in Saigon , or will you opt for a villa rental instead ?
As HCMC is a huge city , there are many things that you will need to do in order to make sure that your stay is the best that it can be .
Know the Districts Before anything else , you will need to keep in mind the number of listings that you can expect to see from every district .
Most listings to help you rent apartment at HCMC are commonly from four districts , namely Districts 1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 .
Condominium rental in district 1 , D1 for example , would n’t have a lot of listings .
This is because district 1 is a crowded district , due to its boisterous and lively atmosphere .
If you would find a listing here , it may tend to be on the upper limits of your budget .
However , if you can afford it , and the vibrancy of the district does not bother you , District 1 can be the perfect spot for you .
If you choose to rent a place in D3 , you have quite a number of better options .
D2 is a quieter district compared to District 1 and has what is often referred to as suburban atmosphere .
It ’s a good compromise for people who would like a bit of peace and quiet yet still near shopping malls , tourist spots and important offices in D1 .
You are sure to find a lot of good options at Saigon condominium rental agency whether you are looking for an affordable apartment or a posh condo unit .
If Districts 1 and 3 are n’t the right place for you , you could always choose to look for an apartment rental in D2 .
D2 is perfect for families , as it has some of the best international schools in Vietnam .
Here you could also find malls , parks , and less congested traffic .
You would find a lot of opportunities to rent a house here or find a listing for a villa rental .
Of course , you could also always choose to stay at D7 .

Here you would find a lot of high - rise buildings , as well as large spacious parks that are perfect for families or simply to just lounge around in .
There are also a lot of malls and cafes in this district .
Due to its layout , this district has large roads , relatively quiet neighborhoods , and a lack of traffic congestion , as well as pollution .
You may also find a lot of listings to rent a house here in D7 or choose from one of many listings for a villa rental .
Do You Research Early
While knowing the districts is already half the battle , you will also need to brush up on a lot of other things to know about apartment rental in Ho Chi Minh City .
Trying to find good apartments for rent at District 2 and any other districts in Saigon can be challenging but definitely worth the effort .
This research may take the form of internet searches , as well as reading up on books and magazines .
You could find more in - depth information about how it is to stay in each district by interviewing one of the locals living in Saigon .
Perhaps you know a friend of a friend or someone who used to stay there not so far back .
Aside from talking to locals , you can also start to contact agents a week before your move .
A good time frame to start contacting agents early is about a week or two before your actual stay begins .
This is so that you can get a feel for your apartment , just in case you ’re having last - minute concerns about the place .
This is also a good way to get to know the neighborhood , and scout out important sports such as the nearest grocery store , convenience store , hospitals and cafes .
Plus , you may even get a chance to meet your new neighbors .
Know What You Need Knowing what you need is an important thing to factor when moving to Vietnam .
Just as it is important to understand what your apartment can give you , it is also important to understand what you need from it .
Everyone has different needs for their apartment rental in Ho Chi Minh City .
For example , some people could n’t live without a Wifi connection , while others need to have a quiet neighborhood .
For others , having a spacious kitchen or a large bathroom is what is important to them .
A good and systematic way to go about this is listing down all the things that you would need to have in your rental .
This can be anything from a close proximity to a mall , or large windows .
From that list , choose the top three things that you absolutely cannot live without , and make sure that you ’re honest and practical about it .
Remember to talk to everyone else who is moving to the apartment with you , and create a compromise about what you would need to prioritize when you rent apartment in Saigon .
Of course , you should also remember that while there are many listings for apartment rental in Ho Chi Minh City , you will have to compromise on some things .
You may not get all the things that you prioritize on your list , but chances are , you ’ll grow to love your place when you rent apartment in HCMC .
Laundry Services May 08 , 2018
Your everyday washing method may be keeping your clothes clean and disinfected at all times , but are you sure it is the appropriate way to clean them without causing damage to the fabric ?
If you ’re not sure , you may want to take a look at some of the most common laundering mistakes that most of us are guilty of doing .
1 . Incorrect Use of the Machines
If you choose to go to a self - service 24 hour laundry in Singapore , make sure you read the instructions on how to use the machines properly .
Commercial washing machines in laundry service shops are bigger and more sophisticated than the washers used at home , but they also come with a lot of problems .
You need to know how much water is needed and which type of detergent should be used .
Using the dryer is also different from using the washer , as well as knowing how to set the right temperature when ironing or pressing clothes .
As for steam - cleaning , remember the recommended temperatures for specific materials to avoid burning the items .
2 . No Stain Treatment
Most commercial laundry services in Singapore will pre-treat stains before washing your clothes , because this will make the cleaning process more effective .
If there are stains remaining after washing , the staff will continue treating the stain before drying , because letting the stain dry can make it more difficult to remove .
Avoid drying clothes with stains because it will set the stain permanently on the fabric .
3 . Wrong Drying Method
One technique of drying your clothes fast in the dryer if you ’re in a 24 hour wash and iron clothes shop in Singapore is to run back - to - back dryer loads .
This will allow you to take advantage of the heat that has been maintained for several loads .
Make sure to follow instructions when drying clothes because you cannot load the same number of items in the dryer as in the washer .
4 . Using Too Much Bleach
Although there are colorsafe bleaches available for colored or dyed clothes , you should avoid using bleach as much as possible .
Commercial laundry services will also advise you that bleaching can only be done if the stain is too difficult to remove using detergent alone .
Even stains made from protein such as blood and sweat will not need bleaching in most cases , unless the stain has been dried for several days .
Laundry pick up services will not bleach your items unless you specifically instruct them to , because it can deteriorate the fabric when done too often .
5 . Wrong Ironing Method
Heat will cause some fabrics to shrink or stretch , that is why you should use only the recommended ironing settings for specific fabrics , especially with uniform laundry that are prone to wear and tear .
6 . Washing Dry -Clean Clothes
Clothes that are labeled dry - clean only should never be soaked in water or cleaned with water - based detergent , but some labels can be misleading .
For example , if the label says dry clean , it means that the clothing can still be hand - washed and air - dried , although the laundry delivery services will always opt for the dry cleaning method if you ask them .
7 . Washing Spot - Clean Fabrics
Spot - clean fabrics are common in some linen and upholstery , because they cannot be cleaned using both water - based detergent and dry cleaning solvent .
The best cleaning method is to use an upholstery cleaner or the foam of a mild detergent on a stubborn stain .
8 . Washing in Hot Water
Use hot water only if you need to sanitize clothing , because even laundry for spa and towel washing should not be done frequently using hot water .
Most fabrics will eventually deteriorate when exposed to high temperatures .
The best tip we can probably share is to read your clothing ’s care label .
The care label states all the cleaning methods you can use on your clothing without damaging the quality of the piece .
Wedding Matters May 03 , 2018
The ring you give to your partner , whether it ’s a wedding ring or an engagement ring , is not just a symbol of your love – it ’s also an expression of your personal tastes .
The many different styles means that there ’s always a choice for you .
If you do n’t know what kind of ring to choose , then this guide is for you to help you get started .
Styles 1 . Plain –
This is the classic choice for most people in Singapore who would like to opt for simplicity – less is more , after all , and simplicity can be quite elegant in itself .
Rings can be made from an abundance of metals , from platinum , palladium , to even alloys containing gold , copper , silver , tin , or even other less - picked metals such as zirconium and titanium .
Plain rings are also perfect if you want to have a special message engraved whether inside or outside the ring .
2 . Two - Metal –
The two - metal , or multi-metal ring , comes in different alloys , but what makes them different is that they are two separate bands of metal crafted together ( either one on top of the other or side - by - side ) , using specialized equipment .
What makes this kind of ring even more special is that you can even use wood or ceramic .
Ceramic rings , especially when crafted from tungsten carbide , are a good example in this case because they are especially durable .
3 . Shaped –
These rings that are popular at ling jewellery shop in Singapore will have a slightly raised stone for a ring to fit next to it , while others tend to be set lower or are curved .
This makes it a go - to choice for an engagement ring or proposal ring as its more intricate designs are specially crafted , and guaranteed to impress .
A wedding ring can also be chosen from this category as well .
A classic example is the Celtic popular , whose design symbolizes eternal love .
The knot itself has no beginning or end .
Moving - block rings are a good choice if you ’re looking for something different – their modern twist makes it popular among couples who want something unique and a little quirky to wear on their fingers for the rest of their lives together .
Metals 1 . Gold
Gold has always been traditional precious metal and legal tender in Singapore .
However , because pure gold is too soft to be used as a ring , it ’s usually alloyed with other metals that give it many different colors .
For instance , white gold jewelry uses pure gold along with other white metals like silver or palladium , which is then plated with rhodium to give it its trademark luster .
What gives gold its deep yellow that you see whenever you think of it is actually the other metals included in the yellow gold alloy , copper and silver .
Silver is responsible for giving gold its white shine , while copper gives its darker and richer color .
Rose gold is made of a beautiful alloy of gold and copper , and rose gold wedding rings are perfect for those with a taste for tradition and vintage style but who want to be able to have a ring made just for them to their own specifications .
The exact proportions of each metal are the suppliers ’ trade secrets .
2 . Silver
Silver is one of the most common metals and is commonly used for making jewelleries .
Because 100 percent silver is expected to be soft , copper is often used to strengthen it .
Silver can also smudge on its surface unless regularly polished .
3 . Titanium
By itself , this metal is shiny as well as really strong , as it ’s used in metal plating for many devices and different types of hardware .
This makes it resist scratches that would otherwise be a problem for other precious metals such as gold and silver .
It ’s also very lightweight and comfortable to wear .
The downside to titanium is that it ’s very brittle , and it ’s often alloyed with different metals to reduce its brittleness .
4 . Steel
You would be surprised that steel made this list , but its luster and durability makes it a popular choice among couples with a low budget as well as jewelers because of its malleability .
Sizes
The widths of wedding bands are measured in millimeters .
For women in Singapore , the most popular widths are between two and four millimeters .
For men’s , the most common width sizes are anywhere between six and eight millimeters .
Width can affect the ring ’s comfortability , as more skin is displaced with a wider ring .
There are many services available to help you find your size , as well as many different charts to convert the size when ordering a ring .
Remember to keep in mind that there are also many different measurements , the most popular being US and UK .
You can also order a ring sizer online to solve this problem .
When sizing your fingers , remember to not do it when it ’s either too cold or too hot , as extreme temperatures can make them swell or shrink .
If it ’s too hot , your fingers might swell and make the ring tighter .
If it ’s too cold , they might shrink and make the ring looser .
Gemstones Engagement rings usually come with gemstones , and you can choose from a variety of them .
Though the most picked stones are diamonds , there are plenty of alternatives , such as rubies , amethysts , emeralds , and even garnet and aquamarine .
Their availability depends on the supplier .
Sometimes , the sheer number of choices when it comes to ring types , styles , metals , or even engravings and gemstones , can be a little too much – but you do n’t have to worry .
Use this guide to get you started on choosing the ring that will sit on yours and your partner ’s finger for life .
Love for Food April 18 , 2018
Estimating the amount of food to serve for a large barbecue party can be overwhelming .
But with simple calculations and generous estimations , you will surely come up with enough food servings good for everybody .
It is important to do your own calculations whether or not you ’ve hired a bbq catering Singapore provider to do the task .
This will give you a clearer idea of how much to budget for your otah and satay party .
Start by assessing individual portion sizes in ounces according on the demographics of your party .
For example , if you ’ve invited kids , allocate 4 ounces or 1/4 pound of meat per child .
If you ’re feeding a gang of linebackers , you will need to triple that amount .
Once you ’ve calculated individual serving sizes , multiply the amount by 50 to come up with a fairly accurate estimation of how much food you will need .
However , keep in mind that it ’s always better to serve a bit too much than not enough , so be generous with your allocations and bbq catering budget .
Meat Generally , you will need 1 / 3 to ½ pound of meat for each of your guest , or 15 to 25 pounds of meat .
Hotdogs , brats , and hamburgers are the simplest meat to calculate since these meats are packaged and pre-counted .
You can order specific amounts of food from Singapore ’s bbq catering that come in pre-determined packages .
Estimate a single serving of one meat and additional 20 percent of other meats .
If you will be serving pulled pork sandwiches , allocate 15 to 20 pounds of pork for each person .
The pork can be maximized because it is shredded , however , it may have the tendency to shrink because of its fats .
So be flexible with your estimations in order for you not to run short .
If you prefer using chicken breasts on sandwiches , budget 25 pounds for every guest .
Side Dishes
In estimating barbecue side dishes in Singapore you can allocate six ounces of it per person , which totals to 300 ounces for a party of 50 guests .
This usually breaks down to almost three gallons or 20 pounds of food .
You can already have a gallon of pasta or potato salad , another gallon of lettuce salad , and another one of fruit salad .
For more selections , add 50 ounces of potato chips , or one ounce per person .
Beverages
The beverages are very important , especially on a hot season .
Allocate a total of 1,600 ounces of lemonade or 32 ounces for every guest .
With this amount , you need to secure large containers where your guests can easily help themselves for a drink .
But if you hired a Singapore bbq wholesale and catering provider , there ’s no need for you to worry about this .
Another option is to stock individual bottles and cans of drinks .
Fill a large cooler with ice and store your beverages in it to keep cool .
If serving beer , estimate two bottles per person .
Again , it is always better to estimate more than have less .
Dessert
What is a party without desserts ?
For outdoor cookout party , ask your bbq wholesale and catering provider to serve finger foods or easy - to - eat desserts , such as cookie bars , cookies , and brownies .
Apart from the fact that they ’re easy to eat , they ’re easy to portion as well .
Estimate two to three pieces of each dessert for every guest .
If serving ice cream , order two to three gallons of different flavors for a party of 50 guests .
Every day is a great day in Singapore for cookouts , picnics and other outdoor activities .
However , bringing food outside , in warm and humid environment , can impose great risk to food safety .
Food airborne bacteria multiply more rapidly at warm temperatures ( between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit ) ; therefore , the hot environment outdoors makes the basics of food safety particularly important .
Fortunately , there are so many precautionary methods that Singapore consumers and bbq catering providers can do to ensure food safety during an outdoor otah and satay party .
What are these methods ?
Read on and find out .
1 . Always wash your hands before and after handling food
Whether you hired a bbq catering provider like http://www.springocean.com/
from Singapore or do the catering yourself , always wash your hands when getting in contact with food .
This rule seems basic but not everyone executes this .
Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds , and a few seconds longer if you have just used the toilet .
If there ’s no available sink or the sink is too far away from the party area , have moist disposable tissues at hand for a more convenient hand cleaning .
2 . Separate raw food from cooked food
Never use plates that previously held uncooked meat , seafood , or poultry when serving ready - to - eat items , unless the plates have been washed with hot , soapy water .
Always keep surfaces and utensils clean before and after using them .
3 . Use marinades properly
A marinade is a savory sauce that bbq wholesale and catering providers use to tenderize and enrich the meats ’ flavor .
When applying this method , marinated meat should be stored in the fridge and not left on the counter .
Poultry and stewed or cubed pieces of meat can be marinated up to two days , while beef , lamb and pork can be marinated up to five days .
If you ’re planning to use the marinade while cooking the food , reserve a portion of it before putting in the uncooked meat ; or boil first the used marinade to kill harmful bacteria before incorporating it with the cooked food .
4 . Keep hot food hot and cold food cold
Foods that are intended to be served hot should be kept at or above 140 degrees Fahrenheit , should be well - wrapped , and placed in an isolated container ; while cold foods should be kept at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below and must be placed directly on racks of ice , or in a deep pan filled with ice .
Your bbq wholesale and catering provider should already know this and has the right equipment to ensure stable food temperature .
5 . Always keep all cooking utensils and your cooking area clean
Make sure that the cooking and serving area are kept clean all the time .
Stock plenty of clean platters and utensils so you can easily get one whenever you need one .
To prevent accumulation of foodborne bacteria , never use the same serving apparatuses for cooked and raw items .
Buildup of harmful microorganisms in raw poultry and meat extracts can contaminate cooked food .
If your bbq catering party is held outdoors , look for a clean water source .
If there ’s none , ask your caterer or make an effort to bring plenty of water for food preparation and cleaning .
For cleaning surfaces and hands , pack clean damp towels and cloths .

To meet your demands , the pest control services involves an assessment of the location to determine the best approach that can be used to terminate pest , because not all the pest control methods can be used in the same setting .
1 . Mechanical or Physical Pest Control
This is only good for quick fixes and minimal infestation , but it does not work for certain pests .
This is most effective when you need to exterminate rodents and small - scale insect infestation .
If you want to remove termites for example , the mechanical method is useless .
2 . Biological Pest Control

3 . Chemical Pest Control Pesticides work fast even if the infestation is significant , plus the chemicals are mostly safe only if you call a trusted pest destroyer in Singapore .
Unlike the pesticides used decades ago , safer chemicals have been developed that will not affect humans and other animals .
4 . Organic Pest Control

However , this is usually recommended only in small - scale infestations and when the target is only one type of pest .

Business Guide April 04 , 2018
When applying to register trademark for your business , you have to consider both the business and trading names that you ’ll use , as well as the extent of which you can use them .
Because there are only so many words that can perfectly sum up your brand of products or services that has not yet been taken by a competitor in Singapore , applying for trademark registration for your company name can be quite tricky .
Understanding terms such as “ trade name ” , “ legal name ” , and “ trademark ” is important , as they have specific legal meanings meant to be used for specific instances .
Trademark in a Nutshell Essentially , trademarks are graphical representations ( a certain combination of lines , shapes , symbols , etc. ) used by businesses to distinguish their goods and services from their competitors ’ .
They can , and are , often used interchangeably with “ brand name ” , and this definition can also extend to slogans used in combination with these graphical representations .
Before you register trademarks and gain exclusivity of use of a certain name , logo or mark , it ’s important that you look at how you present your brand , as this affects how you want your potential consumers to perceive you and your business .
Business Name
The business name , otherwise known as the legal name , is the official name of the entity or person that owns the company .
For partnerships , the legal name is given in the partnership agreement or is usually the last names of the partners combined .
( Ex : Procter & Gamble )
For limited liability companies or corporations , the business ’ legal name is the one registered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore ( IPOS ) , and will often be affixed with a legal prefix , such as LLC , LLP , Inc. , Pte. Ltd. , etc . Remember to register TM for your intellectual property – applying to register trademark for your business name protect your brand as well as your business as a whole .
However , while trademark registration protects your intellectual property from being stolen , this should not be an automatic ground to file an infringement claim for other companies who happen to be using a name or design that ’s similar .
Fortunately , scenarios like this happen to be few and far in - between .
When submitting your application to register trademark for your brand , your application will be compared against a record of all existing businesses for similarities or other grounds for objection .
Trading Name
The trade name is different from the business ’s legal name .
Usually , it can be summed up as the informal version of the legal name , and is used frequently in advertising .
One good example of this is that you do n’t see the legal name “ McDonald ’s Corporation ” , “ The Procter & Gamble Company ” , or even “ The Coca - Cola Company ” in advertisements and advertising media .
Instead , the names you see on billboards and signs in real life or on the internet are “ McDonald ’s ” , or “ P& G ” , or simply “ Coca - Cola ” .
Legal names are rarely consumer - friendly , which is why abridged versions of brand names without the prefix are often used to market products and services .
Even though trading names are technically not business names , they can already be used as a registered mark if the company or entity is already using that name in their business .
While they are not necessarily included in the trademark registration application form , it certainly helps to cement your claim as this allows you exclusive right to use them .
Choosing the Name for Your Business Choosing a business name for your company before applying for a registered mark can be complicated , as the company name can tell consumers a lot about what your business is , as well as indicate the quality of your products and services .
This can often form the basis of your brand , and can either make or break your company .
One way to avoid this is often by simply registering your name and adding “ company ” as a suffix .
However , there are different reasons as to why you may not want to register your own name ; one of these reasons is that it places a significant pressure on you personally .
You can check the availability of a name through a trademark registering company in Singapore like www.brandmark.sg to make sure that no one has claimed it yet .
Once you find that this name has n’t been claimed by any entity , you ’re free to claim it for yourself .
Changing the Name of Your Business
Your business ’s aims can change as it grows , and this does n’t have to be a bad thing – in fact , you can always change your business name in order to reflect your company ’s growth .
Here are the steps you should take in order to change your company ’s name : 1 . As with the first time that you chose the name for your business , you need to cross - reference your intended name with existing databases to make sure that they are different from existing names .
The IPOS should be able to take care of this for you with your new application .
2 . Let the IPOS know that you are changing your business ’s name , and fill out and submit the provided form .
For sole proprietorship businesses , it ’s best to file and submit a new DBA registration form .
Your name will depend on your business structure , although usually these kinds of name changes are mostly the same name but with an added suffix at the end .
3 . Update the name on your licenses , permits , and other corporate paperwork , such as contracts , leases , and loan documents .
You should also update your website , signs , and other branding materials to minimize confusion from your consumers .

Stubborn fat is named such for a reason : regardless of how much diet and exercise you do , it just seems impossible to lose it .
Now , you ’re left with two options — live with them or have them surgically removed .
Well , neither of the two is cool for us .
Coolsculpting is the newest non-surgical way to get rid of those annoying bulges of fat .
This new technology cools unwanted fats to the point of death .
Unlike other methods of fat reduction , coolsculpting Singapore involves no any form of incision and surgery ; and therefore induces no downtime .
Patients can immediately go back to their work and normal activities right after the procedure has concluded .
It ’s safe , FDA - approved , and effective .
The outcome looks natural and can be seen as early as three weeks following the treatment , with the most drastic results after three months .
What areas of the body respond best to coolsculpting ?
Stubborn fat in the upper arms , inner thighs , love handles , tummy area , bra area , and back are target for this non-invasive procedure .
In fact , any area with loose fat cells responds well to the treatment .
And unlike other weight loss procedures , results from coolsculpting are permanent .
Once fat cells are destroyed and eliminated from the body , they ’re gone for good .
So whether or not you weigh less after the treatment , you ’ll look thinner and feel lighter .
What happens to the fat cells ?
During the coolsculpting treatment in Singapore , exposure to cool temperature causes fat cell apoptosis , leading to the release of inflammatory mediators .
Inflammatory cells slowly destroy the targeted fat cells in the weeks and months following the procedure .
Lipids from the dead fat cells are transported by the lymphatic system for them to be processed and released out of the body .
Are there pre-existing health conditions that can affect the treatment ?
Some patients reported that they feel neuropathy ( sense of numbness and tingling sensation ) in the abdomen area following the procedure , though most cases have subsided after a few days .
There are varied causes of neuropathy , and these could include extremely cold temperature .
However , if you have pre-existing medical condition and you have concerns about how the treatment may affect your health , talk to your surgeon before going through the procedure .
Is coolsculpting suitable for diabetic ?
Since this is a non-surgical procedure that does n’t involve anaesthesia and medications , it ’s safe to say that coolsculpting Singapore is safe for diabetics .
Because there ’s no need for incisions , there ’s no wound and no risk of infection or slow and poor healing .
You may experience increased numbness in treated areas , but most diabetic patients have reported that they have not experienced any discomfort or side effects at all .
Is the treatment safe to have after giving birth ?
Pregnant women are not qualified for coolsculpting , but the treatment is effective and safe after giving birth to help fix post - pregnancy belly bump , and wo n’t affect the next pregnancy in any way .
However , doctors suggest waiting for three months after pregnancy before getting a coolsculpting procedure done .
What are the common effects after the treatment ?
Coolsculpting is completely non-invasive , allowing patients to return almost immediately to their normal activities after the treatment .
However , redness on the treated area(s ) may be experienced , which lasts up to a few hours .
Some bruising and swelling can also take place , which should clear after one to two weeks .
Many Singapore patients have also experienced localized dulling sensation , lasting between two and eight weeks .
What to do to get best results after the treatment ?
Eat healthily and exercise regularly .
Doing morning walks help the lymphatic system , while drinking plenty of water aids the body in flushing out wastes and dead fat cells .
Follow your doctor ’s instructions as well , and make sure to disclose complete medical history including the medications you ’re currently taking .
Is it better than liposuction ?
In one word : No .
But it ’s definitely worth trying considering that it does n’t need surgery and extensive downtime , and it ’s far less expensive than liposuction .
Moreover , it is an ideal option for those individuals who are close to their ideal weight and only want small amount of excess fat removed .
However , for those aiming for significant results , liposuction offers more drastic slimming effect than coolsculpting .
Is it safe ?
Coolsculpting is safe as approved by the FDA , and the process of cooling only affects the targeted cells , leaving adjacent tissues intact and unharmed .
Coolsculpting Singapore is n’t only safe , but convenient for patients .
The procedure allows patients to lie comfortably , while reading , listening to music , working on their laptops , or even taking a nap as the treatment takes place .
Uncommonly though , a small percentage of patients may experience slight pain related to the procedure , which should subside in a few days and have no long - term side effects .
Is it right for me ?
As mentioned , the best candidates are those who are near their ideal body weight , who maintains healthy diet , and have stubborn fats that do not respond to a healthy lifestyle .
These people need spot reduction in specific body parts , but are not in favour of surgical procedure .
However , while coolsculpting can trim down certain regions of the body , it is not a weight loss solution for overweight individuals .
Coolsculpting is the newest non-surgical way to get rid of those annoying bumps of stubborn fat .
This innovative slimming method is 100 % safe and can accommodate most patients who are seeking for subtle fat - reduction solution .
To know more about coolsculpting , set an appointment with a certified cosmetic surgeon .

What exactly is a cardiologist ?
For most people , that is a question they never hope to answer unless they want to be doctors themselves .
Most patients will tend to put off seeing a doctor for regular check - ups until the symptoms they suffer become severe or until they are unable to function normally on their own .
However , this should not be the case .
Because everyone is at a certain risk of developing heart disease at some point in their lives ( cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide ) , visits to a cardiology center should be more frequent .
Cardiologists and What They Do A cardiologist , sometimes also referred to as a heart doctor or a heart specialist , is a licensed physician that specializes in the study of the heart .
However , they also look at a person ’s circulatory and cardiovascular systems in order to diagnose and treat certain diseases that target these parts of the body .
Cardiologists diagnose or predict potential health problems by conducting one or more physical examinations to determine heart rate and blood pressure ( heart screening ) , blood tests , and interviews with the patient , as well as referring to medical records .
They also give lifestyle guidelines to patients in order to improve their current heart conditions .
Conditions that involve cardiologists usually range from heart attacks and murmurs to coronary heart disease and hypertension .
Once a cardiologist knows what a patient is suffering from , he / she must make the decision whether to prescribe medication or to refer the patient to a cardiovascular surgeon .
Heart Screening
The heart is a complex , sophisticated muscle that oxygenates and channels blood throughout a person ’s entire body about seventy times a minute in healthy adults .
As much as it is complex and sophisticated , there are many factors that can affect its health .
Heart screening is how cardiologists examine how healthy a patient ’s heart is , next to blood testing or urine testing ( to determine the amount of cholesterol or glucose in a patient ’s system ) .
Sometimes , both methods are used by a heart doctor to determine what a patient is suffering from .
The electrocardiogram ( ECG ) is the primary diagnostic tool used to screen the heart health of a patient , which utilizes electrical signals to determine a patient ’s pulse .
Any irregular rhythms will then be detected and graphed on a monitor .
Other diagnostic tools that are used by cardiology heart specialist from Singapore in order to screen heart health include the tilt table test , where the patient is asked to lie on a table that adjusts from horizontal to vertical position , and the exercise treadmill , where the patient ’s blood pressure and heart electrical activity are taken and monitored for any abnormalities .
Heart Disease Warning Signs and Symptoms Many , if not most , people will put off seeing a heart doctor until a problem or significant pain arises that will interfere with their daily life , and chances are that you are one of these people .
However , some of the common reasons why you should see a cardiologist in Singapore include : • Heart / chest pain –
This is a given symptom preceding many heart diseases , and should be taken as an immediate warning sign .
However , you still need to see a heart specialist just in case .
•
High total cholesterol –
This is the sum of all the cholesterol in your bloodstream .
The higher your total cholesterol is , the more reason you need to see a doctor right away .
•
Have / previously had a smoking habit – Smoking poses a huge risk for heart disease because it decreases the flow of oxygen to the heart and increases the blood pressure and heart rate as a result .
Smoking also contributes to internal blood clotting and damage to your artery linings .
•
Gum disease –
While gum disease does n’t necessarily mean having a heart disorder , most patients with swollen gums often have heart disease as this can happen when there is inflammation in the body .
• Diabetes / Family history of diabetes – Having diabetes , whether it falls under type 1 or type 2 , predisposes you to contracting heart disease at a later point in your life .
While the reasons previously mentioned might not directly indicate any direct diseases , they precede other more obvious symptoms , such as : • Severe discomfort in the chest – When the pain spreads to other areas of the body , such as the shoulders , jaw , neck , or arms , or when the pain is n’t relieved by rest , or when the pain comes with other symptoms ( e.g. paleness , clammy skin , nausea , dizziness , fatigue , or an irregular pulse ) •
Severe pressure on vocal cords , resulting in hoarseness – Usually accompanied by severe pain in the chest • Palpitations – Erratic heartbeat rhythms are a serious indication that need immediate medical attention .
•
Low or high blood pressure –
This could either mean that the heart is not pumping enough blood throughout the body ( due to muscle weakness or other factors ) or that a clogging in a major blood vessel is restricting blood flow , forcing the heart to pump faster Scheduling Appointments
See a cardiologist as soon as possible if your family - care doctor recommends it .
It is ill - advised to put it off for any reason , as even mild reasons or symptoms can indicate life - threatening diseases if left undiagnosed or untreated .
However , there is good news .
When it comes to finding the best cardiologist , Singapore has many government hospitals as well as private clinics with a cardiology center .
This makes scheduling for regular appointments and check - ups more convenient because of the ease of access , as well as make the necessary lifestyle changes to improve heart health .

Your CRM software can do great wonders for your company .
Depending on how much you rely on it , it can simply hold all the contact details of your customers , or it can do as much as automatically publish marketing campaigns .
However , no matter how much you ’re relying on your CRM , the following seven best practices can help you make sure that you ’re doing the most for your business .
1 . Be sure that the data you input is accurate and up to date .
Your CRM system can only be effective in sales management with accurate data .
The more accurate and up to date your data is , the more effective your CRM system will be .
It ’s good practice to regularly review all data in your system , as well as delete all information that is erroneous or redundant .
On top of that , you should also make sure that all the data in your system is important and usable .
This can make sure that your sales teams understand your customer , diminishing the chances of any errors that could occur .
After all , customers would remember their history with you , and they expect you to do the same .
For example , it could be irritating to a customer if you kept selling them something that they already bought from you , or if you kept inviting them to a seminar that they already reserved a seat for .
2 . Go mobile A lot of CRM software gives you the ability to access your data , like sales reports and lead effectivity , by other means than from your web browser .
It pays to use a software that has this ability since accessibility can ensure more productivity and more profit .
It ’s always a good idea to have a mobile version of your CRM software so that you can access your data on the go .
It ’s also a good idea to invest in cloud CRM software , as the Singapore CRM software is available on different platforms and multiple devices , such as tablets and laptops so that every employee can access them without issue .
3 . Make sure that all your employees can access your CRM .
No matter how good or useful a CRM system is , it would n’t be helpful if your employees do n’t use it .
There are a lot of factors that can dissuade your employees from using your CRM system .
More often than not , it ’s because that they do n’t have the knowledge on how to use it , or they find it overly - complex and cumbersome .
To make sure that this does n’t happen , you can create training workshops to make sure that all your employees know how to navigate the system , especially employees that work in sales management and sales reports .
You should also make sure to do this after every software update to make sure that everyone is up - to - date on its features and interface .
When all your employees can access your CRM , your employees are armed with the knowledge on how to best approach your customers , letting you avoid potentially negative interactions with characters who have previously come across issues with your company .
4 . Eliminate all problems and issues promptly
On the subject of issues , make sure that you solve all and every problem and issue as soon as you notice them .
A CRM system can quickly point out what areas need tending to , but they ’ll only be effective if you solve them .
This can also make sure that you do n’t frustrate employees any further , which is especially true for returning customers who returned in the hope that they do n’t come across the same problem again .
If they do come across the same problem , you ca n’t fault them for not wanting to do business with you again .
This practice also extends to complaints made about your company on social media .
When a customer makes a complaint about you , it is imperative to address it as soon as possible .
Knowing the fast pace of the of the online world , it is best to address it on the day of its posting .
Many companies have been smeared and even ruined because of a complaint that was blown out of proportion .
Even if you ca n’t solve a problem right away , simply acknowledging the negative feeling that your customers have can alleviate their problem , and shows that you truly care about your customer ’s satisfaction .
5 . Personalization is key Personalized marketing is one of the easiest things you can do for your customers , yet it can also increase the effectivity of your marketing .
For example , personalized emails that reply to the queries in http://www.crystaldash.com/contact-us/ on the Singapore website can increase effectivity by as much as 50 % .
Geolocation features even allow you to locate where your customers are , whether here in Singapore or abroad , which can greatly increase the effectivity of your leads .
You do n’t even have to know all the details about your customers , simply addressing them by name in their email can increase your click - through rate .
Personalization can also save time for both you and your customers .
Sending your customers products or content that matter to them can increase the chance of click - throughs , purchases , and future engagements .
6 . Be present on multiple channels
At present , information moves fast through many different channels .
Every day , people in Singapore use the internet to express their thoughts and opinions , and your business should do the same .
Try to be present where your customers are present .
This means that if most of your engagement is on Twitter , try to have an active presence on Twitter as well .
This is where the importance of a cloud CRM comes into play ; as the internet is readily available at everyone ’s fingertips , so should your means of keeping up to date with your company ’s data .
Wedding Matters January 22 , 2018
Planning for your grand wedding day does n’t only take time , it also costs money .
Wedding flowers , particularly , are among the expensive factors of a wedding event .
The process usually involves seeking the help of a wedding florist ( if you have zero experience or knowledge about floral decor ) , or you can always opt to do the task yourself if you want to be more hands - on .
Additionally , buying flowers and foliage can be quite pricey in certain seasons .
Most brides - to - be in Singapore have an idea of what they want their dream wedding to look like , and it is the responsibility of a wedding florist to help turn that dream into reality .
Their task is to pull off the most beautiful wedding floral decor on your designated budget .
They are also the ones to provide you with ideas regarding table centerpieces , bridal bouquet , ceremonial flower arrangements , and the like .
Booking the assistance of a florist spans way more than just getting help on arranging your wedding flowers .
They also directly keep in touch with their suppliers and flower growers to ensure your chosen flowers are available , consult with churches and wedding venues , plan the wedding logistics , calculate costs , account for the temperature at the venue , be mindful of the whole duration of the event , and observe other intricate details .
Seeking the help of a florist generally enables you to get what you pay for , as with any other industry .
If you want to make your weddings a little bit more magical and dream - like , consider asking the help of a florist to help you with your floral decor .
However , this may also depend on the experience and expertise of your chosen wedding florist .
Planning for your wedding flowers does n’t have to necessarily cost you a fortune .
If you want to be more practical , here are some money - saving hacks for your Singapore bridal bouquet you can observe : 1 . Simplicity is beauty
If you ’re already splurging on a large , beautiful wedding venue – you probably wo n’t need large floral centerpieces .
Chances are , your guests might even hate them !
In Singapore weddings , it is common to couple or two groomsmen moving or completely removing a large floral centerpiece just so to see the people on the other side of the table .
Simple and elegant bridal flowers are enough .
You can also opt to make use of hurricane vases , candles , and lanterns as table centerpieces .
You can still have floral arrangements on your table , of course .
This allows you to highlight pops of color without the effort and costs involved in a massive arrangement .
Use varying heights of cylinder vases and have three stems of orchids or calla lilies .
2 . Limit the variety of flowers you ’ll be using
If you use a wide variety of wedding flowers for the big day , do n’t be surprised to see how quite expensive the whole thing is going to be .
Some flowers are more expensive than others , especially if they are only made available and sold during certain seasons .
If you ’re keen on reducing your wedding expenses , limit the variety of flowers you ’ll be using in your bridal bouquet and other floral arrangements .
Stick to several specific blooms .
If there are flowers which hold a significant meaning to both you and your partner , use them .
We ’re not saying variety is n’t good – but it also pays to be practical in today ’s world .
3 . Consider flowers that are easy to work with Some blooms require extra effort on hand - wiring and special work just to be held together in a single bridal bouquet .
The more effort it ’d take for your bridal blooms to be put together , the more likely you ’ll be charged with additional fee for the extensive labor .
Keep in mind that somebody has to work on taping or wiring each individual flower .
To make the process easier for your florist , consider blooms with legitimate stems ( roses , calla lilies , Gerbera daisies ) .
You can count on these flowers to reduce your bouquet budget .
4 . Consult with your florist
Your florist is n’t only there to help you with your floral arrangement needs , they can also help you with cutting costs when ordering your wedding day flowers .
Consulting with your wedding florist in Singapore can greatly help you figure out ways to use your chosen flowers to their utmost potential .
Keep your communication lines open .
If you ’re hesitant about the price of a certain bloom , ask your florist if there are other alternatives or if he / she can give you a piece of advice .
Do n’t underestimate the importance of proper communication !
5 . Avoid last minute changes Planning for your wedding is done to ensure everything goes smoothly during the big day – so it ’s unwise to end up not sticking to your plan .
The costs of some blooms are often made more expensive if you order them during the last minute ( or have additional requests when your wedding day is fast approaching ) .
It might seem like a minor tweak to you , but your florist will be obliged to go back to the planning board and might even require extra help .
Keep your changes to a minimum .
Before you even think of a little tweak , ask yourself if it ’s necessary or you ’re just acting on impulsive decisions .
6 . Establish a budget Before you go on browsing through different varieties of flowers for your grand day , it ’s advised to establish a budget for your wedding flowers .
Be honest with your florist .
Establishing a budget also allows you to work around that certain amount and not exceed it .
If anything , it will also motivate you to avail discounts and cut back on any additional costs .
Your florist will also be able to give you an idea as to what you can expect for your budget beforehand .

Plumbing Services December 08 , 2017
Plumbing problems may be simple household issues , but it can potentially drain your pocket .
That ’s why it ’s best to make sure that your home ’s plumbing system is always in its best shape .
Here are the most expensive household plumbing repairs that homeowners in Singapore typically experience .
1 . Clogged Drains
It ’s very common to experience clogged drains from time to time .
However , the severity of the clog depends on the things that caused the stoppage .
Some causes of clog can simply be removed with plumbing tools like plungers , but there are also cases when stock - ups happen deep down the pipes , and solving such problems require professional plumbing services .
2 . Leaky Faucets
Constant dripping noise is enough to drive you insane , but so is receiving a water bill that ’s twice higher than your usual bill .
Did you know that an unattended leak in your faucet can waste around 10,000 gallons of water a year ?
It ’s like throwing away water that can do 270 loads of laundry .
That ’s a lot of water , and therefore a lot of money you are wasting .
Although you ca n’t feel the slight increase in your monthly water bill , it can cost you hundreds of dollars each year .
3 . Low Water Pressure
This may not seem like a big deal , but low water pressure can end up costing you more .
The effect might not be on your water bill , but often in the cause of the problem that makes this plumbing issue expensive .
The cause of the low pressure could be leaky pipes , malfunctioning water heater or underground piping issues .
For plumbing in Singapore contractors to accurately detect the problem and prevent it from getting more expensive , have it checked by a professional and reliable plumber as soon as possible .
4 . Running Toilet
A toilet that does n’t stop from flushing is obviously a very costly problem , which can raise your water bill for up to thrice its usual rate .
Running toilets can be because of a number of reasons .
Sometimes , it can be fixed by simply adjusting some parts such as the flush handle , while other times some parts needs to be replaced .
However , regardless of the cause , leaky toilets need professional plumbing services , so make sure to have it checked by a professional plumber .
5 . Gas Leaks
Gas leaks can cause serious damage to property ; therefore , it ’s an expensive issue if left unattended .
If you suspect that there ’s gas leakage in your premises , evacuate your place and call a professional 24 hours plumber immediately .
In some cases , people try to tamper gas lines for the purpose of sharing or tapping .
These activities are illegal in Singapore , and can ultimately result in loss of property or even life .
Do not attempt to fix gas plumbing problems without the help of a plumbing contractor certified in gas plumbing services .
6 . Clogged Sewer Line
Clogged sewer lines are a major problem for homeowners to tackle on their own because sewer lines are oftentimes inaccessible .
Even if you can access your sewer line , it requires special equipment to have your line unclogged .
If unclogging is done incorrectly , the clog can cause sewage back - ups .
This can be dangerous to your health as the noxious odour and toxins in the biological wastes from the sewage will enter your home through the toilet , sinks and / or drains .
Some tips to prevent plumbing repairs :
• Avoid Hanging
Things on the Plumbing Line
This is a problem often found in basements , where plumbers are surprised to see wet clothes hanged from exposed pipes .
These pipes may feel sturdy , but they are not designed to support weight .
You would be surprised how heavy a few shirts can get , especially when wet , which can cause the pipes to destabilize and burst .
• Do Not Flush Sanitary Items Down the Toilet
The toilet is meant to hold things that we would rather not mention .
If you throw anything else in the toilet that you think will not flush , such as tissues , cotton balls , wet wipes , cotton swabs , napkin and other sanitary items , you are setting yourself for a major toilet disaster .
• Inspect Leaks Right Away
A few drops of water under the kitchen sink may look harmless , but not inspecting the cause of the leak could end up more than just a few drops in a short span of time .
When you find even just a small leak , call a 24 hours plumber right away .
Do not wait until a few drops turn into a paddle of water , as water can potentially damage surrounding structures and fixtures , leading to more extensive and expensive plumbing works .
• Hire a Professional Plumber
Hire a reliable plumbing contractor to inspect your home ’s plumbing system at least once a year .
A highly skilled plumber can detect and fix complex issues that ordinary DIY - ers cannot .
A clogged sewage and a damaged underground piping are just two of the many issues that are impossible to fix on your own , since such issues require advanced skills and plumbing equipment .
To ensure your property ’s safety and plumbing system ’s functionality , only work with a certified and experienced professional .
Spending on plumbing works is never fun , but it ’s necessary to protect your home — your investment .
The thing you really do n’t want to happen is spending way more than you want to for fixing piping issues .
By being aware of the most costly plumping repairs and ways to avoid such problems will help you save money in the long run .
Business Guide November 20 , 2017
Picking the right freight forwarding services for your company can help you focus on improving and expanding your business , but besides considering the types of services that a logistics company offer , you should also be aware of some of the laws in importation , exportation , trade and clearance documentation and permits , licensing and warehousing , the free trade zones , the fees , offences , errors and penalties , and the list of prohibited goods .
On top of that , you should at least have an idea about international transportation if you need air freight or sea freight for your international freight needs .
Sounds complicated , right ?
But knowing all these can also help you find the right freight forwarder in Singapore , because you understand what your company specifically needs .
Let ’s start by defining the terms you will often hear from your logistics company .
1 . Freight Forwarder
A freight forwarder is ideal for small to medium - sized businesses that want to transport goods that will fit in one full container .
This is much easier than utilizing postal or delivery services which will cost you more if you need to deliver more goods .
Freight forwarding services after all is affiliated with shipping lines , air freight , and both local freight and international freight .
They can arrange all the paperwork for you and negotiate prices for the transportation of goods with other logistics services .
They can also perform other tasks for you , such as Customs clearance , insurance , warehousing , and inventory .
2 . Shipping Line
The shipping line should be obvious .
It is a freight forwarding Singapore company that operates ships and containers to transport goods around the world .
Shipping lines are mostly employed by large companies , although small - time clients can book one container for cargo .
So , why not contact a shipping company directly instead of going through a freight forwarder in Singapore ?
The shipping company usually charges full for each container regardless if you can fill each container or not .
Through freight forwarding services , however , you can get competitive prices instead .
3 . Shipping Company
A shipping company , also called an exporter , is the party responsible for the transportation of your goods , but they could also be the manufacturer , the seller , or the company where the point of origin of the product is to be picked up .
4 . Consignee and Customer
The consignee refers to the party that receives the goods at its place of destination and is also called the receiver or importer , while the customer is the party that is responsible for booking and paying for the shipment of items .
The customer contacts a freight forwarder in Singapore and the freight forwarder in turn arranges the shipment with a company that offers logistics services to move the merchandise efficiently from one place to another .
Defining which is which is important when fulfilling the requirements for importation and exportation of goods , because that will also determine your rights , responsibilities , and liabilities .
Do n’t worry though , because the freight forwarding services is well - versed in both local freight and international freight , and it is their task to make the process easier for you .
How International Shipping is Done Singapore imports goods from various parts of the world , whether it ’s for a small - time business or international corporations .
This is also perhaps the most complicated part of the transportation of goods because a lot of parties are involved to complete it .
The logistics company is trained to deal with the shipping company , Customs brokers , air freight , sea freight , and other parties to make the shipment of goods easier .
Small shipments that will fit in one standard ocean shipping container ( less than 20 cubic meters ) , also called Less than Container Load ( LCL ) , go through the following process : haulage ( origin ) , handling ( origin ) , Customs clearance ( for exportation ) , sea freight , Customs clearance ( for importation ) , handling ( destination ) , and haulage ( destination ) .
It should be clear in the contract which one will be paying for each step ( yes , there are fees and documents for each ) , as well as establishing which one is liable for the items transported .
That way , if something happens to cargo , someone will pay for the damage .
Import Procedure in Singapore
The Singapore Customs website contains all the necessary information needed for importation in Singapore , so this section will just be an overview of what you should expect during the freight forwarding process .
All the items that are imported into the country are subject to the regulations of the Customs Act , Regulation of Imports and Exports Act , and Goods and Services Tax Act .
The importer or the receiver of the goods is required to get a Customs permit regardless if the importer is an individual or a company .
The receiver is specifically required to prepare the declaration requirements and the taxes for the goods , whether it ’s a non-dutiable goods or dutiable goods , based on the insurance , cost , and freight values .
Import Requirements in Singapore Besides the Customs permit , the commercial invoice is also needed to determine which party is the consignee and the importer of the items .
You are also required to do the following : 1 . Check if the imported merchandise is prohibited
2. Pay for the GST ( Goods and Services tax ) and other duties
3 . Deposit the merchandise in free trade zones in Singapore , regardless if it was transported through sea freight or air freight
4. Provide containerised cargo documents for clearance Documents should be kept within the next five years as reference if any issue arises .
These will include the books of accounts , commercial invoice , packing list , air waybill , bills of lading , certificate of origin and analysis , insurance certificate , and other related documents .
Standard Trading Conditions of Freight Forwarders
The Singapore Logistics Association website contains details about the standard trading conditions that are practiced by the freight forwarding services in Singapore .
The document includes the obligations of the customer , instructions in the handling of goods and the services , indemnities and charges , rights of the company , liabilities , compensation , and laws and jurisdiction .
There are currently over 500 members which follow these standards of logistics services .

The contractor that does aircon servicing in Singapore should have well - adopted the modernization of technologies .

Love for Food November 02 , 2017
Finding a good caterer is an important part for holding large - scale events like corporate events , wedding , and even on small affairs like parties and family gatherings .
Unfortunately , a standardized grading system for caterers has n’t been established , and anybody can put up their own catering business .
But there ’s nothing to worry about , here ’s how you can choose the good – if not best – caterer in Singapore that will make your event memorable , for the right reasons .
1 . Get and listen to word - of - mouth recommendations and suggestions .
No amount of advertising can equal or replace a good suggestion of someone you know and trust .
If your friend or acquaintance recommended an excellent caterer based on the services that were provided for their event , then that caterer might be someone that you should consider making business with .
Conversely , it ’s also important to heed any bad reviews about a particular bbq catering company .
2 . Schedule a food tasting session with the caterer .
If the caterer that you ’ve chosen provides meals for large events , then it should n’t be a problem to them if you want to schedule a food tasting session .
Do remember though that the bbq catering from Singapore food that you ’ll be tasting will be the best meals that the cat
The Interview with Oiwan Lam
The background on the case is presented at A Conversation With A TELA Bureaucrat .
In brief , Oiwan Lam published an essay at the InMediaHK website that included a linked photograph from Flickr for the purpose of discussing the state of censorship in Hong Kong .
Oiwan Lam has just been informed that the essay was classified on a preliminary basis as " Category II : Indecent " by the Hong Kong Obscene Articles Tribunal .
The maximum penalty is HK $ 400,000 and 12 months in jail .
The following is a translation of an interview with Oiwan Lam .
( InMediaHK ) The Obscene Articles Tribunal is harassing citizens -- an interview with Oiwan Lam .
By Ip Iam - chong .
July 1 , 2007 .
[ in translation ]
Q : Recently you published a photograph from Flickr and the government 's Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority turned their attention on you .
The photograph has been classified as " Category II : Indecent " material by the Obscene Articles Tribunal .
Why did you post that photograph in the first place ?
A : At first , I wrote an essay that called for citizens to post hyperlinks to pornographic website .
This is because there was a case in which a citizen posted some pornographic hyperlinks and the police went to his home and arrested him .
The citizen pleaded guilty and paid a fine .
I thought that this was a very uncivilized act .
A hyperlink is not pornography ; it is just a bunch of computer programming codes .
My essay was an attempt to challenge the Obscene Articles Tribunal because it ignored the new technology and culture and it lacked commonsense .
When I selected that picture , it was not part of my original plan about the hyperlinks .
I only wanted to have a photograph to accompany the essay .
I wanted to highlight some of the problems with the censorious standards at the Obscene Articles Tribunal .
When I chose this particular photograph , I deliberately went to flickr , because flickr is an extremely popular web service .
I used the single search term ' nude ' to find this particular photograph .
I believe that nudity is not identical to indecency .
The human body is not indecent in itself .
From the various nude photographs , I use this one because I felt that this is a female nude that a photographer filmed with considerable design through the use of lighting and photographic techniques .
I did not personally feel that this photograph was indecent .
But I know that the Obscene Articles Tribunal uses the quantitative method of counting the number of exposed vital parts to make their classificaiton .
My guess was that the current bureacratic procedure would deem this photograph to be indecent .
That was why I chose this photograph .
Q. The Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority responded quickly .
What do you think of their attitude ?
What are your feelings ?
A : Actually , the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority called about one week after the photograph / essay appeared .
They gave me an advice and asked me to remove the photograph because it may be indecent .
At the time , my thought was that the Obscene Articles Tribunal had not yet made a judgment and the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority was just an administrative department .
I asked that worker why TELA took action immediately after receiving one and only one complaint .
As an adminstrative department , they should have followed through with the complaint and make some basic observations to decide whether the complaint was valid ; if so , they could follow through .
Previously , the movie < Autumn 's Tale > was forwarded for classifcation after TELA received two complaints and the result was that shown on television repeatedly for ten years already .
But with two complaints , censorship was immediately put into place .
As for my photograph , a single complaint triggered an action .
I felt that this tremendous expenditure of resources only resulted in harassing citizens .
Q : Do you know why it took so long to come up a Category II classification ?
It seemed to have taken several weeks .
It was almost a month .
Some friends , especially those from the gay / lesbian community , called to ask me about the progress .
Ordinarily , action is taken one or two weeks after the advice is issued .
This time , it took one month .
TELA called me first on May 28th with its advice .
TELA called me again at the end of June about the preliminary classification .
It was exactly one month .
At first , I thought that not being called by him was a good thing , because he might be thinking that the complaint was unreasonable .
But it is obvious now that he must have gotten some legal advice and then something else happened in the meantime .
Flickr had a new localized policy : from mid-June , the policy was directed specifically at the users in four regions such that the users from those regions will not see some of the photographs .
These four regions are Germany , Singapore , South Korea and Hong Kong .
This policy went into effect in mid-June .
TELA referred my photograph to the Obscene Articles Tribunal on June 22nd .
The Obscene Articles Tribunal determined within one week ( that is , on June 28th ) that the photograph was Category II : Indecent .
This was some kind of concidence -- Flickr changed its policy and then the Obscene Articles Tribune received my photograph for classification purposes .
Q : Now that the Obscene Articles Tribunal has classified this photograph as Category II : Indecent , what are your feelings ?
A : Since I posted that photograph , I expected that the Obscene Articles Tribunal would only look for the two vital parts and conclude that the photograph was indecent .
I am conflicted inside .
On one hand , I was hoping that they would not classify it as indecent based upon commonsense .
As an organization , they ought to have some commonsense .
As a citizen of Hong Kong , I hope that the Obscene Articles Tribunal of the government should have some commonsense .
But on the other hand , I feel that this case was absurd .
I thought that this case can be used to challenge the censorship system , including all the people inside this system .
Last year , the Audit Department has said that 89 % of the Obscene Articles Tribunal are over 40 years old .
But the publications that they are scrutinising are intended for young people ; the Internet contents are designed for young users .
So why is everything being scrutinized by people over 40 years old with special backgrounds ?
Why can't the users decide for themselves ?
Q : Why do you intend to do next ?
A : This was a preliminary judgment and there is still five days for a review .
I will ask for a review .
I have consulted with a lawyer who told me that if the same result is upheld after the review , the police will take over the case to determine the responsible party ( i.e. myself or the website ) and then follow through .
Q : Are you worried ?
A : Actually , I am not worried .
I am psychologically prepared to spend time to deal with this matter and to raise money .
If the review is still unfavorable , I will appeal .
In the 1995 case of the statue of David , the decision was overturned only when the case reached the High Court .
The statue of David is a popularly received work of art and it even had to go to the High Court .
I need to be psychologically prepared that I will have to spend a lot of time if this makes it to the High Court .
Q : What are you calling for the citizens to do ?
A : The citizens should care about this case .
More generally , they should care about the Hong Kong system for determining indecency / obscenity .
As a cosmopolitan city , we need to have easy circulation and diversity in our information and culture .
The citizens should also actively try to reform the system of censorship of obscene / indecent materials .
For example , the rules should not be so rigid .
One needs to look at the contents of the publication , or factor in the genre , or consider whether it is a work of art , or decide if it is just peddling pornography .
In the case of the < Chinese University Student Press > , the case was based upon a survey questionnaire and a discussion essay .
Maybe some people think that while the essay was poorly written , the newspaper was not peddling pornography .
During the process of examination , it is necessary to separate the discussions from the selling of pornography .
When making the decision , it is necessary to look at the background of the materials and determine the reason why these things are being published .
Presently , the Obscene Articles Tribunal does not care about the context at all .
Q : If you are going to embroiled in a lawsuit , are you worried about the financial impact on yourself ?
A : Yes .
I am presently a freelancer .
Therefore , Hong Kong really needs an organization like the Electronic Frontier Foundation in the United States .
That organization supports individuals to oppose unreasonable censorship .
We can see that many things -- from copyright issues to adjudication of obscene materials -- are being directed against individuals .
For example , some of the Internet cases were directed against individual netizens .
As an individual who has to face up to this monstrous judicial system , many people will accept defeat and pay a few thousand dollars in fines because there was no point in making a big case out of it .
Therefore , Hong Kong needs to have a foundation to support these individuals .
Presently , some people are willing to pay the fines and therefore the law enforcement and judicial departments wind up with the sense that they are doing the right thing .
When citizens accept this way , everything is rationalized .
Actually , the citizens are being forced to accept .
We need an organization or foundation to deal with these cases and offer supoortive work .
" One laptop per child " was the ambitious promise a group of MIT faculty members made to the world in January last year .
The idea to develop and produce millions of simple , Internet - capable $ 100 laptops and give them to the poorest kids on the planet sounded appealing .
But just how children in remote villages in sub-Saharan Africa were supposed to hook up to the Internet was unclear .
The solution may come out of thin air .
Literally .
All you need is a rooftop and the sun , claim the inventors of a solar - powered wireless device .
" Green " initiatives like theirs , together with a range of wireless technologies , may extend the Internet 's reach to developing communities around the globe .
An increasing number of politicians , entrepreneurs , and organizations ( including the United Nations ) hail the Web as a tool with the potential to help transform developing societies .
Access to it provides inexpensive communication as well as vast amounts of knowledge and real - time information .
Eventually , the Web will aid education efforts in developing communities and help lift them out of poverty – or so the thinking goes .
Government institutions in developing nations already present themselves on the Web , and their middle - class city - dwellers increasingly have access .
Even in smaller towns , Internet cafes are springing up .
Yet Web access stops short of reaching millions of people in villages and remote towns – arguably the places where it could have its biggest impact .
Experts call this failure the " last mile problem . "
Rough terrain such as mountains or rain forests makes construction of a wired network in many far - flung places a prohibitively expensive option .
As a result , schools and community centers in many remote villages cannot hook up to the Web , even if Internet connections are available in nearby towns .
Given the lack of reliable electricity in many developing regions , the prospect of wireless networks also did not seem a viable alternative – until now .
" You can't have a network if you do n't have electricity , " says Marc Pomerleau of the Green Wi-Fi project .
But together with cofounder Bruce Baikie and partially funded by the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) initiative , he has developed the prototype of a solar - powered wireless router .
The device , planned to be unveiled in late September , is essentially an off - the - shelf wireless router connected to a battery that is recharged by a solar panel .
To this , Mr. Pomerleau and Mr. Baikie added their own invention – an " intelligent charge controller " that regulates the power consumption of the router .
Test runs indicate that this addition allows the wireless node to run for up to four weeks , even if the sky remains overcast for prolonged periods of time .
A mesh of these Green WiFi nodes mounted on rooftops could keep a wireless network between villages running for weeks .
In principle , only one of the nodes needs to be connected to the Internet to enable the rest of the wireless network to access the Web – potentially via the $ 100 laptops , which are each fitted with a crank or foot pedal to generate the electricity needed to run them .
Such a network could have aided communication with communities cut off from power by the 2004 tsunami in Asia as well as neighborhoods affected by hurricane Katrina last year , says Pomerleau .
Setting up a backbone network to connect the hundreds of major access points throughout a region can be achieved by using three existing wireless technologies , says Daniel Aghion , executive director of the Wireless Internet Institute .
WiFi hotspots serve areas extending up to several miles .
WiMax , a more advanced standard , covers distances of up to 30 miles depending on the terrain between the access points .
Third generation high - speed mobile networks may also be used , especially in places where cellphone networks already exist .
Which technology works best depends on a range of factors , including population density , terrain , deployment costs , and how easily future increases in network size can be achieved .
" If I had to design a backbone network from scratch , I would use all three , " says Mr. Aghion .
In fact , developing countries have a unique opportunity to " leapfrog wired infrastructure , " he says .
The lack of competition from wired – or " legacy " – technology may allow them to deploy wireless networks much more quickly than could be done in developed countries , Aghion asserts .
Existing technologies like WiFi have been tried and tested only on a small scale .
" Using [ WiFi ] for long range communications requires changes , " says Mubaraq Mishra of the University of California 's Berkeley Wireless Research Center .
He has analyzed wireless Internet pilot projects in the southern Indian state of Kerala .
What needs to be modified includes the way a WiFi network handles the information it transmits .
Chip companies also have to adjust their hardware .
" They need to support long distance WiFi , " says Mr. Mishra .
But the major obstacles to spreading the Web may lie elsewhere .
Global technology companies eager to tap into what is potentially a huge market often cosponsor or run their own wireless initiatives in the developing world .
The innovative and cheap equipment developed by other organizations may be viewed as competition , hampering cooperation .
" The $ 100 laptop is disruptive technology ; there are some corporate interests that find us threatening , " says Prof.
Mary Lou Jepsen of MIT and chief technology officer of OLPC .
Government red tape relating to radio spectrum licensing , rights of way , or import duties poses another major challenge .
" Regulation related costs [ can ] account for over 45 percent of the total costs , " says Mishra .
Wireless Internet in developing countries is for the most part uncharted territory .
The potential benefits to developing communities are big , as are the market opportunities for global companies .
But in view of the many uncertainties , the initial costs of deploying wireless networks have to be kept small if the Web is ever to get off the ground in these nations – not least because " we do n't have a handle on the demand , " says Mishra .
The Internet may bring cheap communications to remote communities , allowing them to access weather forecasts and health information , track market prices , or simplify dealings with authorities .
But just how big the demand is for such information remains unknown , says Mishra .
World 's first ' wireless country '
Formerly a part of Yugoslavia , and on the brink of ethnic war only a few years ago , Macedonia has become what may be the first " wireless country " in the world .
With $ 3.9 million from the US Agency for International Development , the Macedonia Connects program has brought wireless Internet service to the country 's 460 primary and secondary schools , which had already been equipped with 6,000 computers donated by the Chinese government .
On .
Net , a Macedonian company , was contracted to build the $ 7 million wireless network .
Instead of a myriad of WiFi hotspots , the network consists of a mesh of hot - zones – each stretching some 10 miles over cities and villages – that covers 95 percent of the country .
After the schools were linked up almost a year ago , On .
Net began offering the service to businesses and individuals .
Now anybody with a WiFi enabled computer can tap into the network – free of charge in some areas , including parts of the capital , Skopje .
Elsewhere in the country , users pay $ 20 or more a month for access .
In practice , however , only 13 percent of Macedonian households can actually access the Internet .
People lack the money , have no computers , or as yet simply have no interest in the Web .

I ’ve been widely quoted as saying
“ I would not trust my life or even my liberty to Tor ”
in a New Scientist article on WikiLeaks .
I said this because low - latency systems such as Tor are susceptible to traffic analysis by a strong adversary ( such as , say , a government ) .
If I were a dissident in a country with an evil government I would not rely on Tor to protect me from that government .
Actually , I should rephrase that : if I were a dissident I would not rely on Tor to protect me .
This is not to say WikiLeaks expects you to rely on Tor , I was commenting in general about the security of Tor , not about the security of WikiLeaks ( in the absence of a detailed design , I ca n’t comment on that ) .

Think a bottle of mineral water might have poisoned you ?
Then test it on a chicken .
One Chinese family on the southern island province of Hainan had just that idea when one of their number started vomiting blood after drinking a bottle of water , a newspaper said .
They fed the luckless chicken the rest of the water to see what would happen , the Beijing News said , citing a report in a local paper .
“ The result was the chicken died within a minute , ” it said , showing a picture of a man holding a plastic bottle squatting over the crumpled body of the bird .
The province ’s authorities were investigating , it added .
Barely a day goes by without some new scandal over a made - in - China product , be it toys , toothpaste or fish , which has raised safety concerns in major export markets around the world .

Unless you ’ve been living in a cave for the past half century , you have probably encountered a geodesic dome at one time or another .
They can be found on playgrounds , at amusement parks , and in museums ; and any number of homes and public buildings are constructed using some variation of this structure .
Depending on your tastes and disposition , you may think geodesic domes look cool , endearingly retro , or woefully unfashionable .
But you may not know the story ( and the logic ) behind this sometimes - controversial design .
Bucky - ing Trends
R. Buckminster Fuller was one of the most prolific thinkers and inventors of the 20th century .
He wrote numerous books , received dozens of patents , and worked tirelessly for decades to solve some of the world ’s most vexing problems using the tools of engineering and common sense .
For all his innovations , Fuller was a very practical man , and like most engineers he saw a great beauty in elegantly logical solutions — even if they defied tradition , aesthetics , or conventional wisdom .
So when a housing crisis arose in the years following World War II , he set out to find the simplest and most effective solution , no matter how unusual it may be .
Fuller loved geometry , and he was particularly impressed by the triangle , the most stable geometrical shape .
Many of his building designs involve triangles , because they provide the greatest structural integrity .
He also knew that the sphere was the most efficient three - dimensional shape , enclosing the largest possible volume with the smallest surface area — meaning a dome ( a partial sphere ) should be a logical shape for a building .
But dome - shaped buildings are notoriously awkward to construct .
Fuller ’s innovation was a way to create a sphere ( or partial sphere ) out of triangles , providing the best of both worlds .
He called this shape a geodesic dome , because the pattern of triangles forms an interlocking web of geodesics .
A geodesic is the shortest path between two points .
This is , of course , a line in two - dimensional geometry , but on the surface of a sphere , the shortest distance between two points is an arc defined by a great circle — a circle with the same diameter as the sphere ( like the equator ) .
The Miracle Building
If all that geometry is too much to wrap your brain around , consider the main advantage Fuller cited in his 1951 patent application for the geodesic dome : this shape , because it is self - reinforcing , requires far less building material than any other design .
Conventional buildings , according to Fuller , weigh about 50 pounds ( 22.7kg ) for each square foot ( 0.09 sq meter ) of floor space .
A geodesic dome can weigh less than 1 pound ( 0.5 kg ) for each square foot of floor space .
( One of Fuller ’s original geodesic domes was a metal framework lined with a sheet of heavy , flexible plastic . )
The upshot of this is that you can create buildings quite inexpensively , and with a minimum of equipment and labor .
Geodesic domes are also stronger than conventional buildings , highly resistant to earthquakes and wind , and more energy - efficient too .
What ’s not to like ?
Well , that ’s a circular question .
The main problem with a dome - shaped building is that although it encloses a large volume of space , a lot of that space is not easily usable by humans .
The slope of the walls means the floor space is effectively limited ( more so , the taller you are ) , and most furniture , having been designed for flat walls and corners , does n’t fit well .
There ’s also the fact that you need a fairly large lot for a dome of any reasonable height ; in urban areas , such real estate may be hard to come by .
Multiple levels within a dome are possible ( thus making better use of vertical space ) but those introduce additional engineering challenges — and expense .
And banks are generally hesitant to provide home loans for dome builders ; they ’re seen as a risky investment , because there ’s no way to gauge their resale value .
All these issues in no way diminish my enthusiasm for Fuller ’s design , because I feel , as he did , that logic and elegance count for a lot .
Plus — let ’s not beat around the sphere — I think geodesic domes look impressive , and I imagine it would be interesting to live in a space without right angles .
If fortune ever smiles upon me broadly enough that I can afford to build my own home , you can be certain a dome will find its way into the design somewhere .

This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on October 22 , 2003 , and again in a slightly revised form on January 5 , 2005 .
Last night Bush went on television to explain how driving the world 's greatest military to the point of destruction was his definition of success .
Faced with reducing the current escalation only because there are no more troops and equipment available , he painted this not only a victory , but one in which he invited others to share .
I think it 's safe to say that Democrats will not be rushing to celebrate damage to our military that no foreign enemy could have accomplished .
Republicans only wish Bush had kept his mouth shut .
Some key Hill Republicans , in fact , were upset that he returned front and center on the issue at a time when the White House had so carefully ceded the selling of the surge to Petraeus and Crocker .
" Why would he threaten the momentum we have ? " says one frustrated Capitol Hill Republican strategist with ties to the G.O.P. leadership .
" You have an unpopular President going onto prime time television , interrupting Americans ' TV programs , to remind them of why they do n't like him . "
Bush did more than remind the American people that this is his war , and that in supporting this war , the Repubicans are placing loyalty to the worst president in history above any demands of decency or common sense .
In his speech , Bush raised the stakes of his long - shot gamble .
In the life of all free nations , there come moments that decide the direction of a country and reveal the character of its people .
Do you smell that ?
That 's the odor of every possible bridge being burned .
By supporting Bush now , Republicans are supporting the idea that Iraq is more than just a miserable conflict , badly planned and horribly executed .
They 're buying the idea that America is defined by what happens in Iraq .
In supporting Bush , they are placing every chip on the table , and accepting that they can never draw them back .
You can not accept this cause as the cause and change your mind later .
The Republicans are absolutely invested in this war .
They hold only a 7 - 2 off suit , but they are all in .
Now all that is wanting is someone to call their hand .

For male sparrows looking for a mate or trying to defend their turf , it pays to keep up with the times and latest musical hits .
A new study finds that female white - crowned sparrows pay more attention to new bird songs than vintage tunes , and that other males find the oldies much less threatening .
Previous studies have shown that the bird songs of a single species can vary population by population .
The new work , detailed online in the journal Evolution , shows the songs can vary significantly over time as well .
It might also show how , across evolutionary time , one bird species becomes two .
Duke University graduate student Elizabeth Derryberry played two versions of male songs to other sparrows :
One was a recording made in 1979 and the other was a more modern version from 2003 .
Differences between the two songs were subtle : the 1979 recording starts out with a higher pitched whistle and ends with rapid trills .
The newer song starts with a lower whistle and has extended trills at the end .
But the female sparrows clearly preferred the newer version of the birdsong and would do a little “ dance ” after hearing it .
They arched their backs , raised their tails and beaks and performed a come - hither flutter with their wings .
If they really liked it , the female birds would begin to dance before the song was even over .
Reception of the old song was less enthusiastic .
“ It ’s not that they do n’t respond at all , ” Derryberry said .
“ It just is n’t as interesting to them . ”
To measure the response of male sparrows to the bird songs , Derryberry placed a speaker in the middle of 20 male territories in Tioga Pass , California , during spring mating season .
She watched to see how closely each male approached the recorded trespasser and found that the 1979 bird song did n’t incite as much defensive behaviors by other males as the 2003 version .
If the bird songs were hard - wired into the sparrows , they would n’t change over time .
That they do change suggests the songs are culturally transmitted .
Derryberry suspects the birds ’ environment influences the songs they sing , and that the trills have become slower in order to travel through the thickening foliage observed in many of her study areas .
And because the birds have to listen carefully and selectively , the changing bird songs could be part of a subtle process by which one species splits into two , Derryberry said .
The two graphs above tell a very interesting story :
1 . In 2000 , the Fed Funds target rate was 6.5 % and the money supply ( M1 ) was $ 1.1 trillion ( see top chart above , click to enlarge ) .
2 . In response to the recession of 2001 and the subsequent " jobless recovery " in 2002 and 2003 , the Fed lowered its target Fed Funds rate to 1 % by mid-2003 using expansionary monetary policy that increased the money supply by 27 % , to $ 1.375 trillion by 2004 ( see top chart above ) .
In dollar terms , that was an injection into the economy of $ 275 billion , or almost $ 1000 of additional M1 ( " monetary crack , " see below ) per person in the economy !
3 . In the process of implementing expansionary monetary policy to lower the Fed Funds rate by 5.5 % ( from 6.5 % to 1 % ) and expanding the money supply by 27 % , the value of the U.S. Dollar ( Trade Weighted Exchange Index : Major Currencies ) has fallen by almost 31 % since early 2002 .
From Don Luskin
writing on the Fed 's recent rate cut to 4.75 % :
1 . The crisis in credit markets is a direct result of the unwinding of speculative excesses that were set in motion in the first instance by the Fed 's having kept interest rates so low for so long .
2 . By lowering interest rates , the Fed effectively increases the quantity of money liquidity in the financial system , and risks increasing inflation as a result .
The reactions to the Fed 's rate cut this week of surging gold and oil prices , and a dollar falling to all - time lows on forex markets , confirms that there are serious inflationary consequences in our future .
3 . Inflation is monetary crack - it promotes short - term euphoria , but in the end leads to ruin .
Any short run growth effect will be more than offset by the dislocations and arbitrary transfers of wealth created by higher inflation , and ultimately by ruinously high interest rates that the Fed will eventually have to enforce in order to rein in the inflation it has created .

“ The SPP ( Security and Prosperity Partnership ) is like putting the monkeys in charge of the peanuts . ”
[ UPDATED Feb 12’08 ]
TORONTO , Sep 22 2007 ( Tierramérica ) – Under the North American Free Trade Agreement , Canada lost control over its energy resources .
Now , with “ NAFTA - plus ” , it could also lose control over its freshwater resources , say experts .
Canada ’s water is on the trade negoti ating table despite widespread public opposition and assurances by Canadian political leaders , said Adèle Hurley , director of the University of Toronto ’s Programme on Water Issues at the Munk Centre for International Studies .
A new report released Sep. 11 by the programme reveals that water transfers from Canada to the United States are emerging as an issue under the auspices of the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) .
The SPP — sometimes called “ NAFTA - plus ” — is a forum set up in 2005 in Cancún , by the three partners , Canada , United States and Mexico .
Economic integration as envisioned by the powerful but little - known SPP is slowly changing the lives of Canadians , says Andrew Nikiforuk , author of the report “ On the Table : Water Energy and North American Integration “ .
The SPP is comprised of business leaders and government officials who work behind the scenes and are already responsible for changes to border security , easing of pesticide rules , harmonisation of pipeline regulations and plans to prepare for a potential avian flu outbreak , Nikiforuk writes .
“ The SPP is run by corporate leaders ; governments are irrelevant , ” said Ralph Pentland , a water expert and acting chairman of the Canadian Water Issues Council .
Pentland envisions a future where , in response to ongoing drought problems in the United States , the SPP will make arrangements to dole out millions of dollars of public funds for private companies to build pipelines to transfer water from Canada .
“ The SPP is like putting the monkeys in charge of the peanuts , ” he told Tierramérica .
Massive water diversions from Canada do not make economic or environmental sense , according to water experts .
Far better and cheaper is to improve water efficiency and eliminate waste .
The United States and Canada lead the world in water consumption and are extraordinarily wasteful , Pentland says .
Moreover , most of Canada ’s water is in the far north , not near its border with the United States .
And even the transboundary Great Lakes are at their lowest levels in 100 years due to climate change , notes Nikiforuk .
William Nitze , prominent member of the SPP and chairman of GridPoint Inc. , a company that makes energy management systems , is not in favor of bulk water exports .
“ Water management has been poor in all three countries , ” Nitze said .
Canada , for example , favors guidelines over mandatory rules for keeping pollutants out of water .
And Mexico needs to double its investment in its water infrastructure , he noted .
CANADA : Losing Water Through NAFTA
GEORGE BUSH had big ideas for his second term .
He promised to fix Social Security , America 's public pensions system , and revamp the tax code .
Despite his best efforts , Social Security reform sank last year .
Rejigging the tax code has proved so politically tricky that the White House dare not push it .
With almost three years to go , Mr Bush seems less a radical reformer than a struggling lame duck .
White House officials , desperate to show that the president still has a domestic agenda , have now changed the subject — to health care .
The buzz in Washington , DC , is that health - care reform will loom large when Mr Bush gives his annual state - of - the - union address on January 31st .
Al Hubbard , Mr Bush 's top domestic policy adviser , adds that the focus will be on ideas that control costs , boost access and improve quality .
Health care ?
The idea seems preposterous .
How can an administration that is too timid to push tax reform tackle one of the most complicated challenges facing America 's economy ?
What 's more , the timing looks terrible .
Mr Bush 's team is under fire for botching its biggest health - care initiative to date , the introduction of a prescription - drug benefit for elderly people covered by its Medicare programme .
Thanks to bureaucratic tangles , thousands of poor old folk have been denied drugs they used to get free , and more than 20 state governments have had to step in to pay for the medicines .
Republican lawmakers dread what this fiasco may cost them in November 's mid-term elections .
Yet Mr Bush may be able to push more radical change in American health care than anywhere else .
Both politicians and the public recognise that spiralling health - care costs are a problem — second only to the Iraq war , according to a recent Wall Street Journal / NBC poll .
Those costs are a big reason for the sluggish growth in workers ' wages , the widespread perception that America 's middle class is being squeezed and the huge job cuts at Ford this week .
America 's health system is a monster .
It is by far the world 's most expensive : the United States spent $ 1.9 trillion on health in 2004 , or 16 % of GDP , almost twice as much as the OECD average ( see charts 1 and 2 ) .
Health care in America is not nearly as rooted in the private sector as people assume ( one way or another , more than half the bill ends up being paid by the state ) .
But it is the only rich country where a large chunk of health care is paid for by tax - subsidised employer - based insurance .
This system is a legacy of the second world war , when firms , hamstrung by wage controls , used health insurance as a way to lure in workers .
It means that , according to census figures , around 174 m Americans get health coverage from their own , their spouse 's or their parents ' employer .
Another 27 m buy health insurance individually , for which they do not get a tax subsidy .
The government picks up the tab for 40 m elderly and disabled Americans ( through Medicare ) and about 38 m poor ( through the state - federal Medicaid scheme ) .
That leaves around 46 m uninsured , though many of these , whether students or workers , go without insurance by choice .
In practice , they get emergency care at hospitals , which is paid for by higher premiums for everyone else .
Set alongside other rich countries , which typically offer all their citizens free ( or very cheap ) health care financed through taxes , America 's system has some clear strengths .
Consumers get plenty of choice , and innovation is impressive .
One survey of doctors published in Health Affairs claimed that eight of the ten most important medical breakthroughs of the past 30 years originated in America .
Equally clearly , the American system has big problems , notably inadequate coverage ( no other rich country has armies of uninsured ) , spotty quality and high cost .
Huge discrepancies lurk within the system .
John Wennberg , Jonathan Skinner and Elliot Fisher of Dartmouth College have pointed out that Medicare spends more than twice as much on people in Miami than in Minneapolis , and , if anything , results are better where spending is lower .
Up to 30 % of Medicare spending , they concluded , is wasted .
Poor treatment is rife : a study by the Institute of Medicine has suggested that medical error is the country 's eighth - largest cause of death .
For decades , American health - care spending has outstripped income growth , by an average of 2.5 percentage points a year .
There have been clear cycles within this trend : for instance , herding employees into managed - care schemes , notably Health Maintenance Organisations ( HMOs ) , which negotiated discounts with doctors and restricted the services available to patients , helped slow down health inflation in the mid-1990s .
But voters loathed HMOs , there was a political backlash and in the late 1990s costs shot up again .
Although the pace of medical spending has slowed slightly recently ( to 7.9 % in 2004 ) , spending has risen by 40 % since 2000 .
Typical insurance premiums have gone up by more than 60 % .
The great unravelling
With medical inflation far outpacing inflation in general , American firms are scaling back the health coverage they offer .
The share of workers who receive health insurance from their own employer has fallen from almost 70 % in the late 1970s to around 50 % today .
In the past five years , the proportion of firms offering medical benefits has fallen from 70 % to 60 % , with the steepest decline among small firms and those employing the low - skilled .
Those employers who do offer health insurance have pushed more costs on to workers by raising co-payments and deductibles ( the expenses before insurance kicks in ) .
Employer - provided health coverage for retirees , once common , has shrunk , although America 's big carmakers , including Ford and General Motors , are still hobbled by having to provide it .
Mr Hubbard 's assessment is stark : “ The private market is broken . ”
At the same time , the burden on government is about to soar .
Add together Medicaid , Medicare and other publicly financed health care , such as that for ex-servicemen , and the public sector already pays for 45 % of American health care .
( The total is nearer 60 % if you include the tax subsidies . )
But as America 's firms limit their health - care spending and , particularly , as the baby - boomers retire , that share will rise sharply .
On current trends , federal spending on health will double as a share of the economy by 2020 .
That would mean much higher taxes , something Americans do not want to pay .
With employers limiting their exposure and government unable to fund its commitments , America 's health system will unravel — perhaps not this year or next , but soon .
Few health experts deny this .
Nor do they disagree much on the sources of the problem .
Health markets are plagued with poor information , inadequate competition and skewed incentives .
Since most bills are paid by a third party ( the insurance company or the government ) , neither patients nor doctors face real pressure to control costs .
Overall , Americans pay only $ 1 out of every $ 6 spent on their health care out of their own pockets .
Doctors are generally paid for individual services and so have an incentive to perform too many procedures .
The huge tax subsidies for employer - purchased health insurance encourage expensive care .
Rapacious lawyers and the risk of being sued exacerbate the tendency towards unnecessary “ defensive ” medicine .
The first question is whether to try to make America 's imperfect market work better , or to accept that markets cannot work in health care and focus more on government regulation .
The second is whether to go for incremental reform or a comprehensive overhaul .
The history of American health policy is littered with failed efforts at radical change .
Harry Truman wanted to create a system of national health insurance in the 1940s .
When Canada introduced its government - run health system in 1971 , many American politicians hoped to do the same .
The biggest recent effort was Hillary Clinton 's health - care plan of 1993 , which mandated health - insurance coverage for all delivered through carefully regulated health alliances with price caps .
All these efforts failed , thanks to the enormous power of health - care lobbies and Americans ' horror at anything that smacked of “ socialised medicine ” .
Today 's debate is scarred by those failures , though some brave health experts still favour comprehensive reform .
The Physicians Working Group , for instance , argues that America has to move to a single - payer system , as in Canada or Britain .
Victor Fuchs and Ezekiel Emanuel , two prominent health experts , argued in the New England Journal of Medicine last year that the current mess should be replaced with a universal system of health vouchers funded by a hypothecated VAT .
In a new book from the Brookings Institution called “ Can We Say No ? ” , Henry Aaron , William Schwartz and Melissa Cox argue that America will sooner or later have to ration health care , though they are coy about exactly how .
Washington 's politicians , however , have shown little appetite for radical change .
Their focus is still on expanding coverage rather than controlling costs .
The biggest recent policy initiative , the 2003 decision to add drug coverage to Medicare , was the biggest expansion of a government health programme since 1965 .
Some states have been thinking more radically .
Massachusetts , for instance , may require everyone to have minimum insurance , with the state helping poorer people with subsidies .
Maryland has a new law that requires all large employers to spend at least 8 % of their payroll on health care , supposedly to prevent the state 's Medicaid system having to pick up the tab .
Though that particular law has more to do with Wal - Mart - bashing than health care , unions are pushing for similar legislation in 30 states .
The most interesting innovations , however , have come less from think - tanks or politicians ' offices than from within the health - care industry .
One trend , called “ Pay for Performance ” , is to shift doctors ' and hospitals ' incentives towards providing more efficient and better care , by measuring quality and adjusting payments accordingly .
According to Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , a health - care research foundation , there are now around 100 “ Pay for Performance ” initiatives in place .
Early evidence suggests that they are having some effect .
Patients as consumers
The second shift within the health - care industry has been to change patients ' incentives with more cost - sharing and larger deductibles .
If patients pay more of the upfront costs of their health care , the argument goes , they will become more discerning consumers .
And some of the cost saved by employers can be put into special Health Savings Accounts ( HSAs ) , which workers can tap to pay routine health costs .
Once the account is empty , workers are responsible for paying for their health care until their deductible is reached .
This should make them think twice before visiting a specialist when they get a sore throat .
The trend towards HSAs was given a big push by a tax change in 2003 that was part of the Medicare drug legislation .
Provided that an individual buys health insurance with a high deductible ( at least $ 2,100 for a family ) , he can put the equivalent amount of money into tax - free accounts , whose balances can accumulate over years .
The number of people with high - deductible plans is still relatively small : only 2.4 m in early 2005 , according to government figures .
But health economists expect HSAs to grow rapidly , as ever more employers offer them to try to control costs .
A new survey by consultants at Deloitte shows that in these kinds of plans , in 2004 - 05 , costs rose by less than half as much as in traditional ones .
The Bush agenda picks up both these new trends .
Without much fanfare , Medicare too has been introducing its own incentive schemes .
Hospitals must now provide proofs of quality to qualify for some Medicare payments .
Medicare is also experimenting with bonuses for hospitals and doctors that improve their quality and efficiency .
Where Medicare leads , many others may follow .
The White House 's main focus , however , is the private market .
One goal is legal reform .
Mr Bush has already pushed ( unsuccessfully ) for laws that cap payments for medical malpractice lawsuits .
He will keep trying .
His health advisers would also like to deregulate the health - insurance market , freeing it from the stifling rules , imposed at state level , that can raise the cost of an insurance plan by as much as 15 % .
Chiefly , Mr Bush wants to accelerate the trend towards consumer - driven health care .
One uncontroversial idea is to encourage doctors and hospitals to provide more information on the cost of treatment .
The other is to cut taxes .
Mr Bush 's team wants to eliminate the bias in favour of employer - purchased , low - deductible health insurance in America 's tax code , not by reducing the existing tax subsidies for employers , but by increasing the tax subsidies for individuals .
This philosophy is conveniently summarised in a new book , “ Healthy , Wealthy and Wise ” , by three economists with close ties to the White House , Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University ( formerly Mr Bush 's top economic adviser ) , and John Cogan and Glenn Kessler of the Hoover Institution at Stanford .
They argue that since it is politically impossible to get rid of tax subsidies for employer - based health insurance , the best way to eliminate the tax bias towards high - cost insurance is to make all health spending tax - deductible and expand HSAs .
Legal , insurance and tax reform together , they argue , could reduce America 's health spending by $ 60 billion and cut the number of uninsured by between 6 m and 20 m .
Since overall medical spending would slow , the authors reckon their suggestions would cost a modest $ 9 billion a year .
To an administration that believes the answer to every problem is lower taxes , the appeal of these ideas is obvious .
Many health experts , however , are deeply sceptical , both about whether the shift to higher - deductible plans will actually reduce health - care inflation and , even if it does , whether the government should encourage this trend with more tax cuts .
The logic of consumer - driven health care assumes that unnecessary doctor visits and procedures lie at the heart of America 's health - care inflation .
And it assumes that individual patients can become discerning consumers of health care .
Both are questionable .
Most American health - care spending is on people with chronic diseases , such as diabetics , whose health care costs many thousands of dollars a year , easily exceeding even high deductibles .
Instead , critics worry that greater cost - consciousness will deter people , particularly poor people , from essential preventive medical care , a trend that could even raise long - term costs .
A classic study by the Rand Corporation in the 1970s showed that higher cost - sharing reduced both necessary and unnecessary medical spending in about equal proportion .
Nor is it obvious that people actually behave like discerning consumers in health care , even when they have information .
Proximity of hospitals and word - of - mouth reputation often matter more to patients than published quality indicators .
Sceptics of consumer - directed care like to point to Bill Clinton , who chose to have his heart surgery in a hospital that New York state rates as having merely average mortality rates for such operations .
The truth is that the shift to consumer - directed health care and greater cost - sharing involves a culture change that may take decades .
It will also come at the price of greater inequality .
The burden of health spending will be shifted on to those who are sick , and not just because people will pay a greater share of their health costs themselves .
High - deductible insurance policies are attractive to the young and healthy .
But as these workers leave traditional insurance , the risk pool in other insurance plans will worsen and premiums will rise even faster .
The real losers will be poorer workers with chronic illnesses .
American health care has already become more unequal as employers have cut back , and this will continue .
The Bush team argue that “ fairer ” tax treatment will slow cost rises and enable more people to get basic insurance .
The opposite is more likely .
Bigger tax subsidies for health care are , if anything , likely to raise overall spending .
Worse , since most tax breaks benefit richer people most , more tax incentives are likely to bring more inequality .
They will also reduce tax revenue and worsen the budget mess .
Mr Bush 's health - care philosophy has a certain political appeal .
It suggests incremental change rather than a comprehensive solution .
It reinforces existing industry trends .
And it promises to be pain - free .
Unfortunately , it will not work .
The Bush agenda may speed the reform of American health care , but only by hastening the day the current system falls apart .
Last year , the government took a more controversial step , amending a long - standing law that limited the kind of trials that foreign pharmaceutical companies could conduct .
In January , the government threw out that constraint .
India , the brilliant hub of outsourced labor , was positioning itself in a newly lucrative role : guinea pig to the world
How Blonds Evolve
Roger Dobson and Abul Taher report in The London Times ( www.timesonline.co.uk) on a study suggesting blonds began having more fun in the Ice Age .
According to the study , North European women evolved blond hair and blue eyes at the end of the Ice Age to make them stand out from their rivals at a time of fierce competition for scarce males .
The study argues that blond hair originated in the region because of food shortages 10,000 to 11,000 years ago .
Until then , humans had the dark brown hair and dark eyes that still dominate in the rest of the world .
Almost the only sustenance in Northern Europe came from roaming herds of mammoths , reindeer , bison and horses .
Finding them required long , arduous hunting trips in which numerous males died , leading to a high ratio of surviving women to men .
Lighter hair colors , which started as rare mutations , became popular for breeding , and numbers increased dramatically , according to the research , published under the aegis of the University of St. Andrews .
However , the future of the blond is uncertain .
A study by the World Health Organization found that natural blonds are likely to be extinct within 200 years because there are too few people carrying the blond gene .
According to the W.H.O. study , the last natural blond is likely to be born in Finland during 2202 .
THE WORLD Correction : March 12 , 2006 , Sunday
An excerpt in the Reading File column last Sunday from an article published last month in The Times of London about the evolution of blond hair included a reference to a study , attributed to the World Health Organization , that predicted that blond hair would become extinct in 200 years .
In 2002 , after the first news reports about the study , W.H.O. said it had never done research on the subject and that it had no knowledge of how the reports originated .
Two mysteries have followed me well into adulthood :
Does soaping yourself work underwater , and how come there are so many people out on the street all day , seemingly not working ?
Having pitched a work , and not a soap , column , I recently attempted to answer the latter .
Because look out your window .
Who are these people ?
At any given hour on any given workday , well , it turns out it 's not a workday at all .
Not for these hordes roaming free , anyway .
By rights our parks and movie theaters and stores should be minor ghost towns between 9 and 5 -- chanced upon by the occasional tourist or late - night bartender but otherwise peaceful .
Instead , they 're inexplicably packed .
I did n't doubt that the packers had sound explanations .
I just wanted to hear them .
It occurred to me last night that you can learn as much about a city from what its people do n't do as you can from what they do do .
So I drove to as many parts of San Francisco as I could and interrupted as much leisure as possible to find out .
" Jeffrey " ( some names changed at owner 's request ) , writing a poem in a notebook on Church Street , had quit his California Pizza Kitchen job that morning ; he was down to a barista gig now .
The poem was about knots .
With extreme reluctance he conceded to hailing from Fresno .
There was " no love " at his pizza job .
John Spencer , 57 , was sipping a large soda near some flowers outside the shopping center on Market Street .
" What do I do ?
I do n't do anything .
I 'm in hospice .
And now I 'm having a luxury Coke at Safeway , " he said .
Spencer was on his way to a writing class at the AIDS Health Project ; he writes poetry .
The class will end soon .
He also goes to respiratory therapy three times a week , and a support group , and he does genealogical work .
I did n't approach school - age kids or obvious tourists .
I did n't approach grown - ups wearing lab coats or swinging hammers .
These people are either not meant to be working , or they clearly are working .
My methodology was to canvass at different hours of the day and to discount those merely on lunch breaks .
Science ?
No .
But revealing all the same .
Just visiting , said the blonde with the cappuccino outside a Starbucks ; she passes for native but comes from Belgium .
And she 's been saddened by the weather .
( A believer in temporary solutions , I lied that tomorrow was supposed to be lovely . )
" I get Wednesdays off , " said Kim Anderson , 29 , an administrative assistant at an architectural firm .
She spends them at physical therapy or catching up on errands or doing what she was doing here : sitting and watching the dogs at Duboce Park .
" Alan " sat 20 yards away , but his nose was in a short - story manuscript .
Once he was a writer in the multimedia industry , but then he was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome .
That was 14 years ago and he 's been on disability ever since .
There are days when typing is exhausting and walking across the room impossible .
Today , however , he was out in the sun .
" If there 's been anything good in this , it 's that I started writing fiction .
Which is actually kind of what I always wanted to do . "
There are helpful statistics to shed light on the out - and - about .
In 2005 , 14 percent of San Franciscans 5 and older reported a disability -- nearly 100,000 people .
Over 40,000 people were self - employed .
Almost 70,000 were in college or grad school .
Stereotypes about the contemporary human condition aside , a great many people do n't inhabit cubicles .
John , 41 , was n't in a cubicle when I spoke to him .
He runs large servers for a living but is between jobs now .
He sees lots of movies at the Metreon and concedes he does n't work out enough .
Many people I encountered reported variations on the " in - between jobs " line , and it 's not just a euphemism .
Among the employed are those who will soon be without work , thanks to frictional unemployment , the inevitable periods of joblessness structured into even perfect economies .
As of March , about 4 percent of San Francisco 's labor force was unemployed altogether -- 17,300 people .
On top of those are the self - employed , the partially employed and so on .
Going over my own findings , a surprising number of people had had something job - related happen that very day .
A surprising number had called in sick .
Claire , who works in quality control at a biotech company , used a vacation day to get a tattoo of a bird .
Another woman took the day off to be with her dogs .
( " And catch up on errands , " she added responsibly . )
" John , " who is 18 and was strolling through Yerba Buena Gardens one Thursday morning , laid out his typical itinerary : " Watch the grass grow , get high , hit on the ladies . "
How does he pay rent ?
" If you ask 100 girls for $ 10 , that 's $ 1,000 , that 's rent , " he explained logically .
How does he get them to part with their $ 10 ?
" I tell them I can't live without them , " he answered , with some disappointment at the caliber of question , as though he'd been asked how many moons our planet has .
Also downtown , there was a pastry cook getting on a bicycle who works weekends .
Then a couple of teachers chatting at a bus stop in the Sunset , done with their workdays by 3 .
Two college students , Jeremiah and Tiera , with no classes that day .
Another young man who did his security guard work on weekends .
Steve , on Divisadero , carrying a neatly wrapped bag of comic books to his son and extolling the pleasures of running one 's own company .
A funny thing about these swarms of daytime layabouts :
They are quietly self - reflective swarms .
Almost all of them admitted to me that they often wonder about their fellow malingerers .
The funny thing is , everyone has an answer for themselves but is baffled by everyone else .
Possibly this is like life itself .
" They can't all be writing the Great American Novel , " said Joshua , 45 , nodding in the direction of everyone else .
Joshua recently left a large law firm to work on his own , hence his mid-afternoon workout downtown .
" I used to wonder who all these people were .
Now I 'm one of them . "
Raul , 34 , works security at Cafe Du Nord when he 's not cooking on a line .
He used to work construction and " would always wonder how the 9 - to - 5 people got their errands done . "
He 's concluded that many of them work nights , like he does now .
I thought Pacific Heights would be crawling with the daytime idle .
If it is , the crawling happens indoors .
And away from the windows .
Possibly those mansions require long hours at offices ?
I drove to the Richmond .
" Zhang , " leaning against a building , said he works in several restaurants and shops .
" Not always , " he noted , acknowledging his presence on the side of the building .
Ken , in the Castro , is in his 50s and is a published author ( " Emphasis on the ' published , ' " he requested .
" There are lots of scribblers sitting in coffee houses " ) .
When he's not writing , he lectures , makes calls and so on .
At the Main Library , a very tall woman gave a be -quiet face , then said she was out of grad school for the summer .
Two young actors chatting at Yerba Buena noted the importance of leaving time for auditions .
Are n't we the country that other countries make fun of for working too much ?
Even the most assiduous Europeans , the British , work more than three hours less than us per week .
Almost half of us get less than seven hours of sleep a night , and it 's gotten worse in recent years .
Our workaholism has spawned entire walls of self - help books .
And yet this parallel universe exists right alongside the work - obsessed one .
It looks nice , too , as parallel universes go .
The shameless weekday daytime moviegoer lives in another dimension entirely .
Richard Inlander , 63 , has been retired three years and loves it .
In addition to watching movies , he travels , spends time with his grandchildren and does part - time work for Weight Watchers .
" I do n't know how I ever had time for a job , " he laughed in front of the Metreon 's ticket line .
The cafe crowd is another special subset of the do n't - seem - to - be- working population .
Ritual Coffee Roasters , in the Mission , is a special subset of that subset .
All day it 's full and , with the music and the laptop acreage , a particularly San Franciscan mellow industriousness fills the place .
I set about grilling the laptoppers .
Ben Long , 40 , is a freelance writer and photographer .
Sometimes he works out of the house , sometimes out of Ritual .
" People are n't just working here -- they 're doing more and more of their non-work , too , " he observed .
" People play massively multiplayer games , they work on their MySpace pages .
It is n't just an extension of the office here , it 's an extension of the living room . "
Keith Kessler , 38 , assumes the other laptoppers are mostly Web designers or students .
He himself is a lawyer at a downtown firm .
He 's been there long enough that he can do legal research or work on a memo from here .
Brandan , 41 , was working on an e-mail .
But he could 've been working .
He does technical editing and writing .
Margaret Mason , seated nearby , makes a living from her blogs , MightyGirl.com and MightyGoods.com .
Her book " No One Cares What You Had for Lunch " was written from this same cafe .
" Face time is n't such a thing anymore , " she said .
" What people care about now is whether you get the work done . "
Sitting next to her was her husband Bryan .
He has an actual office -- just did n't feel like going to it today .
Closer to the door sat Shauna , 24 .
" I do n't work .
I 'm a trust - fund baby , " she said , with a nice mix of self - deprecation and not - too - much self - deprecation .
What did she do today ?
" Got up at noon .
Farted around .
Made corn on the cob .
Went to buy a shirt .
Came to Ritual . "
Her laptop was open ; she was reading about careers in psychology .
Why pick a career ?
I asked .
It 's a question that asserts itself after several days among those with daytime freedom .
If you have a trust fund , I asked , why not keep farting around and making corn on the cob ?
" I 'm bored . "
Chris Colin was a writer - editor at Salon , and before that a busboy , a bread deliverer and a bike messenger , among other things .

The symbolism is not exactly ideal .
Those on the lookout for errors at Wikipedia have flagged a few more — this time , however , they are not examples of vandalism at the user - created site but typographical errors in Wikipedia ’s own logo .
In postings on internal mailing groups , users of Wikipedia have described obvious mistakes in the design , a globelike jigsaw puzzle with characters from various languages on the pieces .
Two of the characters — one in Japanese and one in Devanagari , the script used in Sanskrit and several modern Indian languages — are meaningless because of minor slips .
Jimmy Wales , a founder of Wikipedia , says the symbolism may not be so unfortunate .
“ The nature of Wikipedia is such that because it is written by everyone , there are errors , ” he said .
But he added that it was the nature of the project that errors would be noticed and corrected .
Paul Stansifer , 21 , of Somerville , Mass. , who came up with the globe design as part of a contest among Wikipedia users , shares that sentiment .
He wrote by e-mail that by showing an incomplete jigsaw puzzle , Wikipedia was , “ as far as I know , the only Web site whose logo is a disclaimer ( ‘ This Web site is a work in progress . ’ ) ”
Ms Bhutto wants to run for a third term as prime minister
She spoke after the two were reported to have met in what was said to be a bid to strike a power - sharing deal .
Pakistani reports said Gen Musharraf and Ms Bhutto had met in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates .
Gen Musharraf is facing increasing political opposition and rising violence from Islamist militants .
About 200 people have been killed in attacks since the Red Mosque in the capital , Islamabad , was cleared of militants in a bloody siege three weeks ago .
More than 100 people were killed as soldiers stormed the mosque .
Talks with government
" I have very grave reservations about a uniformed president , and I believe it blurs the distinction between the civilian and military rule , " Ms Bhutto told Britain 's Sky television on Sunday .
Ms Bhutto has made no secret that her Pakistan People 's Party has been holding talks with the government , but neither she nor Gen Musharraf has commented on Friday 's reported meeting in Abu Dhabi .
" We have already said that our negotiations are going on and we have achieved forward movement on some matters , " she told Pakistan 's Geo Television .
Gen Musharraf is facing increased opposition and Islamist militancy
Ms Bhutto has lived in self - imposed exile since leaving Pakistan in 1999 after serving as prime minister for two terms in the 1980s and 1990s .
She says corruption charges against her and her husband are politically motivated .
She has been trying to engineer a comeback , but the constitution would have to be changed to allow her a third term as prime minister .
Gen Musharraf , who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , is expected to seek re-election later this year .
Speculation is running high that he may strike a deal with Ms Bhutto for her support in exchange for allowing her return to Pakistan to run for prime minister .
But Gen Musharraf has repeatedly rejected assertions by Ms Bhutto and another former prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , that they will return for the general elections due later this year .
Men think that women are very demanding .
They are oohing and aahing about it .
Women are always clamouring for gifts ( better expensive ones ) and attention , and if they do n’t get enough , they start to feel hurt , write nasty MySpace posts , moan and groan “ you do n’t love me ! ” , “ you only care about yourself ” , “ I ca n’t bear this anymore ” , “ I am leaving ” , “ I need you to prove your love ” , and so on and so forth .
Hassling policy .
After all , it ’s so easy for a man to get a humble and obedient girl - friend / lover - girl / wife who is always happy , joyful , sweet and smiling , who will not complain of lack of presents and who will never say a single rude word .
This is because women are shallow and primitive creatures .
As bromide as sour milk .
They want romance and fine words .
They want to be wanted all the time .
And when they are wanted , they only want it more .
No matter if a woman has children or not , if her boobs are big or small , if she is smart and witty or green and stupid , if she is a cynic or a drizzle .
The woman control strategy is pretty simple and the same for everyone ( euphoriant ) .
The key rule is : you should be easy on women ( this is because see above : “ women are shallow and primitive ” ) .
1. Presence effect
You can live together or just go out – that ’s not the point .
It ’s important to create presence effect .
You can use anything – IM , e-mail , phone , sms .
Better to use non-verbal ways .
The main thing is not to overdo – otherwise , they ’ll get mad ( those who are PR girls and cynics ; silly girls from a teacher ’s college will hardly get mad but you ’d better not take any risks ) .
3 sms per day is ok .
The ratio is : 30 % of ooly - drooly , 50 % of humour and 20 % of sex ( for PR girls you can do 40 % of sex and cut down ooly - drooly ) .
“ Good morning hun ” , “ Good night bb ” , “ I miss you so much ” , “ I want you so bad !!! ” , etc .
Or just silly quotes not to the point out of movies , books , songs and common life like “ Dr. Evil , how do you like Space ? ” , “ Honey , pass me the salt please ” , “ Who ’s your daddy now ? ” , “ You ’re alright star ” ( Robby ) .
Just give way to your imagination .
And the shallow woman will be kicking up heels as she really believes you are thinking about her night and day ( and this is just what she needs ) .
2 . Sweet little things
Everything is simple here .
It ’s the thought that counts .
Flowers on a black - letter day ( better keep it regular , at least once a month or two months … if you want pomp , send it to her office , say , on some occasion … very bromide but everyone is screaming ) , a Spunch Bob trinket ( if she loves Spunch Bob ) , a Hello Kitty hairclip ( if she loves Hello Kitty ) , a dvd with a Tinto Brass movie ( “ hun , it ’s all about you ” ) , a disk with a cool music downloaded from torrents , etc .
Once I knew a designer who was making a flash intro for a soap brand ( your ad could be here ! ) with blossoming white roses and the logo turning up .
He replaced the logo with a pop-up message “ Cindy , let ’s fuck ! ” and gave it to me as a gift together with three white roses .
Of course , Cindy was unable to say ‘ No ’ to the pop - up message .
In one word , such little things are tremendously touching and euphoriant and they also make women think you are thinking about them all the time .
3. Compliments
Fish stories are allowed .
The main thing is to believe in what you ’re saying as sincerity makes it a success .
This is because ( see above ) “ women want to be wanted al the time ” .
This is also because most women are mentally unstable tight - assed psychos .
Therefore , more phrases like “ you ’re so hot - looking today ” , “ dude , how pretty you are ” , “ I love that open blouse you wear ” .
Regular sex phrases are “ sex with you is the best sex in my life ” , “ I love your boobs ” ( I am telling you , she wo n’t forget these words till the end of days ) , “ you ’re so good at blow job ” ( she will never stop blowing ) .
It ’s important to say she is smart , not only pretty .
And to say she is pretty , not only smart .
Then the woman will again be out of it , thinking she is most pretty , most smart and most sexy , which means everyone wants her ( and this is what she needs ) .
4. Initiative
Zool !
Zaratustra says .
Going to visit a woman , take a lash .
Nietzsche is a genius !
“ Today we ’re gonna do this and that ” , “ This weekend I ’ve thought about this ” , “ We ’ll be going to the cinema on Thursdays ” , etc .
Here she is also out of it , thinking with you she is safe as houses .
5. Hollywood kiss
Not often .
But regularly .
Women want a movie - like kiss .
You can see the example in the 3rd season of “ Lost ” , when Soyer kisses Kate .
Remember how he grasped her head with both hands ?
There is no woman who would n’t be dreaming to be kissed that way , and there is no man who would be able to do that .
6. Gallery play
This means , in front of her friends .
Nothing is more satisfying than their envious mugs at the moment when you ’re stirring sugar in her tea or helping her to take off the shoes .
I guess it ’s enough
I could say much more but I ’m already lazy about doing that :)
Girls are welcome to add their remarks .
Guys can argue , but would be better if they wrote the same thing about men :)
Argument mapping improves critical thinking
April 13 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
Following up on my post on Critical Thinking , I ’ve been looking into how arguments can be visualised .
Simply put , an argument map is a presentation of reasoning , where the inferential sequence or structure is visualised and made explicit in an organic manner .
I remember in my undergraduate philosophy courses doing very simple structural diagrams on paper and it was n’t easy to share them or reproduce them , nor was it easy to keep track of who had rebutted what in a long philosophical debate .
But now there is software to help give structure to our thinking and graphically display our claims in inferential or evidential relationship to each other .
Early 20th Century lawyer , J.H. Wigmore , is probably the originator of the graphical displaying of arguments .
He developed a graphical structure for evidence in legal proceedings .
Check out one of his maps here .
In the 1950s , philosopher , Stephen Toulmin ( a student of Wittgenstein ) , further developed argumentation analysis in his book , The Uses of Argument .
Here ’s an example of one of his maps .
Robert Horn is very well - known for his efforts in visualising argumentation , with his best known map probably being Can Computers
Think ?
Horn picked a debate that had been raging since the 1950s – the Turing Test : whether computers can or ever will be able to think .
I found Robert Horn ’s explanation of how he developed pictorial argumentation maps very interesting .
You can download each map and read about the claims , rebuttals , counter rebuttals etc – a great way to learn more about the structure of reasoning and argumentation .
Horn considers that text and pictures have become so interwoven that they form a language of their own – visual language – and was really the first to hit on the use of a map as metaphor in the context of his work .
We have difficulty navigating our way around complex arguments when there ’s no map .
It would be a bit like trying to find your way around Sydney , London or New York without maps !
Philosophers have been thrashing it out over the last 2500 years or so , attempting to discern what constitutes a good argument , but our minds more easily grasp the visual and so argumentation maps are a great form of knowledge generation and transfer – a non-expert can see what the essence of a debate is and what the experts think and disagree about .
Here is a good site that offers a tutorial on how to construct an argument map , including some practical exercises ; and here is a link to a comprehensive list of tools for argument mapping , and the related techniques of concept and mind mapping .
I leave you with a photo of Taro .
I do n’t think anyone would argue that this is one cute pup :)-

The other day I showed this video of Tom Friedman 's macho posturing on Iraq back from 2003 .
Media Bloodhound looks at this op -ed Friedman wrote this week , on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary and Gen.
Petraeus 's testimony before Congress :
That he believes , or is simply promoting , this idea - the emptiness of Arab dictatorships is one of the " most troubling lessons of the Iraq invasion " - is not only chilling in both its inhumanity and disregard for the rule of domestic and international law ( does he forget we illegally invaded a sovereign nation under false pretenses ? ) , but also , contextually , all the more stunning in its willful obliviousness to what is undeniably one of the worst - if not the worst - American foreign policy decisions in our nation 's history .
Yet this characteristically disingenuous Friedman narrative serves as the perfect moral blank check for the Bush administration , a timely tonic that encourages us to continue to shove " democracy " down the Iraqis ' throats at the barrel of a gun while it simultaneously provides a rhetorical exit strategy if that just refuses to take : if only those Iraqis really wanted democracy , our illegal , unprovoked invasion of their country - which now accounts for nearly 4,000 deaths of American servicemen and women and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis - would be a success .
Come see China , where the rivers are as deadly as our pet food and toys !
There is an understanding among first world nations and sometimes also the United States that pollution standards must be maintained to protect the environment .
This understanding flips when it comes to the third world .
It is perfectly natural for a company based in Europe or the United States to set up factories in a third world nation and ignore all environmental regulations that may apply back home .
I suppose the thinking goes that the skies will darken and begin to smell like cat ass somewhere over in China , but the dirt - sucking Chinese will just be glad to escape communism and earn an honest 73 cents a day .
Everyone is reasonably happy .
Western consumers have their three dollar Sponge Bob sandals made in a blackened hellscape and the Chinese workers get to enjoy a new corrugated tin roof to shield them from the liquid carbolic acid falling from the sky .
They 've got food in their bellies to offset the ecological disaster and we do n't have to look at the possible repercussions because they 're happening 5,000 miles away .
This summer , the equation fell apart on the shores of Lake Michigan , and Indiana and Illinois went to war .
The story of this war begins in the 1980s , when efforts began in earnest to reverse decades of heavy industrial pollution of Lake Michigan .
Populations of fish and other lake life had been devastated by algae blooms , fishing had been all but banned because of mercury contamination , and there were even concerns that city water supplies in Chicago and other urban areas along the lake might become threatened by the quality of the lake water .
It 's not an uncommon story in the United States .
Lakes and rivers here have suffered many years of almost unrestrained dumping and some have caught on fire .
You know water is polluted when it 's flammable .
EPA regulations had done some to ease this dumping over time and a long struggle to get regulators in Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Indiana on roughly the same page had brought some results , but people had to actively work to rejuvenate the environment .
For 25 years Lake Michigan and other great lakes have been slowly recovering .
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year to clean up pollution , test water supplies , and even engage in major engineering projects to improve the water quality and protect wildlife .
The lake is n't quite as great as it once was , but it 's getting better .
Every year since these efforts began it has improved .
I 'm sure a cynical percentage of you are rolling your eyes about tree - hugging hippies , but in Chicago the push to restore Lake Michigan has had broad support .
You live next to a tar pit long enough and you eventually decide something has to be done .
Every year brings new major projects and millions of taxpayer dollars spent to restore beaches or improve water conditions and most people applaud these efforts .
I 'm not talking about saving whales or protecting some nature preserve I 'll never visit in Alaska , this is our beach , our lake .
Chicagoans have to live with it and we'd prefer to live next to a lake that can cool you off in the summer , not one that can strip chrome off a bumper .
Think of it not so much as environmental activism ( though it is ) , but as the large scale version of a bunch of people wanting their neighbor to clear a mound of trash and dead bodies off his lawn .
That 's where we were in spring of 2007 , but then came the war .
The bigger the better !
Refineries beautify our Great Lakes !
The first shots were fired in Northern Indiana , the blighted section of Lake Michigan coast that still pumps out the greatest volume of industrial pollution .
Here the steel mills and refineries still dump in the lake , though over the years their emissions have been curtailed .
In July of 2007 the Chicago Tribune published an article that revealed the nefarious scheme hatched by Indiana and British Petroleum , which maintains a large refinery in Whiting , Indiana .
Indiana regulators exempted BP from state environmental laws to clear the way for a $ 3.8 billion expansion that will allow the company to refine heavier Canadian crude oil .
They justified the move in part by noting the project will create 80 new jobs .
Under BP 's new state water permit , the refinery -- already one of the largest polluters along the Great Lakes -- can release 54 percent more ammonia and 35 percent more sludge into Lake Michigan each day .
Ammonia promotes algae blooms that can kill fish , while sludge is full of concentrated heavy metals .
Whiting and the refinery are located on the border with Illinois and are sometimes considered a part of the Chicago urban area .
Neither Chicago nor Illinois were consulted before this closed - door agreement was made .
The first word the public heard on the matter was the July Tribune article .
' No modern president has seen such a sustained rejection ; ' Kissinger : Bush 'at peace with himself '

President Bush is holding private meetings " over sodas and sparkling water " in which he asks trusted advisers -- " Why does the rest of the world seem to hate America ?
Or is it just me they hate ? "
This according to the Washington Post .
" Not generally known for intellectual curiosity , Bush is seeking out those who are , engaging in a philosophical exploration of the currents of history that have swept up his administration , " the Post 's Peter Baker writes in the lead story for Monday 's paper .
" These sessions , usually held in the Oval Office or the elegant living areas of the executive mansion , are never listed on the president 's public schedule and remain largely unknown even to many on his staff . "
To some , " Bush seems alone , isolated by events beyond his control , with trusted advisers taking their leave and erstwhile friends turning on him . "
But he remains upbeat , the article says .
" You do n't get any feeling of somebody crouching down in the bunker , " said a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who talked to Baker .
" This is either extraordinary self - confidence or out of touch with reality .
I ca n't tell you which . "
Bush 's setbacks are manifold .
" No modern president has experienced such a sustained rejection by the American public , " Baker writes .
" Bush 's approval rating slipped below 50 percent in Washington Post - ABC News polls in January 2005 and has not topped that level in the 30 months since .
The last president mired under 50 percent so long was Harry S. Truman .
Even Richard M. Nixon did not fall below 50 percent until April 1973 , 16 months before he resigned . "
Among his woes : Hurricane Katrina , Jack Abramoff , Harriet Miers , Scooter Libby , Alberto Gonzales , Monica Goodling , Vice President Dick Cheney , Valerie Plame , Joe Wilson , Colin Powell , Lawrence Wilkerson , Fallujah , Abu Ghraib , Paul Wolfowitz , immigration , CIA prisons , " torture , " Guantanamo Bay , warrantless wiretapping , FOIA , the estate tax , Social Security , Osama Bin Laden , journalists , faltering Republican allies , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , John Conyers , Patrick Leahy , Henry Waxman , a Democratic Congress and Iraq .
Perhaps his most salient victories were the appointment of two conservative bona fides to the Supreme Court -- John Roberts and Samuel Alito -- which have , in recent days , shown they will leave a lasting conservative legacy .
Notes Baker : " Other presidents have been crushed by the pressure .
Lyndon B. Johnson was tormented by Vietnam War protesters outside his window shouting , ' Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? '
Nixon swam in self - pity during Watergate , talking to paintings and once asking Henry Kissinger to pray with him .
Bill Clinton fumed against enemies and nursed deep grievances during his impeachment battle . "
Kissinger told the Post Bush was n't Nixon .
" I find him serene , " Kissinger said .
" I know President Johnson was railing against his fate .
That 's not the case with Bush .
He feels he 's doing what he needs to do , and he seems to me at peace with himself . "

WASHINGTON — For front - runners Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , Florida looked to be a major battleground in the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination .
With its big , sprawling population , the state was a natural for high - profile candidates who could afford costly campaigns , and the prize was a whopping 210 delegates .
But now , because of an unexpected glitch , those delegates could go to a candidate most Americans do n’t even know is running : a crusty former senator from Alaska named Mike Gravel .
Or maybe to Ohio Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich , the quixotic peace candidate who barely registers in the polls .
It sounds like just another wacky political dust - up from the land of hanging chads and butterfly ballots .
But the problem is considered so serious that Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean and state party officials are embroiled in frantic behind - the - scenes negotiations to stave off a potential disaster that could quickly spread across the nation .
The trouble sprang from a decision by Florida lawmakers to jump to an earlier spot on the primary election calendar , following the lead of other big states tired of voting too late to have a meaningful say in choosing each party ’s nominee .
But whereas California , Illinois and many other states are moving to set their primaries for Feb.
5 , Florida opted to leap ahead to Jan. 29 — a week earlier than allowed under Democratic Party rules .
And that has triggered mayhem .
National Democratic officials have vowed to enforce party rules that strip delegates from any state that moves too early in the calendar , and also from candidates who campaign in those states .
The penalties were meant to stop states from continually leapfrogging each other in a race to be among the first to vote .
As things stand now , Clinton , Obama and other prominent contenders may not be eligible to win any Florida delegates , though the state offers a compartively large share of the total needed to win the Democratic nomination .
Under one scenario , it could turn out that no Democratic candidate gets any Florida delegates .
Democratic officials are alarmed by these possibilities , though they are reluctant to talk about the problem for fear of jeopardizing the negotiations .
For starters , they do n’t want to undercut their own candidates in what many consider the biggest swing state for the general election .
And if the Florida crisis is not resolved quickly , it could prompt other states to change their voting dates again — with some ballots possibly cast as early as 2007 .
New Hampshire , which plans to vote Jan. 22 , has said it will do whatever is necessary to protect its status as the first presidential primary state .
All agree they need to find a solution .
“ The alternative is chaos , ” said Mitchell Berger , a Fort Lauderdale lawyer and fundraiser for former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , a top - tier Democratic candidate .
“ I ’m encouraging everybody to calm down , take a deep breath and figure this out , ” said Berger , who is privy to the negotiations
It was not supposed to be this way .
To prevent this very problem — and to protect the practice of retail politicking in the traditional early - voting states —
Dean and other party leaders established a nationwide schedule for primaries and caucuses , starting in January 2008 .
They designated Iowa as the first caucus state , along with newcomer Nevada .
New Hampshire and South Carolina were approved for primaries soon afterward .
If that date holds for picking Florida ’s Democratic delegates , penalties for violating the party ’s rules would cut Florida ’s delegation by more than half , to 92 votes .
But most important , the rules would also take away any delegates won by candidates who campaigned or raised funds in the state .
Tension over the 2008 calendar is especially high because , for the first time in half a century , there are competitive primaries in both parties .
The GOP , which also has rules designed to keep order in the nominating process , plans to strip Florida of about half its delegates to the national convention if the early primary is held .
But the DNC rules go much further .
Strategists for Clinton vow that the senator from New York will campaign in Florida no matter what , underscoring her intent to build a campaign for the general election .
Other well - known contenders such as Sen. Obama of Illinois , Edwards , Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) and Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson are not likely to forgo the fundraising riches of Florida , one of the country ’s biggest sources of campaign cash .
That means that Florida ’s delegates could fall to the also - rans who appear on the state ballot but face no pressure to campaign there .
.
One possible solution gaining steam is to forget the primary and schedule statewide Iowa - style caucuses for February 2008 .
But whereas Florida taxpayers would underwrite the primary , the Democratic Party would have to pay for the caucuses — estimated to cost as much as $ 10 million .
And , though Iowa has a tradition of caucuses set in living rooms and firehouses , they might not work so well in the diverse , bare - knuckles political environs of Florida .
A typical condo complex in Broward County has more residents than many Iowa towns .
A state nominating convention is another possibility .
It would be less expensive , but some strategists worry that it could create the perception that party bosses were picking the nominee .
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to a quick resolution is the fear that if the DNC makes concessions to Florida , it could face new demands from other states .
Even worse , some fear a legal battle could result if one candidate wins the statewide vote and another wins the caucuses — especially if the Florida delegates are needed to determine the nominee .
GOP officials in the state say they had no idea until late in this spring ’s legislative session that the change would create so much turmoil on the Democratic side .
“ I do n’t think anybody made us aware of that until the very end of the process , ” said Marco Rubio , the Republican state House speaker .
And Jeremy Ring , a Democratic state senator from Broward County and co-sponsor of the legislation , defended it .
“ If the choice is Florida is relevant and has no delegates versus being irrelevant and having delegates , I ’d choose being relevant with no delegates , ” Ring said .
“ We did this so 18 million Floridians could take part in the presidential primaries , not so a few hundred people can go to a party in Denver . ”

Dozens of Iranian engineers and 15 Syrian soldiers were killed in an explosion while conducting a top - secret experiment – providing new evidence that the two countries are working together to develop weapons of mass destruction , it was reported yesterday .
The blast occurred while the joint Syrian - Iranian team was trying to mount a chemical warhead on a Scud missile , spreading lethal agents – including deadly Sarin and mustard gas – into the air .
The July 23 accident occurred at a factory in northern Syria , 50 miles from the Turkish border , created for the purpose of adapting ballistic missiles to carry chemical weapons , Jane ’s Magazine reported .
A fire that started in the missile ’s engine led to an explosion near a storage facility for chemical substances , the British - based magazine reported on its Web site .
This summer ’s accident confirms that Iran , which has been trying to develop its own nuclear weapons , is working with its Mideast ally to secure warheads capable of inflicting widespread destruction .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has come under fire from the United States and other nations for going ahead with his country ’s nuclear - energy program .
The incident was reported at the time by Syria ’s official news agency .
But the report included only information on the Syrian casualties and did not mention Iranian casualties .
The Syrian report claimed the explosion was caused by a “ heat wave , ” although the blast took place at around 4:30 a.m .
The Syrian government rejected the possibility of sabotage .
Syria has a long history of developing chemical weapons .
Since 1985 it has manufactured a variety of missiles capable of carrying Sarin .
Russian intelligence has claimed that Syria has a stockpile of hundreds of chemical aerial bombs .
According to Jane ’s , the facility where the accident took place was built as part of a cooperation agreement signed between Syria and Iran in 2005 .

The Center for Naval Analyses is a think tank that dates back to World War II .
Last month , they released a report on the national security implications of climate change , authored by a panel of 11 former admirals and generals .
The report suggests that the science of climatology needs to be incorporated into US security planning , and energy - efficient technology needs to be made accessible to both the military and developing world as soon as possible .
The panel 's take on climate change was a bit diverse .
A number of the members had spent time in science agencies , including NASA , since ending their military careers ; they tend to accept the scientific consensus .
Others emphasized the remaining uncertainties in the science but suggested they were irrelevant , as the military constantly engages in planning with incomplete information .
Indeed , there were frequent references to worst - case climate scenarios representing the sort of " low probability / high consequence event " that has been the centerpiece of national security planning since the Cold War .
As one panel member noted , " As military leaders , we know we cannot wait for certainty .
Failing to act because a warning is n’t precise enough is unacceptable . "
For the most part , however , the study 's language echoes the recent IPCC reports on climate change in terms of the probability and impact .
They view it as a serious issue , suggesting that " global climate change presents a new and very different type of national security challenge . "
The difference is clear in comparison to the Cold War , where the challenge was to keep the geopolitical situation stable .
Climate change , in contrast , brings with it the specter of inevitable instability through failed states .
" It has the potential to create sustained natural and humanitarian disasters on a scale far beyond those we see today .
The consequences will likely foster political instability where societal demands exceed the capacity of governments to cope . "
The failed states that result from this political instability are more likely to harbor terrorists and become involved in warfare ( both national and civil ) over scarce resources , including water .
Even the more stable Western democracies are likely to feel strains , as they are compelled to deal with mass migrations , refugees , and demands for humanitarian intervention — a fear echoed in other recent reports .
The panel produced five recommendations on how to cope with these impending security issues .
The first is simply that we need to start incorporating climate change into our security analysis and military planning .
There appears to be some movement in that direction , as the US House has dictated in a recent appropriations bill that climate change be considered in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimates .
The panel also recommend that the US government become directly involved in international efforts to limit carbon emissions .
Here there is little sign of movement , as the US continues to reject international agreements .
Other recommendations are more practical , such as the suggestion that the military should begin planning for the potential loss of coastal facilities due to rising ocean levels .
The potential for a warmer atmosphere to produce more severe weather was also acknowledged , as it was suggested that the military plan to have its normal operations disrupted by weather , and to have some of its resources put to use in helping storm - damaged communities within the US .
There are two recommendations , however , that may have a significant impact on technology spending .
One is that the US should get involved in assisting borderline states with both energy efficient tech and resources for mitigating the impact of climate change with the goal of preventing their failure .
The second is that the US military needs to become radically more energy efficient .
The panel noted that 70 percent of the tonnage the military brings to the battlefield is fuel , and that analyses within the Pentagon have long recognized that a more energy - efficient military would be more flexible and potent .
If these last recommendations are backed up by research money , they have the potential to have a major impact on energy technology , and possibly technology research in general .
Mitigation efforts directed at failing states will be faced with the limited resources and capabilities of those states .
As a result , any technology developed for these efforts will necessarily be cheap and easily applied .
Creating an energy - efficient military may have an even more profound effect .
The military is able to fund long - term , " blue sky " research of the sort that has gone the way of the dinosaurs in private industry .
Although military technology is often very expensive in early iterations , some of it eventually reaches the public in an affordable , mass - market form ( like GPS receivers ) .
Hype about a hydrogen economy aside , most of the actively funded areas of energy research involve an evolutionary approach to existing forms of battery , wind , biofuel , and solar technology .
Getting the military involved might send some money towards more exotic technology that could eventually revolutionize the global energy economy .
This might benefit not only the military and national security , but the planet as a whole .

His face covered by a balaclava , an official brandishing a cane repeatedly lashes the back of a man found guilty of breaking Iran 's morality laws .
Two police officers hold the legs of 25 - year - old Saeed Ghanbari and another his arms to ensure there is no escape from the punishment of 80 lashes handed down by a religious court .
Traffic was brought to a halt in Qazvin , 90 miles west of the capital Tehran , as more than 1,000 men gathered behind barricades to watch the public flogging .
Scroll down for more
Some took pictures on mobile telephones , others climbed traffic lights for a better vantage point as Ghanbari was marched to the centre of the square under the watch of blue - uniformed guards carrying machine guns .
A four foot long metal bench was taken from a police van and the convicted man was made to lie on it on his stomach , his fawn checked shirt pulled - up to his shoulders to expose his back and waist .
One police officer held his hands together beneath the bench , two others gripped his legs to ensure there was little movement .
Two police officers stood - by , their faces covered with balaclavas - each to administer 40 lashes .
Both men then lashed Ghanbari , taking the cane back behind their heads to guarantee maximum impact , each stroke leaving a distinctive red mark and bruising on his back .
Several wounds began to bleed .
It was unclear exactly what his offence had been as the country 's strict morality laws cover many areas , but it was reported he had been convicted of abusing alcohol and having sex outside of marriage .
The public lashings have been endorsed by the judiciary as a way of deterring alcohol abuse at a time when it is on the increase among young men but some religious leaders are said to be questioning their validity , fearing they have an adverse impact on the country 's image abroad .
Although men and women convicted of flouting public morals are routinely flogged in detention centres , public floggings are considered rare .
Human Rights groups say there have been a marked rise in recent months in the number of people sentenced to executions and floggings in Iran .
Amnesty International , which said it is " greatly concerned by continuing human rights abuses in Iran " , has highlighted figures revealing 117 people were executed in 2006 with thousands facing floggings .
They included a woman , who had been forced into prostitution as an eight - year - old , receiving 99 lashes because of " acts contrary to chasity . "
Earlier this year , a man was flogged after a copy of the Bible was found in his car .
At least 120 executions have been recorded so far this year , according to Amnesty , with two youths under the age of 18 when they committed their crimes among those killed
The latest gruesome pictures have emerged three weeks after there was an outcry over a video of a flogging in a Malaysian jail was posted on the Internet .
The sickening images showed a man being lashed repeatedly on the buttocks until he bled from several wounds .

I ’m not a political poet .
Not for the most part , anyway .
I certainly never wanted to be one , and I had been writing for a number of years before this finally happened :
I do n’t want to say too much for fear of being misconstrued
or maybe
for fear of being understood all too clearly so here ’s your warning â€ “
flowers sometimes bloom quite literally ,
unfurling in the dewfall to kiss
mother sky good morrow .
And sometimes wolves change their sheep
clothes for pinstripes .
Then these truths we hold to be self - evident fade to black ,
seven ancient words
lost in the splash and white noise â€ “
bites , topspin , code .
Make no mistake : style has triumphed over substance ;
our shamans hire out as consultants ;
God is coming to pay - per-view ; and a thousand points of light
are less than nothing
in a million miles of darkness .
Surely some gentle beast , its hour come round at last , stirs ,
casts its drowsy eyes
across the land .
Surely it wonders â€ “
what is this terrible myth
My Word has become ?
Certainly political verse has a long and noble tradition , and some of my own heroes were pretty darned political in both their writing and their professional lives .
This poem makes direct reference to William Butler Yeats ’
“ The Second Coming , ” and Yeats ’ earlier writing provided the mythic foundations for the Irish rebellion against England .
Later on he became a legislator , even .
Eliot ’s writing had its socio-political tones , and if I track back through the parts of the canon I always liked the most I come across people like Arnold , Byron – even the Metaphysicians and cavalier poets who sashayed off to a righteous ass - whipping at the hands of Cromwell ’s Roundheads .
To Lucasta , Going to the Warres TELL me not ( Sweet ) I am unkinde ,
That from the Nunnerie
Of thy chaste breast , and quiet minde ,
To Warre and Armes I flie .
True ; a new Mistresse now I chase ,
The first Foe in the Field ;
And with a stronger Faith imbrace
A Sword , a Horse , a Shield .
Yet this Inconstancy is such ,
As you too shall adore ;
I could not love thee ( Deare ) so much ,
Lov’d I not Honour more .
Still , I felt no call to political commentary .
But over time I think it became more and more inevitable .
I wanted , perhaps , to be left alone to write about love and loss and spirituality and a variety of more apocalyptic themes , but the political world would n’t leave me alone .
Maybe this is how it was for my heroes .
Maybe Yeats never wanted to write about politics – certainly “ Easter 1916 ” is n’t something he ’d have ever hoped for .
We live in a period where it ’s almost impossible to write without at least political implication .
Sure , most of life is political in some respects , but is it possible for the writer with a soul to keep down the foul , necessary beast that is the public expression of outrage ?
Maybe .
Maybe it ’s just me .
But I ’ll leave you with a taste of the sort of thing that keeps insisting on being written .
Covenant
Our legions are marching on the
City of Rain , our bleeding
bare feet , bone against concrete ,
tearing ruts in the Kingâ€™s highway .
We remember the lash and the
hole .
We remember Babylon
Ballroom , silver trays of cheese and
meats and candy - twist liqueur , the
splay of light tinkling
wine - filled crystal , but later ,
hunched over our books and
tearing at stale bread , we
recite the lessons we
will teach you soon : there is no difference between palace and prison ,
champagne and hemlock ,
chandelier and gallows .
When gunfire rips at the hinges of dawn ,
we will decorate lampposts with your
heads and feed your tongues to corbies .
When pyres of burnished mahogany
roil the skies of Hell ,
we will kill you last ,
saving you and savoring as you
boil in the dying screams of your
children .
Pinned to the wall like butterflies ,
you will hang in the grand gallery
twitching for centuries among the
handbills of kleptocracy : your economies of fraud ,
grifters in the boardroom , jowls
dripping with grease , your genocides of neglect ,
sucking the bones of your
feasting tables clean
while abandoned children and stray dogs
fight for scraps
in your alleys
in your roach - ripe tenements
in fields scalding with immigrant despair
in the flesh - caked machines of your factories
in your third worlds
on your oil - soaked beaches
in extinctions that once were forests
aflame with birdsong in the shadow of church bells
tolling beneath your mansions .
This Do in the Name of Commerce ,
but we are your shareholders now , flooding down the
Valley of Chrome , like
rose petals and ticker tape and gun oil .
I hope you ’ll share some of your thoughts and favorite political poems with us .

In 2005 , when Silicon Valley entrepreneur Michael Arrington started TechCrunch , his popular blog on Internet startups , he saw it mainly as a chance to indulge his obsession with young technology companies .
But it turned out that Arrington had latched onto something big .
TechCrunch became the go - to site for the scoop on new Web companies .
And , as technophiles flocked to TechCrunch , advertisers followed suit .
Arrington 's blog morphed from a labor of love into a fast - growing business .
Today , TechCrunch has a full - time staff of eight .
This year , it hired a CEO .
In August , 1.25 million people visited TechCrunch or its affiliated blogs at least once , according to comScore Inc .
It brings in $ 240,000 per month in advertising , according to Arrington , and pulls in additional revenue from conferences and parties .
Most important of all , TechCrunch is in the black .
" When I started the blog , it was just a hobby , " Arrington said .
But , after a while , " It was pretty clear that I could make more money blogging than from anything else . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
More quickly than most anyone imagined , blogging is growing up .
From the blogosphere 's anarchistic roots , a professional cadre is emerging that is creating an industry whose top - performing businesses now earn serious money .
The industry is expanding at warp speed .
Blog - based media could just be poised to elbow aside traditional print and broadcast outlets to become one of the dominant sources of news , information and opinion , many observers believe .
" As traditional media continue to contract , this stuff is going to expand , " said Steve King , senior fellow with the Society for New Communications Research , a Palo Alto think tank .
" The business models have caught up and you 're starting to see little blog publishing companies that frankly are becoming not so little . "
The blogging world has tremendous strengths - original voices , provocative opinions , imagination and intimate knowledge of a variety of subjects .
But it is also an industry struggling to mature , many observers argue .
They say blogging companies must overcome the industry 's reputation as a sort of digital Wild West where anything goes , and confront such questions as conflicts of interest , product hype , bias and low standards of accuracy .
Professional blogs " are at a fork in the road , " said Lisa Stone , co-founder and CEO of BlogHer , an online company operating a women 's blogging network .
" Any publisher has to implement ( ethical ) guidelines .
If someone recommends a mixer , a diaper or a personal digital assistant , it has to be because they absolutely love it .
It 's the only way to succeed . "
While there are plenty of growing pains , insiders are convinced there 's vast amounts of money to be made .
Venture capitalists and big - time media companies are taking notice .
" This is the next evolution of media , " said Jon Callaghan , a partner with True Ventures , a Palo Alto venture capital firm that has invested in Om Malik 's technology news blog GigaOm .
" We are in the second or third inning , extremely early in the emergence of this industry . "
Still many skeptics
Skeptical voices can be heard .
But even they acknowledge rapid progress .
" A few self - sustaining blog media businesses do seem to have emerged , " said Nick Denton , founder of Gawker Media , the parent of gossip site Gawker.com .
" But they 're still minuscule by the standards of traditional media .
And none have weathered a downturn .
So it would be unwise to sound too triumphant . "
A blog , of course , is an Internet writing format featuring regular posts by one or more authors that mix text , images , video , links to other sites , and comments from readers .
The vast majority are still the personal creations of those souls eager to share their thoughts and feelings with the world at large .
But out of that morass , an elite of professionally produced blogs has risen thanks to their quality of writing , originality of thought and usefulness of information .
An unknown number of those have quickly become bona fide businesses .
Of the millions of blogs on the Web , " most are diaries by teenagers and the like , but they get no traffic , " King said .
" The sites that are attracting traffic are professional blogs . "
When King speaks of professionals , he is referring to those whose full - time occupations and main sources of income are their blogs .
That 's different from people who blog as an extension of their jobs , such as newspaper reporters who put out online items as part of their work or Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz , who writes a widely followed technology blog .
The blogging industry is coming to resemble the magazine world , with multiple sites for every taste in politics , entertainment , business , technology and any other imaginable field .
" The ones that have become very strong small businesses have a niche market that 's big enough to attract advertisers , " King said .
" In most categories , a few blogs tend to dominate . "
At the top of the industry are sites such as the gossip and commentary network Gawker Media and politics site Huffington Post that started as blogs but mushroomed into Internet destinations with multiple blogs and other features such as news and product sales .
Not surprisingly , given the region 's role in the development of the Internet , the Bay Area is a center of the blogging business .
Several of the most popular tech - oriented blogs are based here , including TechCrunch , GigaOm and Matt Marshall 's VentureBeat .
BlogHer , with 13 employees , is in Redwood City .
Markos Moulitsas , the founder of Daily Kos , the influential and sometimes - feared liberal political blog , writes from Berkeley .
Sugar Inc. , one of the most powerful women 's lifestyle blog networks , is in San Francisco .
Federated Media Publishing , the brainchild of former Industry Standard Publisher John Battelle , operates here as a sort of uberblog , selling advertising and carrying out business functions for a stable of 130 independent blogs and related online media .
And the area is also home to an array of quirky , hard - to - categorize blogs that are succeeding as businesses , such Boing Boing , with an office in Sausalito , a sort of techno - futurist meditation that describes itself as a " directory of wonderful things . "
Boing Boing is one of the blogs in the Federated Media network .
What 's got entrepreneurs excited , especially those who went through the dot - com debacle , is that an increasing number of blogs are bringing in cash faster than they 're spending it after only a few years of existence .
That 's in sharp contrast with the dot - coms of several years ago , many of which lived off the proceeds of stock offerings and never succeeded in generating significant sales .
The economics of blogging is so strong that entrepreneurs often can self - finance , which lets them tell potential investors to take a hike .
TechCrunch 's Arrington said he 's walked away from venture capital deals four separate times .
" Every time we almost did a round ( of financing ) , we grew so fast the terms did n't make sense anymore , " he said .
The emerging business model is to start by selling advertising and build from there with events , subscriptions or product sales .
And with audiences growing at double - or triple - digit rates , ad prices are soaring for top blogs .
" When we started selling advertising in this space late in 2005 , it was very experimental and risky .
We were able to get maybe $ 4 or $ 5 " per 1,000 page views , Battelle said .
" For the same impressions we were selling then , we are now on average $ 20 to $ 30 . "
On the other side of the coin , blogging businesses can make money because their overhead is low .
" It 's dirt cheap to operate , which makes break - even incredibly achievable , " Callaghan said .
Right now , it 's rare for even the most successful blogging operations to employ more than a dozen full - time staff members .
Computer power and bandwidth get cheaper all the time .
And a headquarters is not essential .
" There are no offices .
It 's all virtual , " Daily Kos ' Moulitsas said about his site in an e-mail .
One success story
TechCrunch illustrates the new blogging math .
It sells sponsorships that allow advertisers to display on the home page at $ 10,000 per month .
It also uses Federated Media to sell display ads , keeping 60 percent of the revenue .
And it charges $ 200 to list in its Cool Jobs section , getting about five or six want ads per day .
Parties and conferences add another income source .
Last month , TechCrunch organized a two - day event at the Palace Hotel that gave 40 startups a platform to tout their wares .
And , as far as spending goes , " our costs are only headcount , " Arrington said .
As blogs mature and start producing good cash flow , they often create additional blogs or new sites , forming networks with multiple products and a common brand identity .
For example , GigaOm now offers four additional blogs , all with a common brand , and its staff has grown to 10 full - time employees .
" You 're seeing small media groups being created , " said Paul Walborsky , GigaOm 's newly hired chief operating officer .
" This is the next evolution . "
Brian Sugar , a veteran of several Silicon Valley startups , and wife Lisa began celebrity gossip blog Pop Sugar in 2005 as a hobby .
As they watched traffic rise and ran the numbers , they decided to organize as a business .
Now , one blog has become 11 aimed at college - educated young women , covering everything from fashion to health .
Five more blogs are on the drawing boards and a social network started in February .
The enterprise has emerged as Sugar Inc. , with a staff of 56 , including about 40 in editorial .
About 5 million people visit Sugar blogs every month , a number that is growing more than 10 percent a month .
Such growth has made it easy to raise money .
Sequoia Capital , one of Silicon Valley 's top venture firms , has contributed almost $ 10 million in two rounds of financing .
And NBC 's digital media unit , which owns the women - oriented Web site iVillage , invested a little more than $ 5 million this year , agreed to sell advertising for Sugar sites and is distributing Sugar 's content across its properties .
Meanwhile , the company has repeatedly turned down buyout offers , according to Brian Sugar , who noted that NBC bought iVillage for $ 600 million .
" We 're living in a very frothy environment at the moment , " he said .
Asked why he would turn down offers to buy his company at a lofty price , Sugar described the operation as " a family - run editorial business , " explaining that he collaborates with his wife and they get to bring their 16 - month - old daughter to work with them every day .
" This may be a weird answer , " he said , " but I 'm having way too much fun . "
Carlyle 's way
Making a mint inside " the iron triangle " of defense , government , and industry .
By Dan Briody
January 8 , 2002
Like everyone else in the United States , the group stood transfixed as the events of September 11 unfolded .
Present were former secretary of defense Frank Carlucci , former secretary of state James Baker III , and representatives of the bin Laden family .
This was not some underground presidential bunker or Central Intelligence Agency interrogation room .
It was the Ritz - Carlton in Washington , D.C. , the plush setting for the annual investor conference of one of the most powerful , well - connected , and secretive companies in the world : the Carlyle Group .
And since September 11 , this little - known company has become unexpectedly important .
That the Carlyle Group had its conference on America 's darkest day was mere coincidence , but there is nothing accidental about the cast of characters that this private - equity powerhouse has assembled in the 14 years since its founding .
Among those associated with Carlyle are former U.S. president George Bush Sr. , former U.K. prime minister John Major , and former president of the Philippines Fidel Ramos .
And Carlyle has counted George Soros , Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz Alsaud of Saudi Arabia , and Osama bin Laden 's estranged family among its high - profile clientele .
The group has been able to parlay its political clout into a lucrative buyout practice ( in other words , purchasing struggling companies , turning them around , and selling them for huge profits ) -- everything from defense contractors to telecommunications and aerospace companies .
It is a kind of ruthless investing made popular by the movie Wall Street , and any industry that relies heavily on government regulation is fair game for Carlyle 's brand of access capitalism .
Carlyle has established itself as the gatekeeper between private business interests and U.S. defense spending .
And as the Carlyle investors watched the World Trade towers go down , the group 's prospects went up .
In running what its own marketing literature spookily calls " a vast , interlocking , global network of businesses and investment professionals " that operates within the so - called iron triangle of industry , government , and the military , the Carlyle Group leaves itself open to any number of conflicts of interest and stunning ironies .
For example , it is hard to ignore the fact that Osama bin Laden 's family members , who renounced their son ten years ago , stood to gain financially from the war being waged against him until late October , when public criticism of the relationship forced them to liquidate their holdings in the firm .
Or consider that U.S. president George W. Bush is in a position to make budgetary decisions that could pad his father 's bank account .
But for the Carlyle Group , walking that narrow line is the art of doing business at the murky intersection of Washington politics , national security , and private capital ; mastering it has enabled the group to amass $ 12 billion in funds under management .
But while successful in the traditional private - equity avenue of corporate buyouts , Carlyle has recently set its sites on venture capital with less success .
The firm is finding that all the politicians in the world wo n't help it identify an emerging technology or a winning business model .
Surprisingly , Carlyle has avoided the fertile VC market in defense technology , which now , more than ever , comes from smaller companies hoping to cash in on what the defense establishment calls the revolution in military affairs , or RMA .
Thus far , Carlyle has passed up on these emerging technologies in favor of some truly awful Internet plays .
And despite its unique qualifications for early - stage funding of defense companies , the firm seems to have no appetite for the sector .
Despite its VC troubles , however , the Carlyle Group 's core business is set for some good times ahead .
Though the group has raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill in the past , the firm 's close ties with the current administration and its cozy relationship with several prominent Saudi government figures has the watchdogs howling .
And it 's those same connections that will keep Carlyle in the black for as long as the war against terrorism endures .
For the 11th - largest defense contractor in the United States , wartime is boom time .
No one knows that better than the Carlyle Group , which less than a month after U.S. troops began bombing Afghanistan filed to take public its crown jewel of defense , United Defense , a company it has owned for nearly a decade .
That this company is even able to go public is testament to the Carlyle Group 's pull in Washington .
United Defense makes the controversial Crusader , a 42 - ton , self - propelled howitzer that moves and operates much like a tank and can lob ten 155 - mm shells per minute as far as 40 kilometers .
The Crusader has been in the sights of Pentagon budget cutters since the Clinton administration , which argued that it was a relic of the cold war era -- too heavy and slow for today 's warfare .
Even the Pentagon had recommended the program be discontinued .
But remarkably , the $ 11 billion contract for the Crusader is still alive , thanks largely to the Carlyle Group .
" This is very much an example of a cold war - inspired weapon whose time has passed , " notes Steve Grundman , a consultant at Charles River Associates , a defense and aerospace consultancy in Boston .
" Its liabilities were uncovered during the Kosovo campaign , when the Army was unable to deploy it in time .
It is exceedingly expensive , and it was a wake - up call to the Army that many of its forces are no longer relevant . "
But the Carlyle Group was having none of that .
While it is impossible to say what U.S. secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld was thinking when he made the decision to keep the Crusader program alive , people close to the situation claim to have a pretty good idea .
Mr. Carlucci and Mr. Rumsfeld are good friends and former wrestling partners from their undergraduate days at Princeton University .
And while Carlyle executives are quick to reject any accusations of them lobbying the current administration , others are n't so sure .
" In this particular effort , I felt that they were like any other lobbying group , apart from the fact that they are not , " said one Washington , D.C. , lobbyist with intimate knowledge of the Crusader negotiations , noting the fine line between lobbying and having a drink with a old friend .
According to Greg McCarthy , a spokesperson for Representative J.C. Watts Jr. ( R : Oklahoma ) , whose district is home to one of the Crusader 's assembly plants , the Carlyle Group 's influence was indeed felt at the Pentagon .
" Carlyle 's strength was within the DoD , because as a rule someone like Frank Carlucci is going to have access , " says Mr. McCarthy .
" But they have other staff types that work behind the scenes , in the dark , that know everything about the Army and Capitol Hill . "
Perhaps even more disconcerting than Carlyle 's ties to the Pentagon are its connections within the White House itself .
Aside from signing up George Bush Sr. shortly after his presidential term ended , Carlyle gave George W. Bush a job on the board of Texas - based airline food caterer Caterair International back in 1991 .
Since Bush the younger took office this year , a number of events have raised eyebrows .
Shortly after George W. Bush was sworn in as president , he broke off talks with North Korea regarding long - range ballistic missiles , claiming there was no way to ensure North Korea would comply with any guidelines that were developed .
The news came as a shock to South Korean officials , who had spent years negotiating with the North , assisted by the Clinton administration .
By June , Mr. Bush had reopened negotiations with North Korea , but only at the urging of his own father .
According to reports , the former president sent his son a memo persuasively arguing the need to work with the North Korean government .
It was the first time the nation had seen the influence of the father on the son in office .
But what has been overlooked was Carlyle 's business interest in Korea .
The senior Bush had spearheaded the group 's successful entrance into the South Korean market , paving the way for buyouts of Korea 's KorAm Bank and Mercury , a telecommunications equipment company .
For the business to be successful , stability between North and South Korea is critical .
And though there is no direct evidence linking the senior Bush 's business dealings in Korea with the change in policy , it is the appearance of impropriety that excites the watchdogs .
" We are clearly aware that former President Bush has weighed in on policy toward South Korea and we note that U.S. policy changed after those communications , " says Peter Eisner , managing director at the Center for Public Integrity , a watchdog group in Washington , D.C. , which has an active file on the Carlyle Group .
" We know that former President Bush receives remuneration for his work with Carlyle and that he is capable of advising the current president , but how much further it goes , we do n't know . "
While the Center for Public Integrity looks for its smoking gun , others in Washington say hard evidence is unimportant .
" Whether the decisions made by the former president are a real or apparent conflict of interest does n't matter , because in the public 's eye they 're equally as damaging , " says Larry Noble , executive director and general counsel of the Center for Responsive Politics .
" Bush [ Sr. ] has to seriously consider the propriety of sitting on the board of a group that is impacted by his son's decisions . "
And the controversy is expected only to increase as Carlyle 's investments in Saudi Arabia are scrutinized during the war on terrorism .
Mr. Eisner says that very little is known about Carlyle 's involvements in Saudi Arabia , except that the firm has been making close to $ 50 million a year training the Saudi Arabian National Guard , troops that are sworn to protect the monarchy .
Carlyle also advises the Saudi royal family on the Economic Offset Program , a system that is designed to encourage foreign businesses to open shop in Saudi Arabia and uses re-investment incentives to keep those businesses ' proceeds in the country .
But the money flowing out of Saudi Arabia and into the Carlyle Group is of even more interest .
Immediately after the September 11 attacks , reports surfaced of Carlyle 's involvement with the Saudi Binladin Group , the $ 5 billion construction business run by Osama 's half - brother Bakr .
The bin Laden family invested $ 2 million in the Carlyle Partners II fund , which includes in its portfolio United Defense and other defense and aerospace companies .
On October 26 , the Carlyle Group severed its relationship with the bin Laden family in what officials termed a mutual decision .
Mr. Bush Sr. and Mr. Major have been to Saudi Arabia on behalf of Carlyle as recently as last year , and according to reports , the Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently looking into the flow of money from the bin Laden family .
Carlyle officials declined to answer any questions regarding their activities in Saudi Arabia .
But for all the questions , Carlyle has stayed clean in the eyes of the law .
Lobbying laws in Washington , D.C. , are ambiguous at best , requiring only that former politicians observe a one - year " cooling - off period " before they reėnter the lobbying scene on behalf of industry .
It is playing within this gray area that has given the Carlyle Group some of the best returns in the business .
After David Rubenstein , a former aide in the Carter administration , and William Conway Jr. , former chief financial officer of MCI Communications , hooked up at New York 's Carlyle hotel in 1987 to form the company , the Carlyle Group spent two lost years investing in a hodgepodge of companies .
It was n't until 1989 , when the company brought in Mr. Carlucci , fresh off his two - year stint as U.S. secretary of defense , that Carlyle got serious in government .
In 1991 the company made a name for itself by facilitating a $ 590 million purchase of Citicorp stock for Prince Alwaleed bin Talal .
Shortly thereafter , Carlyle snatched up defense contractors Harsco , BDM International , and LTV , turning the companies around and selling them to the likes of TRW , Boeing , and Lockheed Martin .
The Carlyle Group has diversified its holdings since then , investing in everything from bottling companies to natural - food grocers .
In the process , it has become one of the biggest , most successful private - equity firms in business , with annualized returns of 35 percent .
( Judging by the early numbers from some of their funds , however , like many other private - equity funds , 2001 will be a considerably less profitable year for Carlyle . )
" They are the new breed of private equity , acting more like a large mutual fund of private companies , " says David Snow , editor of PrivateEquityCentral.net , a Web site that tracks private - equity firms .
The numbers are impressive : Carlyle employs 240 people , as opposed to the 10 or 12 typical of most private - equity firms .
It has ownership stakes in 164 companies , which collectively employ more than 70,000 people .
George Soros invested $ 100 million in the group 's funds ; the California Public Employees ' Retirement System is in for $ 305 million .
Carlyle has succeeded by raising money first , then finding the talent to manage it .
For instance , it raised a fund for buying out telecom companies and hired William Kennard , the former U.S. Federal Communications Commission chairman , to run it .
Accused early on of being nothing more than a bunch of Washington grip - and - grinners , Carlyle has proven its critics wrong .
At a Salomon Smith Barney private - equity conference last March , a panel of professional investment managers were asked who the best fund managers are .
Carlyle cofounder Mr. Conway was one of two managers chosen .
With its size and success , questions about the firm 's ability to grow revenue has arisen .
Carlyle has placed its bets for future growth on the VC markets , which it entered in 1996 .
But to date , it has found that venture capital is a game with far different rules than that of corporate buyouts .
" They may be very established in private equity , but it seems to me that they do n't really know the venture capital business , " says one VC who has done deals with Carlyle .
" In buyouts , you take over a company and fight the management , but in venture capital it's the opposite .
You want to work with people . "
Carlyle executives admit as much .
As a result , the Carlyle Europe Venture Partners fund has been slow to commit its capital .
So far , it has spent just more than 20 percent of its $ 660 million , and 3 of its original 17 investments have already folded .
None has gone public or been acquired .
As Jack Biddle , cofounder of Novak Biddle Venture Partners , dryly puts it , " I have n't been involved in a lot of venture deals where the participation of a president mattered that much .
In venture capital , it 's all about the technology . "
For a firm that has made its money in highly regulated , politically charged industries , picking business - to - business plays is hardly second nature .
While Carlyle has investments in highly regulated sectors like telecom and banking , it has avoided defense entirely , instead focusing on tech industries that have already gone flat .
The firm 's European fund alone boasts six B2B companies , two optical - networking companies , and Riot - E , a wireless media play .
Jacques Garaļalde , managing director of the Europe fund concedes that expectations have been shifted .
" Clearly , we can't make 100 times returns on B2B , but there are some situations in which we can make 3 times . "
But the struggles in its VC business may be offset , at least temporarily , by the expected windfall from the war on terrorism .
The federal government has already approved a $ 40 billion supplemental aid package to the current budget , $ 19 billion of which is headed straight to the Pentagon .
Some of the additional government spending is likely to find its way into Carlyle 's coffers .
The Bush administration is n't afraid to mix business and politics , and no other firm embodies that penchant better than the Carlyle Group .
Walking that fine line is what Carlyle does best .
We may not see Osama bin Laden 's brothers at Carlyle 's investor conferences any more , but business will go on as usual for the biggest old boys network around .
As Mr. Snow puts it , " Carlyle will always have to defend itself and will never be able to convince certain people that they are n't capable of forging murky backroom deals .
George Bush 's father does profit when the Carlyle Group profits , but to make the leap that the president would base decisions on that is to say that the president is corrupt . "

Breast - Feeding May Reduce Sleep - Related Breathing Disorders Breast - feeding may protect infants and kids from serious breathing difficulties .
June 12 , 2007  --
Breast - feeding proponents have already extolled the various benefits of keeping babies off the bottle , saying it results not only in more robust immune systems and healthier lungs , but brings anti-obesity advantages .
Now , they may have yet another benefit to brag about -- a lower likelihood of a breast - fed child developing sleep - related breathing disorders , such as sleep apnea and snoring .
Breast - feeding beyond two months also showed promise in reducing the severity of the symptoms seen with certain breathing problems , according to the researchers .
" We saw real benefits in children who were breast - fed up to five months , and some showed results for being breast - fed up to one year , " says lead author Hawley Montgomery - Downs , associate professor of psychology at the University of West Virginia .
In a report released Monday at the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies , 197 parents completed a survey about breast - feeding habits while their children participated in an overnight sleep study .
The University of West Virginia researchers found that children who were breast - fed for at least two months as infants had lower rates of sleep - related breathing disorders .
Of special concern to pediatricians is childhood sleep apnea .
In this condition , infants or children stop breathing while they are asleep , which can lead to disrupted sleep and eventually brain damage .
" Childhood obstructive sleep apnea is a real problem , " says Dr. John Herman , director of the Sleep Disorders Center for Children at Children 's Medical Center in Dallas .
" If it can be avoided , or its odds reduced , it saves some parents the hassle of having to deal with listening to their child snore , telling their pediatrician , having their child go through a sleep study , and probably having upper airway surgery . "
Breathing Benefits
Other children 's health experts not affiliated with the study agree that the findings suggest new mothers may be better off breast - feeding their kids .
" This study alerts parents that breast - feeding should always be considered , both for the short - term and long - term benefits when deciding how to feed your baby , " says Jodi Mindell , associate director of the Sleep Center at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
" It also encourages parents to continue to breast - feed past two months . "
But why does breast - feeding have this effect ?
The researchers say there are two possible explanations for the link between breast - feeding and fewer sleep - related breathing problems in children .
One is that the special components of breast milk give protection against exposure to viruses , which in turn leads to a stronger immune system .
" The other possibility , " says Montgomery - Downs , " is that the actual act of breast - feeding itself -- sucking on a breast -- helps develop better bone structure .
For infants who breast - feed , there 's more space in the upper airway for breathing , especially during sleeping . "
The findings could be far - reaching .
One out of four infants and children experiences sleep - related breathing disorders , from simple snoring to potentially dangerous sleep apnea .
These complications occur when the airway is partially blocked during sleep , due to inflammation or some other obstruction .
Children 's performance in school , behavior and even cognitive development can suffer because of these disorders .
The authors of the study admit that while there is still more research to be done on this topic , the study offers " just one more bit of evidence that breast - feeding is very important , " says Montgomery - Downs .
Home Resources , Concurrency and Local Reasoning Resources , Concurrency and Local Reasoning , Peter O'Hearn , 2007 .
Resource has always been a central concern in concurrent programming .
Often , a number of processes share access to system resources such as memory , processor time , or network bandwidth , and correct resource usage is essential for the overall working of a system .
In the 1960s and 1970s Dijkstra , Hoare and Brinch Hansen attacked the problem of resource control in their basic works on concurrent programming .
In addition to the use of synchronization mechanisms to provide protection from inconsistent use , they stressed the importance of resource separation as a means of controlling the complexity of process interactions and reducing the possibility of time - dependent errors .
This paper revisits their ideas using the formalism of separation logic .
I have to admit that in posting this paper , I was at least slightly motivated by the imp of the perverse -- it 's pretty much a commonplace among expert programmers that reasoning about programs that use shared memory , explicit mutual exclusion , and concurrency is very difficult .
So the urge to post a paper showing one approach for doing it in a clean ( and imo quite beautiful ) way was irresistible .

The recent suicide of a Japanese minister highlighted the issue
The government in Tokyo said it is the first time a comprehensive plan has been agreed to try to reduce the number of people who kill themselves .
Japan 's suicide rate is one of the highest in the industrialised world ; more than twice the rate of the US and second only to Russia's .
More than 30,000 have killed themselves each year for the last nine years .
That is roughly 24 people out of every 100,000 in the country .
Experts blame a number of factors .
Japanese companies and schools are often run without much flexibility ; and non-conformity is not tolerated - for those who fail there is often no second chance .
GOVERNMENT AIMS
Cut suicides by 20 % before 2016 Boost workplace counselling Filter websites promoting suicide Tackle unemployment
The samurai custom of taking one 's life is sometimes given as a reason for modern suicides .
Others kill themselves to protect loved ones from embarrassment or to save face .
And the lack of religious taboos against suicide are also , no doubt , a factor .
With so many ingredients at work , though , it is hard to find effective measures to reduce the number of suicides in Japan .
In the past politicians have been accused of not trying at all .
Now , though , the government has set itself a target of reducing the suicide rate by more than 20 % over the next 10 years .
It plans to try to block access to websites which promote mass suicides , to offer better mental health counselling in the workplace and to organise public campaigns to raise awareness of the problem .
But it will not be easy .
The problem was again highlighted last month when the agriculture minister killed himself .
Although the latest figures show a slight fall in the overall numbers of suicides in Japan , the number of young people killing themselves rose sharply - up by 23 % .
The Humble Programmer
by
Edsger W. Dijkstra
As a result of a long sequence of coincidences I entered the programming profession officially on the first spring morning of 1952 and as far as I have been able to trace , I was the first Dutchman to do so in my country .
In retrospect the most amazing thing was the slowness with which , at least in my part of the world , the programming profession emerged , a slowness which is now hard to believe .
But I am grateful for two vivid recollections from that period that establish that slowness beyond any doubt .
After having programmed for some three years , I had a discussion with A. van Wijngaarden , who was then my boss at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam , a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live .
The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously , and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine , I had to make up my mind , either to stop programming and become a real , respectable theoretical physicist , or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only , with a minimum of effort , and to become ..... , yes what ?
A programmer ?
But was that a respectable profession ?
For after all , what was programming ?
Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline ?
I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues , who , when asked about their professional competence , could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes , amplifiers and the rest , whereas I felt that , when faced with that question , I would stand empty - handed .
Full of misgivings I knocked on van Wijngaarden ’s office door , asking him whether I could “ speak to him for a moment ” ; when I left his office a number of hours later , I was another person .
For after having listened to my problems patiently , he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline , but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay , that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come ?
This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could .
One moral of the above story is , of course , that we must be very careful when we give advice to younger people ; sometimes they follow it !
Another two years later , in 1957 , I married and Dutch marriage rites require you to state your profession and I stated that I was a programmer .
But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession .
And , believe it or not , but under the heading “ profession ” my marriage act shows the ridiculous entry “ theoretical physicist ” !
So much for the slowness with which I saw the programming profession emerge in my own country .
Since then I have seen more of the world , and it is my general impression that in other countries , apart from a possible shift of dates , the growth pattern has been very much the same .
Let me try to capture the situation in those old days in a little bit more detail , in the hope of getting a better understanding of the situation today .
While we pursue our analysis , we shall see how many common misunderstandings about the true nature of the programming task can be traced back to that now distant past .
The first automatic electronic computers were all unique , single - copy machines and they were all to be found in an environment with the exciting flavour of an experimental laboratory .
Once the vision of the automatic computer was there , its realisation was a tremendous challenge to the electronic technology then available , and one thing is certain : we cannot deny the courage of the groups that decided to try and build such a fantastic piece of equipment .
For fantastic pieces of equipment they were : in retrospect one can only wonder that those first machines worked at all , at least sometimes .
The overwhelming problem was to get and keep the machine in working order .
The preoccupation with the physical aspects of automatic computing is still reflected in the names of the older scientific societies in the field , such as the Association for Computing Machinery or the British Computer Society , names in which explicit reference is made to the physical equipment .
What about the poor programmer ?
Well , to tell the honest truth : he was hardly noticed .
For one thing , the first machines were so bulky that you could hardly move them and besides that , they required such extensive maintenance that it was quite natural that the place where people tried to use the machine was the same laboratory where the machine had been developed .
Secondly , his somewhat invisible work was without any glamour : you could show the machine to visitors and that was several orders of magnitude more spectacular than some sheets of coding .
But most important of all , the programmer himself had a very modest view of his own work : his work derived all its significance from the existence of that wonderful machine .
Because that was a unique machine , he knew only too well that his programs had only local significance and also , because it was patently obvious that this machine would have a limited lifetime , he knew that very little of his work would have a lasting value .
Finally , there is yet another circumstance that had a profound influence on the programmer ’s attitude to his work : on the one hand , besides being unreliable , his machine was usually too slow and its memory was usually too small , i.e . he was faced with a pinching shoe , while on the other hand its usually somewhat queer order code would cater for the most unexpected constructions .
And in those days many a clever programmer derived an immense intellectual satisfaction from the cunning tricks by means of which he contrived to squeeze the impossible into the constraints of his equipment .
Two opinions about programming date from those days .
I mention them now , I shall return to them later .
The one opinion was that a really competent programmer should be puzzle - minded and very fond of clever tricks ; the other opinion was that programming was nothing more than optimizing the efficiency of the computational process , in one direction or the other .
The latter opinion was the result of the frequent circumstance that , indeed , the available equipment was a painfully pinching shoe , and in those days one often encountered the naive expectation that , once more powerful machines were available , programming would no longer be a problem , for then the struggle to push the machine to its limits would no longer be necessary and that was all what programming was about , was n’t it ?
But in the next decades something completely different happened : more powerful machines became available , not just an order of magnitude more powerful , even several orders of magnitude more powerful .
But instead of finding ourselves in the state of eternal bliss of all programming problems solved , we found ourselves up to our necks in the software crisis !
How come ?
There is a minor cause : in one or two respects modern machinery is basically more difficult to handle than the old machinery .
Firstly , we have got the I/O interrupts , occurring at unpredictable and irreproducible moments ; compared with the old sequential machine that pretended to be a fully deterministic automaton , this has been a dramatic change and many a systems programmer ’s grey hair bears witness to the fact that we should not talk lightly about the logical problems created by that feature .
Secondly , we have got machines equipped with multi- level stores , presenting us problems of management strategy that , in spite of the extensive literature on the subject , still remain rather elusive .
So much for the added complication due to structural changes of the actual machines .
But I called this a minor cause ; the major cause is ... that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful !
To put it quite bluntly : as long as there were no machines , programming was no problem at all ; when we had a few weak computers , programming became a mild problem , and now we have gigantic computers , programming had become an equally gigantic problem .
In this sense the electronic industry has not solved a single problem , it has only created them , it has created the problem of using its products .
To put it in another way : as the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a thousand , society ’s ambition to apply these machines grew in proportion , and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of tension between ends and means .
The increased power of the hardware , together with the perhaps even more dramatic increase in its reliability , made solutions feasible that the programmer had not dared to dream about a few years before .
And now , a few years later , he had to dream about them and , even worse , he had to transform such dreams into reality !
Is it a wonder that we found ourselves in a software crisis ?
No , certainly not , and as you may guess , it was even predicted well in advance ; but the trouble with minor prophets , of course , is that it is only five years later that you really know that they had been right .
Then , in the mid-sixties , something terrible happened : the computers of the so - called third generation made their appearance .
The official literature tells us that their price / performance ratio has been one of the major design objectives .
But if you take as “ performance ” the duty cycle of the machine ’s various components , little will prevent you from ending up with a design in which the major part of your performance goal is reached by internal housekeeping activities of doubtful necessity .
And if your definition of price is the price to be paid for the hardware , little will prevent you from ending up with a design that is terribly hard to program for : for instance the order code might be such as to enforce , either upon the programmer or upon the system , early binding decisions presenting conflicts that really cannot be resolved .
And to a large extent these unpleasant possibilities seem to have become reality .
When these machines were announced and their functional specifications became known , quite a few among us must have become quite miserable ; at least I was .
It was only reasonable to expect that such machines would flood the computing community , and it was therefore all the more important that their design should be as sound as possible .
But the design embodied such serious flaws that I felt that with a single stroke the progress of computing science had been retarded by at least ten years : it was then that I had the blackest week in the whole of my professional life .
Perhaps the most saddening thing now is that , even after all those years of frustrating experience , still so many people honestly believe that some law of nature tells us that machines have to be that way .
They silence their doubts by observing how many of these machines have been sold , and derive from that observation the false sense of security that , after all , the design cannot have been that bad .
But upon closer inspection , that line of defense has the same convincing strength as the argument that cigarette smoking must be healthy because so many people do it .
It is in this connection that I regret that it is not customary for scientific journals in the computing area to publish reviews of newly announced computers in much the same way as we review scientific publications : to review machines would be at least as important .
And here I have a confession to make : in the early sixties I wrote such a review with the intention of submitting it to the CACM , but in spite of the fact that the few colleagues to whom the text was sent for their advice , urged me all to do so , I did not dare to do it , fearing that the difficulties either for myself or for the editorial board would prove to be too great .
This suppression was an act of cowardice on my side for which I blame myself more and more .
The difficulties I foresaw were a consequence of the absence of generally accepted criteria , and although I was convinced of the validity of the criteria I had chosen to apply , I feared that my review would be refused or discarded as “ a matter of personal taste ” .
I still think that such reviews would be extremely useful and I am longing to see them appear , for their accepted appearance would be a sure sign of maturity of the computing community .
The reason that I have paid the above attention to the hardware scene is because I have the feeling that one of the most important aspects of any computing tool is its influence on the thinking habits of those that try to use it , and because I have reasons to believe that that influence is many times stronger than is commonly assumed .
Let us now switch our attention to the software scene .
Here the diversity has been so large that I must confine myself to a few stepping stones .
I am painfully aware of the arbitrariness of my choice and I beg you not to draw any conclusions with regard to my appreciation of the many efforts that will remain unmentioned .
In the beginning there was the EDSAC in Cambridge , England , and I think it quite impressive that right from the start the notion of a subroutine library played a central role in the design of that machine and of the way in which it should be used .
It is now nearly 25 years later and the computing scene has changed dramatically , but the notion of basic software is still with us , and the notion of the closed subroutine is still one of the key concepts in programming .
We should recognise the closed subroutines as one of the greatest software inventions ; it has survived three generations of computers and it will survive a few more , because it caters for the implementation of one of our basic patterns of abstraction .
Regrettably enough , its importance has been underestimated in the design of the third generation computers , in which the great number of explicitly named registers of the arithmetic unit implies a large overhead on the subroutine mechanism .
But even that did not kill the concept of the subroutine , and we can only pray that the mutation wo n’t prove to be hereditary .
The second major development on the software scene that I would like to mention is the birth of FORTRAN .
At that time this was a project of great temerity and the people responsible for it deserve our great admiration .
It would be absolutely unfair to blame them for shortcomings that only became apparent after a decade or so of extensive usage : groups with a successful look - ahead of ten years are quite rare !
In retrospect we must rate FORTRAN as a successful coding technique , but with very few effective aids to conception , aids which are now so urgently needed that time has come to consider it out of date .
The sooner we can forget that FORTRAN has ever existed , the better , for as a vehicle of thought it is no longer adequate : it wastes our brainpower , is too risky and therefore too expensive to use .
FORTRAN ’s tragic fate has been its wide acceptance , mentally chaining thousands and thousands of programmers to our past mistakes .
I pray daily that more of my fellow - programmers may find the means of freeing themselves from the curse of compatibility .
The third project I would not like to leave unmentioned is LISP , a fascinating enterprise of a completely different nature .
With a few very basic principles at its foundation , it has shown a remarkable stability .
Besides that , LISP has been the carrier for a considerable number of in a sense our most sophisticated computer applications .
LISP has jokingly been described as “ the most intelligent way to misuse a computer ” .
I think that description a great compliment because it transmits the full flavour of liberation : it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts .
The fourth project to be mentioned is ALGOL 60 .
While up to the present day FORTRAN programmers still tend to understand their programming language in terms of the specific implementation they are working with — hence the prevalence of octal and hexadecimal dumps — , while the definition of LISP is still a curious mixture of what the language means and how the mechanism works , the famous Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 is the fruit of a genuine effort to carry abstraction a vital step further and to define a programming language in an implementation - independent way .
One could argue that in this respect its authors have been so successful that they have created serious doubts as to whether it could be implemented at all !
The report gloriously demonstrated the power of the formal method BNF , now fairly known as Backus - Naur - Form , and the power of carefully phrased English , a least when used by someone as brilliant as Peter Naur .
I think that it is fair to say that only very few documents as short as this have had an equally profound influence on the computing community .
The ease with which in later years the names ALGOL and ALGOL - like have been used , as an unprotected trade mark , to lend some of its glory to a number of sometimes hardly related younger projects , is a somewhat shocking compliment to its standing .
The strength of BNF as a defining device is responsible for what I regard as one of the weaknesses of the language : an over - elaborate and not too systematic syntax could now be crammed into the confines of very few pages .
With a device as powerful as BNF , the Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 should have been much shorter .
Besides that I am getting very doubtful about ALGOL 60 ’s parameter mechanism : it allows the programmer so much combinatorial freedom , that its confident use requires a strong discipline from the programmer .
Besides expensive to implement it seems dangerous to use .
Finally , although the subject is not a pleasant one , I must mention PL/ 1 , a programming language for which the defining documentation is of a frightening size and complexity .
Using PL / 1 must be like flying a plane with 7000 buttons , switches and handles to manipulate in the cockpit .
I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language — our basic tool , mind you !— already escapes our intellectual control .
And if I have to describe the influence PL / 1 can have on its users , the closest metaphor that comes to my mind is that of a drug .
I remember from a symposium on higher level programming language a lecture given in defense of PL / 1 by a man who described himself as one of its devoted users .
But within a one - hour lecture in praise of PL / 1 .
he managed to ask for the addition of about fifty new “ features ” , little supposing that the main source of his problems could very well be that it contained already far too many “ features ” .
The speaker displayed all the depressing symptoms of addiction , reduced as he was to the state of mental stagnation in which he could only ask for more , more , more ...
When FORTRAN has been called an infantile disorder , full PL/ 1 , with its growth characteristics of a dangerous tumor , could turn out to be a fatal disease .
So much for the past .
But there is no point in making mistakes unless thereafter we are able to learn from them .
As a matter of fact , I think that we have learned so much , that within a few years programming can be an activity vastly different from what it has been up till now , so different that we had better prepare ourselves for the shock .
Let me sketch for you one of the possible futures .
At first sight , this vision of programming in perhaps already the near future may strike you as utterly fantastic .
Let me therefore also add the considerations that might lead one to the conclusion that this vision could be a very real possibility .
The vision is that , well before the seventies have run to completion , we shall be able to design and implement the kind of systems that are now straining our programming ability , at the expense of only a few percent in man-years of what they cost us now , and that besides that , these systems will be virtually free of bugs .
These two improvements go hand in hand .
In the latter respect software seems to be different from many other products , where as a rule a higher quality implies a higher price .
Those who want really reliable software will discover that they must find means of avoiding the majority of bugs to start with , and as a result the programming process will become cheaper .
If you want more effective programmers , you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging , they should not introduce the bugs to start with .
In other words : both goals point to the same change .
Such a drastic change in such a short period of time would be a revolution , and to all persons that base their expectations for the future on smooth extrapolation of the recent past — appealing to some unwritten laws of social and cultural inertia — the chance that this drastic change will take place must seem negligible .
But we all know that sometimes revolutions do take place !
And what are the chances for this one ?
There seem to be three major conditions that must be fulfilled .
The world at large must recognize the need for the change ; secondly the economic need for it must be sufficiently strong ; and , thirdly , the change must be technically feasible .
Let me discuss these three conditions in the above order .
With respect to the recognition of the need for greater reliability of software , I expect no disagreement anymore .
Only a few years ago this was different : to talk about a software crisis was blasphemy .
The turning point was the Conference on Software Engineering in Garmisch , October 1968 , a conference that created a sensation as there occurred the first open admission of the software crisis .
And by now it is generally recognized that the design of any large sophisticated system is going to be a very difficult job , and whenever one meets people responsible for such undertakings , one finds them very much concerned about the reliability issue , and rightly so .
In short , our first condition seems to be satisfied .
Now for the economic need .
Nowadays one often encounters the opinion that in the sixties programming has been an overpaid profession , and that in the coming years programmer salaries may be expected to go down .
Usually this opinion is expressed in connection with the recession , but it could be a symptom of something different and quite healthy , viz .
that perhaps the programmers of the past decade have not done so good a job as they should have done .
Society is getting dissatisfied with the performance of programmers and of their products .
But there is another factor of much greater weight .
In the present situation it is quite usual that for a specific system , the price to be paid for the development of the software is of the same order of magnitude as the price of the hardware needed , and society more or less accepts that .
But hardware manufacturers tell us that in the next decade hardware prices can be expected to drop with a factor of ten .
If software development were to continue to be the same clumsy and expensive process as it is now , things would get completely out of balance .
You can not expect society to accept this , and therefore we must learn to program an order of magnitude more effectively .
To put it in another way : as long as machines were the largest item on the budget , the programming profession could get away with its clumsy techniques , but that umbrella will fold rapidly .
In short , also our second condition seems to be satisfied .
And now the third condition : is it technically feasible ?
I think it might and I shall give you six arguments in support of that opinion .
A study of program structure had revealed that programs — even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content — can differ tremendously in their intellectual manageability .
A number of rules have been discovered , violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the intellectual manageability of the program .
These rules are of two kinds .
Those of the first kind are easily imposed mechanically , viz .
by a suitably chosen programming language .
Examples are the exclusion of goto - statements and of procedures with more than one output parameter .
For those of the second kind I at least — but that may be due to lack of competence on my side — see no way of imposing them mechanically , as it seems to need some sort of automatic theorem prover for which I have no existence proof .
Therefore , for the time being and perhaps forever , the rules of the second kind present themselves as elements of discipline required from the programmer .
Some of the rules I have in mind are so clear that they can be taught and that there never needs to be an argument as to whether a given program violates them or not .
Examples are the requirements that no loop should be written down without providing a proof for termination nor without stating the relation whose invariance will not be destroyed by the execution of the repeatable statement .
I now suggest that we confine ourselves to the design and implementation of intellectually manageable programs .
If someone fears that this restriction is so severe that we cannot live with it , I can reassure him : the class of intellectually manageable programs is still sufficiently rich to contain many very realistic programs for any problem capable of algorithmic solution .
We must not forget that it is not our business to make programs , it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour .
The suggestion of confining ourselves to intellectually manageable programs is the basis for the first two of my announced six arguments .
Argument one is that , as the programmer only needs to consider intellectually manageable programs , the alternatives he is choosing between are much , much easier to cope with .
Argument two is that , as soon as we have decided to restrict ourselves to the subset of the intellectually manageable programs , we have achieved , once and for all , a drastic reduction of the solution space to be considered .
And this argument is distinct from argument one .
Argument three is based on the constructive approach to the problem of program correctness .
Today a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it .
But : program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs , but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence .
The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness .
But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness , because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer ’s burden .
On the contrary : the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in hand .
Argument three is essentially based on the following observation .
If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and , having found this , then constructs a program satisfying this proof ’s requirements , then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance .
By definition this approach is only applicable when we restrict ourselves to intellectually manageable programs , but it provides us with effective means for finding a satisfactory one among these .
Argument four has to do with the way in which the amount of intellectual effort needed to design a program depends on the program length .
It has been suggested that there is some kind of law of nature telling us that the amount of intellectual effort needed grows with the square of program length .
But , thank goodness , no one has been able to prove this law .
And this is because it need not be true .
We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “ abstraction ” ; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer .
In this connection it might be worth - while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague , but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise .
Of course I have tried to find a fundamental cause that would prevent our abstraction mechanisms from being sufficiently effective .
But no matter how hard I tried , I did not find such a cause .
As a result I tend to the assumption — up till now not disproved by experience — that by suitable application of our powers of abstraction , the intellectual effort needed to conceive or to understand a program need not grow more than proportional to program length .
But a by - product of these investigations may be of much greater practical significance , and is , in fact , the basis of my fourth argument .
The by - product was the identification of a number of patterns of abstraction that play a vital role in the whole process of composing programs .
Enough is now known about these patterns of abstraction that you could devote a lecture to about each of them .
What the familiarity and conscious knowledge of these patterns of abstraction imply dawned upon me when I realized that , had they been common knowledge fifteen years ago , the step from BNF to syntax - directed compilers , for instance , could have taken a few minutes instead of a few years .
Therefore I present our recent knowledge of vital abstraction patterns as the fourth argument .
Now for the fifth argument .
It has to do with the influence of the tool we are trying to use upon our own thinking habits .
I observe a cultural tradition , which in all probability has its roots in the Renaissance , to ignore this influence , to regard the human mind as the supreme and autonomous master of its artefacts .
But if I start to analyse the thinking habits of myself and of my fellow human beings , I come , whether I like it or not , to a completely different conclusion , viz .
that the tools we are trying to use and the language or notation we are using to express or record our thoughts , are the major factors determining what we can think or express at all !
The analysis of the influence that programming languages have on the thinking habits of its users , and the recognition that , by now , brainpower is by far our scarcest resource , they together give us a new collection of yardsticks for comparing the relative merits of various programming languages .
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull ; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility , and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague .
In the case of a well - known conversational programming language I have been told from various sides that as soon as a programming community is equipped with a terminal for it , a specific phenomenon occurs that even has a well - established name : it is called “ the one - liners ” .
It takes one of two different forms : one programmer places a one - line program on the desk of another and either he proudly tells what it does and adds the question “ Can you code this in less symbols ? ” — as if this were of any conceptual relevance !— or he just asks “ Guess what it does ! ” .
From this observation we must conclude that this language as a tool is an open invitation for clever tricks ; and while exactly this may be the explanation for some of its appeal , viz .
to those who like to show how clever they are , I am sorry , but I must regard this as one of the most damning things that can be said about a programming language .
Another lesson we should have learned from the recent past is that the development of “ richer ” or “ more powerful ” programming languages was a mistake in the sense that these baroque monstrosities , these conglomerations of idiosyncrasies , are really unmanageable , both mechanically and mentally .
I see a great future for very systematic and very modest programming languages .
When I say “ modest ” , I mean that , for instance , not only ALGOL 60’s “ for clause ” , but even FORTRAN ’s “ DO loop ” may find themselves thrown out as being too baroque .
I have run a a little programming experiment with really experienced volunteers , but something quite unintended and quite unexpected turned up .
None of my volunteers found the obvious and most elegant solution .
Upon closer analysis this turned out to have a common source : their notion of repetition was so tightly connected to the idea of an associated controlled variable to be stepped up , that they were mentally blocked from seeing the obvious .
Their solutions were less efficient , needlessly hard to understand , and it took them a very long time to find them .
It was a revealing , but also shocking experience for me .
Finally , in one respect one hopes that tomorrow ’s programming languages will differ greatly from what we are used to now : to a much greater extent than hitherto they should invite us to reflect in the structure of what we write down all abstractions needed to cope conceptually with the complexity of what we are designing .
So much for the greater adequacy of our future tools , which was the basis of the fifth argument .
As an aside I would like to insert a warning to those who identify the difficulty of the programming task with the struggle against the inadequacies of our current tools , because they might conclude that , once our tools will be much more adequate , programming will no longer be a problem .
Programming will remain very difficult , because once we have freed ourselves from the circumstantial cumbersomeness , we will find ourselves free to tackle the problems that are now well beyond our programming capacity .
You can quarrel with my sixth argument , for it is not so easy to collect experimental evidence for its support , a fact that will not prevent me from believing in its validity .
Up till now I have not mentioned the word “ hierarchy ” , but I think that it is fair to say that this is a key concept for all systems embodying a nicely factored solution .
I could even go one step further and make an article of faith out of it , viz .
that the only problems we can really solve in a satisfactory manner are those that finally admit a nicely factored solution .
At first sight this view of human limitations may strike you as a rather depressing view of our predicament , but I do n’t feel it that way , on the contrary !
The best way to learn to live with our limitations is to know them .
By the time that we are sufficiently modest to try factored solutions only , because the other efforts escape our intellectual grip , we shall do our utmost best to avoid all those interfaces impairing our ability to factor the system in a helpful way .
And I cannot but expect that this will repeatedly lead to the discovery that an initially untractable problem can be factored after all .
Anyone who has seen how the majority of the troubles of the compiling phase called “ code generation ” can be tracked down to funny properties of the order code , will know a simple example of the kind of things I have in mind .
The wider applicability of nicely factored solutions is my sixth and last argument for the technical feasibility of the revolution that might take place in the current decade .
In principle I leave it to you to decide for yourself how much weight you are going to give to my considerations , knowing only too well that I can force no one else to share my beliefs .
As each serious revolution , it will provoke violent opposition and one can ask oneself where to expect the conservative forces trying to counteract such a development .
I do n’t expect them primarily in big business , not even in the computer business ; I expect them rather in the educational institutions that provide today ’s training and in those conservative groups of computer users that think their old programs so important that they do n’t think it worth - while to rewrite and improve them .
In this connection it is sad to observe that on many a university campus the choice of the central computing facility has too often been determined by the demands of a few established but expensive applications with a disregard of the question how many thousands of “ small users ” that are willing to write their own programs were going to suffer from this choice .
Too often , for instance , high - energy physics seems to have blackmailed the scientific community with the price of its remaining experimental equipment .
The easiest answer , of course , is a flat denial of the technical feasibility , but I am afraid that you need pretty strong arguments for that .
No reassurance , alas , can be obtained from the remark that the intellectual ceiling of today ’s average programmer will prevent the revolution from taking place : with others programming so much more effectively , he is liable to be edged out of the picture anyway .
There may also be political impediments .
Even if we know how to educate tomorrow ’s professional programmer , it is not certain that the society we are living in will allow us to do so .
The first effect of teaching a methodology — rather than disseminating knowledge — is that of enhancing the capacities of the already capable , thus magnifying the difference in intelligence .
In a society in which the educational system is used as an instrument for the establishment of a homogenized culture , in which the cream is prevented from rising to the top , the education of competent programmers could be politically impalatable .
Let me conclude .
Automatic computers have now been with us for a quarter of a century .
They have had a great impact on our society in their capacity of tools , but in that capacity their influence will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture , compared with the much more profound influence they will have in their capacity of intellectual challenge without precedent in the cultural history of mankind .
Hierarchical systems seem to have the property that something considered as an undivided entity on one level , is considered as a composite object on the next lower level of greater detail ; as a result the natural grain of space or time that is applicable at each level decreases by an order of magnitude when we shift our attention from one level to the next lower one .
We understand walls in terms of bricks , bricks in terms of crystals , crystals in terms of molecules etc .
As a result the number of levels that can be distinguished meaningfully in a hierarchical system is kind of proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between the largest and the smallest grain , and therefore , unless this ratio is very large , we can not expect many levels .
In computer programming our basic building block has an associated time grain of less than a microsecond , but our program may take hours of computation time .
I do not know of any other technology covering a ratio of 1010 or more : the computer , by virtue of its fantastic speed , seems to be the first to provide us with an environment where highly hierarchical artefacts are both possible and necessary .
This challenge , viz .
the confrontation with the programming task , is so unique that this novel experience can teach us a lot about ourselves .
It should deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation , it should give us better control over the task of organizing our thoughts .
If it did not do so , to my taste we should not deserve the computer at all !
It has already taught us a few lessons , and the one I have chosen to stress in this talk is the following .
We shall do a much better programming job , provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty , provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages , provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers .

NORTHEASTERN STATION , Russia ( Reuters ) - When Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev died and the Communist propaganda machine organized a mass outpouring of grief , Sergei Zimov hardly noticed .
Scientist Sergei Zimov takes a sample of ground taken from a layer of melting permafrost on the Duvanny Yar cliff , some 75 miles from the town of Chersky , in northeast Siberia , August 28 , 2007 .
Back in November 1982 , the young scientist was roaming around local shops and warehouses looking for the nails he needed to finish building a scientific research station high above the Arctic Circle that he had founded two years earlier .

Back in November 1982 , the young scientist was roaming around local shops and warehouses looking for the nails he needed to finish building a scientific research station high above the Arctic Circle that he had founded two years earlier .
“ I wanted to deal with pure science , and I was a dissident , critical of communist ideas , ” says Zimov , now a bearded 52 - year - old with a mane of wavy hair , at his research station in the desolate tundra eight time zones from Moscow .
“ So this was just the place to be then .
And it still is .
My soul is at peace here , ” said Zimov .
Here , temperatures fall as low as minus 50 Celsius ( - 58 Fahrenheit ) , and in winter it is dark day and night for four months .
Mikhail Gorbachev ’s tumultuous perestroika , bloody interethnic conflicts , the Soviet Union ’s demise and two Chechen wars were barely noticed by Zimov ’s outpost , one of just a handful of similar Arctic stations .
But even out here , the station was not immune from the economic trials that afflicted Russia in the 1990s after the collapse of Soviet rule .
“ We had to survive on just a few roubles a day back then , and there were fears the Russian Academy of Sciences could close us , ” Zimov recalls .
“ Fish was our only salvation . ”
Fish and moose are still the staples of the station , which looks out over the steep - sided Kolyma river .
Zimov ’s Northeastern station is unusual in the world of polar research because it is manned all year round and the scientists live with their families .
Zimov and his wife Galina brought up their family here .
His fellow scientist Sergei Davydov lives with his wife , Anna .
Galina and Anna tend the station ’s treasured greenhouses , where in the short Arctic summer they grow onions , lettuce and tomatoes to supplement their diet .
PRACTICAL MEN
The climate change research conducted here has won international recognition , but Zimov and Davydov are not academics with their heads in the clouds .
If they were , they might not have survived in this harsh environment .
Both think nothing of walking dozens of kilometers ( miles ) through the swampy tundra .
They drive the station ’s vehicles including a speed boat , an SUV , and a converted armored personnel carrier to tackle the roughest terrain .
They also pilot the station ’s seaplane .
Zimov has developed a philosophy for life which allows him to live in this empty region twice the size of Holland , but which has a population of just a few thousand .
At the station , a cluster of two - storey wooden buildings including accommodation and a laboratory , the doors are never locked .
And if Zimov ’s vehicle is stuck in the mud , he leaves the key in the ignition and makes his own way home .
He once left a car in the taiga 900 km ( 560 miles ) away from the station and returned two years later to find it untouched .
“ You must trust people , ” says Zimov , proud of being friends with local wheeler - dealers , secret policemen , hunters , fishermen and reindeer breeders alike .
“ In Moscow , you have metal doors and locks and every third person looks like a security guard .
What great disrespect for other people ! ”
The station is heated with wood chopped in the forest .
Visitors - who include a steady stream of researchers from around the world - are struck by the special atmosphere .
“ I ’ve never been in a place where every day , at every meal , science was sincerely argued , not out of intellectualism , but because people really wanted to know the truth , ” says Adam Wolf , a scientist at the Carnegie Institution , Stanford University .
When it is too cold to conduct field work , the scientists work in the station ’s library , work on research papers or travel to attend scientific conferences .
Some local people have a different technique for passing the time .
“ Two great drinking bouts , and the winter is over , ” jokes fisherman Alexei Nalyotov .
The research station is Zimov ’s life ’s work .
It is also a family affair .
His son Nikita grew up here , then went off to university in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk .
A trained mathematician , he is back at the station helping his father with calculations and equations for his work tracking climate change .
Now there is a third generation : two months ago Nikita and his wife Nastya had a baby girl , Katya , and they plan that she too will grow up in this unique outpost .
July 10 , 2007 — jao
I do n’t know whether Monty Python ever wrote a gag on programming languages , but if they did , this Erlang video must be it .
The funniest thing is that it is pretty serious , and does a great job showing one of my most cherished abilities when using dynamic languages , namely , adding new functionality to a running system on the fly .
As for the Monty Python bit , well , you have to see the to know what i mean : i kept laughing out loud during most of its twelve minutes ( those Ericsson engineers seem to be taken from The Larch , but then maybe it ’s just my sense of humor ) .
Update : Mike , one of the engineers in the film , has been kind enough to post a comment about the experience , which I ’m reproducing here for your convenience :
We gave a well received “ demo ” in 1990 , conjunction with ISS90 , a big telecoms conference in Stockholm .
We made this movie to record the demo .
We actually used a professional company to do the filming , but I wo n’t mention their names as they would probably sue me for libel .
The worse of it all , is that we were deadly serious at the time .
The Monty Python aspect must be due to our backgrounds .
Of the people involved , Joe is English , Robert is Swedish – but brought up in Australia , Bjarne is also Swedish but spend some formative years in Scotland and I ’m half Welsh half Scottish with some Irish thrown in somewhere .
In 1990 , when we made the movie , the very idea of using anything other than C , Plex , assembly language etc to design embedded concurrent systems was heresy , we expected to take the world by storm .
It seems that the cheap communication and multi core processors are giving Erlang a boost 16 years later .
Well at least in the intervening time we have tested the hell out of Erlang and its implementations !
/ mike PS .
If you look carefully at the film , you can see that Erlang at that time had a Prolog like syntax .
PPS .
I ca n’t watch the movie without laughing ( at ) myself
While we ’re at it , let me mention that i like many a thing of Erlang .
It ’s a curious mix of good stuff : a simple syntax and kind of minimalist flavor that reminds of Scheme , pattern matching and functional variables like Haskell ’s , and what amounts to a programming paradigm of its own based on mailboxes and processes ( which , as you surely know , are amazingly cheap ) .
Also worth mentioning is Erlang ’s error handling philosophy , which is , at first sight , a bit startling ( i’m not still sure if it makes perfect sense , but after playing with the language a bit , it looks like it does –this is an interesting post on those matters ) .
Definitely worth a look : see for instance Joe Armstrong ‘s thesis , or , if you have some bucks to spare , the forthcoming Programming Erlang .
The capacity to resist peer pressure in early adolescence may depend on the strength of connections between certain areas of the brain , according to a study carried out by University of Nottingham researchers .
New findings suggest that enhanced connections across brain regions involved in decision - making may underlie an individual 's ability to resist the influence of peers .
The study , published in the July 25 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience , suggests that brain regions which regulate different aspects of behaviour are more interconnected in children with high resistance to peer influence .
Professor Tomas Paus and colleagues at The University of Nottingham used functional neuroimaging to scan adolescents while they watched video clips of neutral or angry hand and face movements .
Previous research has shown that anger is the most easily recognised emotion .
Professor Paus and his team observed 35 ten - year - olds with high and low resistance to peer influence , measured by a questionnaire .
The researchers then showed the children video clips of angry hand movements and angry faces and measured their brain activity .
They found that the brains of all children showed activity in regions important for planning and extracting information about social cues from movement , but the connectivity within these regions was stronger in children who were marked as less vulnerable to peer influence .
Those children were also found to have more activity in the prefrontal cortex , an area important for decision - making and inhibition of unwanted behaviour .
Professor Paus said : “ This is important if we are to understand how the adolescent brain attains the right balance between acknowledging the influences of others and maintaining one 's independence . ”
Future research will involve follow - ups with the same children to determine whether their resistance to peer influence is related to the brain changes observed in this study .
The work was a supported by grants from the Santa Fe Institute Consortium and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .

How the White House Drowned New Orleans
by Greg Palast
The charge is devastating : That , on August 29 , 2005 ,
the White House withheld from the state police the information that New Orleans was about to flood .
From almost any other source , I would not have believed it .
But this was not just any source .
The whistle - blower is Dr. Ivor van Heerden , deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center , the chief technician advising the state on saving lives during Katrina .
I ’d come to van Heerden about another matter , but in our talks , it was clear he had something he wanted to say , and it was a big one .
He charged that the White House , FEMA and the Army Corp hid , for critical hours , their discovery that the levees surrounding New Orleans were cracking , about to burst and drown the city .

The Ethics of Benefiting From Policies that You Oppose :
David 's post on Robert Bork 's effort to take advantage of aspects of the tort system that he has condemned in the past , raises a more general issue : when , if ever , is it ethical to take advantage of the benefits of policies you oppose ?
Public figures on both the left and the right are constantly accused of hypocrisy whenever they benefit from policies that they criticize .
Consider the attacks on Al Gore 's extravagant energy use ( indulging in practices that he claims should be curtailed to fight global warming ) or the ongoing criticism of Clarence Thomas for opposing affirmative action even though he himself probably benefited from it .
Going back in history , many of the Founding Fathers ( including Thomas Jefferson , George Washington , and George Mason ) owned slaves , even though they recognized that slavery was an evil .
Even we bloggers are not immune to the problem .
For example , I oppose the deductibility of state income taxes from federal income taxes ; high - tax states should not be subsidized by the rest of the country .
Yet , every year , I deduct my state income taxes on my Form 1040 , and save several hundred dollars as a result .
Which of these cases are defensible and which are not ?
There is no easy answer , but let me suggest a helpful way of thinking about the problem .
Some policies are wrong in an absolute sense : every individual instance of the practice they promote is an evil .
Even if no one else owned slaves , Thomas Jefferson 's owning some was a grave evil .
In cases of this kind , it is indeed wrong to take advantage of practices that you oppose .
Even if Jefferson lacked the political leverage necessary to get slavery abolished throughout the country , his failure to free his own slaves was a serious injustice in and of itself .
Some actions , however , are only wrong because of their aggregate effects .
An individual instance of deducting state income taxes or burning oil does little if any harm .
It is only the aggregate impact of these practices that does damage .
Thus , no good would be achieved by my deciding to forego my income tax deduction .
Only an across - the - board policy change would do any real good .
The same goes for Al Gore and his contributions to the greenhouse effect .
OK , maybe this is my way to get myself off the moral hook ( even at the cost of doing the same for Al Gore ) .
But I think that the argument is sound , even if self - serving .
What about Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas ?
These are intermediate cases , it seems to me .
Some critics of affirmative action primarily decry what they see as its harmful aggregate effects ( admitting lower - qualified students ; increasing racial conflict ; contributing to negative stereotypes of minorities as underqualified ) .
Others argue that each individual instance of affirmative action is itself an injustice because of the " reverse discrimination " it inflicts on white and Asian students or job applicants .
Critics of affirmative action who emphasize systemic harm are not being inconsistent if they take advantage of affirmative action policies where they exist .
On the other hand , those who accept the benefits of AA even though they oppose it on absolutist grounds , are indeed complicit in what they consider to be injustice .
One can make a similar distinction between aggregate and absolute criticisms of the tort system .
The bottom line :
Not all people who benefit from policies they oppose are inconsistent or hypocritical .
It depends on the policy in question , and on the reasons for their opposition to it .
NOTE : I am not going to regulate the comments .
However , I think it will be more productive if people focus on the general issue of benefiting from policies that one opposes rather than on arguments about the merits of the specific policies that I used as examples .
UPDATE : Ted Frank of Overlawyered made a related point about hypocrisy and the state income tax deduction in this November post .

Magazine The Nonbelievers
An increasing number of young people in America - and adults around the world - do n't believe in God.
Greg Epstein , who advises fellow atheists and agnostics at Harvard University , wants to create a kind of church for those who reject religion .
But he 's encountering resistance from some of the very people he wants to unite .
( Photo by Tanit Sakakini ) Rosy - cheeked angels smile from stained - glass windows , and crucifixes hang on the granite walls .
The vaulting stone arches lend voices a holy echo .
A chandelier - illuminated red carpet leads to the large casket , which is covered with white roses .
When the balding man walks into the 165 - year - old Gothic chapel , he greets mourners warmly , solemnly , with reverent words and tender handshakes , like a rabbi or a priest .
But the well - wisher in a pin-striped suit is no man of the cloth .
He doesnt wear flowing robes or a skullcap , and instead of a Bible or other sacred text , he carries a book titled Funerals Without God .
" This is Reverend Epstein , " says a friend of the deceased , a physician who considered religion a pernicious fiction .
Epstein interrupts : " It s chaplain . . . .
Its OK .
A lot of people arent sure what to call me . "
Over the past two years , Greg Epstein , 30 , has become a kind of ministerial paradox , a member of the local clergy who disavows God , preaches to atheists and agnostics , and seeks to build the equivalent of a church for nonbelievers and others skeptical of or alienated by religion .
A former lead singer of a rock band , he now serves as the humanist chaplain at Harvard University , one of a small but growing number of such chaplains for nonbelievers on college campuses .
In his position , which is endowed , he has helped marry and bury fellow atheists .
He has presided over baby - naming ceremonies and organized a " coming out " ceremony for a congressman , Representative Pete Stark of California , one of the few public officials to acknowledge he doesnt believe in God .
He also counsels students and approximates evangelizing by handing out pamphlets with the question : " Are you a humanist ? "
From the pulpit at Bigelow Chapel in Watertown ( located in Mount Auburn Cemetery ) , speaking with the slow cadence of a clergyman delivering a sermon , Epstein tells those gathered not to expect a traditional service .
" We intend , of course , no disrespect to those who have religious beliefs .
. . .
We hope and believe you will find the occasion dignified and acceptable . "
He continues : " A religious funeral is a celebration of a particular faith , giving homage to God .
A humanist funeral is a celebration of the individual human life and his contribution to humanity . "
Later , after delivering a homily that might have been heard on a Sunday morning , he explains the contradictions of his role .
" I have a religious personality , without a scintilla of religious belief , " he says .
" If its an oxymoron to believe that people who have ceased to believe in God still need caring and community , then I m proud to be a walking oxymoron . "
In a world where zealots crash planes into buildings in the name of God and politicians use the Bible to craft public policy , Epstein sees himself as in the vanguard of an emerging movement fueled by the rise of skepticism , advances in science and technology , and a spreading aversion toward radical religious ideologies and traditions .
He and other humanists , who also call themselves atheists , agnostics , freethinkers , secularists , or brights , point to a survey published in January by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , which found that 20 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 say they have no religious affiliation or consider themselves atheists or agnostics  nearly double those who said that in a similar survey 20 years ago .
Another Pew survey in March concluded the nation is witnessing a " reversal of increased religiosity observed in the mid-1990s . "
Today , 12 percent of Americans surveyed age 20 and older describe themselves as not religious , up from 8 percent in 1987 .
" This change , " the surveys authors wrote , " appears to be generational in nature , with each new generation displaying lower levels of religious commitment than the preceding one . "
Epstein , a Jew from New York City who trained as a " humanist rabbi " after becoming disillusioned by the music industry during a year and a half crooning for a band called Sugar Pill , embodies that generational shift .
He calls himself a humanist , because he sees it as a more embracing term than atheist .
" Atheism is what I dont believe in ; humanism is what I do believe in , " he says .
He defines it as a " philosophy of life without supernaturalism that affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment aspiring to the greater good of humanity . "
His deepening involvement in humanism has mirrored a rising interest in nonbelief throughout the country .
Books about atheism have become a publishing phenomenon in the past few years , with five of the most popular combined accounting for more than a million copies in print .
Some have spent weeks on the New York Times bestseller list , such as Sam Harriss 2004 The End of Faith .
The publisher of Christopher Hitchenss God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything had printed some 300,000 copies less than two months after it went on sale this year .
Other popular titles include evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkinss The God Delusion , of which there are more than a half million hardcover copies in print ; Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon by Tufts University philosophy professor Daniel Dennett ; and God : The Failed Hypothesis by Victor J. Stenger .
The spike in interest in atheism can be attributed to a backlash against militant Islam and a response to the faith - based initiatives and religiosity of the Bush administration , says Steven Pinker , the cognitive scientist at Harvard whom the American Humanist Association last year named its Humanist of the Year .
But he says interest in the new literature also reflects how science is increasingly displacing religion as a way people understand the world .
" Aside from fundamentalists , most people [ outside the United States ] have given up on creationism and seeing the Earth as the center of the universe , " he says .
" More and more of what used to be the domain of religion has been ceded to science .
It s the trend of modernity .
I think this is a tide .
Weve seen it happen everywhere else in the developed world .
This is the direction of history . "
Students on college campuses and others have begun to organize nonbelievers .
The number of campus groups affiliated with the Secular Student Alliance , for example , has increased by more than 50 percent in the past two years , to more than 80 groups , says August E. Brunsman IV , executive director of the Albany , New York - based alliance .
Since January , the Center for Inquiry in Amherst , New York , a science - promoting umbrella group , has sponsored or helped organize more than 50 atheist outfits on campuses from the University of Georgia Law School to the University of Texas at Austin to Kent State University in Ohio , says D.J. Grothe , the centers vice president of outreach .
The MySpace atheist and agnostic group has grown by about 10,000 members a year since it began in 2004 and now is about one third the size of MySpaces largest Christian group , says Bryan J. Pesta , an assistant professor of management at Cleveland State University , who moderates the group .
" We need to get visible and let people know that were much more like [ believers ] than different from them , " Brunsman says .
" By banding together under the umbrella of nontheism , we can show the country that we are a sizable part of the population , and we can show closeted nontheists that they are not alone . "
Five years ago , to try to change the low opinion many Americans have of atheists ( a national Gallup poll this year found more than half of those surveyed would not vote for an atheist for president ) , a group of four organizations started the Secular Coalition for America .
Now , the coalition employs a full - time lobbyist in Washington , regularly issues press releases about everything from stem cell research to religious language used by politicians , and represents eight national organizations with more than 25,000 members , more than a third from the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
Lori Lipman Brown , the coalitions director , acknowledges they have a long way to go in a country where , polls show , two - thirds of the population still believes in God .
But the venom she used to hear has faded .
" When Im on right - wing radio or Christian radio , I no longer hear people say as much that I m immoral or liable to commit murder , " she says .
" Now , it seems , they acknowledge its possible that I could be a good person . "
Humanists trace their roots to the ancient Greeks , among them philosopher Diagoras , who burned images of the eras gods .
Their apostate forebears include the philosophers David Hume , who promoted skepticism and logical reasoning during the Enlightenment ; Karl Marx , who likened religion to opium ; Friedrich Nietzsche , who gained infamy by declaring God dead ; and novelist Ayn Rand , who argued that reason is our only guide to action .
Even Mother Teresa doubted the existence of God , according to a new book that unveils her private journals and letters .
Humanists align themselves with more recent proponents of ridding society of God , including the author Dawkins , the popular astronomer Carl Sagan , and the novelist Kurt Vonnegut , who in 1980 asked a Unitarian congregation in Cambridge : " How on earth can religious people believe in so much arbitrary , clearly invented balderdash ? "
Today , Americans appear to be following a larger trend of people around the world abandoning organized religion , particularly those in wealthier , more educated countries .
In the 2007 Cambridge Companion to Atheism , Phil Zuckerman , a sociologist at Pitzer College in Claremont , California , studied religion surveys in some 50 countries .
Over the past 50 years , according to a 2004 survey he cites , the percentage of people believing in God has plunged in Sweden , where as many as 85 percent of the population now say they dont believe in God ; Australia , where about 25 percent are nonbelievers ; Canada , where as many as 30 percent dont believe in God ; and Japan , where about 65 percent are now nonbelievers .
Overall , according to 2007 World Almanac , there are nearly 1 billion nonbelievers in the world , which would make them the worlds third - largest persuasion , after Christianity and Islam .
While the ranks of nonbelievers are increasing , they likely account for a decreasing percentage of the worlds population , as religious nations tend to have higher birth rates , Zuckerman notes .
In India , for example , he cites surveys that show between 3 percent and 6 percent of the population say they dont believe in God .
In the Middle East , where Islam  the worlds fastest - growing religion with about 1.3 billion adherents ( about 800 million fewer than Christianity )  thrives , Zuckerman cites surveys showing that fewer than 1 percent of those in countries including Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Iraq , and Syria say they dont believe in God .
" Making definite predictions of the future growth or decline of atheism [ is ] difficult , " Zuckerman writes .
" What is clear is that while most people continue to maintain a firm belief in deities . . . in certain societies , nonbelief in God is definitely increasing . "
Here in the United States , where atheism remains a relatively weak current against the tides of religion , the rising interest in Godlessness is most visible on college campuses and among recent graduates .
Many of them regard religion as the perpetuation of superstitions and mythology and see the worlds largest faiths as sowing division and enmity more than the peace they profess .
Nina Lee , president of the Tufts Freethought Society , says a university survey of the Class of 2009 showed nearly one - third of her fellow students cited no religious affiliation  equal to those identifying themselves as Christian .
Many of those who listed a religion , she says , are not actually religious .
" I dont think people are taking religious beliefs as seriously as they used to , but they still go through the habit of using religion as a way to meet people and as a social space , " says Lee , 22 , a senior majoring in psychology who was raised by Chinese Buddhists but who embraces humanism today .
Lee studied religion but says she found no evidence to support it  her prayers to Jesus and Buddhist deities went unanswered , she says  and faults religion for standing in the way of science .
" I oppose any ideology that motivates people to ignore or deny scientific evidence , especially when that evidence is crucial for improving peoples lives , " she says .
David Rand went to Hebrew school until he was a senior in high school .
But the 25 - year - old graduate student at Harvard never really believed in God and was excited to find like - minded students when he left home .
" I dont think religion is the source of all evil , but I think it can be a source of division in a world that does not need division , " says Rand , who studies biology .
" I dont find the answers offered by religion satisfactory .
Trying to find answers rationally is much more satisfying .
. . .
I think theres also pleasure and beauty in natural explanations . "
Zach Bos , 25 , who works at Boston University and serves as director of the group Boston Atheists , grew up going to Sunday Mass , was active in his churchs youth group , and was confirmed as a Catholic .
But now , he says , " my atheism is sustained by the continual absence of evidence for a single supernatural event .
You might as well ask if my belief in gravity is sustained ; it is only insofar as I havent seen any apples falling up off the tree today . "
Still , for Bos and the others , theres something missing , and its a void Greg Epstein wants to fill .
From his office in Harvard Yard , where the shelves are crammed with hundreds of books including Whos Who in Hell , Politics at Gods Funeral , and Losing Faith in Faith , Epstein cant escape the religious .
He works in the bowels of the Memorial Church , where prayers literally seep through his walls and an organ groans from above .
Crucifixes abound , and the surrounding offices are filled with Harvards faith - oriented chaplains .
But unlike other humanists , many of whom argue that acceptance of even moderate views about religion legitimizes religious extremists , Epstein is more ecumenical in his atheism .
He has even sparked controversy by criticizing more militant , religion - bashing atheists  in a press release promoting a conference on humanism last spring , his office referred to that group as " fundamentalists . "
His goal is to prod nonbelievers to go beyond denouncing religion and denying the existence of God ; he wants them to focus on what they value , what unites such a disparate array of people and views .
" Life can be lonely , challenging , and we need community , " he says .
" We do want to be part of something bigger than ourselves . "
In the office of his chaplaincy , which has an endowment worth more than $ 2 million and pays him a salary of $ 20,000 , Epstein keeps a stack of cards printed with a summary of the American Humanist Associations Humanist Manifesto III , a successor to a draft from 1933 .
The foldout card lists maxims such as " Knowledge of the world is derived by observation , experimentation , and rational analysis " ; " Ethical values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience " ; and " Working to benefit society maximizes individual happiness . "
Epstein wants those bullet points to be more than bromides .
Ironically , he would like humanism to share some of the accouterments and traditions of religion , sans notions of heaven and hell , of course .
He envisions common songs , rites for weddings and funerals , and common spaces that might substitute for churches .
" We have this critical mass of people that need more , " he says , adding that nonbelievers need to build humanism so that its thought of as beautiful and inspiring .
" You should be able to get out and say ,  I did humanism .  " But Epsteins vision and criticism of fellow atheists has angered some of the very people he wants to unite .
R. Joseph Hoffmann , a senior vice president at the Center for Inquiry , argues that Epstein has " abused " his links to Harvard " as a shortcut to the legitimacy he craves . "
In a letter that has made rounds in the blogosphere since last spring , Hoffmann wrote : " If the word spiritual works , they wear it ; but if they need to spin things in a secular direction to win friends and influence people , they spin away like sodden spiders .
This is Gen - X humanism for the Passionately Confused , and owes almost nothing to philosophy , intellectual commitment , or serious political involvement .
It s about bringing people to the table because eating together is always nice .
Family - time , yes ? "
The letter added : " What makes Epstein special is his determination to turn his role into that of World Leader of the New Humanism , using the Harvard name as a whip to bring recalcitrant or struggling humanist groups into his new order . "
In one posting on his popular atheism blog , Brian Flemming , the director of the film The God Who Wasnt There , called Epstein a " train wreck " who " seems determined to take the worst possible approach in his response to the controversy he started " when he used the " fundamentalists " label , which atheists consider a religious epithet .
" The accusation that blunt but reasoning atheists . . . are equivalent to the dogmatic fundamentalists on the other side is false , quite dumb , and constantly deployed by their enemies to derail useful conversation , " Flemming wrote .
" And that is not something of which you want to be part . "
In response to his critics , Epstein  who speaks softly and has a gentle , rabbinical way about him  says the " fundamentalist " label was misinterpreted but that he has no intention of curtailing his efforts to promote a more communal humanism .
" Im proud to say I want and need to be part of a supportive community .
Sadly , this can stir up the emotions of a few atheists who have been wounded by religion and want to distance themselves from it .
. . .
It s true that religion has done some terrible , irrational things , but the key question for a humanist is nt  Who am I angry at ? 
It s  How can I make this world a better place ?  "
On his blog at Harvard , Epstein wrote that he hopes atheists avoid vilifying believers as they have disparaged atheists .
" I dont even have a problem with all the people who are blogging about me right now and slamming me as some kind of representative of appeasement ,  " he wrote .
" We want to be treated as equals ?
Let s raise hell about it , fine , but perhaps think twice about slamming me so hard as some kind of Uncle Tom ( I definitely heard that one on a few blogs ) if I want to speak for myself , and for the millions of atheists and Humanists out there who actually * like * and care deeply about a lot of religious people and dont feel the need to hurt their feelings in addition to disagreeing with them . "
The rift occurred as Epstein was about to assume a much larger mantle .
After months of planning  arranging satellite links , choreographing schedules , and securing speakers such as the novelist Salman Rushdie , the Pulitzer Prize - winning scientist E.O. Wilson , and Nobel laureate and economist Amartya Sen  Epstein used his perch at Harvard to host more than a thousand nonbelievers at the humanism conference in Cambridge in April .
As a jab at his critics and to draw a distinction between their views , he titled the gathering " The New Humanism . "
The conference , which featured speakers including Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and a performance by the folk singer Dar Williams , was so packed that organizers had to turn people away .
The panel discussions , stamped with Epsteins agenda , had titles like " Toward an Abrahamic Humanism " and " Dialogue Among Religions , Cultures , and Civilizations . "
There was even an invocation read for the dead .
The most attended event was at Memorial Church , beneath a large crucifix , where Rushdie received an award .
As the author of The Satanic Verses spoke amid the surrounding emblems of religion , he joked : " Thank you all for coming to this little Black Sabbath . "
Rushdie talked about growing up without religion and said his family celebrated holidays from many religions .
But he later wondered : " Where s the one for the unbelievers ?
Where is the Kwanzaa for the atheists ?
Surely we could make one of those up , [ like ] Atheismas . "
The allusions to religion upset some atheists , a few of whom described events at the conference as " religious humanism . "
Rebecca Watson , the editor of Skepchick magazine who spoke at a panel presentation titled " The Next Generation of Humanism , " says she supports the building of a support network for humanists .
But on her blog , she wrote about the conferences " disturbing trend of kowtowing to religion . "
She cited a teleconference Epstein organized with the Southern Baptist Convention and his dubbing the earth " The Creation , " which Epstein later explained was a reference to the title of E.O. Wilsons latest book .
" A number of the talks were sermons , " she wrote .
" I mean , they were really , really sermons , just without the god .
The syntax , the tone , and some of the message ( such as pleas for money ) made many in the audience noticeably uncomfortable . "
A few weeks later , while working on a book about what he calls " cultural humanism " and planning a class at Harvard Divinity School he has titled " Humanist Polity : Building a Community for Atheists , Agnostics , and the Non-Religious , " Epstein learned of the death of 66 - year - old physician Don Burke .
He had attended the conference and helped support the humanist chaplaincy , which was founded in 1974 by Catholic priest turned atheist Thomas Ferrick and endowed in 1995 as part of a $ 100 million gift to Harvard by the philanthropist John L. Loeb .
Leading the service for Burke was a chance to act on his vision , to begin filling the emptiness inherent in atheism .
So Epstein , who succeeded Ferrick as humanist chaplain two years ago , began perusing Funerals Without God to prepare for this day , his first humanist funeral .
Standing at the pulpit of the ornate chapel in Watertown , Epstein delivers a eulogy that could be appropriate in any tradition .
He reads a poem , Wendell Berrys " The Peace of Wild Things , " about the beauty of nature , asks those gathered to stand in honor of the man , and provides time for silent prayers ( or reflection ) .
Epstein relays a story Burke told him of how he came to identify as a humanist after growing up in Ireland , where some people believed in ghosts .
He " could not believe in such unseen things and was outraged by the way such beliefs terrified people into living their whole lives in unnecessary fear , " Epstein says .
" And so from his early boyhood he sought a more rational , scientific way of life . "
Then he addresses death by quoting Sherwin Wine , a humanist Epstein considered a mentor .
" It is so overwhelmingly final that it fills our lives with dread and anxious fear , " Epstein says .
" We cry out at the injustice of destiny and wait for answers that never seem to come . "
To cope with it , he says , humanists need a certain courage .
" Courage is loving life , even in the face of death .
It is sharing our strength with others , even when we feel weak .
It is embracing our family and friends , even when we fear to lose them .
It is opening ourselves to love . "
Before closing with a meditation on the precariousness of life , Epstein offers lines adapted from a familiar Christian burial rite .
" His body we commit to be burned and returned to the cycles of nature , " he says .
" Earth to earth , dust to dust , ashes to ashes . " © Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company .

The badgers appeared near the British base in Basra
Word spread among the populace that UK troops had introduced strange man-eating , bear - like beasts into the area to sow panic .
But several of the creatures , caught and killed by local farmers , have been identified by experts as honey badgers .
The rumours spread because the animals had appeared near the British base at Basra airport .
UK military spokesman Major Mike Shearer said : " We can categorically state that we have not released man-eating badgers into the area .
It is the size of a dog but his head is like a monkey
Housewife Suad Hassan
" We have been told these are indigenous nocturnal carnivores that do n't attack humans unless cornered . "
The director of Basra 's veterinary hospital , Mushtaq Abdul - Mahdi , has inspected several of the animals ' corpses .
He told the AFP news agency : " These appeared before the fall of the regime in 1986 .
They are known locally as Al - Girta .
" Talk that this animal was brought by the British forces is incorrect and unscientific . "
THE HONEY BADGER
Also known as a ratel , it is a large , sharp - clawed mammal At around 100 cm ( 39in ) long it is slightly bigger than its British woodland cousin Capable of taking on a cobra , the animal weighs up to 14kg ( 30 lb ) Its Latin name is mellivora capensis , and it is indigenous to Africa and the Middle East
Dr Ghazi Yaqub Azzam , deputy dean of Basra 's veterinary college , speculated that the badgers were being driven towards the city because of flooding in marshland north of Basra .
But the assurances did little to convince some members of the public .
One housewife , Suad Hassan , 30 , claimed she had been attacked by one of the badgers as she slept .
" My husband hurried to shoot it but it was as swift as a deer , " she said .
" It is the size of a dog but his head is like a monkey , " she told AFP .
Gordon Brown has insisted that global climate change can be limited to 2C and called on the US to accept binding targets to limit its carbon pollution .
In a letter to Stop Climate Chaos , a coalition of green groups , the prime minister said " all developed countries " needed to commit to reduce emissions to tackle the problem .
" Climate change poses the most urgent challenge to humankind - a challenge that threatens not only the environment , but international peace , security , prosperity and development , " he wrote .
The letter was the first significant statement on climate change from Mr Brown since he became prime minister .
It came ahead of a key week of talks on developing a new international treaty , to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 , to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
The UN will today hold a special high - level session on the issue in New York , attended by more than 70 heads of state .
The talks are intended to secure political commitment and build momentum for the UN climate change conference , taking place in Bali in December , where negotiations for the new international treaty will start .
Hilary Benn , the UK's environment , food and rural affairs secretary , is expected to attend .
" Bali must advance a negotiating agenda to combat climate change on all fronts , including adaptation , mitigation , clean technologies , deforestation and resource mobilization , " the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , said .
Prior to today 's meeting , the conservation group WWF called on the UN to negotiate within the UN framework convention on climate change to achieve an " ambitious comprehensive climate agreement " , which sets clear targets to reduce emissions , by no later than 2009 .
" For world leaders to come together under the UN umbrella and to commit to deeper cuts in emissions is a watershed moment , " Hans Verolme , the director of the WWF 's global climate change programme , said .
Friends of the Earth urged the US and the rest of the world to focus on the UN process prior to a two - day meeting of the major emitting countries , taking place in Washington later this week .
The Washington meeting provoked controversy when the US president , George Bush , announced it earlier this year .
Critics claimed it was a diversionary tactic , and said the US was trying to sideline the separate UN process .
The US insisted its efforts would help the UN agree the outline to a new treaty at Bali .
Privately , British officials say they are not yet convinced by the US , which remains opposed to binding targets and new international carbon trading markets .
Britain and Europe believe such measures are needed to draw developing nations such as China and India into a new deal .
" The EU has already agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % by 2020 … we want other developed nations to follow suit , " Mr Brown said .
Ashok Sinha , director of I Count , the campaign of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition , welcomed the Prime Minister 's aim to achieve a climate change agreement that will limit global warming to 2C .
But he called on Mr Brown to raise the target in the government 's forthcoming climate change bill from a 60 % reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 to at least 80 % , and to include aviation and shipping .
This is necessary in order to " meet the UK 's moral obligation to play its fair share in the international effort to keep global warming under 2 C , " said Dr Sinha .
Some girls stared at the floor while others tugged self - consciously on short hemlines , stretching the flimsy material a few centimetres longer as they catwalked awkwardly to the accompaniment of blasting hip - hop music .
Watching these young entertainers of the " Cherry - Sexy Girls " model groups were a few male customers , and a far larger crowd of Burmese sex workers , mostly in their late teens and early 20s , who sat at low tables in the darkness of the club .
Escorting several girls to a nearby table of young men , a waiter said the show was not so much modelling as marketing .
" All the models are available , " the waiter said , adding that the youngest girls ask $ 100 ( £ 48.50 ) to spend a night with a customer , while the older girls and young women in the audience could be bargained down for a lot less .
Prostitution , particularly involving children , is a serious crime in military - ruled Burma , but girls taken from the club would have no problem with the authorities , the waiter assured the company , but did not explain why not .
It would seem that prostitution is one of the few things the Burmese military , fresh from its recent crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations by Buddhist monks , is still willing to tolerate .
Information on the Burmese sex trade is extremely limited , as NGOs and other organisations can not conduct proper research within the country , said Patchareeboon Sakulpitakphon at the Bangkok offices of the international organisation Ecpat , whose acronym stands for End Child Prostitution , Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes .
As a result of the restrictions , what is known is limited to a " basic picture based on what victims have said , and information that leaks out , " Ms Patchareeboon wrote in an email .
But , she added , the information available indicates that " [ child ] sex tourism is emerging in Burma as well as the development of the sex industry " .
Rights abuses
Burma is already a big source country for people trafficked to the regional sex trade .
" The junta 's gross economic mismanagement , human rights abuses and its policy of using forced labour are the top causal factors for Burma 's significant trafficking problem , " the US state department noted in its 2007 trafficking report .
Disastrous economic policies pursued by the military have hobbled this resource - rich nation and hundreds of thousands have left the country to seek their fortunes elsewhere .
With an estimated annual income of just $ 220 a head among Burma 's 52 million people , fleeing the country to work elsewhere is all too common .
For many , their effort to escape leads them into the hands of human traffickers and the sex trade in Thailand , China , Malaysia , Macau and elsewhere , according to the state department .
On a recent night in Rangoon , a boisterous group of sex workers trawled a hotel bar for customers .
Lin Lin , 22 , and Thin Thin , 24 - names commonly used by sex workers in Burma - said they did not normally work in hotel bars , but the 10 pm curfew in the wake of the pro-democracy protests had shut down the late - night clubs and forced them to new venues to find customers .
With a mother , father and young brothers and sisters to support , Lin said that prostitution was not such a difficult choice .
" Sometimes I can earn $ 40 from one customer , " she explained , speaking in good English .
This was just her night job , she said , adding that she was in her second year at university , studying to become " an advocate of the law " .
Thin
Thin said she was a hairdresser during the day , but sleeping with men , particularly foreign tourists , paid far more than either could earn by legitimate work .
With one of the most serious HIV epidemics in Southeast Asia - an estimated 360,000 Burmese people were living with HIV at the end of 2005 , according to the UN - Thin Thin said she took no chances , and pulled several condoms from the pocket of her faded jeans to demonstrate .
According to the UN 's programme on HIV / Aids , and based on available statistics , one in three of Burma 's sex workers were infected with HIV in 2005 .
However , the ministry of health 's expenditure on HIV was estimated that year to be around $ 137,000 , or less than half of $ 0.01 a head , the UN said .
Because of the junta 's policies , the country also received a fraction of the international aid given to its neighbours .
" Overall , overseas development assistance per capita in 2004 for Myanmar [ Burma ] was US $ 2.4 , compared with $ 22 in Vietnam , $ 35 in Cambodia , and $ 47 in Lao People 's Democratic Republic . "
Now the outlook for ordinary Burmese looks decidedly gloomier in the face of the military 's crackdown .
The US and EU have promised more sanctions against the junta and Japan has said it will cut humanitarian aid to the country .
New revenues
Several people spoken to in Rangoon said further sanctions would have little impact on the military elite , who have lived comfortably for decades and now have new sources of revenues from contracts with countries such as China , France , India , and Thailand to extract natural resources .
Ms Patchareeboon said that tougher sanctions " will have a direct impact on children who are already vulnerable , increasing their risk significantly " .
The Burmese regime has , at least , joined the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking , she said , and the Burmese media have reported on the arrests of traffickers and the stiff jail sentences they receive .
So what is shielding the trade in young girls that takes place behind the flimsy facade of " modelling " shows in Rangoon from the military regime 's wrath ?
The answer is as simple as it is obvious , Ms Patchareeboon said : money .
" I am sure that [ the military ] has officials making profit from the growing sex industry and trafficking of Burmese citizens abroad , " she said .
" Corruption and the institutionalisation of the sex industry is common . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The first full genetic map of a cat -- a domestic pedigreed Abyssinian -- is already shedding light on a common cause of blindness in humans and may offer insights into AIDS and other diseases , researchers reported on Wednesday .
An undated handout photo shows 4 - year - old Cinnamon , a domestic pedigreed Abyssinian cat .
The first full genetic map of a cat , Cinnamon , is already shedding light on a common cause of blindness in humans and may offer insights into AIDS and other diseases , researchers reported on October 31 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Laboratory of Genomic Diversity , National Cancer Institute / Handout
And the cat genome shows some surprising qualities that cats and humans appear to have uniquely in common , the researchers report in the journal Genome Research .
“ We can start to interpret them in terms of one of evolution ’s special creations , which is also probably one of the greatest predators that ever lived , ” Dr. Stephen O’Brien of the National Cancer Institute , who helped lead the study , said in a telephone interview .
The cat , named Cinnamon , is descended from lab cats bred to develop retinitis pigmentosa , a degenerative eye disease that causes blindness and which affects 1 in 3,500 Americans .
O’Brien said a study of her genes can help uncover some of the causes of the incurable condition and may help find treatments for it .
Cats also are important for studying other diseases , O’Brien said .
“ The reasons why the cat genome is cool go on for about an hour , ” he said .
For instance , they are the only animals besides humans who naturally become sick from immune deficiency viruses .
People get HIV , which causes AIDS , while the feline immunodeficiency virus or FIV causes a similar disease in cats .
The discovery of feline leukemia virus in the 1960s led scientists to realize that viruses can cause cancer .
“ This led to oncogene development and some of the best smart drugs that we have for cancer , ” O’Brien said .
TRACING EVOLUTION
Like other mammals , the cat has around 20,000 genes .
Genome researchers have learned that much of the genetic code is made up of “ non-coding regions ” of DNA .
These are stretches of DNA that do not make up genes but which are clearly important for biology .
Researchers can compare the cat genome to those of the six other mammal genomes that have been finished -- the human , chimpanzee , mouse , rat , dog , and cow -- to figure out differences in biology , evolution and disease .
O’Brien said this comparison already demonstrates something interesting that happened as so many different species evolved from a tiny , shrewlike ancestor that outlived the dinosaurs .
“ The order of genes in cat is remarkably similar to the order of genes in the ancestor of all placental mammals , ” he said .
“ The two species that have that similarity are humans and cats .
Other species have a reshuffled genome , like a deck of cards .
The cat and the humans are pretty much similar to the way it was , which means the good model did n’t get fiddled with , ” he added .
Pedigreed cats and dogs are highly inbred , and Cinnamon especially so .
“ We now , for the first time , have seen in the kind of detail that we never imagined a generation ago all these genes that this cat has as well as the footprints of inbreeding as well as cat domestication , ” O’Brien said .
According to The Humane Society , Americans keep 90 million cats as pets .
“ One thing I ’d like to discover is the genes for good behavior in the cats -- the genes for domestication , the things that make them not want to kill our children but play with them , ” O’Brien said .

Boot Camp could bump up interest in Mac machine
The release of the Boot Camp software has prompted mixed reactions from computer industry pundits and bloggers .
The popular Boing Boing blog said comments by readers ranged from " appalled " to " awesome " .
On the Flickr photo - sharing site , some keen Mac users posted screenshots of what happens when they installed Boot Camp and got Windows running .
Share surge
The news definitely impressed the financial markets and Apple shares leapt 9.8 % in trading after the announcement .
The release of Boot Camp is significant because it could convince far more people to buy Apple computers rather than plump for a PC .
" Apple has removed another barrier to switching , " said Joe Wilcox , a Jupiter Research analyst .
By making XP run on Apple hardware , users will be able to get access to all those Windows programs they were previously denied .
However , the main switchers initially may not be businesses but consumers who are keen to keep playing all the games made for PCs .
Though there still remain some technical questions , particularly over video cards , about how straight - forward this will be .
Some people may also be keen to switch because , as commentators point out , there are also far fewer security problems with the OS X e-mail and web browsing programs .
Mac owners , though , must still contend with the spam and phishing e-mails that plague everyone .
Cost counting
Ted Schadler from Forrester Research said that the Windows version of the iTunes online music store gave a huge boost to the market for iPods .
He said Apple 's move was " smart " and could open up a huge part of the computer - using market that would otherwise never consider using Macs .
If Boot Camp does convince a lot of people to buy Apple machines , it could mean increased fortunes for the company .
Each additional percentage point of PC market share that Apple could win would give it an extra $ 2bn ( £ 1.14bn ) in revenue , estimated Chris Shope from broker JP Morgan .
For its part Apple believes that each switcher would soon see the benefits of using OS X over Windows .
What ?
Let Microsoft get a foothold on my lovely Mac ?
Never
Jon , St Austell
Windows XP on Macs :
What do you think ?
Analysts point out that using an Intel - based Mac could be an expensive option .
Joe Wilcox from Jupiter noted that Macintosh machines tend to be more expensive than PCs and users will have to buy a copy of Windows to run on the machine .
" Consumers would pay a premium , as much as $ 200 for Windows XP Home , as installation would require full version , not the upgrade , " said Mr Wilcox .
The trial version of Boot Camp released by Apple only lets owners use one operating system at a time .
Switching from one to the other is , currently , a process that takes a while to complete .
Many expect that once the dual start - up software is built in to the next version of OS X , expected in late 2006 or early 2007 , the switch between the operating systems will be much smoother .
At that time Intel - based Macs may also support Vista - the next version of Microsoft 's operating system .
By the end of 2007 , all Apple 's computers are expected to be Intel - based .
However , there were some that remained stubbornly unimpressed .
For instance one caustic comment on the Slashdot website read : " You get the stability of Windows with the value - of - money of Apple hardware .
Sign me up . "

Web Password Hashing
Description
The Common Password Problem .
Users tend to use a single password at many different web sites .
By now there are several reported cases where attackers breaks into a low security site to retrieve thousands of username / password pairs and directly try them one by one at a high security e-commerce site such as eBay .
As expected , this attack is remarkably effective .
A Simple Solution .
PwdHash is an browser extension that transparently converts a user 's password into a domain - specific password .
The user can activate this hashing by choosing passwords that start with a special prefix ( @@ ) or by pressing a special password key ( F2 ) .
PwdHash automatically replaces the contents of these password fields with a one - way hash of the pair ( password , domain - name ) .
As a result , the site only sees a domain - specific hash of the password , as opposed to the password itself .
A break - in at a low security site exposes password hashes rather than an actual password .
We emphasize that the hash function we use is public and can be computed on any machine which enables users to login to their web accounts from any machine in the world .
Hashing is done using a Pseudo Random Function ( PRF ) .
Phishing protection .
A major benefit of PwdHash is that it provides a defense against password phishing scams .
In a phishing scam , users are directed to a spoof web site where they are asked to enter their username and password .
SpoofGuard is a browser extension that alerts the user when a phishing page is encountered .
PwdHash complements SpoofGuard in defending users from phishng scams : using PwdHash the phisher only sees a hash of the password specific to the domain hosting the spoof page .
This hash is useless at the site that the phisher intended to spoof .

Please note :
These prototypes are intended for demonstration purposes only .
We reserve the right to change the hashing algorithm in future versions , which may require you to reset your passwords if you want to upgrade .
Deployment Challenges
PwdHash
PwdHash must defend against JavaScript at a phishing site that may confuse users into typing their passwords in an insecure location ( such as a text field that is made to look like a password field ) .
PwdHash includes a number of clever mechanisms to defend against such attacks .

includes a number of clever mechanisms to defend against such attacks .
After PwdHash is installed users can set up hashed passwords at the various sites they use by resetting their password .
Typically , reset pages ask the user to type in the old password and then enter the new password twice .
PwdHash must somehow recognize the old password field and avoid hashing it .
PwdHash relies on the user to pick new passwords that start with @@ so that they can be distinguished from regular passwords .
Alternatively , the user can press the password key ( F2 ) before entering the password to indicate that the password should be hashed .

We found a small number of sites ( i.e. one site ) where the password reset page is hosted on a different domain than the password use page .
As a result the wrong password hash is registered at the site after password reset .
One solution is to create a list of such sites so that PwdHash can tell how to handle them .
Other solutions involving server - side changes are also possible .

Project Staff :
As most development managers know , the FBI 's Virtual Case File ( VCF ) system has become the epitome of the software industry 's most expensive failed project .
Running taxpayers between $ 100 and $ 200 million dollars over four years , the VCF delivered little more than a mountain of useless documentation , nearly a million lines of code that will never run in production and a whole lot of costly lessons .
Worse still , the lessons offered from this multi-million dollar failure could have just as easily been found in a $ 50 software engineering textbook .
In fact , the major factors behind VCF 's failure read much like such a book 's table of contents :
Enterprise Architecture : VCF had none .
Management : Developers were both poorly managed and micromanaged .
Skilled Personnel : Managers and engineers with no formal training were placed in critical roles .
Requirements :
They were constantly being changed .
Scope Creep :
New features were added even after the project was behind schedule .
Steady Team :
More people were constantly added to the team in an attempt to speed the project .
While these are all valuable lessons that every development manager should take to heart , one of the most important -- and certainly least discussed -- lessons stems from one of the rare correct decisions made on the project : the decision to cut bait and scrap the whole thing .
As painfully difficult as it must have been to halt the VCF , the alternative would have been far worse .
If the VCF system had been put into production , the bureau 's productivity would have ground to a halt as agents struggled to learn and use the bug - infested software .
Programmers would have had to work day and night , hacking together patch after patch in a futile attempt to fix known defects , all while introducing countless new defects into the system .
Untold millions would have been spent bringing the system to that dangerous state of " stable instability , " where the costs and risks associated with fixing even the most trivial defect are far too great to justify .
Eventually , and probably within a few short years , the system would have to be rebuilt from scratch .
Although only a handful of development managers will ever work on a project the size of VCF , most have experienced first - hand what the VCF would have become : a staggering behemoth application of rapidly decaying quality with a rotting , ever - growing codebase .
This class of applications represents the worst type of software failure : the perceived success .
Worse than Failure
When an enterprise software application is deployed to production , it 's almost universally considered to be a success .
In most other industries , equating completion and success would be ludicrous .
After all , few in the construction industry would deem a two - year - old house with a leaky roof and a shifting foundation anything but a disaster -- and an outright liability .
Yet , had the VCF system gone live , almost everyone involved -- from the business analysts to the programmers to the project managers -- would have called their work a success .
Even after the code devolved into an unsustainable mess , many would still refuse to admit that they had failed .
The result is a cycle of failure , as dev shops refuse to recognize and correct issues that plague their projects .
As editor of this site , I 've been tracking software development meltdowns for years .
Most of these stories share a lot of common elements : poor management , misguided process and loads of human error .
In fact , the vast majority of the development failures I 've documented have little , if anything , to do with tools and technologies , and everything to do with the people using them .
The only way to prevent this kind of failure is to be pragmatic about success .
And realistically , enterprise software applications should last at least 15 years .
Anything short of that and the software should be considered that short of being successful .
The primary reason that custom enterprise software is replaced is because it simply becomes too costly to maintain .
This even holds true for old , highly successful software .
Imagine the difficulty and cost of building ( or even finding the programmers to build ) a real - time inventory lookup module on a 1980 's - era COBOL - based warehousing system .
In situations like this , gutting the old system -- or at least replacing the bulk of it -- is usually the only sensible choice that allows for affordable maintenance .
A well - designed system built over the past eight to 10 years , however , should n't require a forklift upgrade .
Makings of a Mess
Maintainability is often at the heart of failed software projects , says ( former ) Microsoft MVP Phil Haack , a developer who frequently blogs about software maintainability .
He learned the maintainability lesson early in his career , when his team was tasked with building a fairly simple marketing Web site that a client would use to receive feedback .
The site included a form that visitors would fill out , with the input sent to the company as an e-mail .
The team decided to keep it simple : no database , no special configuration and no extensibility .
And the site worked just fine .
The project was delivered on time and on budget , and the client was satisfied .
In fact , it worked so well that the client came back and asked for an additional form to be added to the software .
Though the software was never designed to handle multiple forms , a second form was not difficult to add .
They were able to hack in the additional requirements and make it work exactly as the client requested .
A month later , the client asked for a third form to be added .
Haack 's team hacked , compiled and delivered it .
Then they asked for a fourth .
Hack , compile , deliver .
And a fifth .
Hack , compile , deliver .
With each change request , the once - simple application evolved into a tangled mess .
After a year 's worth of changes , the Web application utilized a database , COM objects and all sorts of other technologies that were well beyond the scope of the original application .
What 's more , each change to the code became riskier and costlier as time progressed .
The team was rapidly losing the ability to maintain the application .
" Each project took progressively longer , even though the requirements were as simple as all the previous ones , " Haack says .
" The application became so monolithic and so difficult to maintain . "
Eventually , Haack 's team had to break the news to their client :
The application they had been building and extending for almost two years had become a complete mess .
Worse still , it had grown so complicated that rewriting the app was no longer even feasible .
They 'd have to build a " legacy bridge " in a new application and then build a standard platform on top of that .
Admitting to Failure
It was n't easy for Haack 's team to admit to failure .
Sure , they could have blamed their situation on the client 's ever - increasing demands , but in the end it was their team that built the application and allowed it to degrade from a simple form to a maintenance nightmare .
Their mistake was n't in the original , simple design , but in not abandoning that design sooner .
In other words , the team 's decision to build a simple application for a simple requirement was the right one .
No one could have predicted that the software would have changed in the manner that it did .
Had they built the initial version of the application to be more extensible , perhaps including a forms database or form groupings , the requirements could have easily shifted to make those features irrelevant or , worse , cumbersome .
" Avoid premature generalization , " Haack advises .
" Do n't build the system to predict every change .
Make it resilient to change . "
As for knowing when to generalize , Haack lives by the rule of three : " The first time you notice something that might repeat , do n't generalize it .
The second time the situation occurs , develop in a similar fashion -- possibly even copy / paste -- but do n't generalize yet .
On the third time , look to generalize the approach . "
In the case of Haack 's Web application , this approach would have motivated the team to begin generalizing the working code with each new iteration .
Over time , the changes might have prevented " ancient " parts of the code from becoming an unmanageable burden .
A Change - Friendly Environment
Both the VCF system and Haack 's Web application had collapsed under their own weight , the former before it could even make it to production and the latter after a brief two - year life .
They would have lasted indefinitely longer had they been maintainable .
Creating software that 's maintainable -- meaning resilient to change -- must start early on , and at a much higher level than the code or even the application 's design .
Maintainable software begins at the highest level -- the Enterprise Architecture -- and works its way down through each phase of the software development lifecycle .
Business analysts and software developers must be trained to understand that the software they build can and will change in ways they 'll never be able to predict .
Therefore , tools such as refactoring and design patterns should be an integral part of the development process .
Testing and quality assurance also need to be resilient to change .
When the software changes , so should the unit tests , smoke tests and regression tests .
Without adequate testing early and throughout , defects from the constant changes will pile on and become even more difficult to resolve .
Ultimately , development managers must be able to recognize the point at which a software effort has failed and to be able to make the decision to move on .
The sooner that can happen , the less damage the failed project will inflict .
And , unlike the VCF , there might even be something left to salvage from the effort .

After September 11 , many Americans were compelled to give blood , write checks to the Red Cross , or even to join the military as a way of serving the country .
Apparently , though , an awful lot of us were also moved to show up for jury duty .
This revelation comes courtesy of U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young , who recently addressed the Florida Bar Association on the death of the jury trial .
Young noted that nationwide data ( which he unfortunately did n’t cite ) show that Americans turned up for jury service in record numbers in the year after the towers fell .
Young is most famous recently for sentencing shoebomber Richard Reid by telling him “ You ’re no big deal , ” but his speech ( recently posted here ) is an amazing–and rare–love song to the American jury that ’s worth a read .
Along with some harsh words for Congress for suspending habeas corpus , there are some interesting observations about the state of the federal judiciary , including this one :
In 1988 , the average time a federal judge spent actually sitting on the bench each year was 790 hours .
In FY 2005 , that number had fallen to 437 , of which only 225 hours were spent overseeing trials .
So what are the judges doing all day if not on the bench ?
“ Litigation management , ” said Young .
“ Hardly a shining vision , is it ? ”

According to the going theory , a six - mile - wide asteroid slammed into the Yucatán Peninsula 65 million years ago , throwing enough dust up into the atmosphere to dim the sun for years , killing off green plants and triggering a famine that wiped out all the dinosaurs in the geologic blink of an eye .
Not so fast , says U.S. Geological Survey geologist emeritus James Fassett .
A few years ago , Fassett ’s colleagues were digging in a fossil - rich area of New Mexico when they uncovered the four - foot - long fossilized thighbone of a duck - billed , plant - eating hadrosaur in a sandstone cliff .
When Fassett dated the bone to half a million years or so after the dinosaurs ’ supposed mass extinction , most paleontologists dismissed his find as a meaningless anomaly or a mistake .
Now Fassett has examined 30 more dinosaur fossils in the same rock formation and completed a more extensive analysis of the surrounding environment , taking into account paleomagnetism , fossil leaves , pollen , spores , and the geochemistry of the area .
“ There ’s no longer any question that dinosaurs in the area survived the asteroid impact event , finally becoming extinct about a million years later , ” he says .
If Fassett is right , either a small group of dinosaur holdouts miraculously survived the catastrophe that killed their brethren , or possibly the K - T asteroid impact was n’t nearly as deadly as some have claimed .
The fossil record shows that lots of animals weathered the impact , including most mammals and birds , as well as lizards and amphibians .
So why not some dinosaurs ?
“ These dinosaurs could have survived in the Far North where the impact ’s devastation was less , and then eventually they migrated back down south over time , ” Fassett says .
“ Or it ’s possible eggs may have survived the initial impact to hatch later and grow . ”
Description :
In summary , we found Summary :
The benchmarks were derived from commitments first articulated by the Iraqi government in June 2006 .
The Iraqi government met 3 , partially met 4 , and did not meet 11 of its 18 benchmarks .
Overall , key legislation has not been passed , violence remains high , and it is unclear whether the Iraqi government will spend $ 10 billion in reconstruction funds .
These results do not diminish the courageous efforts of coalition forces and progress that has been made in several areas , including Anbar Province .
The Iraqi government met one of eight legislative benchmarks : the rights of minority political parties in Iraq ’s legislature are protected .
The government has not enacted legislation on de-Ba’athification , oil revenue sharing , provincial elections , amnesty , and militia disarmament .
It is unclear whether sectarian violence in Iraq has decreased — a key security benchmark — since it is difficult to measure whether the perpetrators ’ intents were sectarian in nature , and other measures of population security show differing trends .
As the Congress considers the way forward in Iraq , it should balance the achievement of the 18 Iraqi benchmarks with military progress and with homeland security goals , foreign policy goals , and other goals of the United States .
I do n't go to as many conferences as I used to , but the advantage of that is that I have time to go to ones that take my fancy .
I 've long had a particular fondness for the Ruby community , so I turned up as an attendee at this year 's RailsConf .
With a young technology there 's lots of new and important pieces appearing , but for me the most important of these is JRuby .
Now in its final cycle of release candidates , JRuby offers a full implementation of the Ruby Platform on the Java JVM , as well as providing a scripting language for the JVM .
For what we do at ThoughtWorks , and for many Ruby / Rails developers this matters a great deal even if you never " include java " .
Chad Fowler and Rich Kilmer introduced the conference .
Chad shares my name but I do n't share his ukulele skills .
One of the biggest issues our Ruby teams run into is deployment .
Getting a ruby app into production involves a whole bunch of new technologies , and data centers tend to be conservative on this kind of thing .
Our RubyWorks stack tries to simplify this , but JRuby offers the choice of just deploying into a Java container , turning a Rails app into an easily deployed war file .
I think this will make Ruby on Rails a much more viable choice in lots of enterprise environments .
JRuby 's maturity on the JDK raised the obvious question of what will happen with the other popular managed runtime .
Signals from Microsoft were faint and unclear .
It was good to see notable Microsoft - oriented geeks Scott Hanselman and Chris Sells at the show , even if when I saw Chris Sells it felt like being in an arena .
What I like is that there is a real desire within the ruby community to collaborate with Microsoft rather than the usual competition and Redmond - bashing .
Indeed the overwhelming impression I got at RailsConf was a sense of industry - changing mission .
At last year 's conference my sense was that of a community delighted and rather stunned by its success .
My iconic image was DHH as Neo of the Matrix , breaking the rules of enterprise software and reveling in the success .
This year my sense is that this morphed into something much more important .
Success is not just being an outbreak of sanity in the IT world , but actually leading that world .
There seems an excellent chance that Ruby and Rails could become a significant platform for IT develop over the next few years .
We 're already seeing signs of this at ThoughtWorks - 40 % of our new business this year in the US is Ruby work .
Unlike previous platforms , this one is n't controlled or even dominated by vendors .
Ruby is a community effort .
I 've been hoping for a long time that one of the LAMP technologies would break through into corporate IT , and it looks like Ruby could well do it .
Corporate IT is dominated by bloatware .
Time and time again we have to deal with expensive software purchased on golf - courses that just get in our way while sucking funds and development hours .
Technologies that make it harder for programmers to do what they like to do best - make a difference for the businesses they are supporting .
( This week 's memorable tale was of a large company that spent eight million dollars on an enterprise - wide version control system that could n't branch properly . )
My hope that with a platform that 's controlled by a community we 'll see a platform that focuses on simplicity - finding the key things that need to be done and doing them in a way enables programmers to provide their best .
Michael Koziarski and Jamis Buck describing the Rails Way - establishing the good style which lies deep in the Ruby community .
It 's helped by the fact that the ruby community has formed around the best ideas of the OO and Extreme Programming communities .
Listening to the keynote of Jamis Buck and Michael Koziarski I was delighted to reflect on the thought that they were right there in the values of Ward , Kent , and all the other people who 've been advocating clean code , well - factored object - oriented design , and testability .
These ideas have made a great impact on many other technological communities , but in Ruby - land they are the orthodoxy .
Throughout the conference there was a sense that we are at an inflection - point in our industry , a key technological shift that promotes a new major platform .
Listening and reading about JavaOne I got the sense that a big shift had happened there , people no longer focusing on Java the language but on Java the JVM , replacing one language with multiple languages closely collaborating .
A particularly fascinating thing about the Ruby community is the diversity of ages of people in it .
Not just do you have the young paradigm breakers like DHH and the core team , you also have the , ahem , rather more seasoned campaigners like PragDave and the RubyCentral triumvirate .
The important thing is that there 's a lot of respect and collaboration across this generation gap .
There is n't the wall between the old farts and the loud teenagers that you often get , instead a real appreciation for what both groups have to offer .
Not that all is good , however .
There is a marked lack of women in the ruby community which , apart from the fact that we 're missing out on some serious talent , probably is a sign of other problems within the community .
The DevChix group was pretty active in looking for ways to try to correct this and I was pleased to see several conversations sprout up during the conference on finding ways to improve our Diversity problems .
A couple of years ago I wrote about the impressions people had that the RubyPeople were notably more friendly than most software communities .
Talking to people at RailsConf I got the message that that had changed for the worse .
Both the ruby lists and particularly the rails lists had tended more towards the sad Internet mean .
In his opening keynote Chad Fowler said that the rails community had a reputation as " a bunch of arrogant bastards " and I cringed as an , admittedly small , group raised a triumphant cheer .
What pleased me was , that starting with Chad , there was a strong push from the ruby leadership to try and change this .
A theme that came from several talks was that our community had an opportunity to try to lead the software profession away from this tar - pit of NetNastiness and lack of diversity , to create a community that really welcomed many types of people into a nurturing and pleasant environment .
I 've been sick of the tone of geek discussion for many years and if the Ruby community could really show a direction to lift us out of this quagmire , this would delight me even more than all of the other prizes that glitter in front of us .

Our lives tend to accumulate clutter in every corner : on our desks , in our drawers , on our shelves at home , in our closets , on our computer — you name it , and clutter finds a way to fill every available space .
But having a simple , uncluttered life is possible , with some very simple methods .
Devote a little of your time to tossing clutter from your life , and keeping things relatively clutter - free , and you ’ll be rewarded with much more pleasing living spaces , with a less stressful life , and with better organization and productivity .
Clutter weighs us down , distracts us , brings chaos into our lives .
Let ’s look at some ways to kick it out … for good .
Your desk
If your desk is covered in paper and other clutter , clear it off to create a pleasing work environment .
The steps here are the basic decluttering steps we ’ll follow for many of the other steps below : Clear everything off :
Take everything off your desk and put it in a pile on the floor .
Clear out the drawers too , if you have time .
The only things that should be on your desk now are the computer , phone and other similar equipment .
Clean :
Wipe down your desk , and clean your drawers if you ’re decluttering them too .
It ’s good to start with clean surfaces .
Sort : OK , here ’s the meat of the process : sort through your stuff , one pile at a time .
Toss out or route as much as possible , so that what you ’re left with is a relatively small amount of stuff .
If you wo n’t be using it again in the near future , or if you can access it on the computer , toss it out .
Designate homes :
Now you get to place everything back in your desk .
Set up a simple alphabetical filing system , with one folder for each project or client .
Have drawers for your office supplies and other stuff .
With less stuff to organize , it should n’t be too hard .
Be sure to have a place designated for everything , and keep things in those places .
Sometimes it helps to label , so you do n’t forget .
Leave flat surfaces clear :
Do n’t put stuff on top of your desk .
Have an inbox for all incoming papers , and then sort them each day and either toss , delegate , do them immediately , or file all documents , so nothing remains on top of your desk .
The only thing that should be on your desk is your computer , phone , inbox , perhaps a family photo , and the documents you ’re working on right now .
Files
If you decluttered your files in the above step , you can skip this , although you should declutter not only your work files but your home files as well .
Keep a simple alphabetical system , and try to fit everything in one drawer .
It ’s good to take out all your files , and purge what you do n’t need .
Many times that can be half of your files or more .
Get rid of as much as possible — most times , we keep copies of stuff we ’ll never need again .
When you ’re done purging , you should have a minimum of files , and it should n’t be hard to keep organized .
Information
In today ’s digital world , there are tons of ways that information comes into our lives — and it can be overwhelming .
It ’s information clutter — we get too much of it .
Instead , set certain times of the day when you check email , your RSS feeds , Facebook , or various forums or other things you read daily .
Reduce the number of things you read each day — purge anything that does n’t give you value , reduce your consumption of news and television , get rid of magazine subscriptions .
Keep information to a bare minimum , and only check it at certain times of the day instead of letting it rule your life .
Computer
Purge your computer files , getting rid of stuff you do n’t need .
Clear your desktop of icons — they slow your computer down , create visual clutter , and are an inefficient way to access files , programs or folders .
Set up hotkeys with AutoHotKey or similar programs .
With online search tools ( such as that in Gmail ) and programs such as Google Desktop , you do n’t need to keep your files in a complex array of directories and subdirectories — just archive , and search later .
Purge old , unneeded files at least every month or two .
Closets
Use the same method for your closets as you did with your desk : clear everything out , clean it out , sort ( and toss or donate as much as possible ) , and designate homes for what you decided to keep .
Keep only what you love and use often .
I recommend keeping your closet floor clear — it makes everything look nicer .
If tackling the entire closet is too intimidating , it can be helpful to just tackle one area of your closet a day , until it ’s done .
It ’s also useful to go through your wardrobe , and donate everything you have n’t worn in 6 months — it greatly simplifies your closet .
Rooms
Are the rooms in your house too cluttered ?
A few rules about simplifying a room : first , start with anything that ’s stacked on the floors ; then work to the flat surfaces ( tables , shelves , countertops , the tops of dressers , etc. ) and clear them completely if possible ; then do the larger stuff like furniture and other things that clutter the room ; and finally tackle drawers and cabinets and closets .
As much as possible , keep floors clear and all flat surfaces .
Sort through everything in piles as in the first step above , tossing and donating as much as possible .
Organize everything else in drawers and closets and cabinets , out of sight but still neat and uncluttered .
Tackle one room at a time , going for a clean , uncluttered , simple , minimalist look in all cases .
It can be helpful to continually edit a room once you ’re done decluttering — you can always find little ways to make a room simpler .
Drawers
The way to declutter a drawer is the same as outlined above : empty everything out , clean the drawer , sort through the pile of stuff from the drawer ( purging as much as possible ) and organizing the few things left .
Keep like things together — a drawer for office supplies should only be for office supplies .
Avoid having a junk drawer — everything should have a designated place .
Go through one drawer at a time — do n’t jump from one drawer to another .
Commitments
Aside from physical clutter , our lives are often way too cluttered by the things we need to do — at work , at home , in our civic or religious lives , with our hobbies , with friends and family , etc .
Go through each area of your life , and write down every commitment you have — from things you ’ve volunteered or agreed to do on a regular basis , to meetings and sports games and other things you do every month or week .
It can be overwhelming .
Now examine each one , and decide if it truly gives you joy and value in your life , and whether it ’s worth the time you commit to it .
It can be useful to just choose a few of the commitments that your really love doing .
Get rid of all the rest .
Just call people and tell them your schedule is too busy , and you have to decline .
Learn to say no !
One by one , eliminate the commitments in your life that do n’t give you value , and you ’ll have more time to do the stuff that ’s really important to you — stuff for yourself , or your loved ones .
Routines
It is extremely useful to examine your daily and weekly routines .
Often , we do n’t have any set routines , and we tackle our chores , regular tasks , and obligations haphazardly .
This leads to chaotic days and weeks , and often a drop in productivity .
It ’s better to batch like tasks together — do all your errands at once , for example , or all your laundry at once instead of throughout the week .
Write down all of your weekly and daily obligations , chores , tasks , etc. and plan out a weekly and daily routine .
Post it up where you can see it and try to follow it , at least for a week .
It could bring some calmness and simplicity to your life that had n’t been there before .
Be sure to schedule time for decluttering in your weekly routine !
Systems
Once you ’ve purged clutter from your life , it will inevitably start to creep back in .
To keep from having a cluttered life again , you need to set up systems that will keep the clutter to a minimum .
Examine how you do things , how things come into your life , and see if you can create a simple system for everything : chores , laundry , paperwork , email , RSS feeds , yardwork , errands , work projects , filing .
And then write down your systems , step by step , and try to follow them .
If your systems are set up right , you will continually purge clutter you do n’t need .
For example , a system for paperwork might look like this :
All incoming papers go in inbox .

If your systems are set up right , you will continually purge clutter you do n’t need .
For example , a system for paperwork might look like this :
At the end of each day , inbox is processed .
Rules for processing : toss , route , file , do , or write on to - do list to do later and put it in “ action file ” .
Process to empty , leaving no papers in inbox or on desk .
Clear desk of any working papers .

Sleepy people may have a harder time comprehending speech .
Next time you whisper sweet nothings to the object of your affections as they peacefully doze off , do n't be surprised if they can't remember a word of it the next morning .
Neuroscientists have shown that the brain 's pathways for deciphering speech , and forming memories of it , switch off as anaesthetized patients begin to nod off .
They suspect the same holds true for normal , non -drug - induced sleep .
He may not remember a thing you say ...
Getty
Researchers led by Matt Davis of the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge , UK , studied 12 volunteers under the influence of varying amounts of an anaesthetic called propofol , which induced varying levels of drowsiness .
They played them recordings of speech or other sounds , and monitored their brains using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging .
The volunteers ' brains were more active in response to speech than to generic noise , suggesting that they still recognised spoken words .
But the part of the brain involved with the more subtle job of untangling words that can have alternative meanings depending on context or spelling ( such as ' bark ' , or ' pear / pair ' ) showed no activity in the drowsiest volunteers .
Neither did the part involved with forming memories of speech .
This suggests that the brain simply shuts down higher - level aspects of speech recognition as sleep starts to set in , making it hard to remember or understand what was said in the moments before sleep .
The results appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1 .
The results also show that speech comprehension can suffer even when only lightly sedated , or when slightly sleepy , says anaesthetist David Menon of the University of Cambridge , who also worked on the study .
This , he adds , would explain why " when you 're falling asleep when your wife is telling you something , sometimes you do n't remember it " .
Brain activity when listening to language ( left ) and ambiguous words ( right ) , when awake ( top ) or sleepy ( bottom ) .
MRC
Asleep or awake
Menon and his colleagues hope that this type of work might one day help them to discover more about the degree of awareness experienced by patients in operating theatres .
Data on how many people are aware of , or have memories of , their operations , are sketchy .
But the overall figure is estimated at as much as 0.2 % of patients .
That incidence may be even higher in certain procedures in which anaesthetists err on the side of caution and administer less anaesthetic , such as caesarian sections , heart surgeries and operations on elderly people .
So researchers are keen for improved methods for gauging the level of awareness among people under anaesthetic .
" We do n't want to overdose but we want to provide a measure of how much is ' enough ' anaesthetic , " Menon says .
Mind readers
Menon admits that it is difficult to know , simply by scanning the brain , exactly what the patient is experiencing .
But he hopes that more studies of lightly sedated healthy volunteers will yield accurate descriptions of their cognitive experience to go with their brain readings .
" This has to be seen as a first step , where we try and calibrate brain responses , " Menon says .
He notes that because memory seems to be impaired before other functions relating to awareness , patients may be aware of their operations but have no explicit memories of them afterwards .
This could potentially lead to post - traumatic stress disorder or a worse recovery without the patient knowing why or being able to tell doctors what had happened .
" They might be aware of ongoing events but we 'd never know about it , " Menon says .

Another area in which such work could be useful is in measuring the cognitive experience of people in vegetative or minimally conscious states .
Although these conditions feature little or no outward signs of consciousness , previous research has shown that patients can potentially achieve remarkable feats , such as mentally walking around a house or even imagining themselves playing tennis ( see Thoughts of woman in ' waking coma ' revealed )
Once every 42 years , the angle between Uranus and the Earth is perfectly lined up so that the planet ’s rings are seen edge on .
Since the rings were only discovered back in 1977 , this is the first opportunity astronomers will have to view the planet without the glare and dust from the rings .
It does n’t happen on a specific date , though , it ’s a little more complicated than that .
Because the Earth goes around the Sun much more quickly than Uranus , there are actually three separate times that Uranus and the Earth line up perfectly : May 3 and August 16 in 2007 , and then February 20 in 2008 .
Unfortunately , during that last point , the Sun will be directly in between our two planets , so we wo n’t be able to see Uranus .
The first to image Uranus during this special occasion was a team of astronomers from UC Berkeley .
They imaged Uranus on May 28th with the near infrared camera and adaptive optics on the W.M. Keck II telescope atop Hawaii ’s Mauna Kea .
Their images revealed the nearly edge on ring appearing as a bright line passing right through Uranus .
The next images come from Hubble , taken on August 14th .
Hubble captured its images on nearly the precise moment when the rings were aligned with the Earth , showing similar features to the Keck image , and also seeing some recently discovered outer rings .
The outermost ring , seen by Hubble , is difficult to view in infrared .
Astronomers are hoping these images will reveal more details about the moons that help tend the ring , called Cordelia and Ophelia , keeping it in place .
But it ’s also thought that there are additional moons in the region , helping to tend all 9 rings .
This precise geometry might allow the telescopes to reveal moons that would normally be lost in the glare of the rings .
One other important date :
“ December 7 is the Uranian equinox , when the rings are perfectly edge - on to the sun , and after that , there is a brief period again when we will view the dark side of the rings , before they become illuminated again for another 42 years , ” said Heidi B. Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colorado .

Perhaps this is old news to most bayblabbers but I just found out about this recently .
Apparently , group size is a function of relative neocortical volume in nonhuman primates .
Meaning larger brained primates hang out in larger numbers .
This correlation was first described in 1990 .
It is thought that a larger brain size allows an individual to keep track of its social network to which it must use to the best of its ability in order to be as reproductively successful as possible .
Social interactions among primates are maintained by social grooming .
And the time devoted to social grooming is linearly related to group size among the Old World monkeys and apes .
So then based on my human brain size , how much time should I be grooming my friends and indeed how many friends can I have ??
Awesome questions , answered by Dunbar , R.I.M .
In a paper published in 1993 , Dunbar explains how language enables us to more efficiently groom our friends , because based on our brain size , we should be grooming about 150 people .
Especially with modern humans grooming obsession this would be extremely time consuming without just being able to chat .
Dunbar suggests in fact that 60 % of human conversations are about personal experiences and gossip , thus fulfilling its role as a social networking tool .
One hundred and fifty friends then is also known as Dunbar 's number .
I ran into a very interesting article that discusses the concept of Dunbar 's number and how it applies to modern society .
Apparently just through trial and error the military has been aware of Dunbar 's number before it was proposed .
And some companies , like Gore - Tex , use this number for company structuring .
An absolute KILLER blog entry at http://www.lifewithalacrity.com does an awesome job of discussing Dunbar 's number and attempts to challenge it using data from online networks and massive multiplayer online games and their guild sizes .
Check the ganked graph I ganked from that website .
On a podcast I remember stating that I thought that language evolution was all about the meme ie .
being able to learn survival abstractly from others in the group and being able to pass on behaviors that can evolve faster than biology .
I guess I was wrong and it's all about being able to gossip so that you can have a bigger group with which to beat down the smaller groups .
We have already reported on the recent survey showing massive support for the Cape Wind project from people who live in Massachusetts ( both on Cape cod and state wide ) .
And now Greenpeace is airing television ads in Massachusetts ( starting today ) targeting Rep. William Delahunt and Sen. Edward Kennedy .
The lawmakers continue to oppose the Cape Wind project , to be sited in Nantucket Sound off of Cape Cod , which is slated to be the first offshore wind energy installation in the United States .
The ads will air this week and next , and again the week of September 10 , to set the record straight after a misleading radio ad campaign by Cape Wind opponents .
“ As the birthplace of American independence , Massachusetts finds itself in a position to again spark revolution , this time in the fight for independence from dirty and dangerous energy , ” said Greenpeace global warming campaigner Katherine Smolski .
“ Our elected leaders owe future generations of Americans the chance to escape the climate crisis and breathe clean air .
That is why Senator Kennedy and Representative Delahunt should no longer cater to the interests of the wealthy few and fully support the Cape Wind project , ” she continued .
Having already passed the Commonwealth ’s environmental impact review , the Army Corps of Engineers review , and been certified as having no significant impact on the marine environment , navigational safety and shipping lanes , the Cape Wind project has endured an approval process lasting over six years .
Public desire for action on global warming prevented Sen .
Kennedy from killing the project through a backdoor deal brokered with Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens ( who I might ad just got his house searched by the FBI and also the series of tubes guy . ) , in part stoked by a Greenpeace television spot exposing Kennedy ’s hypocrisy .
The wind turbines would be within eyesight of the Kennedy compound and the homes of other wealthy residents .
One further step in the approval process , the publication of the federal draft environmental impact statement by the U.S. Department of Interior ’s Mineral Management Service ( MMS ) is expected this fall .
“ Cape Wind ’s opponents have been misleading the public about the impacts the project will have on the economy and environment of the Cape and Islands .
A clean energy project that would provide 75 percent of the electricity needs of the Cape and Islands is the answer , ” added Smolski .
“ These leaders know that global warming could eventually put the Massachusetts coast under water ; protecting the view from the Kennedy compound is not the leadership that neither Massachusetts nor the United States needs , ” she concluded .
Greenpeace members and supporters of the Cape Wind project will be attending public meetings in the coming months to show that citizens stand on the side of common sense and sound science in making Massachusetts a leader in renewable energy .

Facebook LAS VEGAS ( AP )  Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she followed all Senate rules when she accepted rides on a private jet from a longtime benefactor .
" Whatever I 've done , I complied with Senate rules at the time .
That 's the way every senator operates , " the Democratic presidential contender said in an interview with The Associated Press during a campaign stop in Las Vegas .
The travel and consulting fees paid to Clinton 's husband have come to light recently in a lawsuit against Vinod Gupta , a Clinton contributor and chief executive of the data company , InfoUSA Inc .
The lawsuit by company shareholders accuses Gupta of excessively spending millions of dollars , including $ 900,000 worth of travel on the Clintons .
Sen. Clinton , who complained about corporate America 's largesse and skyrocketing executive pay during campaign events Wednesday , said she did not believe her message was undermined by her acceptance of the private flights .
In line with Senate rules then in effect , Clinton 's campaign has said she reimbursed Gupta at the cost of a first - class flight , typically a significant discount off the expense of a private jet .
" Those were the rules .
You 'll have to ask somebody else whether that 's good policy , " she said .
The Senate earlier this year voted to change the rules to require senators , their staff and candidates for federal office to pay the charter rate for flights on corporate jets .
All the presidential candidates serving in the Senate , including Clinton , voted for the change .
Clinton struck several populist notes Wednesday in a speech at a union hall and at a town hall appearance at a North Las Vegas high school with large number of minority and low - income students .
The senator told members of the Culinary Workers Union , a group that represents casino and hotel workers , that it should be made easier for unions to winning Nevada 's Jan. 19 caucus .
The senator made light of her own personal wealth .
" I know a lot of rich people .
My husband and I never had any money ... now all the sudden we 're rich , " Clinton said .
" I have nothing against rich people .
... but what made America great is the American middle class . "
Clinton won her loudest applause with her promise to end the war in Iraq .
In the AP interview , she defended her vote against an Iraq war funding bill , saying she believes that President Bush will begin withdrawing troops from Iraq soon and she does n't want to back his strategy any longer .
Clinton said she came to the conclusion while watching the president 's Rose Garden news conference last week in which he referred to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group report .
" He talked about it favorably for the first time I 've ever heard him talk about it , " Clinton said .
" That was to me a big signal that starting in the fall and toward the end of the year we 're going to start seeing troops withdrawn from Iraq .
" My argument is , why wait ? "
Among other things , the Iraq Study Group warned against sending more troops for long stints in the war zone and initially called for withdrawal by early 2008 .
Clinton and her chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , voted against the funding bill last week in the face of strong pressure from liberal groups who wanted Democrats to use the bill to force a change of course .
Clinton earlier supported a bill calling for a withdrawal timeline , which was vetoed by the president .
Clinton initially opposed cutting off funding for the troops , but said Wednesday that she believed last week 's vote was cast in support of soldiers abroad .
" The best thing I can do to continue my very vigorous support of the troops is to begin to bring them home , " she said .
Clinton declined to comment on two unreleased biographies that , according to press accounts , describe the former first lady 's road to her candidacy in unflattering terms .
She said she was n't familiar with the books .
Clinton acknowledged an assertion reportedly contained in one of the books : that she did not read a National Intelligence Estimate before voting to authorize the president to go to war in Iraq .
" I do n't believe that I did or that vast majority of my colleagues did because we were briefed repeatedly about everything that was in it , " she said .

Civil unions between male couples existed around 600 years ago in medieval Europe , a historian now says .
Historical evidence , including legal documents and gravesites , can be interpreted as supporting the prevalence of homosexual relationships hundreds of years ago , said Allan Tulchin of Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania .
If accurate , the results indicate socially sanctioned same - sex unions are nothing new , nor were they taboo in the past .
“ Western family structures have been much more varied than many people today seem to realize , " Tulchin writes in the September issue of the Journal of Modern History .
" And Western legal systems have in the past made provisions for a variety of household structures . ”
For example , he found legal contracts from late medieval France that referred to the term " affrèrement , " roughly translated as brotherment .
Similar contracts existed elsewhere in Mediterranean Europe , Tulchin said .
In the contract , the " brothers " pledged to live together sharing " un pain , un vin , et une bourse , " ( that 's French for one bread , one wine and one purse ) .
The " one purse " referred to the idea that all of the couple 's goods became joint property .
Like marriage contracts , the " brotherments " had to be sworn before a notary and witnesses , Tulchin explained .
The same type of legal contract of the time also could provide the foundation for a variety of non-nuclear households , including arrangements in which two or more biological brothers inherited the family home from their parents and would continue to live together , Tulchin said .
But non-relatives also used the contracts .
In cases that involved single , unrelated men , Tulchin argues , these contracts provide “ considerable evidence that the affrèrés were using affrèrements to formalize same - sex loving relationships . "
The ins-and - outs of the medieval relationships are tricky at best to figure out .

Exclusive : ABC News Obtains Text of Blackwater Immunity Deal ABC
News has learned details of an immunity deal given to Blackwater guards .
Oct. 30 , 2007  -- ABC
News has learned the exact wording of the immunity deal the State Department granted Blackwater security guards involved in a September shooting incident that left 17 Iraqis dead .
The security guards were given a limited immunity called " use immunity " in exchange for giving sworn statements about their involvement in the Sept. 16 shooting incident .
The wording of the immunity is included at the beginning of the Blackwater guards ' sworn statements , which have been obtained by ABC News .
In each of the statements , the guards begin by saying " I understand this statement is being given in furtherance of an official administrative inquiry , " and that , " I further understand that neither my statements nor any information or evidence gained by reason of my statements can be used against me in a criminal proceeding , except that if I knowingly and willfully provide false statements or information , I may be criminally prosecuted for that action under 18 United States Code , Section 1001 . "
The immunity deal was granted in the immediate aftermath of the shooting by State Department officials in Iraq who were under intense pressure to quickly explain what happened in the face of allegations by Iraqi officials that the contractors murdered civilians in cold blood .
News of the immunity deal caught State Department officials in Washington off guard .
" If anyone gave such immunity it was done so without consulting senior leadership at State , " a senior State Department official initially told ABC News .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack would not comment directly on the immunity given to the security guards , but said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is determined to hold anybody guilty of wrongdoing accountable .
" Secretary Rice 's attitude is that if there are individuals who broke rules , laws or regulations they must be held to account , " McCormack told reporters .
" Every action that she has taken during the course of the aftermath of this incident has been consistent with that approach . "
McCormack refused to discuss the specific shooting and the subsequent investigation .
However , he did say that the State Department " would not have asked the FBI and the Department of Justice to get involved in a case that we did not think that they could potentially prosecute . "
" The kinds of , quote , ' immunity ' that I 've seen reported in the press would not preclude a successful criminal prosecution , " he insisted .
" The Department of State can not immunize an individual from federal criminal prosecution , " he added .
McCormack refused to answer questions as to whether the type of immunity provided to the Blackwater guards would in fact make prosecution much harder , citing the ongoing investigation .
" The secretary does n't want us to say anything that would potentially jeopardize an ongoing investigation , " he said .
Scope of Immunity Is Limited
The immunity granted to the Blackwater guards is more limited in scope than so - called " transactional immunity " which would prevent any proscution for the alleged crimes .
But the immunity granted to the guards means that anything said in the statements -- and anything learned as a result of the statements -- cannot be used by prosecutors .
" It 's a nightmare for prosecutors , " said legal expert Eugene Fidell .
Even without immunity , however , it would be extremely difficult to prosecute the Blackwater security guards in U.S. courts .
Shortly after the Sept. 16 Blackwater incident , Secretary Rice dispatched a panel of experts to Iraq to examine the use of private security contractors .
The panel 's report , drafted by Ambassador Patrick Kennedy , concluded that even if a private security guard committed cold - blooded murder , there may be no legal basis for prosecuting the guard in U.S. courts under current law .
" The panel is unaware of any basis for holding non-Department of Defense contractors accountable under U.S. law , " the report concluded .
Lately I 've been filled with an eerie , sickening feeling that I can only remember feeling once before .
Once , a few years ago I had this feeling for only a few moments , and I remember it distinctly .
It was the evening before hurricaine Charley passed over my house .
As a native of Seattle , I had never experienced a hurricaine before .
Part of me looked forward to it , while the other part of me was afraid as I knew it was dangerous .
It was in the early evening , and the first feeder bands had just passed over .
It was getting dark , but the sky was clear .
I remember walking out into the backyard , and that 's when it hit me .
I did n't hear anything .
There were none of the usual sounds of birds or squirrels , nor any other creature out that evening .
I looked up to the sky , and it was as though it were any other evening , except for the strange silence .
Day was turning to dusk , and had I not heard the news , I 'd have never known what was coming .
But the birds and squirrels knew .
Today that same feeling exists in me every moment of every day .
For the last month or so , since the US Dollar began its nosedive , I 've known that the storm is coming .
I first realized this storm was headed our way more than ten years ago , but back then we had leadership that was working toward diverting it .
Over the past six years , our leadership has done the opposite , and the storm has been encouraged , strengthened , and emboldened to become the monster it is today .
And now the monster is upon us .
Events of the past week make it clear that the storm is just over the horizon .
We have begun to see the feeder bands , with events like the Fed 's rate cut , and Hugo Chavez 's announcement that Venezuela will now trade for their oil in currencies other than the dollar .
There were even indications of something similar from Saudi Arabia .
Each day the entities holding massive numbers of dollars overseas take enormous losses as their dollars decline in value .
Every day the value of the dollar falls , every day more dollars are pumped into the system , and every day the prices on everything rise .
People are becoming more and more desperate , but slowly enough for most people not to notice .
Like before , you would n't know the storm was coming - unless you 'd heard the news .
Most people have n't heard - certainly not those who only get their news from the mainstream media , and that actually is relatively fortunate , as their blissful ignorance is the only thing holding our economy together .
But as the storm approaches , and people begin to see the lightning and hear the thunder , it will become clear to them what we are facing .
People will begin to panic when they realize the storm has arrived and they have n't prepared .
Their windows wo n't be boarded , and their patio furniture will begin flying right into their living rooms .
Once that happens , nobody can predict what we will face from this monster storm , our panic stricken and desperate countrymen , or from our outlaw government .
A few things are certain though .
This storm is worse than any hurricane , and it wo n't be something that will pass overnight .
It will be a very long time before we can begin to come out of our shelters and survey the damage .
I can't say exactly when the storm will strike , as I do n't have the most advanced satellite imaging equipment , but it is n't far away .
If you go outside right now and look just over the horizon , you can feel it .
The birds and the squirrels know it too .

Teach the zombies to dance , or they 'll eat your brains too !
I remember Jeff Han ‘s talk on TED , introducing to the crowd his stunning demo of a multi- touch and multi-user screen interface .
It was the first time I had heard of such screens and naturally , my first thought was : Minority Report has finally arrived .
The technology is already being commercialized and we start witnessing the emergence of products using these new interfaces , such as Microsoft Surface or even the iPhone with it ’s two fingers multi-touch .
For those who are unfamiliar with multi - touch I added a link to Han ’s demo .
Although , this technology did seem quite complex to me at first , I discovered that a few people were already trying to build their very own surfaces at home .
Information about such projects is somewhat scarce but I ’ve found a video I thought was most helpful and self explanatory .
What is missing in the video is the rear projection mechanism that normally projects the computer screen back on the multi - touch surface .
To clarify such aspects , not encompassed in the movie , I ’ve also included a link to a step by step explanation on how to build the complete multi- touch screen .
I was n’t able to verify the validity of certain links to the required software , so if you think you can help please dont hesitate .
In the meantime , enjoy the show …
Programming Erlang — Software For A Concurrent World
( ISBN 10193435600X ) is part of the pragmatic programmer series .
As with all the books in this series , it is available in paperback or for a reduced cost you can directly download it in PDF format ( which is always useful if you spend a lot of time on the move and you do not like carrying around a dead tree with you ) .
The book 's format and layout as with all the books of this series are clear and logical .
The book is written by Joe Armstrong , who co-authored the first Erlang book a decade ago .
He was also one of the originators of the Erlang language and has been directly connected to its development ever since .
We can therefore be assured about the author 's knowledge and insight into the language , if not his impartiality .
The book itself can be roughly split into three main sections : Getting started and Sequential programming , Concurrent Programming and Erlang libraries and advanced Erlang techniques .
In Chapter 1 the author sets out his stall of why Erlang is worthy of your attention .
It 's clear from this chapter that the author feels Erlang 's strength lies in applications requiring an element concurrency and fault tolerance .
Another emphasis is made of running Erlang on modern multi-core processors , something that was only a glint in a hardware designer 's eye 10 years ago , but is rapidly becoming an issue in all areas of programming .
From this chapter you also get a feel on how the author approaches his programming in that he states that he wants the reader to have fun with the language , which is a refreshing change to some language text books whose main purpose appears to be as a cure for insomnia .
Chapter 2 goes through installing Erlang and the Erlang shell ( a command line environment similar to ones with languages such as perl ) .
The chapter also starts us into the strange world of functional programming , where variables can only be given a value once ( e.g you cannot do i=i+1 ) , recursion replace loops and pattern matching replaces assignments .
Fortunately the Erlang language is remarkably concise .
For example there are only 4 data types .
However to those coming from a purely procedural programming background the learning curve could be a steep one .
Saying that the Author does a good job of leading you through the languages intricacies with examples being compared to code from languages such as Java to help keep your feet on solid programming ground .
The next 3 chapters move on to writing simple Erlang programs .
As a quick aside , for anyone new to Erlang it is well worth examining the quicksort implementation described in chapter 3 .
Its conciseness and simplicity was one of the reasons the language won me over when I first met the language .
These chapters also cover error detection and handling .
It 's worth noting that Erlang has a philosophy of ensuring programs fail hard , so that bugs can be weeded out at an early stage .
This idea very much defines how Erlang error handling is defined .
One criticism of the first section is Chapter 6 , which describes compiling and running an Erlang program .
I would have preferred that this information be covered earlier in the book or be placed in an appendix because it is probably an area you will want to reference repeatedly .
Chapter 7 is where things really get interesting and the true power of Erlang starts to come to the fore .
This is where Erlang 's concurrency credentials are explained .
This chapter begins by providing some useful metaphors of the Erlang concurrent model , but chapter 8 is where the fun begins by describing the Erlang concurrency primitives that allow the creation of processes and the process communication methods .
The author here highlights one of the language features , the Erlang light weight process .
These are true processes ( not threads ) but take up very little in the way of resources .
Indeed it is not unusual to have 1000's of such processes running in an application .
The next few chapters expand on the available concurrency primitives and how to move from concurrency on your local processor to concurrency utilizing the resources of multiple machines either on a local network or across the web .
It finishes the section off by showing the example of a simple IRC application .
Chapter 12 starts the next section by looking at how to interact with the world outside the Erlang environment .
First it examines how to interface an Erlang program to applications written in other languages such as C .
It then goes onto to look at file and socket handling in Erlang .
Chapter 15 looks at two important Erlang storage primitives ETS and DETS before we get to the OTP Erlang libraries in Chapter 16 .
The OTP libraries are the standard Erlang libraries and tools .
In fact the OTP libraries are worthy of a book in itself .
The author highlights the section on the generic Server module as the most important section in the whole book and one to be reread until its importance has sunk in .
This is because here are encapsulated many of the lessons learned in writing industrial fault - tolerant applications , such the updating of a running applications code without causing that application to miss a beat .
The section is finished off by describing the Erlang distributed database ( humorously named Mnesia ) and then finishing it off with the example of a simple server application .
The book finishes off by looking at Erlang on multicore systems including its support for SMP .
As the author states this is the leading edge of present day Erlang and is still under development .
I would like to thank the pragmatic programmers for publishing this book .
Erlang 's profile has been in need of highlighting for many years and hopefully this book will help .
The book definitely provides a great starting point for anyone who wants to get to grips with the language and takes them to the point where they can start writing useful applications .
This book is a worthy successor to the last book published and does a good job of both updating the material and explaining some of the later developments such as SMP .
Anyone who has a need for writing fault tolerant applications should at least look at this book .
If nothing else you will never be afraid of dealing with recursion ever again .
In many ways the book cuts off just when things are getting interesting .
There are hints in the book about real world Erlang 's applications and it would have been good if some of these experiences could have been expanded .
Hopefully this book is the start of increased exposure for Erlang .
If so then someone may get around to writing another Erlang book describing some of the advanced issues about generating robust applications .
I just hope it wo n't take another 10 years this time .
Tony Pedley is a senior engineer specializing in real - time embedded systems .
In his spare time he likes to tease windows programmers and confuse managers by telling them it would be a lot easier if we wrote it in Erlang .

in response to d c
While still in high school ( and a few months of casual C++ ) , I bought the GoF book because the comments on Amazon said I should .
I barely knew how to design a class , forget groking the whole polymorphic thing .
I put the book on a shelf , not picking it up until my first year in College .
Reading and comprehending it for the first time was a mind - altering experience .
It is one of the few non-religious books that becomes more meaningful each time it is read .

in response to Paul - Michael Bauer Despite having studied C++ at university and used it for a couple of years , it was n't until reading Design Patterns that I finally ' got ' OO .
Pattern Hatching provides an engaging insight into the mind of a clear - thinking proponent of good design .
The field of computing does n't often produce leaders who are almost universally respected for their contributions .
Mr Vlissides was one of the few to achieve such status .
