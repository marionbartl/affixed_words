Google is a great tool to compare the popularity of searches in a similar niche .
When the number of people searching for something goes up , it is often a sign of increased popularity .
We take a look at the search volume for three popular BitTorrent clients , how this changed over time , and how it differs worldwide .
Google insights graphs the search volume for the keywords you choose , and allows you to compare searches over time .
We decided to take a look at three frequently used BitTorrent clients : uTorrent , Azureus ( now Vuze ) and BitComet .
Below is a graphical representation of the search volume over time .
The graph clearly shows that Azureus was the most searched for client until the beginning of 2007 , followed by BitComet .
From then on , uTorrent took over and it continued to grow while BitComet and Azureus searches slowly decreased .
Search statistics are of course only an indirect measure of the popularity of a BitTorrent client , but the graphs seem to follow the same pattern as actual usage statistics which we have reported before .
Search volume comparison
Worldwide
Another measure that is worth looking into is the geographical distribution of the searches .
It is interesting to see how popular BitComet is in Asia .
Currently , it is ( based on searches ) the preferred client in China , Taiwan , Thailand , Malaysia and Hong Kong .
However , uTorrent is most often searched for in most countries , especially in Moldova .
Azureus , on the other hand , is a popular search term in Greece .
u Torrent search volume worldwide
US
If we take a closer look at the US ( you can do this for any country ) , we see that pretty much every BitTorrent client is popular in California .
The graph shows that most uTorrent searches ( relatively ) come from Kentucky and California , Milpitas in particular .
Azureus seems to be quite popular in Ohio , specifically in Salt Lake City .
BitComet is the least searched for client of the three , but gets most search traffic from New York and California again , Monterey Park on this occasion .
u Torrent search volume in the US
Overall I would say that based on other statistics , the search data is a pretty close match to the actual BitTorrent client preferences .
Google ’s insights on the regional differences certainly have something to add to what we already know , but keep in mind that they are only search statistics .
Most of all , it ’s a fun tool to play around with on a Sunday afternoon when there ’s not much news to go around .
Tories accuse Darling of ' giant con ' over plans to raise taxes after recession is over
Chancellor Alistair Darling said the recession will be ' short and sharp '
Alistair Darling came under fire from the Tories today after he appeared to hint that taxes will rise in the long term to fund the Government 's borrowing spree .
The Chancellor signalled that Britain will suffer a short , sharp recession , claiming that it would bounce back into growth in 2010 .
But in a newspaper interview , he also suggested that taxes would have to go up to fund rising borrowing , stating ' at some stage you have to pay for it ' .
He predicted the economy could shrink by 1 per cent next year and that the recession would be harsh .
However , it will be over by 2010 , when the economy would recover quickly and strongly , he told the Independent .
' We are going into recession but I remain confident that we will get through it ' , he said .
Mr Darling added that the Government had to get ' sharper and smarter ' as he outlined his plans to raise taxes in the coming years to bring borrowing back under control .
' It is right to let borrowing rise .
It is also important that we come back into balance over the medium term ' , he said .
' The basic principle is to support the economy now but you have got to make sure you live within your means . '
His report on November 24 is likely to show a big increase in public borrowing from £ 43 biliion to £ 65 billion , for which he will blame falling government revenues .
While the government has been keen to avoid using the ' R ' word , Mr Darling 's comments are being seen as the clearest indication yet that a recession will happen .
His views come after Bank of England governor Mervyn King said he was ready to reduce rates to ‘ whatever level is necessary ’ to counter the economic storm .
That could mean interest rates being slashed to zero for the first time as the Bank of England battles the deepening recession .
Mr King warned Britain ’s economy could shrink by at least 2 per cent during 2009 , pushing inflation into negative territory for the first time in almost half a century .
A worst - case scenario could see a slump of more than 3 per cent in gross domestic product , the biggest year - on - year fall since the beginning of 1981 .
Mervyn King said that interest rates will have to fall even further
Former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke , who led Britain ’s recovery from Black Wednesday , warned the economy was heading for a ‘ catastrophic crisis ’ far worse than ‘ anything that has occurred in my lifetime ’ .
‘ There will be a very serious recession next year , ’ he said .
‘ I think the big problem in 2009 will be the catastrophic fall in consumer spending demand , spending in shops will get worse . ’
The Bank confirmed the country has already entered its first recession since the early 1990s , blaming the slump in lending and chaos in the financial markets .
It said national output will fall at an annual pace of around 2 per cent by the middle of 2009 .
Inflation will drop to 1 per cent .
However many warn that deflation - where prices for goods actually fall - may be on the horizon .
Jobless numbers are also set to rise ‘ significantly ’ for the next two years , driving down incomes , the Bank warned in the wake of a surge in unemployment figures .
Separately , more than a million people are now struggling with their mortgages because of the credit crunch , its quarterly inflation report showed .
The grim assessment came as Gordon Brown again hinted at temporary tax cuts - funded by Government borrowing - to be unveiled in a Pre-Budget report on November 24 .
The Prime Minister told MPs : ‘ I think that people are beginning to understand that we are dealing with a new situation of low inflation next year , a downturn and a credit crunch .
‘ And that requires very special measures indeed to deal with unprecedented circumstances . ’
Mr Brown insisted there was growing international support for a ‘ fiscal stimulus ’ package , code for tax - cutting measures .
Meanwhile , former Labour deputy leadership candidate Jon Cruddas said yesterday Mr Brown should drop his mantra that Britain was well placed to weather the crisis .
He said : ‘ We have to put behind us some of these slogans , some of the language of more benign economic [ times ] .
‘ This is a very different environment and it demands very different remedies . ’
Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Philip Hammond said : ‘ One by one senior Labour MPs are lining up to tell us what Gordon Brown ca n’t bring himself to admit .
‘ Yesterday the Welfare Minister let the cat out of the bag by telling us that taxes would have to rise to pay for more borrowing .
‘ Now we have a former Labour deputy leadership contender saying the Prime Minister should abandon his ridiculous claim that Britain is well prepared for the recession .
‘ It ’s good to know that at least some Labour MPs are prepared to be straight with people . ’
Asked whether interest rates would have to be slashed to zero , Mr King yesterday repeatedly refused to rule out the drastic measure .
The Monetary Policy Committee ’s quarterly growth and inflation outlook came less than a week after it axed rates by 1.5 percentage points to 3 per cent .
Perils of Deflation
The Bank of England yesterday warned there is a 20 per cent chance the UK could spiral into deflation in 2010 .
Deflation is the inverse of inflation , and is seen as one of the worst economic diseases a country can catch .
It involves a massive squeeze on lending , which leads to sustained falls in prices on the High Street .
The Bank of England 's rate - setters slashed the price of borrowing by 1.5 per cent
The costs of food , clothing , cars , electronic goods , and services plummet as companies are forced to repeatedly slash prices .
This can drive thousands of firms out of business and send unemployment to stratospheric levels .
For those with large debts , the consequences are disastrous .
During inflation , debts become easier to service over time as the value of money is eroded .
But with deflation the opposite happens , resulting in rocketing debt defaults and more trouble for the banking sector .
This last struck the U.S. and European economies during the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The administration ’s position would give the health and human services secretary “ enormous discretion ” to determine the amount paid for every item and service covered by Medicare , without reference to the detailed formulas set by Congress , Judge Kennedy said .
“ This flies in the face of the detailed statutory provisions , ” he added .
Over the years , Medicare officials have often tried to adopt regulations that allow them to consider cost in deciding whether the program should cover various goods and services .
Health care providers , manufacturers and some patients ’ advocates have resisted these efforts , saying that coverage decisions should be made based on clinical effectiveness and not cost .
“ We are disappointed with the ruling and continue to believe that our policy is supported by the statute , ” Peter L. Ashkenaz , a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said Monday .
“ We are still considering our options and next steps . ”
Federal health officials said the decision would make it more difficult to rein in Medicare costs .
Judge Kennedy found that Medicare and some of its contractors had unlawfully limited payments for DuoNeb , an inhalation drug taken through a nebulizer , which turns the medicine into a fine mist .
The drug , made by Dey , a unit of Mylan Inc. , makes breathing easier by opening up the bronchial tubes .
A single dose provides a combination of two commonly prescribed bronchodilators , albuterol and ipratropium .

Money Morning
Having spawned the worst market for stocks since the Great Depression , the global financial crisis is forcing investors to re-examine a number of long - held beliefs .
Gold bugs , for instance , have been left to wonder just how gold prices could backpedal in the face of all - time - record demand .
Gold demand did increase – in fact , by a record 45 % from the second quarter to the third .
Retail demand was the primary catalyst , spiking 121 % to 232 tons .
And because of it , bullion dealers reported shortages in bars and coins , according to the World Gold Council , a gold - mining - industry association .
“ Gold ’s universal role as a store of value has shone through during this quarter helping attract investors and consumers to all forms of gold ownership , ” James E. Burton , chief executive officer of the World Gold Council .
However , if you ’d just looked at gold ’s performance alone , you ’d never be able to tell demand was so strong .
Indeed , in the third quarter alone , gold prices tumbled almost 6 % – and were actually down as much as 20 % , until a mid-September rebound narrowed that loss .
Then came “ Black October . ”
The worldwide financial crisis continued to punish stocks , slashing the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 14 % .
At the same time , however , in a disconcerting surprise for gold investors , yellow - metal prices plummeted 17 % .
Why ?
The financial crisis is apparently once again taking long - held market truisms – and forcing investors to question the validity of their beliefs , namely :
That gold should act as a safe haven against the global recession most economists believe has just begun .
And that when demand for gold moves up , prices should do the same .
“ Gold is not a safe haven against recession , ” said Money Morning ’s Martin Hutchinson , an investment banker with more than 25 years ’ experience on Wall Street and a leading expert on the international financial markets .
“ It ’s a safe haven against inflation . ”
And it just so happens that , in October , consumer prices dropped at the fastest rate in the 61 years that the Labor Department has been keeping records .
And as far as gold prices go , demand for gold is n’t as widespread as the World Gold Council would have you think .
Overall demand was a record ; that ’s no fluke .
And most of that came from the retail side .
But like common tradable stocks , institutional demand exerts much more influence on the market than consumer - led retail demand .
As markets collapsed , institutions and hedge funds were forced to liquidate assets across the board .
This so - called “ de - leveraging ” is taking place for a number of reasons , but one is due simply to asset allocation issues .
Simply put , institutional investors typically employ an asset - allocation model that ’s designed to manage risk and maximize returns by setting a percentage for each category of assets .
Those ratios can change over time as some assets surge in value , while others hold steady or even decline .
Thus , assets that performed well while others tanked could now comprise 20 % of the portfolio ’s value , instead of once accounting for 15 % .
And these multi-billion - dollar portfolios are often controlled by precise asset allocation guidelines that set strict maximums and minimums for each asset category .
For example , Harvard ’s endowment aims to have 13 % of its portfolio to be composed of “ private equity ” investments .
But private equity now accounts for more than its assigned allocation .
So , to get back to that 13 % target , it ’s selling $ 1.5 billion in private equity assets , according to Fortune .
One purpose of such asset - allocation models is to prevent a massive loss in case one class of assets takes a big hit .
But in this case , institutions are selling gold because , in the third quarter , it only fell 6 % , while the rest of the stock market skidded 14 % .
The logic is confounding , but the bottom line gold ’s value is incredibly suppressed considering demand has moved at an all - time high .
Two Catalysts For Gold ’s 2009 Climb
The U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Oct. 10 Crop Production Report said acreage for a handful of staple food commodities has shrunk :
Corn acreage fell 1.2 % .
Soybean acreage dropped 1.4 % .
Canola acreage dropped 1.9 % .
Sunflower acreage shrank 0.8 % .
And acreage of dry edible beans fell 0.7 % .
That naturally translates into higher prices because it squeezes the supply of the particular commodity .
And it does so at a time when demand continues to escalate from populations in China , India and Latin America .
And higher prices equal inflation .
But Hutchinson – who correctly predicted this last run-up in gold prices – says there ’s another catalyst that ’s right now inherent in the U.S. economy that could help vault gold prices to $ 1,500 an ounce by the end of 2009 .
And it has to do with the much - ballyhooed $ 700 billion rescue plan .
“ The government is pumping money in so many banks , and that money has to come out somewhere , ” Hutchinson said .
The philosophy behind the rescue plan is elegantly simple :
By providing a portion of the $ 700 billion to foundering U.S banks , the Treasury Department believed it could provide banks with badly needed capital , and get them to start lending money once again – jump - starting the economy in the process .
Since September 2007 , U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers have cut the benchmark Federal Funds target rate nine times – from 5.25 % down to the current 1.0 % rate – to increase bank - to - bank lending and bank - to - consumer lending .
Right now , banks are n’t boosting lending .
Instead , as a Money Morning investigative article demonstrated , they are using the cash – essentially taxpayer - provided money – to finance buyouts of other banks .
Even so , that money will “ come out ” into the economy in the form of higher stock prices for banks .
That will make consumer / investors wealthier , and could make them more confident in the economy .
If they ’re more confident , they will spend .
As that happens , food prices should begin ticking upward , adding another set of thrusters to gold prices .
“ Everybody thinks that because we ’re having a horrible recession , we ’re not to going have inflation .
I think that ’s probably wrong , ” Hutchinson said .
“ I think gold has quite good hidden - store value . ”
As gold prices increase , count on more investors leaving the sidelines to invest , too , causing the surge in gold prices to accelerate and then steepen .
“ As gold goes up , it gets more popular and investors start piling into it , ” Hutchinson said .
And if gold gets anywhere near the $ 1,500 mark , it will probably be smart to sell .
At that level , the price of gold could likely stall and remain in place for a long stretch .
Or , in an even more likely scenario , the yellow metal could see its price careen downward – once the economy starts to show some life , forcing the central bank to boost interest rates , an act that should also cause the dollar to rise in value .

Mr Annan also noted that Mr Mogae had tried to diversify Botswana 's economy away from its reliance on diamonds .
In 2006 , President Mogae 's government introduced a law curbing the sale of alcohol and banning it on Sunday .
He blamed alcohol for the spread of HIV / Aids , among other problems .

A 14 - minute , improvised , experimental track recorded by the Beatles which was considered unworthy of being issued under their name may be released 41 years after its only public performance , Sir Paul McCartney has revealed .
" Carnival of Light " , which the band laid down in January 1967 , features distorted guitars and drum - beats , gargling , church organs , and Sir Paul and John Lennon yelling : " Are you all right ? " and " Barcelona ! "
Although it was performed at an electronic music festival that year , the audience were unaware it was a Beatles track and the band later shelved it , feeling it was too adventurous .
George Harrison had called such experimentation " avant - garde a clue " , McCartney said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The track gained legendary status among hardcore Beatles fans , and Sir Paul has not only confirmed that he possesses a master tape , but said " the time has come for it to get its moment " , if he can get permission from the group 's estate for its release .
Sir Paul was commissioned by his friend Barry Miles to make a track for the 1967 Million Dollar Light and Volt Sound Rave at the Roundhouse Theatre in London .
Drawing inspiration from the composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage , " Carnival of Light " was duly recorded at the Abbey Road studios while the band were working on the vocals for " Penny Lane " .
" We were set up in the studio and would just go in every day and record , " Sir Paul told the BBC Radio 4 arts programme Front Row , in an interview to be broadcast later this week .
" I said to the guys , this is a bit indulgent , but would you mind giving me 10 minutes ?
All I want you to do is just wander round all the stuff and bang it , shout , play it .
Then we put a bit of echo on it .
It 's very free . "
The track came within a whisker of inclusion on the 1996 Beatles compilation Anthology .
" I said it would show we were working with really avant - garde stuff , but it was vetoed , " Sir Paul said .
The producer who oversaw the recording , Sir George Martin , described the track as " a kind of uncomposed free - for - all melange of sound " .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Shares of General Motors Corp GM.N tumbled 24 percent to 62 - year lows on Monday after analysts downgraded the automaker , citing cash levels that may fall below the minimum needed in the first quarter of 2009 .

Analysts including Barclays Capital to Credit Suisse also warned that while government aid would decrease the risk of a bankruptcy for the No.1 U.S. automaker , any assistance would come at a significant cost to existing shareholders .
GM and Ford Motor Co F.N reported far deeper - than - expected quarterly losses on Friday and said their rate of cash burn had accelerated , as an extended slump in car sales raised questions about the future of the U.S. auto industry .
GM burned through $ 7 billion in cash in the third quarter and warned its cash holdings would fall short of the minimum needed to run its business without new funding or other drastic action .
Barclays cut GM to “ underweight ” from “ equalweight ” and lowered its price target for the stock to $ 1 from $ 4 .
It said GM is expected to end 2008 with $ 13.3 billion in cash and fall below its minimum the $ 11 billion to $ 14 billion in cash needs during the first quarter .
That would necessitate a government bailout , which is likely to “ significantly dilute GM ’s equity , ” Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note .
Deutsche Bank cut GM to “ sell ” from “ hold ” and lowered its equity value to zero from $ 4 , saying GM may not be able to fund its operations beyond December .
GM shares slid $ 1.05 to $ 3.32 on the New York Stock Exchange , where it fell as low as $ 3.02 , its lowest since 1946 .
GM ended September with $ 16.2 billion in cash , down from $ 21 billion at the end of the second quarter .
Through the first nine months of 2008 , it burned through more than $ 14 billion .
Barron ’s , the influential investment weekly , reported on Sunday it was time to sell GM shares , adding it was wrong to have described the company as a “ buy ” late last spring .
Credit Suisse said investors should avoid U.S. automakers until vehicle sales start recovering .
“ While a federal bailout may alleviate the bankruptcy risk , we think equity holders remain at risk , ” Credit Suisse said in a note to clients .
It widened its fourth - quarter loss estimate for GM to $ 4.33 per share from $ 3.52 , and lowered its target price to $ 5 from $ 7 .
Credit Suisse also sees
Ford losing 58 cents per share in the fourth quarter versus its previous estimate of a loss of 22 cents per share .
It lowered its target price to $ 1 from $ 4 .
Separately , an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities said both GM and Ford are likely to receive government aid , even as he widened his loss estimates for both companies after they reported far deeper - than - expected quarterly losses .
“ Ford management ’s commentary on the third - quarter call as well as GM ’s comments raises our optimism that some form of government help is likely given dire Big 3 liquidity , ” JP Morgan ’s Himanshu Patel wrote in a note to clients .
Shares of Ford were down 3.5 percent , or 6 cents , at $ 1.96 .
The Ministry of Justice promised to provide public guidelines to the new extreme porn legislation this week and – behold !
– here they are .
They have been greeted with some degree of criticism from those opposed to the legislation , on the grounds that they add little new to what was already known and fail to make matters as clear as they could .
Much of this criticism , however , is as much to do with the substance of the law as the guidelines .
What almost all those involved agree – whether for or against – is that we shall not know how wide - reaching this new law will be until the first few cases are heard before a court .
Everything else is mere parlour room speculation – and readers who wish to indulge in a little speculation of their own should proceed rapidly to the end of this artcle .
To fall foul of the new law – ss 62 - 67 of the Criminal Justice Act 2008 – images must be pornographic , grossly offensive and portray activity that threatens harm to life or limb , or involves sex with a corpse or animal .
" Life - threatening " is defined according to the usual dictionary definition : " serious injury " is not defined , but " could include the insertion of sharp objects or the mutilation of breasts or genitals " .
" Explicit and realistic " take their ordinary dictionary definition .
The guidance is clear that the material will include " images which are indistinguishable from photographs and films " : that includes cgi ; and also , if Sadville ever gets its act together , some of the more extreme performances of virtual sadism .
Deleting an image will be sufficient to prove you no longer " possess " it – unless you have the skill to recover it .
In which case you could still be done : techies beware .
Two interesting features of this new law arise in respect of potential defences .
The first is where the material in question is a BBFC classified film , that should be an absolute defence .
However , if you extract images or sequences from that film , your defence may fall .
That raises the interesting question of whether the BBFC would ever pass for viewing any scene , however transitory , that would fall foul of the Obscene Publications Act .
The interesting answer from the BBFC was that although they knew of no such instance , the theoretical possibility was always there , not least because juries in different parts of the UK might have different views on what constituted obscenity .
Back in 1997 , the Police took possession of material produced by Nigel Wingrove .
Mr Wingrove is no stranger to controversy , being both the impresario behind the Satanic Sluts , and an avant - garde filmmaker famed as producer of Visions of Ecstasy , the only work still banned by the BBFC on the grounds of potential blasphemy .
When Mr Wingrove objected that the material in question had been passed by the BBFC , the Police suggested that they might have to raid that body as well .
Such a move would have been devastating for film in the UK , which is why it never happened .
The BBFC has no formal powers at all to ban film : but Councils use its recommendations almost without question .
Loss of faith in the BBFC system could lead to a collapse of the classification system – and the need for government to intervene .
A good 1,000 people , by my estimate , are currently protesting outside the gates of the Mormon Temple in Los Angeles .
This is in response to the Mormons bankrolling Proposition 8 , which just revoked the marriages of nearly 20,000 gay newlyweds in California , instantly making their children bastards .
I think the Mormons , and Utah more generally , have created a massive public relations disaster for themselves .
The Mormon church has for years been bankrolling hateful and bigoted efforts to block civil rights legislation in various states .

Barack Obama ’s election is a milestone in more than his pigmentation .

The couple was determined to get to Grant Park on Election Night , despite the fact that the pregnant woman was six days overdue .
They had tickets –– so they were going .
Mawi Asgedom said he and his wife listened to Obama speak , awed , but all the while recording contractions every three to four minutes for about 90 minutes .
When the pain became too intense , the pair made their way out of the park and tried to get a cab to take them to the hospital .
Since the streets around the Grant Park event were closed to traffic , the cab search was futile .
Asgedom said they walked the mile to Prentice Women 's Hospital , pausing every couple of minutes for more frequent contractions .
The woman was five - centimeters dialated when they arrived at the hospital and their son was born at 5 a.m .
Asgedom said the couple considered naming the boy Barack Hussein Asgedom , but opted for the name they had , apparently , settled on previously : Sawyer Tewolde Asgedom .

( CNN ) --
The 15 countries that share the single European currency are in recession for the first time in the 10 - year history of the eurozone , according to initial estimates the European Union said Friday .
A giant euro symbol , the currency of the EU , stands in front of the European Central Bank .
According to the latest EU figures , GDP fell 0.2 % in the third quarter , the second successive quarter of negative growth .
The news comes a day after Germany -- Europe 's biggest economy -- announced it had dropped into recession territory .
With the UK expected to follow suit , France is the only one of Europe 's biggest three economies to expand in the third quarter , with figures showing it had grown by 0.1 percent between June and September .
The UK is not part of the eurozone .
There was further economic misery in the U.S. as well Friday as beleagurered mortgage lender Freddie Mac reported a $ 25 billion third - quarter loss that will force it to start tapping into the $ 100 billion in taxpayer money set aside for its bailout by the U.S. Treasury .
The Treasury took control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , the U.S. 's other mortgage finance giant , in September when it became clear that rising losses on bad mortgages would cause them to run out of capital .
California - based software and computer networking giant Sun Microsystems also became the latest company to slash its workforce , announcing that it will cut 6,000 jobs , or 18 percent of staff , as part of cost - cutting measures .
Meanwhile U.S. retail figures for October suffered the worst monthly drop on record -- down 2.8 percent -- and the fourth consecutive decline in monthly retail sales , according to the Commerce Department .
" These numbers reinforce the fact that we are in a recession , " Michael Niemira , chief retail economist with the International Council of Shopping Centers ( ICSC ) , told CNNMoney .
Elsewhere , there was more bad news in the British banking sector , as Royal Bank of Scotland announced plans to slash around 3,000 jobs worldwide over the next several weeks to reduce costs , according to British media reports .

The spreading recession is likely to top the agenda this weekend when the G20 summit takes place in Washington D.C , bringing together leaders from 20 of the world 's biggest developed and developing economies .
Other items for discussion include possible coordinated tax cuts or spending increases around the world .

On Wall Street U.S. markets slumped Friday , following wild swings in the previous session that saw the Dow Jones slip to within 81 points of its 5 - 1/ 2 - year low before surging late to finish up more than 6.7 percent , or more than 550 points .
According to early closing tallies , the Dow Jones industrial average fell 338 points , or 3.8 percent .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index fell 4.1 percent and the Nasdaq composite shed 5 percent .
In Europe , major markets in London , Paris and Frankfurt slipped back a little in late afternoon trading but remained in positive territory .
Asian and Pacific markets posted modest gains with Japan 's Nikkei index closed up 2.7 percent , Hong Kong 's Hang Seng index was was up 2.43 percent and Australia 's All Ordinaries index rose 1.46 percent by close of play .
Stocks tumbled each day this week and through early Thursday afternoon .
But the sell - off left the major gauges at levels that many market pros think could represent a bear market bottom , at least in the near term .
" As soon as the Dow fell below 8,000 , we saw a rush of buying , " said Matt King , chief investment adviser at Bell Investment Advisers .
It was the second time the market retested those lows , which were first hit around October 10 .
The major gauges slumped to around those levels at the end of October and again in mid-November .
" It was very positive , " King said .
" It seems like we have put a bottom in place . "
However , he said there was a possibility that the market could rally for a few months and then retest again .
If so , that would be similar to what happened when the last bear market bottomed in 2002 and 2003 .
In further sign that a global recession is starting to take hold , China announced that its powerhouse manufacturing sector slowed in October .
China 's industrial output grew 8.2 percent in October compared to year - ago levels -- a decline in growth of 3.2 percent from September , the National Bureau of Statistics reported .

Confessions of a credit crunch haggler - desperate to save a few pennies ?
You 've nothing to lose but your dignity ...
Holding a rumpled Paul Smith shirt in my hand , I made my way up to the counter window of the small dry-cleaners by the stairwell of Oxford Street Tube station .
' Hello , ' I said , smiling my broadest smile at the lady behind the counter .
' I 'm going to a party tonight and I wonder if you might be able to iron this for me ? '
I put the pink shirt on the counter .
' Sure , ' she said , beginning to write out a ticket .
' And how much will that be ? '
I asked .
' £ 2.20 , ' she replied , continuing to fill out the ticket .
Taken to the cleaners :
Tom 's effort to save money on getting a single shirt ironed failed , but he discovered a discount was available on bulk orders
' Ah , right , I see , ' I said , meaningfully looking at her in the eye .
' And would you have any , er , flexibility with that price ? '
' Any what ? ' she said , staring at me in disbelief .
' Flexibility , ' I said .
' Can you knock 10 per cent off ? '
The ballpoint pen stopped in its tracks .
' You want to haggle on your dry - cleaning ? ' she asked .
' Well , have n't you heard ? '
I replied , with all the confidence I could muster .
' We 're near enough in a recession .
And anyway , I do n't want this shirt dry -cleaned .
I just want it ironed .
So come on !
How about two quid ? '
I got the coins out and pushed them around in what I hoped was a tempting fashion on the counter .
' I 'd better get the manager , ' she sighed reluctantly .
While she disappeared into the back of her capacious cubby hole to fetch the boss , I reminded myself of a recent survey by online credit monitoring firm CreditExpert .
It found that 47 per cent of British adults are prepared to haggle over prices - up 50 per cent from a year ago .
More than a third reported successfully negotiating a lower price for a new car , and 60 per cent said they were comfortable bargaining over the price of entertainment goods , such as TVs , stereos and DVD players .
Of course , there 's nothing new about haggling down the price of big ticket items .
What I had set out to discover was whether in these straitened economic times , and given a neck made of brass , it might be possible to shave a few pence off more everyday items such as food , haircuts - and dry - cleaner 's bills .
Finally , the manager came up to the counter .
' Are you looking for a discount ? ' he asked .
A little extra dough : Tom gets £ 1.10 off a sandwich , so at least lunch does n't break the bank
' Absolutely , ' I said , recalling that the survey had found that confidence is the key to getting a better deal .
' Well , I can't really do you anything on the one shirt , but if it 's a bulk order then maybe we could work something out . '
' How about 20 per cent off ten shirts ? ' I asked .
You do n't need to be a dry - cleaner to know that it 's best to strike while the iron 's hot .
' Well , I could do you 10 per cent , ' he replied .
' 15 per cent - and that 's my final offer , ' I said .
The man sighed and rolled his eyes .
' Bring them in and let 's talk , ' he said .
I took his card - and my shirt .
I was even more determined to get a deal - and made my way up to street level , waiting until I got out of sight to punch the air .
I was elated that my first attempt at High Street haggling had been successful .
I had feared I 'd come across as a bit low rent - think Del Boy without the class - but I felt like Donald Trump .
Surveying Oxford Street , the spiritual home of the fixed price , I felt a surge of adrenaline and the stirring of the primeval huntergatherer instinct within as I wondered just how much money I would be able to save over the course of a hard day 's haggling .
My next few tries , however , failed .
A waffle stand outside the station , which I thought would be an easy target , would n't give me a penny off .
Nor would French Connection or the Apple Store on Regent Street , where I attempted to negotiate a lower price on an iPod .
What a snip : Tom Sykes manages to save £ 37 on a haircut in a top hairdressers where men's cuts start at £ 24 and go up to £ 52
At the Carphone Warehouse , where I tried to drive down the price of an iPhone , the sales rep made a startling admission - the prices on these gadgets were the same at all stores and they were not allowed to offer discounts .
Was n't that called price - fixing , I demanded .
The guy behind the counter just shrugged , and told me that if I waited until Christmas , the price would probably come down anyway .
Next , I took the shirt into a dry-cleaners on Kingly Street nearby and was met with another point - blank refusal .
I was getting tired of being on my feet and arguing .
I dearly wished I 'd brought my portable haggling stool , bought in a Moroccan medina ten years ago ( for half the initial asking price ) .
Bringing your own seat to the market - which lets your adversary know you can't be rushed - is an integral part of closing any deal on favourable terms in Marrakech .
So instead I pulled out my phone and called an upmarket butcher 's called Allens on nearby Mount Street .
' Oh yes , hello there , ' I said in my poshest voice .
' A friend of mine recently came into your shop and purchased some steaks .
He said that you threw in a chop for free .
I was rather wondering if you might be able to do the same for me if I bought a chicken ? '
' You what ? ' said the lady on the other end of the phone , no doubt briefly forgetting she was employed by one of London 's snootiest purveyors of fine meats .
' Well , you know it 's hard times in the City right now and your chickens are expensive .
I thought maybe there might be room for some negotiation . '
' Who 's speaking , please ? ' ' Sir Thomas Sykes - Crykes , ' I replied with assurance .
' But do n't be misled by the name .
I 'm hurting like everyone else .
It 's tough out there right now .
' So how about it ?
Could you throw in a couple of bangers ?
Or maybe just some liver ?
Nanny could cook it up for the children . '
' Well , I do n't think so , sir , ' said the bemused shop girl .
' But why not ask the manager when you come in ? '
' Jolly good ! '
I replied , hanging up with a faux cheerfulness that belied my heavy heart .
These guys were never going to budge .
They 'd rather lose 20 quid than degrade their brand by handing out free offal .
For my next shot , I decided to try a luxury item , something that might have been hit harder by the downturn than meat .
I walked into the box office of the London Palladium on Argyll Street where The Sound Of Music is playing .
' Hello , do you have two tickets for this evening 's performance ? '
I asked brightly .
The man behind the counter answered in the affirmative and showed me a card , which indicated that the best seats in the house were available for a cool £ 55 each .
' That 's just too much for me , ' I replied .
' Can you reduce them at all ?
I mean we are talking about tonight . '
' Yes , I should think so , ' he said .
' How does £ 25 sound ? '
That was less than half - price !
Though it felt churlish , he had dropped the price so quickly and dramatically that I felt obliged to keep piling on the pressure .
' Still too much , I 'm afraid .
Could you do them for £ 20 ?'
' Not really , ' he said .
The silence hung between us like a particularly oppressive rain cloud .
Eventually , he broke it .
Bargain hunt : London 's Oxford Street is one of the busiest shopping hotspots in the world , but with a little more effort , you too can pay a little less for goods
' If you came back right before the performance , then maybe , ' he said .
' Twenty quid ? '
I asked .
' Maybe , ' he said meaningfully .
' Make sure you come to my window . '
' Thanks .
I 'll see you later , ' I replied , giving him a knowing wink , spinning on my heel and heading back out onto the street .
Buoyed up by my success , I marched purposefully into the smartest hairdressers I could find - Headmasters on Hanover Street .
It 's favoured by the likes of Lisa Snowdon , Donna Air and even the girls from Vogue , whose office is on nearby Hanover Square .
I asked how much a haircut would be .
' Men 's cuts start at £ 24 and go up to £ 52 , depending on which stylist you want , ' receptionist Sofia told me .
' That 's far too much , ' I blustered .
' Fifty quid for a haircut ?
I hardly want anything off .
Just a quick snip really .
Ca n't we find some middle ground here ?'
' Well , if you 're ready to get it done right now , our top stylist is free and you can have a stand - by appointment for £ 15 , ' she replied .
If I 'd been sitting down , I would have fallen off my chair .
As it was , I merely sat down .
' And that would usually be £ 52 ? '
I asked gently .
' Yes , ' replied Sofia .
I was so stunned that I disclosed I was an undercover reporter for the Daily Mail and asked to see the manager , Ailis Gourley .
She admitted the salon had been offering stand - by appointments - which are not advertised and available only to those who ask - for several months .
' If a stylist is free , we would rather they were working , ' she said .
' And we will always put clients with the best stylist available because we see it as a sales tool .
Hopefully , they 'll like the cut so much they 'll come back again .
' There 's definitely been an increase in the numbers of people looking for deals in the past few months .
They even mention the credit crunch on the phone . '
After all this haggling , I was starving , so I stopped in at sandwich shop Thanks For Franks on Foubert 's Place , just off Carnaby Street , to see if I could pick up a cheap snack .
It was 3.30 pm , and there were still more than a dozen sandwiches in the fridge .
I selected a tasty - looking Parma ham and mozzarella roll , labelled at £ 4.10 , and asked the guy behind the counter , Ian Tuckwell , if he could give me a discount .
Feeling the pinch : Shoppers walk past sale signs , but surprising savings can be had if you just ask
By then I was so used to haggling that I did not feel the merest flicker of embarrassment .
' All right , ' he said , looking at his watch .
' Give me three quid . '
I slapped my coins on the counter and we got chatting about the recession as I tucked into my sandwich , which was all the more delicious for being a bargain .
' You can feel it out there , it 's very quiet , ' he said .
' I was in this business in the last recession , in 1987 , and there 's a feeling of deja vu .
' People are bringing their own lunch from home to save a few pounds .
We are definitely taking steps to look after our regulars . '
Despite all this gloomy talk , I was delighted with my day 's discounts .
Yet I still had a party to go to - and a rumpled shirt to get pressed .
My final stop was Marshall Laundry on Marshall Street .
' How much to press a shirt , mate ? '
' Two pounds , ' he replied .
' Can you do it for any less than that ? '
I asked .
' Nope , ' he replied .
' You ca n't even move on that figure by , say , 5 per cent ? '
I asked quizzically .
' What , 10 p ? ' he asked , laughing at me in amazement .
' Yes , ' I replied .
' Just 10 p .
That 's all I 'm after .
There 's a recession on , you know . '
' Nope , ' he replied .
' Two pounds . '
' Is that your final offer ? '
' It 's not an offer , it 's the price ! ' he replied .
I suppose there are some things in life each of us can live without .
A theatre ticket , a sandwich in the middle afternoon , a last - minute haircut - I realised that I was able to haggle on those items because if I did n't get the price I wanted , I was ready to walk away .
But not having a freshly ironed shirt when I was off to a party ?
That was not really a viable option for me , and my negotiating position was weak .
The guy in the laundry had turned back to his other work .
He had mountains of laundry to deal with .
The bags were piled up to the ceiling .
His business seemed to be handling the downturn well - good for him , I thought .
And that 's when I caved in .
I slapped two pound coins down on the counter .
I came back ten minutes later and slipped on my shirt .
It was still warm from being pressed , starched and crisp .
But most of all , it was worth every penny I had paid for it .
The US Federal Reserve has formally approved the Bank of America 's purchase of investment bank Merrill Lynch , which was hard hit by the global financial crisis .
The bailout was announced in September at the same time that rival investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed .
The deal makes the Bank of America the world 's largest financial services company , with assets of more than $ 5 trillion and nearly 12 per cent of US bank deposits .
The central bank says the takeover will not harm competition .

I remember seeing this in the mid-90 ’s in bottles -
If I recall , I think either the bottle label or the six - pack holder had an illustration by that guy who does ( did ? ) the comic " Shoe " in the newspapers .
This was probably 1994 or so .

Steve Fried was the brewmaster at the time it was bottled , and i think that ’s been at least a couple years ago .

Ten years ago you could buy bottles at the brewpub in Pensacola for on premises consumption .
I have n’t kept up with it since then other than seeing it at the occassional festival .
People who fail to tell the authorities of a change of address or amend other key personal details within three months will face civil penalty fines of up to £ 1,000 a time when the national identity card scheme is up and running , according to draft Home Office regulations published yesterday .
The Home Office made clear that repeated failures to keep an entry on the national identity register up to date could ultimately be enforced by bailiffs being sent round to seize property .
But yesterday 's detailed regulations to implement the national identity card scheme make clear that they intend to avoid the creation of ID card " martyrs " , by levying no penalty on those who refuse to register for the national identity card database in the first place .
The Liberal Democrat peer , Lady Williams , is amongst ID card " refuseniks " who have said they are prepared to go to jail rather than sign up for the scheme .
But the regulations show that the main sanction they are likely to face is being barred from leaving the country when it is time to renew their passport .
The regulations confirm ministers ' intention to make passports a " designated document " which means anyone applying or renewing their passport will be automatically issued with an ID card at the same time .
Ministers claim that this does not amount to compulsion but ID card critics disagree .
The consultation on the fine detail of how the ID card scheme will work in practice published yesterday also makes clear :
• The £ 30 initial fee for a standalone ID card valid for travel in Europe only is capped for the year 2009 / 10 when it will be compulsory for airport workers and on a voluntary basis for students .
The regulations allow for this fee to be " modified " in future years including by 2012 , when it is anticipated that mass rollout will take place with 5 - 6 million combined passports / identity cards a year expected to be issued .
Passport fees will be on top of this basic charge .
• If it necessary to change any of the details held on the card , such as name or fingerprints which entail a new card being issued , a further £ 30 will be charged .
Changes of address or other details which do not appear on the card will not be charged .
• Transgendered people : those " moving from their birth gender to an acquired gender " will be able to apply for two ID cards - one for each gender .
The second ID card will use a different name , signature and photograph although they will be linked as one entry on the national ID card register .
Nevertheless they will be charged two fees for the privilege of holding two cards .
• Homeless people and others who live " transient lifestyles " will also be able to register under the scheme .
The Home Office expects to be able to agree with homeless people a suitable place to be registered as their residence - presumably even if it is only a railway arch .
Those who move around frequently for work will be able to register their principal residence without notifying each move .
But the draft regulations also set out in detail the escalating series of fines for those who fail to keep their ID card register entry up to date or fail to correct errors on it .
The kind of details that must be provided within three months are a change of address , a change of name perhaps because of marriage or by deed poll , a change of nationality , a change of gender , or a significant change in an individual 's face or their fingerprints perhaps because of an accident .
The Home Office say they will not need to police this aspect as it will soon become apparent when somebody tries , for example , to get on a plane with a ID card / passport with an out of date address that does not match that the bank debit / credit card they used to book the flight .
They say they may well find themselves not being allowed to travel .
Those who lose their ID Cards or have them stolen will have to report the loss within a month .
Fines for failure to update the register start at £ 125 going up to £ 1,000 for repeatedly failing to comply .
As a civil penalty the bailiffs may be sent in to enforce payment .
The shadow home secretary , Dominic Grieve , said the scheme was truly the worst of all worlds - expensive , intrusive and unworkable .
" The home secretary has confirmed the worst element of the scheme - a single , mammoth and highly vulnerable database exposing masses of our personal details to criminal hackers .
" Worse still , she has magnified the scope for fraud by allowing spot fines to be issued by email , " he said .
The NO2ID campaign say that in just four weeks in 2005 , more than 10,000 people pledged online to refuse to register for an ID card .
" It is possible that refusal could be made a crime but the government has shied away from that so far .
If enough people say no , it will be impossible , " said a campaign spokesman .
What do you make of this one ?
Additionally , Joe Biden mentioned a “ generated crisis ” :
“ Mark my words , ” the Democratic vice presidential nominee warned at the second of his two Seattle fundraisers Sunday .
“ It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy .
The world is looking .
We ’re about to elect a brilliant 47 - year - old senator president of the United States of America .
Remember I said it standing here if you do n’t remember anything else I said .
Watch , we ’re gonna have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy . ”
“ I can give you at least four or five scenarios from where it might originate , ” Biden said to Emerald City supporters , mentioning the Middle East and Russia as possibilities .
“ And he ’s gonna need help .
And the kind of help he ’s gonna need is , he ’s gonna need you – not financially to help him – we ’re gonna need you to use your influence , your influence within the community , to stand with him .
Because it ’s not gonna be apparent initially , it ’s not gonna be apparent that we ’re right . ”
This is hilarious .
Letterman is none too happy because he was jilted by McCain to “ focus on the economy ” ; McCain then appears on Katie Couric ’s show instead :
What is even more hypocritical about McCain “ suspending his campaign ” ( whatever that means , considering that he appeared on TV tonight ) is that it was Obama who initially contacted McCain this morning at 8:30 am with the suggestion that they work together to develop a joint response to the economic crisis .
At 2:30 pm , McCain phoned Obama to “ express his willingness to work with Obama ” .
But at 3 pm , McCain abruptly changed course and announced he was suspending his campaign to focus on the economic crisis and asked to postpone the debate .
Obama responded that he ’d like to keep the debates as planned , because “ it is going to be part of the president ’s job to deal with more than one thing at once ” .
“ This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess . ”
A poll conducted today shows that 86 % of Americans think Friday ’s debate should go on .
Also note that McCain has n’t even shown up to vote in the Senate since April , having missed 109 of the last 110 votes ( 412 out of 643 for the current term ) , the worst job record of any senator .
So why is it all of a sudden so important that he rush back to the Senate ?
Is it because his poll numbers are dropping like a lead ( economic ) bubble ?
Besides , McCain does n’t have to rush back to the Senate .
As pointed out in the Wall Street Journal , McCain can “ probably get to the bottom of the whole mess just by cross - examining the people riding on his campaign bus , ” since many of his campaign staff are the people who are responsible for the current crisis in the first place .
Finally , on top of all that , McCain admitted Tuesday that he had not yet even read the Wall Street bailout proposal even though it had been circulated four days before that .
And it is a whole three pages long .
UPDATE : Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says it would not be useful for McCain ( or Obama ) to return to Washington :
It would not be helpful at this time to have them come back during these negotiations and risk injecting presidential politics into this process or distract important talks about the future of our nation ’s economy .
If that changes , we will call upon them .
We need leadership ; not a campaign photo op .
If there were ever a time for both candidates to hold a debate before the American people about this serious challenge , it is now .
Also note that just before McCain declared he was suspending his campaign because of the importance of focusing on the economy , he did manage to find time to keep an appointment with Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild , the former Hillary Clinton supporter who is now supporting McCain because she thinks Obam is “ elitist ” .
UPDATE 2 : Electoral Vote has an excellent summary of McCain ’s suspension of disbelief .
More grim news from Afghanistan :
An airstrike by U.S. - led forces may have claimed the lives of more civilians .
The New York Times quotes Afghan officials as saying as many as 40 civilians were killed after a coalition airstrike hit a wedding party in Kandahar province .
Details are still sketchy , and we were unable to reach U.S. Forces - Afghanistan for immediate comment .
But civilian casualties have been causing serious friction between the U.S. and Afghan governments , particularly after a recent airstrike on the village of Azizabad claimed a number of innocent lives .
In a statement congratulating Barack Obama on his election victory , Afghan President Hamid Karzai called for a new strategy .
“ The fight against terrorism can not be fought in our country , rather , our country is a victim of terrorism and we demand for civilian casualties to be eliminated , ” he said .
As Noah has discussed here earlier , the top U.S. general in Afghanistan curtailed air strikes in 2004 over concerns they might undermine the support of the Afghan population .
Likewise , the Taliban have become adept at exploiting civilian casualty reports in their own propaganda war .
But Afghanistan has long been an " economy of force " mission – and sometimes that means relying on air power when there are n't enough boots on the ground .

Though the U.S. still trails other parts of the world in deployment of high - speed broadband , all is not lost .
According to the latest State of the Internet report from content delivery player Akamai , the nation 's broadband penetration is on the rise .
Akamai found that U.S. broadband connections -- defined as connections at 5 megabits per second ( Mb/ sec ) or faster -- grew in number by 29 percent , compared to the previous quarter .
" I think the U.S. growth rate is something we expected , " David Belson , Akamai 's director of market intelligence and author of the report , told InternetNews.com .
" If you look at the money being spent to build out the fiber to the home infrastructure , and if you look at the competitive deals that are going on , vendors are trying hard to make it affordable and ' outspeed ' each other . "
Despite such efforts , the country still sits sixth on Akamai 's list of the most widely broadband - enabled counties , with only 26 percent of U.S. Internet connections having been clocked at speeds of 5 Mb / sec or greater .
South Korea continues to hold the top spot with 64 percent of its Internet user 's connection at speeds of 5 Mb/sec or greater .
Belson is n't optimistic that the U.S. will catch up to South Korea any time soon , either .
" We 'll expect to see connection speeds grow rapidly in the future since we 're at only a quarter of the connections that we 're seeing from the U.S. being at 5 Mb / sec , " Belson said .
" There is still a long way to grow . "
Belson attributed the large percentage of broadband deployments in South Korea were the combined result of population density and government intervention .
In South Korea , a large portion of the population lives in apartment buildings , which makes wiring large groups of people easier .
Likewise , its government has taken a proactive stance on rolling out high - speed connectivity .
Whether the winner of the upcoming presidential elections in the U.S. will push for similar proliferation -- supporting much - discussed efforts like wiring rural communities -- remains uncertain , he added .
" Does the new leadership of the Unites States have the opportunity to put some money where their mouth is ? "
Belson said .
" Absolutely .
Will they fund rural broadband ?
Unlikely . "
Given the nature of the market , I do n't think we 'll see 60 to 70 percent high - speed broadband penetration in the U.S. for quite some time , " he added .
Closer to home
While the U.S. as a whole continues to get faster , the State of California actually slipped in the rankings , despite its huge IT and high technology industries .
Belson noted that California came in 21st in the nation , with its 7 percent growth rate over first quarter having been outpaced by other states ' growing broadband infrastructures .
In Akamai 's last report , California ranked 17th .
Once again , the tiny state of Delaware led the U.S. in broadband penetration , a fact that Belson attributed to some of the same factors that also made South Korea the leader globally -- namely , comparatively high population density .
About 66 percent of all traffic from Delaware came from broadband connections .
Akamai , a leader in Internet content distribution , is in prime position to assess the status of the U.S. 's infrastructure , since it has servers based at the edge of the Internet in locations across the country and throughout the world .
It examined some 346 million unique IP addresses to compile its most recent report .
Its position also enables it to provide some insight into attack traffic that also radiates across the Internet .
In the report , it said some 400 unique ports were targeted by attackers , representing a nearly 20 - times increase over first quarter .
The Ubuntu developer community conducted a series of public tutorials and discussions on IRC last week during Ubuntu Open Week .
The event attracted many enthusiastic Ubuntu users and contributors as well as other members of the open source software community .
Many of the Open Week sessions offer valuable technical insight into the development process and provide instructions for new contributors who want to learn how to package software and help fix bugs .
In addition to technical tutorials , Open Week also included a two hour question - and - answer session with Mark Shuttleworth , founder of the Ubuntu project and CEO of Canonical .
Shuttleworth discussed a wide variety of subjects , ranging from Ubuntu 's governance model to plans for the upcoming version of Ubuntu , codenamed Jaunty Jackalope .
Canonical 's relationship with Dell is one of the topics that Shuttleworth addressed during the session .
The hardware vendor began offering Ubuntu preinstalled on a select assortment of computers last year in response to demand from the Linux enthusiast community .
We were impressed when we tested one of Dell 's Ubuntu laptops shortly after the launch .
Shuttleworth believes that distributing Ubuntu on Dell hardware has been a big success and he says that " the machines are selling well " .
" [ Dell ] clearly sees Linux users as thought leaders , " he told Open Week attendees on IRC .
" They know it takes a lot of work to do something like Linux well and they work very hard at it , so we appreciate the partnership . "
Indeed , Dell 's commitment to Linux appears to be growing .
Dell is working with component makers to improve the maturity of Linux drivers in order to boost the open source operating system 's hardware compatibility .
Dell has also introduced DVD playback and media codec support .
A focus on mobile
Shuttleworth also discussed Canonical 's partnership with Intel that is focusing on mobile platform development .
He sees enormous opportunity for Linux in the mobile device market but believes that the lack of a cohesive ecosystem is going to impede progress on that front .
" Linux is a perfect platform for consumer electronics , and the rate of adoption there is fantastic , but it 's highly fragmented .
There are many different projects / environments / frameworks for Linux on smartphones , " he said .
" We have partnered with Moblin from Intel because we think they are committed to a ( a ) great user experience and ( b ) open processes and governance .
Intel has really set the pace with hardware enablement in free software .
They invest a lot in it , and they invest it well — they work like an open source project to a much greater extent than any other manufacturer . "
He is " looking forward " to the next major version of the Moblin platform and intends to have the components packaged for Ubuntu .
He acknowledges that single - vendor solutions are suboptimal and suggests that success for Linux in the mobile space could depend on multiple hardware manufacturers , mobile operators , and software vendors coming together within a single ecosystem .
Moblin could be a good starting point for achieving that goal , he said , and he hopes that the project will grow beyond its
Intel roots to attract a community of active contributors and third - party developers .
Responding to critics
Ubuntu Open
Week participants also asked Shuttleworth to comment on some of the allegations that have been made by critics of Ubuntu , such as kernel developer Greg Kroah - Hartman .
Kroah - Hartman has condemned Canonical and believes that the company 's relatively low involvement in kernel development reflects a serious failure to contribute back to upstream projects .
Shuttleworth does n't accept this assertion and argued that Canonical is making valuable contributions in other areas that move the Linux platform forward .
" The ecosystem is broader , deeper and richer than Greg was making out and those relationships are more complex than Greg was making out .
I believe Ubuntu and Canonical are making a very big difference in free software , and that has little to do with how many patches in the kernel have an @canonical.com email address associated with them , " he said .
" I 'm not going to hire lots of people to keep Greg happy .
I do continue to hire people to make free software into an amazing experience for me , my friends , my colleagues and peers , and everyone else I meet in a plane , train or on the street . "
This approach is exemplified by several of the development projects that Shuttleworth talked about during the question and answer session .
Roughly half of Canonical 's staff is working full time on Launchpad , the web - based collaborative development platform that is used to facilitate Ubuntu development .
Shuttleworth has committed to completely open sourcing Launchpad by the end of 2009 .
" When we open source launchpad , we will have more than 100 people doing nothing but hack on free software .
I think that 's a great contribution for a company of 200 people , " he said .
" It will be done by November 2009 .
The team is working through a list of issues already — license checks , separating out pieces that are not related to the web service , determining the right approach for various issues .
It may happen sooner , but you have a concrete commitment that it will be done by then . "
Another area where Canonical is hoping to make major contributions is in design and usability .
Shuttleworth announced in September that the company was planning to hire more professional designers and interaction experts to work with upstream projects on improving the quality of the Linux user experience .
In response to an Open Week question about theming for Jaunty Jackalope , Shuttleworth revealed that these plans are moving forward .
" We have been hiring , for months , designers and user experience guys .
It has taken much longer than I hoped .
That team will be in place in Jan / Feb , I imagine , " he said .
" Whether their initial work will make a dramatic visual impact on Jaunty , I do n't know .
I know that other work , on the user experience front , will land , but i'll keep some surprises in store till later . ;-) "
Now that Ubuntu Open Week has passed , the development cycle for Jaunty Jackalope is in full swing .
The developers will meet next month in Mountain View for the Ubuntu Developer Summit , where the roadmap for the next release will be formulated .

When a politician claims that he always saw the storm on the horizon , it is often more informative to read what he was saying when the sun was still shining .
Before I listened to the latest thoughts from Gordon Brown and David Cameron on the crisis of capitalism , I first reminded myself what they were saying before the boom went bust .
Let 's start with Gordon Brown in June 2005 giving the Chancellor 's annual speech to the City at the Mansion House .
Addressing the bow - tied ranks of money - changers , he paid lavish homage to ' your unique innovative skills , your courage and steadfastness ' .
They had his personal thanks ' for the outstanding , the invaluable contribution you make to the prosperity of Britain ' .
Though even the financiers may have wondered what courage had to do with it , they clapped long and hard .
Having hosed them with adulation every time he visited the City , Gordon Brown surpassed himself when he returned in 2007 to deliver his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor before he moved into Number 10 .
' A new world order has been created , ' he proclaimed .
Britain was ' a new world leader ' thanks to ' your efforts , ingenuity and creativity ' .
He congratulated himself for ' resisting pressure ' to toughen up regulation of their activities .
Everyone needed to follow the City's ' great example ' , emulate this ' high value - added , talent - driven industry ' .
' Britain needs more of the vigour , ingenuity and aspiration that you already demonstrate . '
Thanks to their ' remarkable achievements ' , we had the huge privilege to live in 'an era that history will record as the beginning of a new Golden Age ' .
Or , as it turns out , an era that history will record as ending in the Great Crash of 2008 .
Their ' ingenuity ' engineered the most seismic financial crisis in 80 years .
Their ' aspiration ' has destroyed swaths of their own industry and the rest of the economy .
Their ' vigour ' is propelling us into recession .
What he then hailed as a ' Golden Age ' , the Prime Minister now deplores as an ' Age of Irresponsibility ' .
David Cameron has had some fun at the expense of the Prime Minister .
Which might make you assume that the Tory leader had foreseen , as Gordon Brown had not , that it would all turn to dust .
So here is Mr Cameron in June 2006 , offering his thoughts on ' the new global economy ' .
He trumpeted ' the victory of capitalism , privatisation and liberalisation ' .
Not to be out - grovelled by Gordon Brown when talking about bankers , the Tory leader lauded the ' highly innovative ' City as ' the biggest international finance centre in the world ' .
Mr Cameron happily noted that ' there are more than 550 international banks and 170 global securities houses in London ' , numbers that may now be subject to downward revision .
The Cameron of this pre-bust vintage gave the credit for all that reckless - sorry , ' innovative ' - trading to ' critical Conservative decisions ' when the Tories were in government .
It proved that ' light regulation ' and ' low regulation ' were ' keys to success ' .
Just over a year ago , in September 2007 , Mr Cameron made a speech at the London School Of Economics .
The financial markets were already experiencing what was then politely termed ' turbulence ' , but the Tory leader chose to amplify his thesis about the ascendancy of unconstrained capitalism .
In a section entitled ' The End Of Economic History ? ' , he answered the question by declaring that : ' The debate is now settled . ' ' Liberalism ' had prevailed .
The left 's silly idea that markets required tight regulation had been thoroughly discredited .
' The result ?
The world economy more stable than for a generation . '
He drizzled sycophancy on the heads of the bankers , drooling that ' our hugely sophisticated financial markets match funds with ideas better than ever before ' .
What a pity the casino got so sophisticated that it traded trillions of dollars of toxic bets that no one understood , including the gamblers themselves .
I could fill every column until Christmas with the foolish eulogising of the animal spirits of ungoverned markets by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition .
I could probably fill this entire newspaper with embarrassing quotes from senior politicians about the erstwhile masters of the universe .
A generation of leaders , here and in much of the rest of the world , fell under the thrall of high finance .
The commanding heights of politics were surrendered to the bankers .
Right - leaning politicians did so from ideological conviction , left - leaning politicians did so because they came to believe that it was the only way to power .
The markets were allowed to set the rules for the politicians .
Leaders could n't tax wealth more than the markets were prepared to allow .
They could n't spend , borrow , intervene or regulate without the permission of the gods of the dealing rooms .
When Bill Clinton was in the White House , he would rage about the way in which his presidency was dictated to by ' a bunch of fucking bond traders ' .
One of his senior aides , James Carville , joked : ' I used to think if there was reincarnation , I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or a .400 baseball hitter .
But now I want to come back as the bond market .
You can intimidate everybody . '
This side of the Atlantic , Tony Blair and Gordon Brown took a short spoon to supper with the devil .
He seemed such a seductive fellow when the financial sector was growing four times as fast as the rest of the economy .
The credit boom kept house prices rising , shop tills ringing , tax revenues flowing , the country feeling prosperous and voting Labour .
The financial alchemists of the City appeared to have invented a perpetual motion machine for producing cheap money .
No one in government wanted to ask awkward questions about ballooning debt and obscene bonuses that incentivised ever more reckless bets .
Mr Brown made his wildly hubristic claim to have abolished ' boom and bust ' .
In so much as the Tories raised an objection , it was that Labour was over - constraining the ' wealth creators ' with bureaucratic red tape .
Vince Cable was alone when he wandered the battlements of the City of Gold crying his warning that it would all end in tears .
That the Lib Dem has been proved utterly correct does n't seem to be doing his party much good in the polls , but at least it has made him Britain 's most popular politician .
Gordon Brown and David Cameron are meanwhile scrambling to reposition themselves for the world of the bust .
The Prime Minister would prefer we forgot that drivel about a ' Golden Age ' and look out those of his old speeches in which he argued for a global surveillance system of financial markets .
Mr Cameron would be obliged if we 'd pretend we had n't heard him extolling the gamblers and concentrate on his more recent call for ' economic responsibility ' .
The Prime Minister 's strategy is to try to internationalise not just the solutions to this crisis , but also the culpability for it .
He would have us blame those greedy bankers who were once his heroes and the America that he once so admired .
Mr Cameron is conversely keen to localise the blame around the Prime Minister .
The Tory party has been uncomfortable supporting the government and unnerved by the sight of Gordon Brown feted as some sort of superhero .
The Tory leader has been reassuring worried colleagues : ' I will pin the tail on the donkey . '
Hence his speech on Friday which broke the pseudo truce by heaping culpability on the Prime Minister .
This parochial blame game takes place in the context of a much more important global realignment of the balance of power between finance , government and the rest of society .
The barons of capital have been devoured by their own excesses .
Forced to go running to the state for help , large chunks of their firms now owned by the taxpayers they previously treated with contempt , the bankers are now the supplicants to the politicians .
Humiliation has been visited not just on the individual chief executives and chairmen who have lost their jobs ; an entire class has been discredited in voters ' eyes .
High finance will not vanish , but its numbers , glamour and power will shrink .
Charles Leadbetter , always an insightful analyst , draws a useful comparison with what happened to the trades union leaders .
Those barons grew over - mighty in the Sixties and Seventies until they met their nemesis in the shape of Margaret Thatcher .
They are still with us , but they lost their ability to mesmerise politicians and intimidate everyone else .
High finance has similarly been dethroned .
There is no appetite , beyond the denuded ranks of revolutionary socialists , for a command economy anything like the model so discredited by the experiment with the Soviet Union .
Governments have taken over banks out of necessity not ideological conviction .
But there has been a shift .
The intellectual and political climate now favours those sceptical about the more exaggerated claims made for markets .
George Bush has been forced to nationalise banks .
It looks increasingly likely that he will be succeeded by Barack Obama governing with the help of big Democrat majorities in Congress .
David Cameron , who as recently as his party conference was inviting us to regard him as the son of Thatcher , is now denouncing ' irresponsible capitalism ' .
Gordon Brown has rediscovered a purpose for his premiership and a potential legacy in the reform and regulation of global finance .
The full extent and shape of this power shift will take time to become clear .
This much is already certain .
Political leaders will not fawn before money as they once did .
The era of uncritical awe for financiers is over .
The epoch of blind faith in the market is done with .
When our leaders go to the City in future , they will no longer take knee pads with them .
The director of a British company who bribed a Ugandan official escaped jail yesterday in the first foreign bribery case since the British government promised to crack down on the crime .
Niels Tobiasen , the 65 - year - old Danish managing director of a Wiltshire firm , pleaded guilty to paying £ 80,000 in bribes and was given a five - month jail sentence which was suspended for a year .
On Monday , Ananias Tumukunde , a 31 - year - old adviser to the Ugandan president , was jailed for a year for receiving the payments , dressed up as " local tax " .
Southwark crown court in London had heard that Tumukunde demanded the bribes after Tobiasen 's firm was given a contract to protect world leaders , including the Queen and Gordon Brown , at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Kampala last November .
Tobiasen 's firm , CBRN Team , received six contracts from the Ugandan government worth a total of £ 500,000 .
The court heard that Tobiasen admitted the payments soon after he was arrested by City of London police and had " fully " cooperated .
Tobiasen made five payments between June last year and February this year to Tumukunde and a Ugandan army officer , Rusoke Tagaswire , who is still at large .
Anti-corruption campaigners pointed out that the two are the only people to be convicted since Britain signed an anti-corruption treaty 11 years ago .
During the same period , the US secured 105 foreign bribery prosecutions , said Transparency International .

Perhaps one of the biggest side - effects of the Senate bailout bill passed yesterday may prove to be the carbon tax measures tucked away in its 451 pages .
News Busters reveals that Section 117 mandates a ‘ carbon audit of the tax code ’ to be completed within the next two years that will determine which carbon tax measures will be put into place .
SEC .
117 . CARBON AUDIT OF THE TAX CODE .
( a) STUDY .
— The Secretary of the Treasury shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to undertake a comprehensive review of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to identify the types of and specific tax provisions that have the largest effects on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and to estimate the magnitude of those effects .
Among other global warming taxation pimps , Goldman Sachs , under Henry Paulson ’s direction , released a statement several years ago pushing for carbon trading , stating that “ voluntary action alone cannot solve the climate change problem . ”
Now we are on the cusp of compulsory measures taking hold .
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel indicated that these tax breaks and others were likely pass in some other legislation anyway .
Forbes reports :
In 2008 another piece of major legislation was introduced : the Lieberman - Warner bill , which would implement a nationwide cap - and - trade program on carbon emissions .
That would instantly change the landscape for any energy producer .
The bill failed this year but is likely to return for the next Congress–both presidential candidates favor a cap - and - trade program .
Additionally , various other ‘ carbon credit ’ schemes and incentives have been put into place for businesses utilizing carbon mitigation , carbon sequestering , renewable energy , biofuels and / or other alternative energy sources .
( Ref. DIVISION B— Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 , summary pages 114-115 ) .
Subtitle A–Renewable Energy Incentives
Sec. 101 . Renewable energy credit .
Sec. 102 . Production credit for electricity produced from marine renewables .
Sec. 103 . Energy credit .
Sec. 104 .
Energy credit for small wind property .
Sec. 105 . Energy credit for geothermal heat pump systems .
Sec. 106 . Credit for residential energy efficient property .
Sec. 107 .
New clean renewable energy bonds .
Sec. 108 . Credit for steel industry fuel .
Sec. 109 . Special rule to implement FERC and State electric restructuring policy .
Subtitle B— Carbon Mitigation and Coal Provisions
Sec. 111 . Expansion and modification of advanced coal project investment credit .
Sec. 112 . Expansion and modification of coal gasification investment credit .
Sec. 113 .
Temporary increase in coal excise tax ; funding of Black Lung Disability Trust Fund .
Sec. 114 . Special rules for refund of the coal excise tax to certain coal producers and exporters .
Sec. 115 . Tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration .
Sec. 116 . Certain income and gains relating to industrial source carbon dioxide treated as qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships .
Sec. 117 . Carbon audit of the tax code .
So the bailout will not only facilitate the government takeover of assets with broad and very unchecked power , but will pave the way to carbon taxation schemes ?
And how does CO2 hysteria bear any relation to our economic woes ?
Only in that both are movements towards greater consolidation and control .
Forcing the economy to develop a ‘ carbon conscience ’ not only would likely be a stumbling block to economic stimulation , but trading carbon - credits on the market seemingly puts real assets in even greater jeopardy and goes beyond leveraging and fiat federal reserve currency further into the realm of imaginary - fiction funny money – and puts globalist monopoly men one step closer to total control .

Solazyme Creates World 's First Algae Jet Fuel
September 9th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
You may remember Solazyme from my post a few weeks ago about its plan to mass - produce algae biodiesel in a three - year time frame .
Now the innovative company is taking algae fuel a step further .
Solazyme announced today that it has produced the world ’s first algae - based jet fuel .
The product passed all testing specifications for Aviation Turbine Fuel — which means that the aviation kerosene has passed all the major hurdles to creating a jet fuel that is compatible with the current commercial and military infrastructure .
Tests that the jet fuel had to go through before meeting specifications include measurements for density , thermal oxidative stability , flashpoint , freezing point , and more .
While Solazyme is n’t the only company working on algae aviation fuel , it is the closest to achieving large - scale production .
So keep a close eye on Solazyme — it may be the first company to get both algae biodiesel and algae aviation fuel to the public .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
KANSAS CITY , Missouri ( Reuters ) - People in a vast seismic zone in the southern and midwestern United States would face catastrophic damage if a major earthquake struck there and should ensure that builders keep that risk in mind , a government report said on Thursday .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said if earthquakes strike in what geologists define as the New Madrid Seismic Zone , they would cause “ the highest economic losses due to a natural disaster in the United States . ”
FEMA predicted a large earthquake would cause “ widespread and catastrophic physical damage ” across Alabama , Arkansas , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Mississippi , Missouri and Tennessee -- home to some 44 million people .
Tennessee is likely to be hardest hit , according to the study that sought to gauge the impact of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in order to guide the government ’s response .
In Tennessee alone , it forecast hundreds of collapsed bridges , tens of thousands of severely damaged buildings and a half a million households without water .
Transportation systems and hospitals would be wrecked , and police and fire departments impaired , the study said .
The zone , named for the town of New Madrid in Missouri ’s southeast corner , is subject to frequent mild earthquakes .
Experts have long tried to predict the likelihood of a major quake like those that struck in 1811 and 1812 .
These shifted the course of the Mississippi River and rang church bells on the East Coast but caused few deaths amid a sparse population .
“ People who live in these areas and the people who build in these areas certainly need to take into better account that at some time there is ... expected to be a catastrophic earthquake in that area , and they ’d better be prepared for it , ” said FEMA spokesperson Mary Margaret Walker .

McCain ’s intervention in the financial crisis is his latest showstopper move – and his riskiest .
Obama camp calls McCain ' erratic '
As John McCain heads South after a dramatic , thus far failed attempt to lead the effort in Washington to craft a bailout bill , Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign is seeking to cast McCain ’s high - stakes political gamble as a failure of temperament .
Obama ’s national press secretary , Bill Burton , emailed reporters Friday afternoon to tag McCain with the Democrats ’ new buzzword : “ Erratic . ”
“ Given his unsteady performance this week , [ McCain ] desperately needs to win this debate in a big way in order to change the topic and get back to his home turf , ” said the memo , which cited McCain ’s “ erratic , out - of - touch behavior this week , his failure to do anything of substance to move the agreement forward on the bailout , and his commitment to continuing Bush economic policies . ”

McCain 's high - wire intervention in the financial crisis is his latest show - stopper move — and his riskiest .
He may yet snatch a measure of political success from the maneuver , but his unpredictable week has prompted the Democrats to launch their most direct attacks on his character to date .
Another Democratic official cited McCain's " erratic , all - over - the - map response to the economic crisis . "
The attempt to cast McCain as " erratic , " in contrast to Obama 's icy cool , is emerging as a central political theme of the week - even as congressional negotiations remain in doubt .
Democrats believe McCain has given voters an uncomfortable glimpse of what a McCain government would look like and reminded them of doubts about his temperament - doubts the Bush campaign used against McCain in 2000 .
But the attacks on McCain 's temperament also carry the risk of appearing to impugn the character of a war hero , and a passion that many voters find attractive .
" McCain is coming perilously close to jeopardizing one of the central brands he has advanced during the campaign — that he has the right temperament to deal with crisis , " said Phil Singer , a former adviser to Hillary Clinton , whose staff had prepared strategies for dealing with McCain in anticipation of a Clinton primary win .
" Given the gyrations he has exhibited over the last several weeks , he 's giving people reasons to think he 's anything but steady - he 's gambling and has had risky reactions . "
" The Obama people would be crazy not to drive the contrast - though they have to careful about how they do it , " he said .
McCain 's aides hit back hard against Friday ’s “ erratic ” memo , referencing an AP story distributed by Obama ’s own campaign that characterized their candidate 's previous debate performances as " lifeless , aloof and windy . "
McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb , twisting the knife , added : “ In fact , that is a better characterization of Sen. Obama 's brief record in the United States Senate .
He has never once bucked his own party in order to enact major legislation , he has never once taken real action when he had more to gain from speechifying , and he has never once risked his own political life in the service of a cause greater than winning his next election . ”
McCain aides dismiss attacks on the Arizona senator 's temperament , saying that he 's simply being himself - and that he has confounded his critics by surviving two years of stressful campaigning without public signs of his legendary temper .
McCain 's aides dismiss attacks on the Arizona senator 's temperament , saying that he 's simply being himself - and that he has confounded his critics by surviving two years of stressful campaigning without public signs of his legendary temper .
" Of course , we 're aware of the fact that the Obama campaign thinks that 's a winning tactic , " said a top McCain aide .
" They 've used language since the start of this campaign indicating they want to use temper as an issue . "
And indeed , McCain has long joked about his temper , and used it as a mark of his maverick authenticity .
Republican consultant Scott Reed dismissed the " erratic " talk , saying the GOP 's candidate has remained consistent - as a maverick .
" McCain is n't doing anything than he has n't always done - he needed a game changer to get out of the shadow cast by being a Republican in an economic crisis , " he said .
But McCain 's attempt to shift the argument from the economy to character has , perversely , given Democrats an opening to question his own fitness to lead .
Spur - of - the - moment decisions - from his choice of a running mate he hardly knew to his request that the first debate be delayed - reflect an impetuousness he 's tried to associate with Obama 's youth , his critics say , while undercutting his argument that he 's a cool , tested old hand capable of coping with presidential pressure .
Questions about McCain 's temperament - some overt , some not - have long been a feature of his political career .
He 's gotten into profanity - laced shouting matches with fellow senators and other officials , and he jokes that nobody 's ever suggested he should get a prize for congeniality .
In March , the Democratic National Committee labeled him " Senator Hothead , " and circulated to reporters a quote from Mississippi Republican Sen .
Thad Cochran , who said earlier this year that " the thought of [ McCain 's ] being president sends a cold chill down my spine ..
He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . "
That line of attack , however , seemed to subside - until this financial crisis .
Nearly two weeks ago , as the crisis dominated the news , McCain claimed that the fundamentals of the economy were " strong , " then quickly corrected himself , saying the economy was " in crisis . "
This week , he defended his running mate , Sarah Palin's , suggestion that America risks another Great Depression .
After initially opposing the $ 85 billion bailout of insurance giant AIG , he backtracked and supported it .
Then he called for the firing of SEC Chairman Chris Cox , claiming he had " betrayed the public 's trust " - only to later soften those comments and call him a " good man . "
In an interview on " 60 Minutes " last Sunday , McCain surprised fellow Republicans by saying he would replace Cox with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat who has investigated Wall Street corruption .
Then came the big , roll - the - dice moves this week .
On Wednesday , McCain announcing he'd " suspend " his campaign to deal with the crisis and called for the postponement of the first presidential debate , scheduled to take plan in Oxford , Miss. , Friday night .
The move was ridiculed by Congressional Democrats like Majority Leader Harry Reid , who called it an attempt to rescue not the economy but McCain 's failed campaign .
Obama resisted calls to delay the debate .
" I think it is going to be part of the president 's job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once , " Obama told reporters on Wednesday .
It was part of the self - consciously cool and level tone Obama has maintained all week .
The Democrat 's campaign thinks voters will absorb the contrast .
Obama is " trying to make it look like a desperate measure - and to do it by using something people already believe about McCain 's character , " said one Democratic official .
Obama is trying , he said to make McCain " look wacky . "
But the attempt to draw a contrast with McCain 's character may carry risk for the Democrat as well .
McCain has been quick to invoke his service in Vietnam , and the ghosts of previous attacks on his stability , in response to any shots .
Republicans could also use overt attacks on McCain 's temper - something the Democrats have shied away from so far - as a cover to launch their own character - based attacks .
For now , though , McCain aides said they view not - so - subtle references to their candidate being " erratic " as mere bait to anger McCain so that he 'll prove the allegation in the debates that start Friday night .

Two pint - sized pugilists are set to square off in a match billed as the world ’s first boxing match featuring dwarves on the Gold Coast in Australia .
A bout between Jamie " The Giant " Fallon and Nazih " Hammer Head " Kheir was nixed from the undercard of a show in September after concerns from sponsors that the bout was too gimmicky .
But now promoter Jamie Myer aims to become the Don King of the below - the - belt boxing world , hoping that the November 14 bout will prove the first stage of creating a professional league for little people .
" It 's a legitimate title and it 's really about credibility , " he said .
" We 've got everything above board – they 've been training for six to eight months , they 're registered professionals , they 've been okayed by a fight doctor in Sydney and they 've opened their own governing body .
" It 's never been done before , but I think people will embrace it . "
Despite Myer ’s claims that dwarf boxing has not been staged before , attractions featuring the short statured are not unprecedented – although they do draw criticism for being little more than exploitative sideshows .
‘ Minis ’ are a well established tradition within the Mexican wrestling world of Lucha Libre and are particularly popular with children .
And Muay Thai kickboxing matches featuring midegets have proved bizarre YouTube hits .
However , Myer rejected comparisons to such unconventional sporting spectacles as dwarf tossing , claiming that the show had received the full support of little people associations .
" There 's always going to be critics , but why not give them a go ? " he said .
" They 've got two legs and two arms – they 're very small – but they can put on an absolute cracker of a fight . "
Is the appeal of watching dwarf boxing similar to that of a freak sideshow ?
Or are Fallon and Kheir right to claim attempts to stop them fighting amounts to discrminination ?
Have your say on the Mirror.co.uk forum boards .
And watch videos of dwarf tossing , a high - flying spill from a Mexican mini wrestler and midgets kickboxing in the videos below .

At a time when our young people are getting STDs from playing too much beer pong and Christian politicos can't even keep their own kids celibate , America is plainly in need of a useful public sex education campaign .
Well , we wo n't get it ; this country can't even tolerate Eva Mendes ' nipple yet .
You have to go to Belgium , where sex in advertising is a form of art !
Below is a new Belgian PSA that is perhaps the single best piece of televised sex ed I 've ever seen .
That ai n't mouthwash , yall :

The National Post ’s unholy obsession with Passchendaele
The National Post & other CanWest papers have now published multiple reviews of Paul Gross ’ epic WWI picture Passchendaele .
Their interpretation and obsession with Passchendaele is peculiar because none of the reviews seem to be particularly thrilled with the movie overall , but at the same time , they all seem to spare no energy praising the fawning and glorious portrayal of Canada , the Canadian military , militarism , Alberta , and the valour of combat in Passchendaele which were precisely the parts of the picture which I had the most difficulty with .
Now , it ’s one thing to be obsessed with a movie that one believes to be of superlative value and merit .
I certainly have movies of my own where I am guilty of precisely this and so it would be hypocritical of me to begrudge any reviewer of any movie the same leeway .
However , neither Nigel Vhannaford of the Calgary Herald nor Chris Knight of the National Post see the movie in this way .
On the contrary , both men hated Passchendaele for precisely the reasons that most of the audience in my movie theatre seemed to enjoy it and yet they praised it for the two - dimensional parts that promoted blind jingoistic nationalism and uncritical patriotism .
For instance , Knight of the National Post takes a poke at Passchendaele for not focusing on praising the province of Alberta ( where much of the movie is set ) enough for his liking .
Passchendaele – which , admittedly , is similar to the Hollywood movie Pearl Harbor insofar as the picture takes its name for a particular battle / event that is not necessarily central to the plot – also gets slammed by Knight for not focusing enough on the glorious war and instead focusing too much on the inter- personal relationships between the main characters .
Knight writes : “ Some cross-cutting between the home front and the European theatre might have helped remind us that there ’s a war going on .
Instead , the only clue is the behaviour of the local head of recruitment . ”
I mean , it ’s just madness , shear madness I say !
It ’s almost as if this meaningless war between the inter - related royal families of Russia , the U.K. and Germany which began over nothing is n’t the all consuming event for every single human on the planet every waking hour of every day as Knight had in mind .
Knight ’s disappointment that “ the only clue ” that we ’re at war in the movie is by the behaviour of certain people in the film is borderline childish with the refrain “ you mean we do n’t get to see blood and guts more often ” replacing the more common teenage boy obsession with wishing he got to see more breasts and asses “ more often ” .
But as ridiculous as Knight ’s review of Passchendaele is , it pales in comparison to Vhannaford ’s review .
Vhannaford went so far as to title his review “ Gross ’s Passchendaele does teach one thing – patriotism ” which obviously lets the cat out of the bag as to what he sees as the movie ’s key virtue .
Vhannaford ’s critique of Passchendaele borders on Puritanism when he writes ( I kid you not ) :
“ But , it ’s not all in the film — no U - boats or mutinies for instance , that would explain why it was so important so many Canadians should risk so much to kick the Germans out of Passchendaele , and why they deserve their place in the national narrative .
“ What was exhaustively covered were the dynamics and dilemmas of a handful of Calgarian families circa 1917 .
Gratuitously so , in fact .
We suspected teen sex went on in those days , but now we know .
And in a doctor ’s office , by George . ”
Anyone who ’s seen the movie will know which scene Vhannaford is referring to above .
Anyone who has not seen the movie would likely think from the above passage that the scene in question is like something out of the American Pie franchise .
Not to be outdone though , Vhannaford concludes his review with this jingoistic and demonstrably false assumption :
“ If all people get from this was that Canadian troops were the best of the best and saved the day for the British Empire in 1917 , and there was once a place called Passchendaele that should be spoken of in awed tones , it was a well done thing .
For , on this kind of shared understanding of history is patriotism based . ”
So , by his own words , Vhannaford would be happy if moviegoers got nothing from the movie except how great Canada , Canadian troops , the Canadian military and the salvation of the British Empire was .
The only problem with this – other than the fact that Vhannaford could n’t bring himself to mention the anti-German hysteria which gripped Canada during WWI and which was a significant part of the storyline ( indeed it was perhaps the most significant part of the storyline ) – is that the Third Battle of Ypres ( AKA the battle of Passchendaele ) was not the salvation of the British Empire any more than it was a significant military victory .
The movie and Vhannaford both gloss over the fact that any military significance of an obscene number of Canadians dying only to capture a shelled out and destroyed hamlet called Passchendaele was erased and undone in less than a fortnight by the Germans the following year who were able to easily re-capture the village .
The battle of Passchendale , in short , was significant only for the same reason that Postmodernism was significant : for its sheer absurdity .
But instead of attempting to understand the battle ’s full historical context , Vhannaford and company would rather turn Canadians into mere Saraphim for the Canadian state and thus it ’s no wonder they both hate and love the movie .
They love the movie because — like the six - winged Seraphim angels in Christian mythology whose sole job is to uphold God ’s Throne and do nothing else other than continually sing his praise for all of eternity – they see Passchendaele as instilling this same kind of uncritical praise for our secular god : the Canadian state .
Conversely , they hate the movie because it dares to suggest at times that there are other things in life worth doing than praising and upholding our secular god ’s throne .
We all know that being bald runs in families .
Both my Dad and I are bald , as are five of my eight uncles and both Grandfathers .
Based on twin studies , the heritability of male pattern baldness is 81 % .
This means that if your father or uncle is bald , you have a pretty good chance of going bald , too .
Even though the presence of a genetic component to baldness seems obvious , until this decade nobody had any idea what genes are responsible for this terrible affliction .
The first gene , the Androgen Receptor ( AR ) , was identified in 2001 .
This gene was found because it made sense : it is a receptor that regulates a cell 's sensitivity to androgens ( male sex hormones ) .
It is well established that balding regions of the scalp have increased levels of both the androgen DHT ( a derivative of testosterone ) and the androgen receptor .
Elimination of androgens ( such as by castration , but I do n't recommend it ) can eliminate balding .
[ This is why I have always argued that balding is a very manly trait . ]
For the next few years , no new genes were found even though AR can't be the whole story , since some men are much balder than others .
On October 12 , two studies were published in Nature Genetics ( one German and one British ) that have nearly identical results , and both implicate a new region of the genome in male pattern baldness .
Both studies examined various European populations and found that balding people tended to inherit the same genetic variants on a region of chromosome 20 called 20p11 .
So how big of a deal is it if you have the balding variant of this region ?
It depends on your AR gene .
The British study found that if someone carries an allele of AR that does n't promote balding , then your odds of becoming bald do n't even double compared to the rest of the population ( odd ratio ~ 1.6 ) .
But , for those poor bastards who have balding alleles at both AR and 20p11 ( about 14 % of the population ) , your odds ratio shoots up to 7.12 , meaning that you are seven times more likely to become bald than the more fortunate souls around you .
So what does this genomic region do ?
The short answer is , absolutely nothing .
What is striking about the region of 20p11 identified is that it is over 350,000 base pairs ( letters of DNA code ) away from the nearest gene .
That 's a long way as far as DNA is concerned .
The only way this region could affect balding , as far as anyone can tell , is by changing how strongly a nearby gene is expressed ( turned on or off ) .
Regions of the genome that affect the expression of nearby genes are called cis-regulatory regions .
350,000 bases is a long way , but it is not unheard of for cis-regulatory regions to affect gene expression at that distance .
So what nearby genes are affected ?
The two closest genes are PAX1 and FOXA2 .
What is important about these genes is that they are both .
Transcription factors are genes responsible for turning other genes on and off ( they bind to the cis-regulatory regions I just mentioned ) .
Since all of the cells in your body start with all the same genes , the reason you have a liver , heart , limbs , and so on is because transcription factors turn certain genes on and off at specific places ( for example , the transcription factor MyoD instructs cells to become muscle ) .
Of course , it 's possible that the effect of 20p11 has nothing to do with PAX1 or FOXA2 , but the current best explanation of the data is that one of those two genes is involved .
Coincidentally , mutations in FOXI3 , a gene similar to FOXA2 , cause several breed of hairless dogs .
What I like about these data is that they provide evidence in humans for a trend that is growing in popularity among evolutionary geneticists ; the trend that transcription factors will often be a source of variation .
Because they turn entire groups of genes on and off , transcription factors are poised to have huge effects ( adding just four transcription factors to a skin cell can turn it back into a stem cell ) .
My first instinct is that transcription factors are just too imporant to mess with in evolution ( mutating one transcription factor in flies creates this monster ) .
But , as we learn more and more about genetic variation , geneticists are finding that there are ways for a transcription factor to have a big effect on a trait without totally screwing up the organism .
Transcription factor changes are now known to underlie domestication traits in corn , wheat , rice , and tomatoes .
Transcription factor changes are also responsible for adaptive evolution in the threespine stickleback fish , and for differences between the larvae of fly species ( ironically , whether or not they have hair ) .
If it turns out that the transcription factors PAX1 or FOXA2 really do affect male pattern baldness , then I may see some gene therapy in my future .
I think it 's too late for Dad .
Malaysia is sending three navy ships to the coast of Somalia to protect merchant vessels from piracy .
The ships , carrying troops and helicopters , are expected to begin patrolling in the Gulf of Aden in the next few days .
Two Malaysian tankers from the shipping line MISC Berhad were seized last month by Somali pirates .
The seas off Somalia , close to busy shipping routes , have some of the highest rates of piracy in the world .
The country has been without a functioning central government for 17 years and has suffered from continual civil strife .
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said the ships being deployed would provide protection for five MISC Berhad vessels , and would not launch rescue operations .
Counting ships
Officials in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland say the ships are being held at the port of Eyl , a lawless outpost controlled by gangs .
Puntland 's minister for mines , who is leading a delegation to investigate the hijackings , told the BBC Somali Service from a hill overlooking the port that he could count eight captured vessels .
He said another two were reported to be on their way to Eyl .
The delegation had spoken to local elders , he said , but it had not approached the pirates .
The latest vessel to be hijacked was an Egyptian ship which was reported missing on Thursday .
Earlier this week a French sailing boat with two crew was seized .
Pirates holding that boat are reportedly seeking a ransom of more than $ 1 m ( £ 0.56 m ) .
Puntland 's ports minister said after the capture of the French boat that pirates in the region were well - armed and employ a lot of people .
He said there was little co-ordination between those trying to tackle them .
In June , the UN Security Council voted to allow countries to send warships into Somalia 's waters to tackle the pirates , but the ports minister complained that international vessels " do n't intervene " .
As voters have gotten to know Senator Barack Obama , they have warmed up to him , with more than half , 53 percent , now saying they have a favorable impression of him and 33 percent saying they have an unfavorable view .
But as voters have gotten to know Senator John McCain , they have not warmed , with only 36 percent of voters saying they view him favorably while 45 percent view him unfavorably .
Even voters who are planning to vote for Mr. McCain say their enthusiasm has waned .
In New York Times and CBS News polls conducted with the same respondents before the first presidential debate and again after the last debate , Mr. McCain made no progress in appealing to voters on a personal level , and he and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin , had alienated some voters .
Personal appeal is an intangible element in voters ’ decisions .
Each voter has a personal reason for connecting with a candidate or not .
But the percentage of those who hold a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama is up 10 points since last month .
Opinion of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Mr. Obama ’s running mate , is also up , to 50 percent last weekend from 36 percent in September .
In contrast , favorable opinion of Mr. McCain remained stable , and unfavorable opinion rose to 45 percent now from 35 percent in September .
Mrs. Palin ’s negatives are up , to 41 percent now from 29 percent in September .

Subject : ANNOUNCE : Windows cross-compiler ( was : Re : [ Caml - list ] OCaml 3.11.0 + beta1 cross-compiler )
[ Oh well , the overwhelming rush of answers seems to indicate we are entering into new territory here ...]
Here is a Linux ->
Win32 OCaml cross-compiler , developed and sponsored by Red Hat 's Fedora MinGW project [ 1 ] .
Red
Hat are sponsoring this project so that we can build our OCaml virt tools for Windows without the hassle of using Windows .
http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/fedora-mingw--devel/
( There is no direct link - to get the latest version you have to click " manifest " then " ocaml " ) .
If you 're not familiar with RPM builds , then start with the .spec file and the patches .
Pay close attention to the ' BuildRequires ' which are the parts of the MinGW project you will need to build it - in particular , we use a version of FlexDLL which we have modified for cross-compilation .
It 's probably best to say what does work , because the list of what _doesn ' t_ work is quite long .
But with this you get : i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlopt
The cross-compiler replacement for ocamlopt ( bytecode so you need a corresponding ocamlrun interpreter to use it ) *.cmx , *.cmxa

Nick Cave is an Australian singer - songwriter , musician , screenwriter , author , composer , and occasional actor who is best known for being the frontman of the rock band Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds .
Cave ’s music can be very emotional and is the result of an array of influences .
His band used to have overhead mics and different instruments and effects such as bass pedals or guitar loopers in order to obtain that unique sound that made them famous .
Most of the lyrics of their songs tackle themes such as religion , death , violence , and love .
Nick Cave &
The Bad Seeds was founded in 1983 after the Birthday Party , a band that Cave had with multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey , broke up .
Initially , the musical genre tackled by the band was post - punk , but it gradually shifted toward experimental alternative rock ; however , many of their albums incorporated diverse influences .
They used instruments such as trumpets from well - known brands , different kind of pedals and effects .
Cave was active in the bands the Birthday party ( 1973 - 1983 ) , Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds ( 1984 - currently ) , Grinderman , and he also performed solo , being accompanied by Warren Ellis on violin ( check this list from Yamaha ) or accordion on some of his tours .
Cave plays vocals , the keyboard , as well as the guitar .
He is known to have played the piano as well and you if you have a toddler obsessed with music you can find a useful selection here and here if drums is what you ’re looking for .
Read the rest of the article to find out what some of his favorite instruments are .
While Cave himself has never mentioned any of these instruments in particular , especially during interviews or performances , most of them were recognized by his fans .
Shure Beta 58A Vocal Microphone
According to Mixonline , Cave sings into a hard - wired Beta 58A .
The monitors that he prefers to work with are Nexo PS15 wedges .
If you love singing but ca n’t afford a professional microphone yet , karaoke mics may be the way to go .
The Beta 58A is a dynamic vocal microphone that has become the first option among many professional sound engineers and singers .
It ’s a high - output vocals microphone that was designed to be used in a recording studio and for the purpose of audio amplification .
The supercardioid polar pattern boasted by this mic extends over the whole transmission range and guarantees feedback - resistant amplifications , as well as a maximum isolation from other audio sources .
The off - axis sound is minimal , and the contoured frequency response is the best feature for close - up vocals .
Nick Cave is reported to have used several home studio mics , studio recording microphones , and studio headphones throughout his career .
Keyboards and synthesizers & Pianos
Over time , Nick Cave has used a variety of keyboards and synths from the Mellotron M4000D Mini or Korg CX - 3 Organ to the Nord Stage EX .
Each of these comes with advantages .
The Mellotron M4000D Mini is a semi- weighted Fatar keyboard with velocity that comes with an LCD and has as many as 100 Mellotron and Chamberlin sounds .
It boasts a mix potentiometer for cross-fading of two sounds and it has a low and high speed switch .
There ’s also a pitch switch .
You can connect headphones to the synth via the 6.3 mm output jack .
The Korg CX - 3 is a clonewheel organ that simulates the sound of an electromechanical Leslie speaker and a Hammond organ .
It was first introduced back in 1979 and there were two models produced – an analog one in 1979 and a digital one in 2001 .
Some of its notable users are Paul Shaffer , Derek Sherinian , Manfred Mann , and Isaiah “ Ikey ” Owens .
The Nord Stage EX is one of the most versatile instruments ever to have been developed as it is an organ , a piano , as well as a synth all in one .
The stellar features of this synth are Pitch Stick and Modulation Wheel that were included to provide the maximum musical expression .
The Organ section comes with emulations of three classic models , the Piano section includes six selectable categories , and the Synth section generates Subtractive , FM , and Wavetable synthesis .
When it comes to pianos , Nick Cave has apparently used a Yamaha CP - 70 Electric Grand Piano and a Shigeru Kaway SK - EX upright piano .
Guitars
As it was to be expected since Cave has played guitar time and again during many of his performances , here we have several more models to tackle .
It seems that Cave is partial to Fender guitars as he was seen performing on a Telecaster , a Stratocaster Electric Guitar , and a Telecaster Thinline Electric Guitar .
There is a performance by Grinderman where he plays No Pussy Blues and where it is rather obvious that he is using a Sunburst Fender Stratocaster .
Some guitarists might argue that the tone and volume knobs of this guitar can get a little too sensitive over time , but the rest of the instrument is perfectly fine .
It is one of the models that have made famous musicians well - known — such as Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Holly .
Its sound is incredible , it is well - balanced , and it fits just right .
It ’s also been reported to be functional and reliable .
Nevertheless , it could use some upgraded pickups , a better bridge and better tuners , but most of the Stratocasters developed by Fender are good enough in all of these respects .
Cave is reported to have used guitar metronomes and travel guitars before , along with various small guitar amps , phaser pedals , looper pedals , and guitar multi effects pedals .
Ghosteen – Latest Album
The latest album from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds was released on October 4th , 2020 and it is called Ghosteen .
The title combines the word “ ghost ” with the Irish - language suffix “ ín ” which translates as “ small ” or “ benevolent ” and in the title , the suffix is Anglicized as “ een ” .
It is a double album and it is the first one the band has released since 2004 and it marks the final part of a trilogy of albums that included Skeleton Tree and Push the Sky Away .
The double album includes a total of 11 songs with a total length of 60 minutes and 10 seconds .
Part 1 includes the songs “ Spinning Song ” , “ Bright Horses ” , “ Waiting for You ” , “ Night Raid ” , “ Sun Forest ” , “ Galleon Ship ” , “ Ghosteen Speaks ” , and “ Leviathan ” .
The second part of the album includes just 3 songs , but it encompasses half of the total length of the double album since it features two lengthy songs , “ Hollywood ” which is 14 minutes and 12 seconds long and “ Ghosteen ” which clocks at 12 minutes and 10 seconds .
The other song found in Part 2 is “ Fireflies ” .
All the lyrics in this double album are written by Nick Cave while the music is composed by Cave and Warren Ellis .
The album reached number 6 on the UK Independent Albums charts and number 1 on the Ultratop charts in Belgium .
It is a very powerful album that was met with critical acclaim and it sits currently at a Metascore of 97 % on Metacritic with a user score of 8.8 .
This situates Ghosteen among the highest - scoring albums currently on the website and ranks it as the top-rated album of not only 2020 but the 2010s as well .
The album is influenced in part by the accidental death of Nick Cave ’s 15 - year old son in 2015 and critics and fans alike were quick to praise the haunting but comforting songs found on the album .
While grief is a big theme in his songs , so is love , since in this album love is the power that manages to transcend both life and death .
In “ Ghosteen Speaks ” , in the lyrics “ I am beside you , you are beside me , ” Cave sings from the perspective of his son which emphasizes that love is indeed the propelling force in life and one of the central themes of his album .
There are darker tracks such as “ Hollywood ” and they hurt very much but are necessary for understanding Cave ’s grief and love for his son .
The critics ’ consensus is that Ghosteen is an album that raises the bar in terms of lyrical expression and it a long and sad meditation on grief that is simultaneously beautiful and terrible to listen to .
Ghosteen also marks the 40th anniversary of Nick Cave ’s recording career and it is a great piece of art that while intimidating for the uninitiated , does n’t require a lot of knowledge of the wider Cave mythology to enjoy .
It is an album that is worth purchasing and listening to if you want to be devastated and moved by its humanity , beauty , and despair .
Biography
Nicholas Edward Cave was born in Warracknabeal , Australia on 22/09/1957 .
His mother ’s name is Dawn , a librarian ; his father Colin was an English teacher .
He has two older brothers , Tim ( 1952 ) and Peter ( 1954 ) and a sister , Julie ( 1959 ) .
He was raised an Anglican , which explains the apparent influence of The Bible in his work ..
His education : Caulfield Grammar School , Melbourne and an Art School ( Art department of Caulfield Institute of Technology , now Monash University ) which he attended only two years .
An example of Nick ’s art is on the back of the Birthday Party ’s “ Prayers On Fire ” album , signed “ Nicholas Cave ” .
At Caulfield Nick met Mick Harvey , with whom he founded a high - school band that would become The Boys Next Door .
The first recording released by Nick was “ These Boots Are Made For Walking ” in 1978 , a single that was soon followed by the album “ Door Door ” the next year .
The band consisted of Nick , Mick Harvey , Tracy Pew , Phillip Calvert and Rowland S. Howard ( from 1979 on ) .
The Boys Next Door slowly dissolved into “ The Birthday Party ” in 1980 when the album of the same name came out : some copies stated “ The Birthday Party by The Boys Next Door ” , others only “ The Birthday Party ” .
When they changed their name , the band moved from Australia to London .
Renegade outsiders ,
The Birthday Party hit London from Melbourne with a force that still resounds today .
Nick Cave , Mick Harvey , Rowland S. Howard , Tracy Pew and Phil Calvert blazed through incendiary live shows and a string of albums and EPs of swaggering , raw - boned blues that were at odds with the plastic pop of the early ’ 80s .
The Birthday Party had a huge impact on the British rock scene of that time , especially because of the expression of “ raw emotion , wit and essential dumbness ” ( Mute Records ’ opinion ) in their music , though it took some time for them to really break through .
The LP “ Prayers on Fire ” was released in 1981 , “ Junkyard ” in 1982 .
The band moved to West - Berlin and fell apart in 1983 after releasing 3 studio albums and 2 EP’s .
Their last EP , “ Mutiny ” , was the ultimate manifestation of the extremity of The Birthday Party ’s art .
Following the group ’s breakup in 1983 , Cave briefly sojourned in Los Angeles , writing a film script that would later manifest itself as the prison movie Ghosts … Of The Civil Dead , made with director John Hillcoat and director Evan English .
He also assembled the first incarnation of The Bad Seeds .
Mick Harvey remained from Birthday Party days .
Blixa Bargeld , of Einsturzende Neubauten infamy , had appeared as guest guitarist on The Birthday Party track “ Mutiny In Heaven , ” from their final Mutiny EP .
Barry Adamson , who had guested on “ Kiss Me Black ” from The Birthday Party ’s seminal Junkyard LP , came from revered Manchester post - punks Magazine .
Joined by Anita Lane , Edward Clayton Jones and Hugo Race , they released From Her To Eternity in 1984 .
This fusion of diverse talent was , if anything , more resourceful in constructing vivid musical backdrops to Cave ’s song narratives .
Part of the Birthday Party members continued to form The Bad Seeds , recording the first Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds album in 1984 : “ From Her To Eternity ” .
The line - up at this time was : Nick Cave , Blixa Bargeld ( guitar ) , Mick Harvey ( drums ) , Barry Adamson ( guitar and piano ) , Hugo Race ( guitar ) , Tracy Pew ( bass , only during the Australian tour ) , with cooperation of Anita Lane .
The name “ Bad Seeds ” come from the film “ Bad Seed ” by Mervin LeRoy , 1956 , based on a play by Maxwell Anderson and a novel by William March .
Relocated in Berlin , Cave started work on what was to become his debut novel , And The Ass Saw The Angel .
The themes he was evoking in this work would fire the next Bad Seeds album , 1985 ’s “ The First Born Is Dead ” , in which Cave , Harvey , Bargeld and Adamson explored the myth - heavy terrain of Delta blues .
The epic single “ Tupelo , ” based on John Lee Hooker ’s song of the same name , encapsulated Cave ’s Biblical fixation in one go , blending the birth of the King with Old Testament mythology .
Recruiting Die Haut ’s Thomas Wydler as drummer , the 1986 incarnation of The Bad Seeds selected a poignant set of covers for the “ Kicking Against The Pricks ” album , including Tim Rose ’s “ Hey Joe , ” Velvet Underground ’s “ All Tomorrow ’s Parties ” and the definitive rework of Gene Pitney ’s “ Something ’s Gotten Hold Of My Heart . ”
They swiftly followed this collection with the “ Your Funeral ..
My Trial ” LP .
By this time , Barry Adamson had left the band , replaced by ex-Cramps / Gun Club man , Kid Congo Powers , while the lineup expanded with Roland Wolf on keyboards .
This incarnation delivered 1988 ’s “ Tender Prey ” , with its condenmed - man drama “ The Mercy Seat ” the most outstanding single .
That year also saw the publication of Cave ’s book , “ King Ink ” , a collection of lyrics and plays , and the band appeared in Wim Wender ’s film “ Wings Of Desire ” , performing “ The Carny ” and “ From Her To Eternity . ”
“ Ghosts … Of The Civil Dead ” , with a score composed by Cave , Bargeld and Harvey and a central acting performance by Cave , gained its theatrical release , and the singer ’s film work took on another dimension when he appeared as rock star Freak Storm in Tom DiCillo ’s Johnny Suede .
After this , Cave moved from Berlin to Sao Paolo , Brazil , where he had met Viviane Carneiro during a tour .
The influence of Brazil is apparent in “ The Good Son ” , the album released in 1990 .
The music is much more melodious and friendly than on any other album released before and is often said to express the Brazilian feeling of “ saudade ” .
Kid Congo Powers ( Cramps , Gun Club ) made his appearance as a member of the Bad Seeds on this album , although he already played in the band for a longer period , during the YFMT and KAtP times .
In 1989 , a film called “ Ghosts … of the Civil Dead ” was released , co-written by Nick , the soundtrack of which was written by Nick , acted in by Nick .
It is a prison movie .
Not until 1992 , the seventh album was released : “ Henry ’s Dream ” , followed by a worldwide tour .
Again , the line - up was changed : Nick , Blixa , Mick , Thomas , Martyn P. Casey and Conway Savage .
The tour was used to record their only official live CD to be released in 1993 : “ Live Seeds ” .
The CD was intended as a celebration of the ten years ’ existence of The Bad Seeds and is sold together with a photobook by Peter Milne .
The book contains photographs from the 1992/3 tour .
The Bad Seeds ’ creativity continued to soar to ever - heightening peaks over their next three releases .
1994 ’s imaginative feast , “ Let Love In ” , was produced by Tony Cohen , whose association with Cave dates back to The Birthday Party days .
With Cave now based in London , The Bad Seeds ’ impetus continued apace .
1996 ’s “ Murder Ballads ” was a culmination of Cave ’s longtime fascination with “ the language of violence ” and allowed for further bold experimentation in musical style .
Collaborations with Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey on the singles “ Where The Wild Roses Grow ” and “ Henry Lee , ” respectively , led to mainstream chart success and The Bad Seeds widest exposure ever .
This album also saw the addition of two new Bad Seeds : Warren Ellis , of Melbourne ’s The Dirty Three , added vibrant violin , and New York NoWave troubleshooter Jim Sclavunos pitched in atmospheric percussion .
Apart from this , Nick Cave features on the compilation Album “ Songs In The Key Of X ” , which has songs on it from the TV serial “ The X - Files ” .
Nick does “ Red Right Hand ” and can be found on a “ Hidden Track ” called “ Time Jesum transeuntem et non reverendum ” ( Dread the passage of Jesus for he will not return ) with The Dirty Three .
Meanwhile , Cave , Harvey and Bargeld resumed their cinematic links with John Hillcoat , scoring his second feature film , 1996 ’s To Have And To Hold .
Cave ’s second anthology of lyrics and essays , King Ink II , was also published that year .
Nick Cave was shortlisted for “ Best Male Artist ” of 1996 by MTV Music Awards .
He declined the honour , stating that he did not want to compete with other people where Art was concerned .
” Thank you but no … no thank you ” .
March 1997 saw the release of The Bad Seeds ’ tenth studio album , The Boatman ’s Call .
Cave ’s most intensely personal work to date , the music was pared down to a beautiful simplicity , evoking magical atmospheres , while the singer explored the themes of love , faith and loss in unflinching detail .
Just as Murder Ballads piled on the visceral details with evident glee , so The Boatman ’s Call stripped away all the veils of pretense to the bone of the emotions it evoked .
The contrast between the two albums says much about Cave and The Bad Seeds ’ continual quest for excellence and illumination , as well as displaying all the versatility of the most singular ensemble in contemporary music .
In 1998 , the album “ The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds ” was released , as well as a video compilation of several songs .
The album contains selected songs , mainly chosen by Mick Harvey , but the other Bad Seeds contributed as well .
Initial copies of the album contain a bonus - disc with live tracks from the concerts in Royal Albert Hall , 1997 .
During 1999 , Nick Cave performed without The Bad Seeds , usually with Warren Ellis and somethimes with Dirty Three .
” And The Ass Saw The Angel – Readings and Music ” was rereleased .
That ’s a Nick Cave 1988 readings acompanied by Mick , plus the music Mick Harvey and Ed Clayton - Jones recorded for a theatrical adaptation of the book from October 1993 .
Meanwhile he get married with Susie Bick .
2001 – “ No More Shall We Part ” was released
2003 – “ Nocturama ” , Blixa leaving the Bad Seeds
2004 – “ Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus ” – 2004
2005 – “ B - Sides & Rarities ” , a comprehensive three - disc , 56 - track collection of B - sides , rarities and tracks that appeared on film soundtracks
A Hong Kong computer programmer who had legally resided in the US for 15 years ( since he was 17 ) and fathered two American children went for his final green card interview and was locked up , detained until he died of cancer that the DHS refused to treat him for .
He had overstayed a visa ( the DHS sent a key notice to the wrong address ) , and this prompted the DHS to lock him away and demand that he waive all right to immigration appeal and be immediately deported .
In detention , his complaints of excruciating back pain were treated as fakery , and he was dragged around in shackles after he lost the ability to walk , taken on long , bumpy drives while official demanded that he drop his immigration appeals .
The jailers who caused his death were private contractors with fat deals with the DHS to lock up immigration detainees .
As he lay dying , his family — wife and two children , aged 1 and 3 — were denied access to him while the warden considered their request to visit .
" Give us your poor , your tired , your huddled masses … "
But his condition continued to deteriorate .
Once a robust man who stood nearly six feet and weighed 200 pounds , his relatives said , Mr. Ng looked like a shrunken and jaundiced 80 - year - old .
" He said , ' I told the nursing department , I 'm in pain , but they do n't believe me , ' " his sister recalled .
" ' They tell me , stop faking . ' " Soon , according to court papers , he had to rely on other detainees to help him reach the toilet , bring him food and call his family ; he no longer received painkillers , because he could not stand in line to collect them .
On July 26 , Andy Wong , a lawyer associated with Mr. Cox , came to see the detainee , but had to leave without talking to him , he said , because Mr. Ng was too weak to walk to the visiting area , and a wheelchair was denied .
On July 30 , according to an affidavit by Mr. Wong , he was contacted by Larry Smith , a deportation officer in Hartford , who told him on a speakerphone , with Mr. Ng present , that he wanted to resolve the case , either by deporting Mr. Ng , or " releasing him to the streets . "
Officer Smith said that no exam by an outside doctor would be allowed , and that Mr. Ng would not be given a wheelchair .
Ill and in Pain , Detainee Dies in U.S. Hands
Somalia 's dire situation - worse than at almost any time in the past , aid workers say - has been driven by the worsening violence , drought following the fourth consecutive failed rains , and hyperinflation caused by record food prices which have risen 1,000 per cent in some areas .
Not only is the economy crashing , but so is part of the House of Representative 's website .
The site 's button – " Write Your Representative " – was bombarded by millions of constituents wanting to speak their mind about the stalled $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout .
A government official , Jeff Ventura , who runs the House.gov site , said millions of clicks on the feature might bring down the entire site .
Here 's what the " Write Your Representative " button said when we clicked on it several times Tuesday and again Wednesday :

Plentyoffish.com , a free online dating site which generates revenue from sending members to other dating sites , has recently released data that promiscuity among women has doubled since 2004 .
The site tracked 315,478 users going to casual only dating sites in 2004 .
Of those users , the number of women who were looking for sex through the intimate encounter option was about 9 % .
Among users tracked in 2008 , the number of women who were looking for an intimate encounter rose to 18 % .
The statistics are surprising given that the male : female ratio of Plentyoffish.com members looking for long term relationships or traditional dates has remained consistent at 55:45 .
Three years ago , men who were looking for intimate encounters online outnumbered women 10 to 1 .
Now , the ratio is only 5 to 1 .
Within a decade , it 's predicted that men and women will be equally promiscuous , with a 1 to 1 ratio of those looking for intimate encounters .
Markus Frind , CEO of Plentyoffish.com explained , " Our average user , among males and females , is between 38 and 42 years old .
Yet , the data shows that the behavior exhibited is more of what you would expect from those in their early 20s .
Plentyoffish.com statistics may be indicative of a fundamental shift in society and behavioral norms . "
Scientists at Gillette have won this year ’s Nobel Prize for Physics for their development of the Gillette Samurai , the world ’s first seven - bladed razor .
“ They said man could n’t fly .
We flew , ” said project leader , Roger Bigsby .
“ They said we could n’t travel faster than sound , but we smashed the sound barrier .
They said duct tape could n’t cure warts …
OK , we ’re still working on that one .
And they said a razor with more than five blades was impossible .
Ladies and gentlemen , ” he said , “ You can now have cheeks that will set new standards for babies ’ bottoms ! ”
As recently as two years ago the scientific community scoffed at the idea of a razor with more than five blades .
Field experts like Dr. Alexei Dotsenko , a physicist at MIT , assumed Gillette had reached the practical limit of shaving technology with the five - bladed Gillette Fusion .
“ Are we shaving or fencing ? ” asked Dotsenko in 2006 .
“ We physicists have a saying — if God meant for us to shave with such razors , he would n’t still have his beard . ”
Even before Gillette released the five - bladed Fusion , Bigsby and his team explored the theoretical possibilities of six and perhaps even seven blades .
Traditional multi- bladed razors lift the hair as they cut , enabling subsequent blades to shave closer , but sometimes sharpening the hairs instead of cutting them off and causing an irritating medical condition known as “ Pinhead Syndrome . ”
For the Samurai , Bigsby envisioned blades which became progressively sharper .
The sixth blade , made of finely cut diamond , is sharp enough to cut through time itself , allowing the seventh blade to shave whiskers growing twelve hours in the future , eliminating five - o- clock shadow .
“ This was the real driving force behind Albert Einstein ’s work on the Theory of Relativity , ” said Bigsby .
“ His mistress hated stubble , not to mention that silly mustache . ”
Bigsby dedicated the award to the brave scientists who tested the blades .
Setbacks were many — five men lost ears , one cut off his nose and two were driven mad by constant nightmares of working in a delicatessen .
Finishing second to the Gillette team was the European Organization for Nuclear Research and their work on the Large Hadron Collider , the world ’s largest particle accelerator .
A close third was Scotty McFarlane , a Brooklyn teenager , for his iPhone 3G app “ X - Ray Vision ” that allows users to take pictures of women and make their clothes disappear .
Starting today , when Java users around the world are prompted to download an update , the MSN toolbar will be offered as a tag - along , according to Microsoft representatives .
Starting today , when Java users in the U.S. are prompted to download an update , the MSN toolbar will be offered as a tag - along , according to Microsoft representatives .
It 's part of Microsoft 's continuing effort to raise awareness about its competitor to Google 's market - dominating search site .
Not only will the toolbar give access to Live Search , but also to MSN content like news , and to Live services such as Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger .
" This agreement with Sun Microsystems is another important milestone in our strategy to secure broad - scale distribution for our search offering , enabling millions more people to experience the benefits of Live Search , " said Yusuf Mehdi , senior vice president of the Online Audience Business at Microsoft , in a statement .
" With the vast array of Java software - based Web applications that are downloaded every month , this deal will expose Live Search to millions more Internet users and drive increased volume for our search advertisers . "
The move reflects fiscal weakness on Sun 's part ; the company posted a $ 1.7 billion loss in its most recent quarter .
The alliance is especially surprising , as Sun 's Java platform has traditionally competed with Microsoft technologies such as ActiveX and , more recently , Silverlight .
Sun claims that the Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) is installed on 91 percent of Internet - connected PCsor over 800 million units , and that 6.5 million developers around the globe use its programming language .

If the Minnesota Senate race seems as though it has slogged on like Groundhog Day , well , it has .
A five - member state canvassing board today unanimously rejected Al Franken ’s appeal to count all those rejected absentee ballots , but that does n’t mean the recount is over — yet .
The board appears to have left room for more challenges , some at the local county level , but also in anticipation of a court fight between Mr. Franken , the Democrat , and the Republican incumbent , Senator Norman Coleman , once the recount is over .
According to The Associated Press and the Minneapolis - St. Paul Star - Tribune , about 12,000 absentee ballots — or somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent of all absentee votes cast — were rejected by various local poll workers around the state .
The hand recount began about a week ago , and has been chronicled like a daily episode of Florida redux , with some county officials holding their heads in their hands , and the day - to - day tallies moving by inches .
Or rather by just a few votes here and there .
By Tuesday night , it seemed Mr. Coleman was clinging to a 238 - vote lead , but that only includes places where recounts have been completed .
Going into the recount , Mr. Franken trailed Senator Coleman by about 215 votes , from a total of about 2.9 million cast .
Most of the time , Mr. Coleman has maintained a tiny , tiny lead .
In a statement released this afternoon by Mr. Franken ’s lead recount lawyer , Marc Elias , he said the campaign was disappointed by the canvassing board ’s decision .
But he said , “ We are encouraged that the board is going to have further deliberations next week , preventing at least some of the absentee voters from being disenfranchised , including those rejected for obvious errors . ”
The Franken campaign said it would not appeal today ’s board ruling , while awaiting further meetings .
But Mr. Elias did seem to issue a rather not - so - subtle threat that the process could go on and on , drawing renewed fire from Mr. Coleman ’s lawyer .
First , Mr. Elias :
As we have said all along these votes will be counted , and based on today ’s meeting , I remain more confident than ever that that is true .
Whether it is at the county level , before the Canvass Board , before the courts , or before the United States Senate , we do n’t know yet .
But we remain confident these votes will be counted .
The Board ’s consensus only strengthens our resolve . ”
In response , Fritz Knaak , senior counsel for Mr. Coleman , replied :
“ It is up to Al Franken to decide if he intends to subject Minnesotans to a never - ending legal battle when this recount is concluded and Norm retains his lead .
Our focus is on completing the recount , and we are pleased that the Canvassing Board has committed to following the status quo in this matter . ”
On Tuesday night , Mr. Knaak had released a statement urging a truce , of sorts :
“ It has become apparent that both campaigns are engaged in a mounting game of ballot challenging that serves no useful purpose .
This is not the way the recount process was intended to work , and we are trying the patience and goodwill of election officials and volunteers throughout the state .
While the Franken Campaign began this morning challenging 25 ballots in one Sherburne County precinct , the vast majority without merit , it ’s obvious that our campaign volunteers felt the need to match these growing and unnecessary challenges throughout the day .
This is an artificial game which has virtually no bearing on the outcome of this recount as we know that the vast majority of these challenges will be rejected before we even get to the Canvassing Board on December 16th .
With that in mind , in the spirit of the holidays , and to give respect to this process that it deserves , we ask you to join us tomorrow morning in standing down in the game of ballot challenge one upsmanship . ”
This battle seems destined for some record book , especially given the Democrats ’ inching forward to a filibuster - thwarting 60 - vote threshold in the Senate .
Of course , we ’re also all still watching the Georgia runoff between Senator Saxby Chambliss , the Republican incumbent , and his Democratic challenger , Jim Martin .
Tarsnap public beta
Tarsnap is an implementation of my idea of a perfect online backup service .
After many months in private beta testing , tarsnap is now publicly available for BSD , Linux , and other UNIX - like operating systems .
The design of tarsnap was guided by the following four principles :
Backups should be secure against attack from Hostile Governments and ( Extended ) Three Letter Agencies , even if they force me to cooperate with them .
You should n't have to trust me to keep your secrets if someone puts a gun to my head -- because if someone puts a gun to my head , I 'll do whatever they tell me to do .
Backups should be powerful but intuitive .
Each time you create a backup , you should have complete control over what you want to have backed up ; and you should be able to delete backups at any time .
A backup service should n't do things like deleting old backups after 30 days just because the original version of the file was deleted .
Backups should be efficient .
You should be able to rename files , create multiple copies of them , append data to them , edit parts of them , concatenate them together , et cetera , without needing to store the unchanged data twice .
Backups should be provided as a utility , with pay - as - you - go pricing .
Forcing people to figure out ahead of time how much data they want to back up so that they can sign up for the right " plan " is dumb , and having some customers subsidize other customers is inherently unfair .
How does tarsnap satisfy these four principles ?
Let 's look at them one by one .
Paranoid security
tarsnap - keygen
tarsnap - keygen
Before you can start using tarsnap , you have to register a machine with the tarsnap server using theutility .
This serves two purposes : First , it tells the server which account should be charged for usage ; and second , theutility generates cryptographic keys .
Several cryptographic keys , in fact .
The keys used by tarsnap include
A 2048 - bit RSA key used for signing archives .
This is used in combination with SHA256 and a Merkle hash tree to verify the authenticity of stored archives .
( Cryptographers : RSASSA - PSS is used , with SHA256 as the hash function . )
A 2048 - bit RSA key used for encrypting session keys .
All the data which the tarsnap client sends to the server to store is encypted with per-archive random AES - 256 keys ; those keys are encrypted with this RSA key and attached to the stored data .
( Cryptographers : RSAES - OAEP is used to encrypt the session keys , using MGF1 and SHA256 , and the padding verification performed when decrypting is carefully written to be free of timing side channels .
The AES - 256 keys are used in CTR mode , with sequentially incrementing nonces . )
A 256 - bit HMAC - SHA256 key used to protect each individual block of data from tampering .
From a cryptographic perspective , this is unnecessary , since a Merkle hash tree protects each archive ; but data is compressed using zlib before being stored , so this provides protection against a theoretical attacker who can tamper with stored data and has found a security flaw in zlib decoding .
has found a security flaw in zlib decoding .
Two 256 - bit HMAC - SHA256 keys used to generate names for blocks of data stored .
Tarsnap uses the same reference - by - hash trick as my Portsnap and FreeBSD Update utilities do ; using HMACs instead of raw SHA256 hashes prevents any information from leaking via the hashes .
( Why two keys ?
One is used to hash data , and the other is used to hash archive names .
Yes , that 's right , even the names of archives are stored securely . )
of archives are stored securely . )
Three 256 - bit HMAC - SHA256 keys used to sign requests sent by the tarsnap client to the tarsnap server :
One used for writes , one used for reads , and one used for deletes .
These are the only keys sent to the tarsnap server by tarsnap - keygen .
tarsnap - keymgmt
Naturally , not all of these keys are needed for every operation .
Tarsnap comes with autility for generating key files with a subset of the keys .
For example , you can create a key file with only the keys needed to write an archive ; you could use this to generate backups from a server every day , knowing that if an attacker broke into your server and started deleting all of your files , he would be unable to destroy ( or even read ) your backups .
Tarsnap 's paranoia also extends to the client - server protocol .
With most online backup services , you 're lucky if they use SSL ; I avoided using SSL because I was n't satisfied with its security .
Obtaining a fraudulent SSL certificate is too easy ( read : possible ) for an attacker , and relying on external certification is n't necessary for tarsnap :
The tarsnap server 's public key is included in the tarsnap client code .
Further , the complex and error - prone SSL protocol ( how error - prone ?
Just look at how many security issues OpenSSL has had over the past decade ) is replaced by a significantly streamlined protocol which is cryptologically similar to SSL and resists chosen - input side - channel attacks .
( Cryptographers :
The server uses its 2048 - bit RSA key to generate an RSASSA - PSS signature on a Diffie - Hellman parameter modulo the 2048 - bit " group 14 " modulus .
The Diffie - Hellman computation is performed using a blinded exponent .
The result of the DH exchange is mixed with a 256 - bit server nonce , a master key is generated using MGF1 , and client and server AES - 256 and HMAC - SHA256 keys are derived from that .
Finally , the client and server exchange HMAC - SHA256 signatures of the master key to confirm that the key exchange succeeded .
After the key exchange is complete , variable - length packets are exchanged , authenticated using the HMAC - SHA256 keys and encrypted using the AES - 256 keys in CTR mode . )
Naturally , I would never ask someone to blindly trust a binary which I provide , so all the source code to the tarsnap client is available .
Tar - like front end
tar - xf foo.tar
tar - cf backup.
tar ~/ myfiles
What 's the most powerful and widely used archiving tool on UNIX - like systems ?
Tar .
Various versions of tar have existed ever since Seventh Edition Unix was released in January 1979 , and rare is the user of a UNIX - like system who has n't at some point typedor
Tarsnap , as the name suggests , has the same look and feel of tar .
You can run
tarsnap -c -f mybackup ~/myfiles
tarsnap -t -f mybackup
tarsnap - x -f mybackup
bsdtar
-- exclude
-- include
-- keep - newer - files
-- nodump
to generate an archive named " mybackup " which contains the files in ~ / myfiles ; and you can runandto list and extract the contents of the archive " mybackup " .
Because tarsnap is based on Tim Kientzle 's excellent libarchive archiving library and the includedimplementation of tar , tarsnap also accepts , and many other options .
Of course , instead of being stored as a file on your local disk , tarsnap archives are stored remotely .
Since you can't list your archives with ls , there 's a
tarsnap -- list - archives
rm
tarsnap -d -f backupInolongerwant
command to do that for you ; and since you can't delete an archive with , there 's acommand to do that .
Finally , just in case you want to stop using tarsnap but keep your archives ,
tarsnap -r -f mybackup
Snapshotting
will convert the archive " mybackup " to a tar stream and write it to the standard output .
The second part of the name " tarsnap " is " snap " .
Rather like in " Portsnap " , actually .
As with Portsnap , the " snap " in tarsnap refers to snapshots ; and this is what makes tarsnap both efficient and intuitive .
Most backup systems work with a model of " full backups " plus " incremental backups " :
Once in a while , a full backup is generated , which involves storing everything ; and then more frequent incremental backups are generated , which store only the differences since the last full or incremental backup .
When you want to restore a backup , you start by going to the most recent full backup , and then you apply each of the intervening incremental backups -- all told , a big headache at exactly the time when you do n't need any more headaches .
By working with snapshots , tarsnap eliminates the " full plus incrementals " paradigm .
When tarsnap writes archives , it keeps track of each block of data which has been written to the server .
If it sees the same block of data again -- even if it 's part of a different archive -- it does n't need to store that block .
Tarsnap also keeps track of how many archives reference each block ; when you delete an archive , tarsnap only removes blocks from the server when there are no archives remaining which reference them .
In the " full plus incrementals " paradigm , there 's a trade - off between full backups and incremental backups : Incremental backups are far more efficient , but are less convenient because you can't keep an incremental backup unless you keep all of the preceding increments back to the last full backup .
Snapshots provide the best of both worlds :
The performance of incremental backups , and the convenience of being able to decide to keep or delete each archive completely independently of other archives .
Prepaid " utility " pricing
Tarsnap uses a model which should be familiar to anyone who has ever used a prepaid mobile phone :
You deposit money into your account by sending a paypal payment , and as you use tarsnap , money is deducted from your account at a rate of 300 picodollars per byte of bandwidth used ( $ 0.30 / GB ) and 300 picodollars per byte - month of storage used ( $ 0.30 / GB - month ) .
When your account balance reaches zero , you lose access to tarsnap .
If your account balance stays below zero for too long , your account will be permanently removed any backups you have stored will be deleted .
That said , tarsnap does n't follow some of the more obnoxious aspects of mobile phone pricing :
Your money wo n't evaporate after X days , there is n't any monthly " account maintenance fee " , and if you want to stop using tarsnap , you can have your money back .
It is your money , after all .
If you use twice as much storage and bandwidth , you pay twice as much .
If you use a very small amount of storage , you pay very little -- some tarsnap users have less than 10 MB stored , and they 're paying a fraction of a cent per month .
All of the accounting for tarsnap is rounded in the customer 's favour to the next attodollar ( that 's a millionth of a picodollar , or a quintillionth of a dollar ) , mostly because I 'm a math geek who hates rounding errors .
Public beta

( UPDATE 2010 - 02 -23 :
The above - mentioned issues were fixed a few months ago .
There are still scaling issues , but they 're much further away now -- please warn me if you plan on uploading more than 5 TB , though . )

I have n't figured out how to deal with Canadian and BC sales taxes yet , so for now only non-Canadians are allowed in .
So what does it mean for tarsnap to now be in public beta ?
It means that if you go to the tarsnap beta testing website ( : Go to the main Tarsnap website instead ) , you can create a tarsnap account , download the tarsnap client code , and start using tarsnap ( at least , as soon as you send in some money via paypal to fund your account ) .
It also means that there are some rough edges which I want to get rid of before I remove the " beta " label :
In spite of these ( minor ) rough edges , the past months of private beta testing have demonstrated to my satisfaction that the tarsnap code is very solid .
The " beta " label is an indication that some things are still subject to change and improvement -- not a statement about the quality of the code which is already done .
So what are you waiting for ?
Go and get started with tarsnap !

I have had the best fun writing a piece that appears in today 's G2 , about the way Barack Obama 's rhetoric relates to ancient models – and particularly how he seems to me to be something of a new Cicero .
( Maybe it 's the product of having recently published a book called It's All Greek To Me that makes me see everything as related to the classical world – but I 'm not the only one .
Ancient historian Mary Beard has just written an interesting blog comparing Obama to the first African - Roman emperor , Septimius Severus . )
There are those who will say – and with reason – that we are long way from the time when presidents delivered anything like intellectually heavyweight rhetoric .
But in the post - Nixonian era of ever - shorter soundbites and ever - more demotic speechifying , Obama has certainly bucked the trend : in his oratory he at least does not project himself as being less intelligent than he actually is .
It 's true that Cicero 's speeches , with their long , sweeping periods and their evident excitement at the possibilities that Latin can bring , are much , much more complex than Obama's .
But in their rhythmic patterns , in the use of many Ciceronian rhetorical tricks ( lots about this in the piece ) and in their neat and clever construction I find Obama 's speeches frequently recalling their distant Roman antecedents .
It 's more than that though – it's also that Obama and Cicero were both men of letters , writers , thinkers and lawyers .
They share a constant self - questioning , self - doubt , and excavation of their own identity and history ( there 's lots on this kind of thing in recent Cicero scholarship ) .
They both project a personality through oratory that is absolutely fused with the personality of the state ( a point I borrow from Ian Leslie 's blog here by way of Tom Holland 's fantastic book Rubicon ) .
And they both regard rhetoric as a practice inextricable from the ethical pursuit of a civic ideal .
Here 's the brilliant classicist Joy Connolly writing in the introduction to her 2007 book The State of Speech , ( about ancient rhetoric , but a work she felt impelled to write after 9/11 when " never had the daily practice of citizenship and the exercise of political power seemed so great " ) .
" I concentrate on rhetoric 's representation of the ideal orator , which I read as an exploration of the ethos of the ideal citizen .
Just like the persuasive speech he utters , this citizen is a complex , paradoxical construction , at once imperious and responsive , masterly and fragile , artificial and authentic , who seeks civil concord through the exercise of a seductive authority . "
She 's talking about ancient Rome – but this seems an incredibly apposite way to speak about Obama .
A brief nod to ancient Athens while we are here – the point I loved in my piece was that made by ancient historian James Davidson – that the passionate oratory that comes from contemporary pulpits in America , and is a particular feature of the black church , has its origins in ancient Athens .

GM 's shares duly slumped by $ 1 to close at $ 3.36 , after falling at one point to $ 3.02 - their lowest level since 1946 .
" Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy , we believe that the company 's future path is likely to be bankruptcy - like , " said Lache .
Deutsche warned that GM may not even have enough money to see it past the end of December .
It said the motor manufacturer 's US cash could drop to $ 5bn and that this could be " overwhelmed by payables coming due in early January " .
The US president - elect , Barack Obama , has indicated that he favours aid to Detroit 's struggling motor industry to avert huge job losses and economic damage .
The Michigan - based Centre for Automotive Research has estimated that as many as 2 m jobs in the supply chain could be jeopardised if GM or rival Ford collapse .
But any bail - out is likely to come with strings which could undermine the value of shareholders ' equity .
Analysts at Barclays Capital said : " While further government assistance would decrease the likelihood of a GM bankruptcy , we believe any government assistance would likely significantly dilute GM 's equity . "
GM pointed to further difficulties today by admitting in a regulatory filing that the mortgage operations of its GMAC finance arm may not survive .
After reporting a $ 2.5 bn quarterly loss last week , GM 's chief executive , Rick Wagoner , made it clear that he viewed a filing for protection against creditors as a potentially disastrous option : " You ca n't sell cars to people under those circumstances . "

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - Oscar - winning South African - born actress Charlize Theron was named a United Nations messenger of peace on Friday , with a special focus on ending violence against women .
Messengers of peace , of which there will now be 10 , are celebrities mainly from the fields of film , music , literature and sport who are charged with promoting U.N. activities and ideals through public appearances and media contacts .
Theron , 33 , won an Academy Award for her role in the 2003 movie “ Monster , ” in which she played serial killer Aileen Wuornos , who came from a background of violence and abuse and was executed in Florida in 2002 .
In the 2005 film , “ North Country ” she played a woman who fights back against sexual harassment .
She has been in dramas like “ The Cider House Rules , ” thrillers such as “ The Italian Job ” and the special - effects filled “ AEon Flux . ”
Theron , named by Esquire magazine last year as its “ Sexiest Woman Alive , ” has also been involved in charitable causes such as putting mobile health clinics in rural areas of her native South Africa where access to care is limited .
She had her own experience of domestic violence at the age of 15 when her mother fatally shot her alcoholic father as he threatened the family in a drunken rage .
Designating her a messenger of peace , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said , “ You have used your voice , compassion and special relationship with the public to create a better world . ”
The other messengers of peace are actors George Clooney and Michael Douglas , musicians Daniel Barenboim , Midori Goto and Yo - Yo Ma , authors Paulo Coelho and Elie Wiesel , equestrian Princess Haya Bint al - Hussein and naturalist Jane Goodall .
I was just thinking yesterday that I need to get back to the posts I was intending to make after my initial post of the month , Two Fun(ctional ) Questions .
Then tonight Eric Florenzano made an excellent post on Lambda Calculus which is related to my topic of interest .
So let me take one of his examples and raise again the issue from my first post .
First of all , consider the following Python function taking two arguments :
>>> add_ = lambda x , y : x + y
This function works as expected :
>>> add_( 5 , 4 ) 9
Eric shows a curried version defined in Python :
>>> add = lambda x : lambda y : x + y
and shows how , when given one number , this returns a function that takes a second number and adds it to the first :
>>> add ( 5 ) (4 ) 9
To emphasize my desire to blur the distinction between functions and constants , I 'd like to point out the following works too :
>>> ( add ) ( 5 ) ( 4 ) 9
But imagine we want to add three numbers .
With our two - argument version , we could say :
>>> add_( 5 , add_ ( 2 , 2 ) ) 9
How would we do that with our curried version ?
I 'm NOT talking about defining a new ' add ' , I 'm talking about using multiple applications of the original ' add ' just like we did with ' add_ ' above .
The following works :
>>> ( add ) ( 5 ) ( ( add ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ) 9
but note the additional parentheses we had to add .
If we wanted to instead defer the application of the final argument we'd have to rewrite it as :
>>> ( add ) ( ( add ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) ) < function < lambda > at 0x755f0 > >>> ( add ) ( ( add ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) ) ( 2 ) 9
So the question is : is there a way to modify add ( hopefully with just a wrapper that could be applied to any unary function ) such that the following work :
( add ) ( 5 ) ( add ) ( 2 ) ( add ) ( 5 ) ( add ) ( 2 ) ( 2 )
where the former is equivalent to ( add ) ( 7 ) and the latter returns 9 ?
And is this pretty much the same question I asked in my original post with the very same solution (s ) ?
By the way , here is another example that should work in any true solution ...
If I define
>>> M = lambda x : ( x ) ( x )
then we should be able to get
( add ) ( M ) ( 1 )
to return 2 .
Or is this whole hybrid approach destined to failure and the only real way to use combinators is with Church - encoded numerals ?
Update , Dec. 22 : A few variations of the map technique are posted here .
We spent some of our spare time last week exploring data from the 2008 presidential election and thinking of some interesting ways to visualize it .
Above is one map we put together .
One thing we sought to do was present an alternative to cartograms , which are becoming increasingly popular as post- election maps .
Cartograms are typically offered as an alternative to the common red and blue maps showing which states or counties were won by each candidate , wherein one color ( presently , red ) dominates the map because of the more expansive — but less populated — area won by one candidate .
Election cartograms such as the popular set by Mark Newman distort areas to reflect population and give a more accurate picture of the actual distribution of votes .
A drawback of cartograms that we 're very aware of , however , is that in distorting sizes , shapes and positions are necessarily distorted , sometimes to the point of making the geography virtually unrecognizable .
Our map is one suggestion of a different way to weight election results on the map while maintaining correct geography .
What we 've done is start with a simple red and blue map showing which candidate ( Republican and Democrat , respectively ) won each county in the lower 48 states .
Then , to account for the population of those counties ( or , the approximate distribution of votes ) , we 've adjusted opacity .
High - population counties are fully opaque while those with the lowest population are nearly invisible .
Against the black background , the highest concentrations of votes stand out as the brightest .
We 'll let viewers be the judge of its cartographic effectiveness , but we hope you 'll at least agree that it looks pretty cool !

November 10 , 2008 -- Millions of Americans see the election of Barack Obama as a referendum on white supremacy and today we join in their celebration .
The racist campaigns launched against Obama , conducted sometimes in coded language and other times in inflammatory accusations , turned out to be amazingly unsuccessful .
Yet the 2008 election also represents a dual reality that is important for socialists and activists for peace and social justice to grasp .
For tens of millions of Black Americans , seeing a United States president - elect who ’s Black – and even more important , for their children to see a Black president – is a huge symbolic stride towards full citizenship and liberation .
Perhaps no event since that legendary night in 1938 , when Joe Louis knocked out Max Schmeling , has there been such a magic moment of celebration for the Black community ; only in this case they were n’t simply spectators but participants in the victory .
It ’s not only Black Americans who feel like “ our long national nightmare is over ” .
Young people and working - class Americans , including tens of millions of white people , Latinos , Asian Americans , American Indians and people of Middle Eastern origin feel the same way .
You need only know that Barack Obama carried suburban Macomb County , Michigan – the archetype homeland of “ the Reagan Democrats ” – to understand how much the political tide has turned .
After the decade of Republican domination , a huge majority of Americans are disillusioned with the country ’s political direction and its visible economic decay .
George W. Bush goes down ( in more ways than one ) in history .
He ’s the first president to serve two full terms without being legitimately elected even once .
He ’s not the first president to launch a war on the basis of a lie , but he is the first one to cut taxes in wartime , pretending it did n’t have to be paid for .
His administration was an eight - year continuing criminal enterprise , breaking all of Richard Nixon ’s and Ronald Reagan ’s records for abuse of power .
Ultimately , his economic policies broke the bank – literally – helping to drag down the US and world economy , along with his own political party .
But all that is precisely why Barack Obama ’s election and mandate did n’t come only “ from below ” , from Black and Latino and working - class and young Americans .
It also came “ from above ” , from the elites of corporate USA .
As much as they enjoy the benefits of two major capitalist parties scrambling for power while they carry on the business - as - usual of globalisation , lean production and squeezing maximum profits from our labour , they know that the Republican administration has become a disaster for their system and for US imperial power .
Under Bush , US prestige in the world has collapsed .
Iraq has been a catastrophe .
Afghanistan and Pakistan are becoming a debacle .
Latin America is in revolt against neoliberalism and US domination .
Barack Obama ’s election is bringing enormous international enthusiasm and instant credibility , whereas the election of John McCain and Sarah Palin would have been greeted with “ they ’ve got to be kidding ” .
And a third consecutive election stolen by Republican vote - suppression tactics and electronic vote - switching fraud could have created a massive “ legitimacy crisis ” .
Whose mandate will direct Obama ’s course ?
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue ; an Obama administration promises to expand the “ War on Terror ” in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
While the mainstream media may celebrate “ the end of racism ” , 1 million Black men remain locked in prison , wealth disparities grow , and the crisis of foreclosures and factory shutdowns hits communities of colour the hardest .
In a time of great crisis Obama ’s intention of “ reaching across the aisle ” suggests the most cosmetic of reforms .
Never has race and racism been as openly discussed in mainstream political conversations .
Nonetheless Obama ’s Philadelphia speech about racism repeated the mandatory “ commonsense ” distortion of the country ’s history : the USA is a land of opportunity , perhaps sometimes marred by a failure to live up to its great ideals .
The history begins with the genocide of native peoples , the slavery of African Americans and the theft of land and attempted destruction of Mexican and Indian culture .
The violent suppression of communities of colour and imperial expansion reveal a nation in which institutional racism is deeply embedded .
Jim Crow may be gone , but the forces that perpetuate discrimination exist is housing , education and jobs .
The subprime crisis represents the greatest loss of wealth for people of color in modern US history .
A Black family in the White House , built by slaves , can impact the negative stereotypes deeply rooted in US culture – but ending discrimination requires far more .
The undemocratic two - party monopoly mainly allows voters an opportunity to “ throw the bums out ” – and throw them out they did .
That ’s a long way , however , from forcing through a “ rescue package ” for people rather than Wall Street institutions – a ban on foreclosures , a rewriting of mortgages to reflect their real rather than fictitious value , instituting universal single - payer health insurance system we desperately need , a massive jobs program to build an environmentally sustainable economy , an end to the wars , occupations and secret torture prisons , and a drastic downsizing of the imperial military budget .
The Democratic Party , which will fully control Congress and the White House , has the power to set the legislative agenda .
Those who expect this party to respond to the desire for change so vividly shown in the November 2008 election will soon begin to be disappointed – more and more so as the new administration shows its loyalty to corporate interests .
Highlighting the “ reality gap ” between the hopes for peace and justice and the reality of the Democratic Party agenda is an urgent , immediate task .
Millions of people responded to calls for “ change ” ; hundreds of thousands gained organising skills in working for Obama .
In the months and years ahead , the responsibility of the left is working to re-ignite social movements independent of the Democratic Party ’s dictates .

A court in Iran has ruled that a man who blinded a woman with acid after she spurned his marriage proposals will also be blinded with acid .
The ruling was reported in Iranian newspapers on Thursday .
The punishment is legal under the Islamic Sharia principle of qias , equivalence or analogy , which allows retribution for violent crimes .
The court also ordered the attacker , 27 - year - old Majid Movahedi , to pay compensation to the victim .
The acid attack took place in 2004 .
The victim , Ameneh Bahrami , went to Spain for surgery to reconstruct her face but efforts to restore her sight failed .
The ruling was a response to her plea to the court in the Iranian capital Tehran for retribution .
" Ever since I was subject to acid being thrown on my face , I have a constant feeling of being in danger , " she told the court .
Ms Bahrami also said that Movahedi had also threatened to kill her .

A new study carried out by the British scientists revealed that it takes a person 10,000 hours of practice to become ace in a certain discipline .
They say that top musicians , sportsmen and chess players were all able to become masters in their field by achieving the level where their time of practice reached 10,000 hours .
Researchers suggest that the time spent for practicing makes the difference between a person who is good and the one that is brilliant .
They carried out their study at Berlin's Academy of Music by observing violin students who began playing at the age of five .
These students started practicing for 2 or 3 hours a week and as they grew so increased the time they spent for practicing .
Top performers , by the time they celebrated their 20th birthday , reached 10,000 hours of practice , but those who simply showed good results achieved the amount of 8,000 hours .
" It seems it takes the brain this long to assimilate all it needs to know to achieve true mastery , " explained neurologist Daniel Levitin to Focus , a BBC science magazine , which published The Story of Success .
In his book , entitled Outliners , Malcolm Gladwell wrote that The Story of Success may explain why Beatles became so popular .
While in Hamburg , Germany , the band played about 8 hours a night , seven days a week in their early days .
When they became popular the Fab Four had already performed about 1,200 live concerts , more than many young bands play during their career .
In 1922 , Madrid is wavering on the edge of change as traditional values are challenged by the dangerous new influences of Jazz , Freud and the avant - garde .
Salvador Dali arrives at the university ; 18 years old and determined to become a great artist .
His bizarre blend of shyness and rampant exhibitionism attracts the attention of two of the university ’s social elite – Federico Garcia Lorca and Luis Bunel .
Salvador is absorbed into their decadent group and for a time Salvador , Luis and Federico become a formidable trio , the most ultra-modern group in Madrid .
However as time passes , Salvador feels and increasingly strong pull towards the charismatic Federico – who is himself oblivious of the attentions he is getting from his beautiful writer friends , Margarita .
Finaly , in the face of his friends ’ preoccupations – and Federico ’s growing renown as a poet – Luis sets off for Paris in search of his own artistic success .
Federico and Salvador spend the holiday in the sea-side town of Cadaques .
Both the idyllic surroundings and the warmth of the Dali family sweep Federico off his feet .
Salvador and he draw closer , sharing their deepest beliefs , inspirations and secrets , convinced that they have found a kind of friendship undreamt of by others .
It is more that a meeting of the minds ; it is a fusion of souls .

An internal memo from a top Citibank analyst reveals what the banks really think about the global financial situation , and the outlook is grim .
“ The world is not going back to normal after the magnitude of what they have done .
When the dust settles this will either work , and the money they have pushed into the system will feed through into an inflation shock , ” wrote Tom Fitzpatrick , Citibank ’s chief technical strategist .
He goes on to explain that the massive money creation efforts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks will end with one of two things :
A resurgence of inflation , or a fall into “ depression , civil disorder and possibly wars . ”
Either outcome , he says , will cause the price of gold to skyrocket .
Gold will push to well over $ 2,000 per ounce , he explains .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The timing on all this ?
Sometime in either 2009 or 2010 , said the analyst .
This coincides with predictions I ’ve made here on NaturalNews.com , where I ’ve publicly predicted price inflation of 20 % – 40 % in 2009 , and the financial collapse of the United States government ( sometime before 2025 ) due to an irreversible debt burden .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
I ’ve also predicted that when the people wake up and realize their dollars have been looted by the Treasury and turned into worthless pieces of paper , there will be riots in the streets .
These events have already been set into motion .
It is now only a matter of time until they bubble to the surface .
On the day the mainstream taxpayers actually figure all this out , do n’t be caught out in public .
Stay home .

A Chinese motorist was arrested after police pulled him over for a routine check and discovered that he had no arms .
Zing Shen , 42 , who lost both arms below the elbow in an industrial accident , told the officers that he had been steering with his legs for years .
A police spokesman said : " The man said that he was a very safe driver and felt he was as good as anyone else on the road , despite his disability .
He had an automatic car so did not need to worry about changing gears and said he had put a lot of practice into learning to control the steering wheel with his legs .
He said he was actually even more careful now with driving than he had been before he lost his arms . "
Police issued Mr Zing with a public safety summons .
WASHINGTON , D.C. -- A Gallup Poll update on Americans ' personal financial problems shows that the public has shifted away from a hyperfocus on gas and energy prices and has started to voice increasing concerns about a wider range of money issues , including debt .
In July , Americans ' worries about three day - to - day pocketbook issues -- energy costs , an overall lack of money , and the high cost of living -- easily trumped anything else they could think of when asked to name the most important financial problem facing their families .
But a Gallup Poll conducted Oct. 3 - 5 reflects a more broad - ranging picture today .
The percentage of Americans who single out energy costs in this open - ended question has decreased considerably , from 29 % to 12 % , coincident with a drop in gas prices .
Now , it is one of several issues mentioned by about 1 in 10 Americans as their most pressing financial concern , along with lack of money , inflation , healthcare costs , and too much debt .
There has been a modest increase since July in the percentage of Americans citing retirement savings , from 4 % to 7 % .
However , the October poll was conducted before this past week 's series of stock market losses , so it is possible that concerns about retirement have since increased .
Despite considerable demographic differences between Americans who support Barack Obama and those who support John McCain , there is not a great deal of difference in the financial concerns voiced by these two groups .
Americans ' financial concerns do , however , vary across income groups .
Those with lower incomes are most likely to be worried about not having enough money , while those with higher incomes are most likely to mention retirement .
With Gallup Polls indicating record levels of concern on the part of Americans about the U.S. economy and increasing signs of worry about personal financial situations , these data reveal that these signs of real economic anxiety are not driven by any paramount financial issue in Americans ' eyes , but rather by a whole host of concerns .
This in many ways echoes the financial crisis itself , which each day seems to touch more industries , companies , countries , and individuals .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,011 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 3 - 5 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
One of the sharpest and most telling differences on foreign policy between Barack Obama and John McCain is whether the United States should talk to difficult and disreputable leaders like Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez .
In each of the three presidential debates , McCain belittled Obama as naive for arguing that America should be willing to negotiate with such adversaries .
In the vice presidential debate , Sarah Palin went even further , accusing Obama of " bad judgment … that is dangerous , " an ironic charge given her own very modest foreign - policy credentials .
Are McCain and Palin correct that America should stonewall its foes ?
I lived this issue for 27 years as a career diplomat , serving both Republican and Democratic administrations .
Maybe that 's why I 've been struggling to find the real wisdom and logic in this Republican assault against Obama .
I 'll bet that a poll of senior diplomats who have served presidents from Carter to Bush would reveal an overwhelming majority who agree with the following position : of course we should talk to difficult adversaries — when it is in our interest and at a time of our choosing .
The more challenging and pertinent question , especially for the McCain - Palin ticket , is the reverse :
Is it really smart to declare we will never talk to such leaders ?
Is it really in our long - term national interest to shut ourselves off from one of the most important and powerful states in the Middle East — Iran — or one of our major suppliers of oil , Venezuela ?
During the five decades of the cold war , when Americans had a more Manichaean view of the world , we did , from time to time , cut off relations with particularly odious leaders such as North Korea 's Kim Il Sung or Albania 's bloodthirsty and maniacal strongman , Enver Hoxha .
But for the most part even our most ardent cold - war presidents — Dwight Eisenhower , John Kennedy , Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan , none of whom was often accused of being weak or naive — decided that sitting down with our adversaries made good sense for America .
They all talked to Soviet leaders — men vastly more threatening to America 's survival than Ahmadinejad or Chávez are now .
JFK negotiated a nuclear Test - Ban Treaty with his mortal adversary , Nikita Khrushchev , just one year after the two narrowly avoided a nuclear holocaust during the Cuban missile crisis .
Perhaps more dramatically , Nixon , the greatest anticommunist crusader of his time , went to China in 1972 to repair a more than 20 - year rupture with Mao Zedong that he believed no longer worked for America .
All of these cold - war presidents embraced a foreign - policy maxim memorialized by one of the toughest and most experienced leaders of our time , Israel 's Yitzhak Rabin , who defended his discussions with Yasir Arafat by declaring , " You do n't make peace with friends , you make peace with very unsavory enemies . "
Why should the United States approach the world any differently now ?
Especially now ?
As Americans learned all too dramatically on 9/11 and again during the financial crisis this autumn , we inhabit a rapidly integrating planet where dangers can strike at any time and from great distances .
And when others — China , India , Brazil — are rising to share power in the world with us , America needs to spend more time , not less , talking and listening to friends and foes alike .
The real truth Americans need to embrace is that nearly all of the most urgent global challenges — the quaking financial markets , climate change , terrorism — cannot be resolved by America 's acting alone in the world .
Rather than retreat into isolationism , as we have often done in our history , or go it alone as the unilateralists advocated disastrously in the past decade , we need to commit ourselves to a national strategy of smart engagement with the rest of the world .
Simply put , we need all the friends we can get .
And we need to think more creatively about how to blunt the power of opponents through smart diplomacy , not just the force of arms .
Talking to our adversaries is no one 's idea of fun , and it is not a sure prescription for success in every crisis .
But it is crude , simplistic and wrong to charge that negotiations reflect weakness or appeasement .
More often than not , they are evidence of a strong and self - confident country .
One of America 's greatest but often neglected strengths is , in fact , our diplomatic power .
Condoleezza Rice 's visit to Libya in September — the first by a U.S. secretary of state in five decades — was the culmination of years of careful , deliberate diplomacy to maneuver the Libyan leadership to give up its weapons of mass destruction and renounce terrorism .
She would not have achieved that victory had she refused to talk to the Libyans .
For sure , a successful diplomacy needs to be backed up by strong military and intelligence services to fight our wars and terrorist groups like Al Qaeda .
We should constantly remind our adversaries that we have other options , including the possible use of force , if talks fail .
But we have put too many of the world 's problems on the shoulders of our generals and intelligence officers when diplomacy — our ability to persuade , cajole or threaten an opponent — is sometimes the better and more effective way to proceed .
We need to trust our ability to outmaneuver dangerous regimes at the negotiating table and in the high court of international public opinion .
Iran is a case in point .
Its hard - line , theocratic government poses the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East today .
It is funding and arming most of the region 's terrorist groups shooting at us , Israel and our moderate Arab friends .
It has complicated our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Most alarming , Iran is seeking a nuclear - weapons capability that would change the balance of power in the Middle East .
Rather than default to the idea of using U.S. military force against Iran , would n't it make more sense for the next American president to offer to negotiate with the Iranian leadership ?
Here 's the logic .
If the talks end up succeeding , we will have prevented a third , and potentially catastrophic , war for the United States in the volatile area linking the Middle East and South Asia .
If the talks fail , we will have a far better chance of persuading Russia and China to sign on to tougher sanctions against Iran .
I think war with Iran would be unconscionable if we refuse even to try diplomacy first .
I 'm not saying the next president should sit down immediately with Ahmadinejad .
We should initiate contact at a lower level to investigate whether it's worth putting the president 's prestige on the line .
We should leave the threat of military action on the table to give us greater leverage as we talk to the Iranian government .
And ultimately we'd want other countries with influence — like Russia and China — to sit on our side of the table in order to bring maximum pressure to bear against Tehran .
But the United States has n't had a meaningful set of talks with Iran on all the critical issues that separate us in 30 years , since the Khomeini revolution .
To illustrate how far we have isolated ourselves , think about this : I served as the Bush administration 's point person on Iran for three years but was never permitted to meet an Iranian .
To her immense credit , Secretary Rice arranged for my successor to participate in a multilateral meeting with Iranian officials this past summer .
That is a good first step , but the next American president should initiate a more sustained discussion with senior Iranians .
If we are n't willing to talk to Iran , we may leave ourselves with only one option — military action .
The next U.S. president will have little chance of securing peace in the Middle East if he does n't determine Iran 's bottom line on the nuclear issue through talks .
Similarly , there will be no peace treaty between Syria and Israel if we do n't support the talks underway between those countries .
In Afghanistan , the new president will face a very difficult set of choices roughly similar to those in Iraq before the surge .
The brilliance of Gen. David Petraeus 's strategy in Iraq was , in part , to build bridges to formerly bitter foes in the Sunni militias and to cajole and entice them to switch sides .
Some are now suggesting that we should deploy a similar strategy with the Taliban rank and file .
While we should have absolutely no interest in sitting down with Qaeda fanatics or the Taliban leadership , does it make sense to try to persuade lower - ranking Taliban supporters to give up the armed struggle and commit to a democratic Afghanistan ?
While that 's a seemingly logical goal , it would be highly problematic in the short term .
We would be better served if we first built up a position of much greater military and political strength , and increased security for Afghan villagers .
Talking to our adversaries is not always the answer to all our problems , especially in a highly complex environment such as Afghanistan .
We have a long way to go before it might be part of a long - term solution there .
America faces a complex and difficult geopolitical landscape .
The next president needs to act more creatively and boldly to defend our interests by revalidating diplomacy as a key weapon in our national arsenal and rebuilding our understaffed and underfunded diplomatic corps .
Of course he will need to reserve the right to use force against the most vicious and implacable of our foes .
More often than not , however , he will find that dialogue and discussion , talking and listening , are the smarter ways to defend our country , end crises and sometimes even sow the seeds of an ultimate peace .

The Terror Party
This is accompanied by a smiling photo of Governor Charlie Crist , along with a message warning that terrorists want to kill us , and that we should vote for Republicans to “ help keep America safe . ”
( You can download a .pdf of the entire mailer , if you want . )
Got that ?
The State GOP , which paid for this thing , and the formerly post - partisan Governor , are saying that Democrats want to surrender to terrorists .
Talk about low - class smear jobs …
The three important elements are the course itself , an overhead track , and a method of suspending the player .
The ideal system would be a 2 - axis motorized track in the ceiling paired with a haptic winch .
This winch would dynamically amplify a player 's actions while keeping them safe .

AMERICA REDUCED TO THIRD WORLD STATUS
By Joan Veon
September 22 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
World history is spotted with stories of political conquests : Attila the Hun , Genghis Khan , the Pharaohs , Alexander the Great , and Roman Caesars , each who seized physical control of a country , its economy and assets .
History holds no story of a take over based solely on a country ’s assets , until now .
The modern day Attila ’s , Genghis Khan ’s , Pharaoh ’s , and Caesar ’s are the men who own and control the Central Banks of the world .
America ’s Central Bank is the Federal Reserve , which controls our monetary system , is not part of our governmental system , and , although its name would imply , it has no reserves .
The 13th month of America ’s credit crisis may hold its own in history as a country whose economic power and bulk of wealth overnight become the assets of the Federal Reserve .
This may well be the finest coup d’état .
For more than a week the news media has been a buzz , clamoring for the need to change our regulatory system .
The passage , by Congress , of “ The Treasury Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory System , ” will hand over to the Federal Reserve the last vestiges of our financial sovereignty : savings and loans ; state chartered banks ; thrifts and credit unions ; the entire mortgage and insurance systems , as well as oversight of the Payment and Settlement System of Wall Street .
In addition , the Feds would gain oversee rights to all of America ’s financial markets .
( Read “ The Treasury Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure , ” ) .
Most Americans can’t fathom what is really happening .
How could something like this happen in America ?
How did people who lived through the 1929 Crash and Great Depression manage when everything they knew changed overnight ?
The answer is : they were not in debt the way Americans are today .
Multi-generations lived together , all working to pay off the mortgage .
Additionally , a great many families lived on farms where they could raise their own food .
Today , we are dependent on large banks for our mortgage and debt and big grocery stores for our food rather than our own farm .
We know from various historians that when the stock market crashed in 1929 , the Federal Reserve was at fault because they did not put liquidity into the system but took it out , thus exacerbating the Crash and causing the Great Depression .
In response , on the day he was sworn in , newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt took control of all private ownership of gold when he closed the banks down .
He also instituted a number of socialistic measures to put Americans to work with infrastructure projects .
Today , the Federal Reserve is putting billions of newly printed dollars into the American and global financial system which will increase the interest on the debt that Americans owe to the Federal Reserve .
We have no idea , at this time , what that will do to our purchasing power , but you can be sure that it will drop .
In fact , the value of the dollar could drop so low that we will have to merge our currency with Canada , Mexico , and the other countries of this hemisphere , or even forego the proposed Amero for the Special Drawing Right - SDR , a basket of five currencies : the dollar , the Swiss Franc , the British pound sterling , the euro and the yen .
The SDR is the currency used by the IMF / World Bank and adopted several years ago by the Bank for International Settlements when they changed from the gold franc to the SDR .
I am grateful to geopolitical expert Terry Hayfield , who introduced me to the writings of Harvard economist Joseph Schumpeter .
Schumpeter came up with the idea of creative destruction as a way of saving capitalism , or should we say , transferring the value of capitalism from many to a few powerful insiders ?
Since capitalism is an ism , like Marxism , socialism , or fascism , you need to prop it up by destroying in order to “ save . ”
Our economy has been propped up by debt : mortgages , credit cards , home equity loans , lines of credit , auto loans , tuition loans , medical loans , Treasury bills , notes and bonds , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , commercial loans , business loans , etc .
We must also keep in mind that for every loan interest or a usury is being collected .
We are a debtor nation .
Creative Destruction is the key component , as seen in most of this past weeks headlines .
The Financial Times screamed : “ CREDIT PANIC HITS HISTORIC LEVELS ; ” “ FAR REACHING CHANGES LOOM IN US ; ” “ PUSH FOR CRISIS BREAKTHROUGH ; ” and “ GLOBAL MARKETS ROAR IN APPROVAL , US Rescue Plan Sparks Record Rises for Equities . ”
The Washington Post reiterated : “ STOCKS PLUMMET AS LENDING FREEZES UP , Lawmakers Left on the Sidelines as Fed , Treasury Take Swift Action ; ” “ US PROPOSES $ 500B BAILOUT , Bush ’s Shifting Ideology , ” and “ PRESIDENT SEEKS HISTORICALLY BROAD MARKET INTERVENTION . ”
This mornings , ( Sunday ) The Washington Post headlines read : “ WASHINGTON READIES SEA CHANGE FOR WALL STREET , Cultural and Structural Shifts Rise Out of Risk - Taking Titans ’ Hard Fall ” and “ RESCUE PLAN GROWS TO $ 700B , Similar Measurers Urged Overseas . ”

If you listened to the commentators on CNBC business news , what you heard from time to time from the mouth of Erin Burnett is “ creative destruction ” and “ Schumperterism . ”
The following is a dialogue from September 15 with Larry Cudlow , Mark Haines and Erin Burnett :
Mark Haines : “ Is this another example of creative destruction for the failure of government ? ”
Larry Cudlow : “ Lots of mistakes but the role of creative destruction and Schumperter play a role here . ”
Erin : “ We have a philosophy of –a veil of uncertainty and Schumpertism … . ”
As I have written before , our entire economy and all of our assets are in the process of being transferred to the Federal Reserve , who now appears to be running the United States of America .
We have had a bloodless coup by a very , very powerful group of ruthless men who not only control the United States of America but in unity , control the world in conjunction with all of the other central banks .
Furthermore , they have united to intervene in global markets .
Their apex : the Bank for International Settlements , ( BIS ) , located in Basle , Switzerland .
During this past week , as they acted in concert with liquidity to the tune of $ 600B , opening up their discount windows for 24 hour loans to any banking institution in trouble , it may be fair to say a world or global central bank was birthed .
For America , it began in 1913 when those who opposed a central bank went home for Christmas .
In 1913 , on December 24th , at 11:45 p.m. , after their colleagues left to go home for the holidays , greedy politicians pushing for a central bank garnered enough votes to pass it .
What is a central bank ?
The idea began originally in Sweden who decided that they would set up a private corporation to lend monies to the government at interest .
The government would pay interest on the principal borrowed forever .
Interest in perpetuity !
Can you imagine interest being paid to you forever ?
This is usury par excellent and is known as bondage .
This brilliant idea was adopted by Holland which transported it to England , and little by little around the world .
While America had its own central bank which was formed at the time of our Independence , it was closed by Andrew Jackson and never renewed until 1913 .
Ever since the Federal Reserve Act was passed , Congress voted over 195 times to give the Federal Reserve more power .
In essence , Congress has voted away all their authority and power to protect us .
If they do n’t vote for the emergency package , i.e. Resolution Trust and Blueprint , the market will crash .
If they do vote for it , the American people are reduced to serfs and slaves in the New World Order which will be run by the real financial center of the world , the City of London .
Either way they will be blamed .
Basically they should be tried and hanged for treason along with every president and Congress before them down to 1913 .
With most Americans up to their eyeballs in debt , it is as if we have been led to the slaughter .
First the $ 7T crash of the NASDAQ in 1999 where the value of our stocks and bonds dropped which was followed by 9/11 where the government told Americans to support our economy by “ going out to spend . ”
The Fed accommodated Bush by dropping interest rates to 45 year lows .
Naive and happy Americans bit the apple and went out and purchased the American Dream .
The level of debt rose astronomically .
Then there were home equity lines of credit .
Wow !
All this for us .
No — we have been thrown into the lion ’s den—be it Daniel ’s Lion ’s Den or the Coliseum .
Now , using the credit crisis which , in my opinion was created , these 21st Century Attila the Huns , aka the Federal Reserve , is coming in for the kill .

These carpet - baggers are going to clean up and become the new royalty in America , owning homes across the land that they were able to purchase for two cents on the dollar .
The first time they did this was in 1980 with the Savings and Loan Crisis when the same kind , but different types of events were orchestrated to bring down the institutions that held commercial real estate .
Do you remember that Congress authorized the Resolution Trust Corporation which was financed by our tax dollars to get rid of all the “ worthless ” commercial real estate ?
The problem is that we never had any accounting and no public disclosure about who bought what assets as it was all very clandestine .
Now 28 years later , we have the same situation , except it is our mortgages .
What happened between then and now ?
The price of homes rose substantially .
In 1970 before Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard , you could buy in the Washington , D. C. area , a three bedroom all brick house on ½ acre for $ 32,000 .
today that same home sells for a reduced price of $ 450,000 - $ 500,000 , depending on where it is located .
Our currency has been devalued substantially .
That is the real reason for inflated prices along with the situation that was created after the 9/11 tragedy .
The Federal Reserve lured Americans into their dream house which is now their worst nightmare by dropping interest rates to 45 year lows and creating the mortgage bubble .
In the Washington , D. C. area , you could not find a house to buy cause of all the activity .
Prices for homes doubled in a very short period of time .
What can we expect , now that we are in the Lion ’s Den ?
Congress will pass the legislation that the Federal Reserve wants as early as Monday morning to clam the markets .
Please see the accompanying article on “ The Blackmailing of Congress . ”
This legislation will not tell us everything we want or should know .
I can only assume the following based on fourteen years of research :
First of all , as a result of the International banker turned Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve chairman ’s actions to rescue AIG without Congressional or Presidential approval , those actions set LEGAL precedence for replacing and changing the Constitution .
Never before in the history of America has a president delegated total Presidential authority to a non-elected official .
Secondly , International banker Hank Paulson said Sunday morning in an interview with Tom Brokow regarding the complexity of the mortgage market and the securitization process by which mortgages are sold to investors , “ We have over - complexity .
Securitization is putting [ mortgages in ] tranches and selling them all over the world and that is the risk . ”
On another Sunday morning show , the host , Chris Wallace said of Paulson , “ [ He ] will accept some provision to let people to renegotiate mortgage to stay in home or other huge packages .
But there will be a Main Street renegotiation in this bill because we are scared of the consequences . ”
I believe there will be major changes in the mortgage market here in America .
It will be globalized and changed to the same kind of feudalistic structure that the Europeans and Commonwealth countries have .
According to my research , America ’s move to feudalism is in the process of being finalized .
The backbone of the middle class is home ownership which also includes the property under the building .
I believe that the new system will change America ’s entire mortgage structure to leasehold , a system used all over Europe whereby individuals will pay a monthly rent to the owner of the property that their house sits on .
There will be a total restructuring of property rights in America to fit our new third world status .
All of the rights of property ownership will be changed forever — gone with the wind .
If you do n’t have a mortgage you do not need to worry .
The need to pass massive legislation by Monday morning or by Friday afternoon the latest , is indicative of the high stakes of what will change and the assets that are about to transfer from the American taxpayer to the Federal Reserve .
Congress is being blackmailed .
The Treasury Blueprint lays this all out .
Thirdly , President Bush tried to recommend a flat tax in 2003 .
I wrote extensively on this back then .
The truth of the matter is that if you are going to have a global currency , you are also going to have a global tax .
America is the only country NOT to have a tax on services or a Value Added Tax - VAT .
The repercussions of this takeover of America is that our cities , states and federal government are broke .
One of the ways to “ bail us out ” is to create an “ Infrastructure Corps ” similar to the various programs Roosevelt created in the 1930s .
To pay for it , we will need a VAT tax .
Obama has already alluded to the “ Infrastructure Corps ” and he has talked about a capital gains tax on the sale of property .
Lastly , from Sunday ’s talk shows , it appears that New York City Mayor Richard Bloomberg will head up the newly proposed Resolution Trust Corporation .
We are being given major promises about how fair it will be .
However , if history is any indication , we will receive nothing and end up holding the bag for the worthless paper that supports the assets .
The bottom line is that you and I have always gotten the crumbs from the table , if congress does not approve what we are being told is the solution , we will not even have the crumbs .
We are no longer in America but AmeriKa .
It is time to hit our knees and repent for our own sins and ask God to save us .

BOSTON - Amherst town meeting member Terence J. Franklin supports a Nov. 4 ballot question that seeks to decriminalize possession of one ounce or less of marijuana , saying that use of the illegal drug is becoming more acceptable .
" It 's become more a part of society , " said Franklin , an auxiliary member of the Cannabis Reform Coalition at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst , last week .
" People are more familiar with it .
People are more at ease with it . "
But Agawam Police Chief Robert D. Campbell said that he and other chiefs in Hampden County are against the ballot question .
He said that marijuana is " a gateway drug , " causing many users to eventually turn to harder drugs such as cocaine .
Campbell said that teenagers currently fear arrest , and that use would increase if the drug was decriminalized .
" Teen drug use is down , " he said .
" Why would we want to send the opposite message ? "
A yes vote on Question 2 would decriminalize possesssion of up to one ounce of marijuana , and a no vote would keep the current laws .
Under Question 2 on the statewide ballot , the criminal penalties for possessing one ounce or less of marijuana would be replaced with a new system of civil penalties enforced with citations .
If the question is passed by a majority of voters , it would take effect on Dec. 4 , according to the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , which placed the question on the ballot .
Offenders ages 18 and above would forfeit their marijuana and would pay a civil penalty of $ 100 .
People less than 18 would be hit with the same $ 100 penalty and forfeiture if they complete a drug awareness program that includes 10 hours of community service and at least four hours of group discussion on preventing drug abuse .
The 11 district attorneys in Massachusetts , the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police , and the state sheriffs oppose the ballot question .
Hampden District Attorney William M. Bennett said the state has a sensible marijuana policy .
If a person is charged for the first time with possessing marijuana , he said , the charge is continued for six months without a finding and then dismissed if there are no other violations .
Bennett said there is no finding of guilt , and the record is then sealed .
He said the charge would not currently appear on an individual 's criminal offender record information .
" Why does anybody want to change a system that works in terms of possession of marijuana ? "
Bennett asked .
" The current law works well . "
Terrel W. Harris of the state Executive Office of Public Safety confirmed Bennett 's statement .
He said that a dismissed charge would not now appear on an individual 's criminal offender record information .
Only certain businesses - schools , camps , nursing homes , home - care providers , and youth volunteer organizations - may view dismissals and charges that ended with no convictions .
Potential employers sometimes access criminal offender record information to determine whether to hire someone .
Most employers may see only convictions or pending cases .
Bennett said that approval of the ballot question would give " a green light " to youths to use marijuana , and to drug dealers .
Supporters are optimistic that the question will be approved .
" I think it is going to win for multiple reasons , " said Whitney A. Taylor , the campaign manager for the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy .
According to her , voters in certain Senate and House districts in Massachusetts approved 30 non-binding ballot questions in 2000 - 06 that mirror the current statewide question on marijuana .
Voters in the 1st Hampshire District - Hatfield and Northampton - overwhelmingly approved the non-binding question on marijuana in 2004 , agreeing to make possession a civil infraction .
Voters in the 5th Worcester District , which includes part of Ware , Hardwick and all or parts of nine other communities , also overwhelmingly approved the non-binding ballot question in 2002 .
In Amherst in 2000 , voters approved a non-binding referendum by 1,659 to 981 to urge state and national office - holders to repeal the prohibition of marijuana .
Taylor , who has a bachelor 's degree in criminal justice and a master 's degree in public policy from American University in Washington , said that opponents are using " scare tactics and lies " in an attempt to defeat the ballot question .
She said that $ 30 million is spent each year on arresting and booking people for possessing marijuana .
" That money should stay in police coffers to fight violent and serious crime , " she said .
Eleven states , including Maine and New York , have decriminalized possession of one ounce or less of marijuana , she noted .
" It 's a smart , sensible law that has proven successful in 11 other states , " Taylor said .
Updated 7:20 p.m.| Senator Barack Obama has won North Carolina , according to a New York Times analysis .
Mr. Obama ’s slight lead of about .2 percentage points over Senator John McCain has expanded over the last several hours to .4 percent , prompting several news organizations to declare him the winner .
The total shows 49.9 percent for Mr. Obama to 49.5 percent for Mr. McCain .
Mr. Obama ’s win here caps an extraordinary campaign in the state , which has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1976 .
Early voting gave him a crucial edge when the final tallies were made .
In addition , the share of the black vote increased from 2004 .
Mr. Obama won early voters by 178,000 votes –and actually lost on Election Day by 165,000 votes , said Tom Jensen , a Democratic pollster based in Raleigh .
“ Early voting gave Obama a big advantage , ” Mr. Jensen said .
“ It made it much easier for the campaign to organize rides and get people to the polls over those 17 days of early voting .
Obama had a great ground game , but if you only have 13 hours to get everyone out , it ’s much harder . ”
The weather — rain across most of the state — also played a role , but not in the traditional way .
Bad weather usually holds down the Democratic vote because Democrats tend to be poorer and have more difficulty than Republicans getting to the polls .
But in this case , it benefited the Democrats because it also held down the Republican vote — and the Democrats had their early votes in the bank .
The state ’s 15 electoral votes bring Mr. Obama ’s total electoral votes to 364 , compared with 162 for Mr. McCain .
Twelve electoral votes remain to be counted , 11 from Missouri , which has yet to be called , and one from a Congressional District in Nebraska , which splits its electoral votes .
But the electoral votes are not the story in North Carolina .
The story is how the Obama organization turned the tide in this culturally conservative state and then drilled its voters to go to the polls early .
Across the board , Mr. Obama out - performed Senator John Kerry , who lost the state by 12 percentage points to President Bush in 2004 .
Both blacks and suburban voters came out in record numbers this time .
And he cut the Democratic losses in some of the state ’s most Republican counties .
Most of Mr. Obama ’s margin of victory came in the state ’s seven urban centers .
This year , 22 percent of the total electorate was black , according to Mr. Jensen ’s analysis , compared with 18.6 percent in 2004 ( the 2004 figure comes from the state elections board ; the exit polls that year were wrong ) .
Mr. Obama won about 35 percent of the white vote .
Given the numbers , Mr. Obama ’s total was about one - third black and two - thirds white .
In a highly unusual display of monolithic voting , virtually every black woman who voted did so for Mr. Obama , according to the exit polls .
Black women made up 14 percent of the vote , the exit polls said , and 100 percent of those surveyed said they voted for Mr. Obama .
Black men made up 9 percent of the vote , and 87 percent of them said they voted for Mr. Obama .
Among whites , Mr. McCain won them overall , but Mr. Obama did much better than Mr. Kerry .
Mr. Obama won 37 percent of white voters , compared with 27 percent for Mr. Kerry .
In addition , he improved on Mr. Kerry ’s margins among younger voters .
Exit polls show that 74 percent of those between 18 and 29 voted for Mr. Obama , while Mr. Kerry drew 56 percent .
Ferrel Guillory , an expert on Southern politics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , said that the influx of new voters was also an important component of Mr. Obama ’s coalition in North Carolina , as it was in Virginia and Florida .
“ These states are the most robust in terms of population growth and economic diversification , ” he said .
The new population gives Democrats a larger pool of “ persuadable ” voters that Mr. Obama tapped into , he said .
“ It ’s not that Obama converted the sluggish states in the South , ” Mr. Guillory said .
“ It was the growing states , the more robust states , that gave him the opportunity .
It ’s important to have a president who understands the unfinished business of the south , but who also sees the opportunity . ”
Colony Capital , the company that bailed out Michael Jackson by buying his mortgage on Neverland Ranch , has increased its ownership of the King of Pop 's abode .
It 's now jointly owned by both Jacko and Colony Capital and will change its name to the Sycamore Valley Ranch .
TMZ : According to official documents , the title to Neverland was transferred Monday to a company called Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC .
Now here 's where the plot thickens .
Sycamore is a joint venture between Michael Jackson and a division of a company called Colony Capital .
Colony Capital owns the Las Vegas Hilton , the Red Rock Country Club , and other Las Vegas properties ...
The man behind Colony Capital , Thomas Barrack , Jr. is a Vegas mover and shaker , and there 's a buzz in Vegas that Jackson could end up performing at the Hilton and living in the Red Rock Country Club .
In fact , we reported this earlier in the year .
So now , Neverland is owned by both Jackson and Barrack 's company .
Will Jacko perform at Barrack 's hotel ?
Stay tuned .
BTW , we were told the property will NOT BE CALLED NEVERLAND ANYMORE .
It will be renamed the Sycamore Valley Ranch , in an attempt to erase those pesky child molestation rumors , even though Jackson was criminally acquitted .
Green Cement is Carbon Neutral , Sequesters CO2 from Power Plants
September 2nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
New ideas for reducing CO2 seem to be popping up all the time .
The latest scheme for getting rid of the greenhouse gas comes from Stanford Professor Brent Constanz .
The Geological and Environmental Sciences Professor has invented a new type of cement that is carbon neutral — a huge innovation for a material whose production process normally spews vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere .
Not only is Constanz ’s cement carbon neutral , but it also sequesters CO2 emitted from power plants .
The details of the cement process are secret until it is patented , but Constanz reveals that it does eliminate the need to heat limestone , a major source of CO2 emissions .
In Constanz ’s vision , the green cement factories are built next to power plants , and exhaust gas released from the power plants is bubbled through seawater .
The resulting chemical process creates an important ingredient for the cement .
It also sequesters a half ton of CO2 from the smokestacks for every ton of cement produced .
And the green cement will even be cost - effective — $ 100 a ton versus $ 110 for standard Portland cement .
If green cement goes mainstream , it will drastically reduce CO2 levels , as the cement manufacturing process currently produces 5 percent of the world ’s CO2 emissions .
The faster green cement replaces regular cement , the better for our planet ’s health .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Wayne Lusvardi , semi- professional idiot October 25 , 2008
From blogger Wayne Lusvardi , also known as “ The Pasadena Pundit , ” comes a real gem of an article : No on Prop 8 is Anti-Feminist .
Wayne , as you ’ll immediately see , is both a champion of feminism and a brilliant scholar :
The word ‘ marriage ’ comes from the Latin word ‘ mater ’ for mother .
Great point !
Except …. it does n’t .
It comes from Old French ( marier , “ to marry ” ) .
He ’s thinking of “ matrimony . ”
And ‘ mater ’ is what matters in marriage .
Marriage is unavoidably built around female sexuality and procreation .
Marriage can only concern a relationship to a woman for procreation .
It is the opposite of concubinage , which is an involuntary relationship with a man of higher status in a traditional society .
All right , first , can we get T - shirts that say “ MATER IS WHAT MATTERS ” ?
Second , let ’s take a moment to marvel at the egregious , oblivious sexism in this paragraph .
“ Marriage is unavoidably built around female sexuality ” ?
Wayne , that ’s not true , but if it were , you could try not to sound quite so bummed about it .
Check out that third sentence , too , which quietly assumes that heterosexual marriage is exclusively the domain of — guess who ! — men ( who , in their enlightened feminist benevolence , generally opt nowadays to possess us one at a time rather than keeping entire harems ) .
A social order that does n’t protect a woman from rape or incest or concubinage can’t give women freedom to control who the father (s ) of their children are , or their own bodies , or even their own health .
Marriage is the structure of this freedom of choice for women in a modern society .
Women ’s freedom to control access to their body for procreation is what modern marriage is all about .
Without that there is no societal or religious basis for laws to protect marriage , particularly gay marriage .
Are n’t you glad Wayne is such an ardent supporter of women ’s rights to control their own health and their own bodies ?
I think we can safely assume that he’s on the front lines of the fight to keep abortion and contraception legal and available , to offer comprehensive sex education in all our public schools , to protect rape victims and toughen laws against rapists , and to provide universal health care to all Americans …….oh .
He thinks a husband is all we need ?
Well , I guess he should know , being a man and all .
Defining marriage down to a mere contract between companions or non-procreative sex partners will only end up harming all women for if everyone can marry , no one needs to and it becomes meaningless .
Yeah , yeah , the magical hedge of protection .
We already know .
Move on .
Women will ultimately suffer most .
Gay marriage robs something that belongs exclusively to women .
Fallopian tubes ?
Kotex ?
Supermarket Sweep ?
I give up .
Traditional man-woman marriage is not anti-gay , it is pro-feminine .
Same sex marriage is anti-feminist .
Let ’s review .
THINGS THAT ARE FEMINIST :
All straight marriages , including those that involve spousal abuse and domestic violence ; the use of “ feminine ” as a synonym for “ feminist ” ; men who tell women what ’s feminist and what is n’t .
THINGS THAT ARE ANTI - FEMINIST : Lesbians .
Any questions ?
Kicking back in a comfy brown armchair and sipping from a grande soya latte at the back of a Richmond coffee shop , Steve Roest does n’t look much like a pirate .
Most people in the area simply know him as the Green Party ’s parliamentary candidate for Twickenham .
The only give away as to his piratical alter - ego is a logo on the upper left hand side of his black t- shirt which features a toothy skull crossed with a trident and a shepherd ’s staff .
But unlike Somalian cutthroats who are currently causing chaos in the Gulf of Aden in their search for western hostages and oil tankers , Mr Roest quarry is rather different .
He is after Japan ’s internationally despised whaling fleet .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This week the 42 - year - old property developer will fly towards Australia to join a controversial band of eco-activists who for the past five years have played an often dangerous game of cat and mouse in the frozen waters of the Antarctic where Japan heads each summer to hunt for whales despite international condemnation .
The battle is always a David versus Goliath affair .
On one side is Japan ’s vast whaling fleet lead by the Nisshin Maru – an 8,000ton “ research vessel ” where hundreds of harpooned minke and fin whales will be butchered , packaged and frozen during the three month hunt .
On the other side is the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , an anti-whaling fleet comprised of just a single ship : a converted 885 - ton fishing vessel called the MV Steve Irwin .
If previous years are anything to go by things will get dirty .
The 32 crewmembers , which include three British citizens this year , will stop at nothing to ensure that the Japanese harpooners miss their targets .
In the past activists have thrown rotten butter bombs to contaminate the decks where the whales are cut up , deployed steel cables to foul the ship propellers and have even resorted to ramming vessels using a 7 - foot hydraulic steel “ can opener ” .
The Japanese have responded with flash grenades , the odd live round and accusations that the activists of Sea Shepherd are “ eco-terrorists ” .
“ The suggestion that we are eco-terrorists is ridiculous but I have no problem with the term pirates , ” says Mr Roest .
“ We like to call ourselves pirates of compassion .
Either that or sea cops , legally operating under the United Nations ’ World Charter for Nature . ”
The next three months will be a major test for anyone onboard the Steve Irwin , which was renamed in honour of the late Australian television presenter who was intending to join one of Sea Shepherd missions before he died .
On 1 December the vessel will leave Brisbane harbour and motor towards the Southern Ocean to try and intercept the Japaense fleet .
“ It ’s a small boat and there will be a lot of us crammed together in very difficult and icy conditions , ” says Mr Roest , seemingly unperturbed by the prospect of three months in the Southern Ocean where the water temperature rarely gets above - 5C .
“ We ’ll also be up against boats that are much bigger and more numerous than our own but I ca n’t wait to get there . ”
Founded by Canadian national Paul Watson in 1977 , Sea Shepherd have long been regarded as one of the more radical conservation groups working to combat ethically dubious and often illegal fishing practices in the world ’s oceans .
Watson was one of dozens of activists who helped found Greenpeace in the early 1970s but was later thrown out for breaking the group ’s non-violent ethos during a protest against seal hunters and spent much of the past three decades adrift from the mainstream environmental movement .
But his recent operations against Japan ’s whaling fleet over the past five years have earned the group renewed and increasing praise .
For the past three years the Japanese whalers have been forced to return to harbour with less than half their expected catch .
Although commercial whaling was halted in 1986 Japan is permitted to conduct whaling in the name of scientific research but critics say their hunt is just a front for commercial whaling .
“ Since 1986 the Japanese have not released a single peer - reviewed piece of research that has come through its lethal whaling operations , ” says Mr Roest .
“ What the Japanese are really up to is thinly disguised commercial whaling . ”
This season the Japanese hope to catch 900 minke and 50 fin whales but Sea Shepherd hope to disrupt their operations so badly that they will be forced to return empty handed .
This year , however , Sea Shepherd will be on their own .
Greenpeace , which still has a frosty relationship with its more radical incarnation , usually sends the Esperanza , a ship that documents whaling activities but refrains from the sort of tactics employed by Watson .
But this week the environmental group announced it was instead concentrating on campaigning for two Japanese activists who face jail next year for jail intercepting whale meat stolen by crew from the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru in a trial which Amnesty International says is politically motivated .
Speaking to the Independent yesterday from the deck of the Steve Irwin , Watson was characteristically critical of the movement he once helped found .
“ Obviously the more boats targeting the Japanese the better but Greenpeace have never really been that helpful to us anyway , ” he said .
“ They ’ve never shared co-ordinates of the Japanese fleet with us .
With or without their help we will do everything we can to stop the whalers killing whales . ”
As for Mr Roest , a qualified dive instructor who will be driving one of the fast inflatable boats used to harangue the Japanese fleet when their spotted , he believes direct action is the only way to stop this year ’s whale kill .
“ The more you get involved in the environmental movement the more you understand just how large the problem is , ” he said .
“ The fact is that in thirty years no - one has been harmed on either side by Sea Shepherd .
Everything you do has an element of risk , even crossing the road has its risks , but if you ’re ensconced on an 8,000 ton vessel the risk is very small .
But nothing compares to the risk we face of losing these beautiful sea creatures that are on the brink of extinction . ”
The near - term outlook for global stock markets is for continued volatility , with little chance of sustained progress until we see an end to corporate earnings downgrades and an improvement in economic leading indicators .
In this note we comment on the problems facing emerging markets , and some broad thoughts on why capitalism remains a reasonable starting point for economic systems .
What is our market outlook ?
The threat of a global financial meltdown has diminished thanks to massive central bank and government intervention , which has addressed the liquidity and solvency issues of many US and European banks .
However , corporate earnings estimates for 2009 still look too optimistic in light of the poor economic leading indicators that we are seeing , such as consumer and business confidence levels .
Therefore , sandwiched between the possibilityof an immediate short - term relief rally and a positive long - term view that equities are currently cheap , we have a near - term view that markets will remain volatile and are likely to trade sideways while the US , Europe and Japan endure a recession .
Emerging markets : the real threat would be a rise in global protectionism .
If the worst is over regarding the US and European banking crisis , it certainly is not for some emerging markets .
Hungary finds itselfwith a massively over borrowed consumer sector , with foreign currencyborrowings in Swiss francs and Japanese yen .
As these safe havencurrencies appreciate , the risk of widespread default on mortgages and other bank loans increases .
The Ukraine economy is coming down with a bump as foreign lenders are put off by 25 % inflation .
Other emerging markets are suffering from a mix of problems that can include an overvalued currency , excess consumer borrowing ( in local and sometimes foreign currencies ) , falling prices for commodity exports , domestic politics and a drop in demand for exports as the G7 enters recession .
Read
With little sign of a pick up in investor risk appetite , the near - term outlook is for continued underperformance for emerging market equities .
But as investors pull money out of the asset class , P/E valuations are falling fast and some currencies are now appearing undervalued on a purchasing parity basis .
Also , the long - term case for emerging markets remains in place : stronger productivity and GDP growth relative to the G7 economies , resulting in better long - term prospects for corporate earnings growth and share price appreciation .
The only thing that will stop this , long term , is a retreat from globalisation by the G7 and / or the emerging markets themselves .
Exports will slow down , competition in home markets will weaken as emerging markets raise tariffs on imports in a tit - for - tat measure , leading to weak productivity growth and lower GDP growth .
Fortunately the G7 does not appear likely to repeat the mistakesof the 1930s , when the US responded to the great depression by running a balanced budget , maintaining high real interest rates and imposing import tariffs .
Indeed , it is interesting to note thatthe election speeches of both US presidential candidates have less protectionist rhetoric in them today than they did at the start of the year .
Capitalism remains the best method we have forallocating resources , just ask AynRand .
Few would wish to defend a completely unregulated dog - eat - dog version of capitalism , since this form usually destroys itself assuccessful companies become monopolies .
But within a regulatedenvironment , with the accent on maintaining competition rather thansafeguarding producer interests , capitalism - through trade - hassucceeded in delivering the fastest increase in living standardsover the last 50 years for more people than we have known in history .
The key is in its ability to find the right price for a given resource , whether labour , raw materials , money or time .
For the price to be an effective signal to producers and suppliers ofgoods , it must be ‘ real ’ .
By ‘ real ’
I mean a price that results fromcompeting suppliers and buyers in that market .
If prices are instead influenced by government interference , over or under supply willresult , leading to wasted resources .
Many governments have triedto ignore market prices , with taxpayers having to foot the bill forthe resulting subsidies and everyone suffering from the low productivitygrowth that occurs when government involvement in a sector prevents competition amongst suppliers .
Indeed , the northern European countries that we perhaps most often think of assuccessful socialist countries are arguably prosperous because thestate by and large stays out of business and instead focuses onwelfare benefits .
For anyone who has become disillusioned on this point , and do not wish to wade through economics text books , I recommend as a tonic for your Christmas wish list the classic American novel byAynRand , ‘ Atlas Shrugged ’ .
A word on dividends .
A reduction in corporate earnings may lead to a reduction individends , however history shows that the link is weaker than one might have thought .
Dividends tend to fall much less than headline earnings , as companies like to have stable dividend policies where possible to encourage income investors .
If necessary , companiesmay continue to pay dividends with very little cover if they believe they have strong enough balance sheets to afford such a policy .
Banks and other financials that have recently taken government funds to recapitalise may see the sharpest dividend cuts as acondition of taking taxpayers money .
Therefore the best performing income funds over the next year or so may be those that are widelydiversified by sector , invested in companies with strong free cashflow and with low exposure to financial stocks that may be underboth balance sheet and political pressure to slash their dividends .
LOS ANGELES , Oct. 17 ( UPI ) -- Federal authorities in Los Angeles say they have charged a New Jersey teenager in a January cyberattack that crashed Church of Scientology Web sites .
Dmitriy Guzner , 18 , Verona , N.J. , was charged Friday and had already agreed to plead guilty in connection with the distributed denial of service attack that swamped the Scientology sites , the U.S. Attorney 's office in Los Angeles said in a written statement .

Prosecutors said Guzner had considered himself to be part of " Anonymous , " an underground group that has led recent protests against Scientology .
Guzner was tracked down by a federal cybercrimes task force and is expected to formally plead guilty in a New Jersey federal court in the coming weeks .
He could be sentenced to 10 years in prison .
“ Whether it ’s lending or spending , it ’s tax dollars that are going out the window and we end up holding collateral we do n’t know anything about ... "
“ The time has come that we consider what sort of limitations we should be placing on the Fed so that authority returns to elected officials as opposed to appointed ones . ”
" The U.S. government is prepared to lend more than $ 7.4 trillion on behalf of American taxpayers , or half the value of everything produced in the nation last year , to rescue the financial system since the credit markets seized up 15 months ago . "
" The unprecedentedpledge of funds includes $ 2.8 trillion already tapped by financial institutions in the biggest response to an economic emergency since the New Deal of the 1930s , according to data compiled by Bloomberg . "
This is how taxpayers and future generations ( OUR CHILDREN ) become financial slaves to this country 's financial debt and reckless spending habits .
Americans are being financially raped and this is not by mistake - prepare for this country to hit rock bottom .

Dr. Michael Thomas approached me with an interesting A.I. job to see if we could speed up his neural network code from a 10 year old research platform called PlaNet .
Using new Sun boxes they were n’t getting the speed - ups they expected , old libs or other monkey business were suspected .
As a first investigation I took Neil Schemenauer ’s bpnn.py ( a 200 line back - prop artificial neural network library with doc and comparison ) .
The intention was to see how much faster the code might run using psyco and shedskin .
The results were really quite surprising , notes and src follow .
Addition – Leonardo Maffi has written a companion piece showing that his ShedSkin output is 1.5 to 7 * slower than hand - coded C .
He also shows solutions using the D language and runtimes for Python 2.6 ( I use Python 2.5 below ) .
He notes :
“ I have translated the Python code to D ( using my D libraries ) in just few minutes , something like 15 - 20 minutes , and the translation was mostly painless and sometimes almost mechanical .
I have translated the D code to C in many hours .
Translating Python =>
C may require something like 20 - 30 times the time you need to translate Python => D + my libs .
And this despite I have used a rigorous enough method to perform the translation , and despite at the end I am not sure the C code is bug - free .
This is an enormous difference . ”
End addition .
Addition – Robert Bradshaw has created a Cython version with src , see comments .
End addition .
The run -time in minutes for the my harder test case are below .
Note that these are averages of 4 runs each :
Vanilla Python 153 minutes Python + Psyco 1.6.0.final.0 57 minutes ( 2.6 * faster ) Shedskin 0.0.29 0.78 minutes [ 47 seconds ] ( 196 * faster )
The test machines uses Python 2.5.2 on Ubuntu 8.04 .
The box is an Intel Core Duo 2.4GHz running a single process .
The ‘ hard ’ problem trains the ANN using 508 patterns with 57 input neurons , 50 hidden and 62 output neurons over 1000 iterations .
If you know ANNs then the configuration ( 0.1 learning rate , 0 momentum ) might seem unusual , be assured that this is correct for my researcher ’s problem .
There is a shorter version of this problem using just 2 patterns , this is useful if you want to replicate these results but do n’t want to wait 3 hours on your first run .
My run times for the shorter problem are ( again averaged using 4 runs ) :
Vanilla Python 42 seconds Python + Psyco 14 seconds Shedskin 0.2 seconds ( 210 * faster )
Shedskin has an issue with numerical stability – it seems that internally some truncation occurs with floating point math .
Whilst the results for vanilla Python and Python + Psyco were identical , the results with Shedskin were similar but with fractional divergences in each result .
Whilst these divergences caused some very different results in the final weights for the ANN , my researcher confirms that all the results look equivalent .
Mark Dufour ( Shedskin ’s author ) confirms that Python ’s C double is used the same in Shedskin but notes that rounding ( or a bug ) may be the culprit .
Shedskin is a young project , Mark will welcome extra eyes if you want to look into this .
Running the code with Shedskin was fairly easy .
On Ubuntu I had to install libgc - dev and libpcre3 - dev ( detailed in the Shedskin docs ) and g++ , afterwards shedskin was ready .
From download to first run was 15 minutes .
On my first attempt to compile bpnn.py with Shedskin I received an error as the ‘ raise ’ keyword is n’t yet supported .
I replaced the ‘ raise ’ calls with ‘ assert False ’ for sanity , afterwards compilation was fine .
Edit – Mark notes that the basic form of ‘ raise ’ is supported but the version used in bpnn.py is n’t yet supported .
Something like ‘ raise ValueError ( ‘ some msg’ ) ’ works fine .
Mark notes that Shedskin currently works well up to 500 lines ( maybe up to 1000 ) , since bpnn.py is only 200 lines compilation is quick .
Note that if you ca n’t use Psyco because you are n’t on x86 , Shedskin might be useful to you since it ’ll work anywhere that Python and g++ compile .
Running this yourself
If you want to recreate my results , download bpnn_shedskin_src_20081117.zip .
You ’ll see bpnn_shedskin.py , this is the main code .
bpnn_shedskin.py includes either ‘ examples_short.py ’ or ‘ examples_full.py ’ , short is the easier 2 pattern problem and full has 508 patterns .
Note that these patterns are stored as lists of tuples ( Shedskin does n’t support the csv module so I hardcoded the input patterns to speed development ) , the full version is over 500 lines of Python and this slows Shedskin ’s compilation somewhat .
By default the imports for Psyco are commented out and the short problem is configured .
At the command line you ’ll get an output like this :
python bpnn_shedskin.py
Using 2 examples ANN uses 57 input , 50 hidden , 62 output , 1000 iterations , 0.100000 learning rate , 0.000000 momentum error 65.454309 2008-11-17 15:22:58.318593 error 45.176110 2008-11-17 15:22:59.060787 error 44.616933 2008-11-17 15:23:00.246280 error 44.026883 2008-11-17 15:23:01.743821 error 44.049276 2008-11-17 15:23:02.815876 error 44.905183 2008-11-17 15:23:03.860352 error 44.674506 2008-11-17 15:23:05.270307 error 43.365627 2008-11-17 15:23:06.757126 error 43.299160 2008-11-17 15:23:08.244466 error 42.540076 2008-11-17 15:23:09.732035 Elapsed : 0:00:41.472192
If you uncomment the two Psyco lines your code will run about 2.6 * faster .
Using Shedskin
To use shedskin , first run the Python through shedskin and then ‘ make ’ the result .
The compiled binary will run much faster than the vanilla Python code , the result below shows the short problem taking 0.19 seconds compared to 41 seconds above .

Why is the math different ?
An open question remains as to why the evolution of the floating point arithmetic is different between Python and Shedskin .
If anyone is interested in delving in to this , I ’d be very interested in hearing from you .
Extension modules
Mark notes that the extension module support is perhaps a more useful way to use Shedskin for this sort of problem .
A single module can be compiled ( e.g. ‘ shedskin - e module. py ’ ) and with Python you just import it ( e.g. ‘ import module ’ ) and use it …with a big speed - up .
This ties the code to your installed libs – not so great for easy distribution but great for lone researchers needing a speed boost .
Shedskin 0.1 in the works
Mark ’s plan is to get 0.1 released over the coming months .
One aim is to get the extension module to a similar level of functionality as SWIG and improve the core library support so that Shedskin comes with ( some more ) Batteries Included .
Mark is open to receiving code ( up to 1000 lines ) that does n’t compile .
The project would always happily accept new contributors .

Being a Friendly Heretic
In 1980 I sat in front of the TV to watch a popular talk show of the time , ' The Don Lane Show ' .
On this particular night one of Don 's guests was a visiting skeptic from America , one James Randi .
I had never heard of James Randi and to me he was just another guest .
I 'm sure most of you will now know of this famous interview , it 's repeated every year here in Australia and has become a great moment in Australian television history .
Don Lane become so angry at James Randi ( as Randi dared to suggest that people like Doris Stokes and Uri Geller may not be really using ' psychic ' powers ) that he swept Randi 's props off the table and said , " … and you can piss off ! " and stormed off the set .
I , like most viewers , sided with Don Lane .
How could this little magician come on national TV and say those terrible things ?
I really thought at the time that ghosts , psychics , monsters , UFOs and such like were all real .
Now almost 30 years later I find myself being the TV Skeptic having appeared on The One .
The Search for Australia 's most Gifted Psychic .
This was one of the top rating shows of 2008 here in Australia and as a result I have become somewhat recognised .
The production of the show covered about 6 weeks both in the studio and on various locations .
It was hard work and at times stressful as any TV show is .
However , one of the reasons the producers asked me to participate is that I come across on TV as being a polite and reasonable man .
They did not want some jerk shouting down the ' psychics ' on the show .
So during the production I tried to be friendly , open minded , funny and smiling .
On more than one occasion the giggles got the better of me on set .
I got on very well with my co-judge Stacey , made origami for the kids of some of the contestants and had a great time at the party with the entire cast when the last episode went to air .
Although I do not think anyone involved with the show had magical powers , I still can act like a civilised man to people I work with .
I have since discovered that all this is as nothing to the believer .
" How could you be so mean ? " one woman said to me in the street .
" Why did you kick my favourite psychic off the show when he was the real one ?
You were heartless ! "
Oh dear .
I tried to explain to her that I was in fact nice and friendly on the show but simply did not agree our contestants had magical powers .
" You destroy people with your negativity . "
Oh dear again .
This is more or less typical of the reactions I get from time to time .
Sometimes I am able to talk to the person and assure them I am not a monster hell bent on burning ' psychics ' at the stake and sometimes I can not get through to them at all .
I take all this in my stride and I know from long experience that being a skeptic , a heretic to some , is at times extremely unpopular .
The worst moment for me was when a school student of about 14 ( the same age I was in 1980 watching Don Lane and James Randi ) called me a ' meanie ' .
To her I was the man on TV saying horrible things .
Now , if I had played the part of a heartless bastard then these comments and opinions would be justified .
But as anyone can see ( The One can be viewed on youtube ) I was never mean , never rude but simply put my case and played along with my role on the show .
Despite this , to the believer I came across as being rude , arrogant , conceited , foolish , ignorant and evil .
There is a time for us skeptics to shoot from the hip and not to mess about with being polite .
A national TV show made for entertainment is not one of those times .
But try as we might , to many viewers we can only ever come across as negative or downright evil .
It 's not a failing on our part , we just have to learn to deal with it .
Maybe next time I 'll just wear some horns ….

Once again this year , opponents of women ’s reproductive rights have managed to get initiatives aimed at ending or limiting abortion rights on ballots  in South Dakota , Colorado and California .
These measures , which violate women ’s privacy and threaten their health , have implications far beyond those states .
If voters approve them , they will become a weapon in the right - wing campaign to overturn Roe v Wade .
The South Dakota initiative is a near twin of the sweeping abortion ban handily rejected by South Dakota voters just two years ago .
To make the ban seem less harsh , its backers have included language purporting to make exceptions for incest , rape or the life and health of the mother .
But no one should be fooled .
The exceptions were drafted to make it nearly impossible to get an abortion , even during the first trimester of pregnancy .
The measure is clearly unconstitutional under existing Supreme Court rulings , and that ’s just the point .
The underlying agenda is to provide a vehicle for challenging Roe v. Wade , the 1973 decision that legalized abortion .
The Colorado ballot proposal attacks Roe v. Wade by a different route .
Known as Amendment 48 , this preposterous measure would redefine the term “ person ” in the state ’s Constitution to include fertilized human eggs  in effect bestowing on fertilized eggs , prior to implantation in the womb and pregnancy , the same legal rights and protections that apply to people once they are born .
Editor 's note : Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .
Begala is not a paid political consultant for any politicians or candidates .
His new book is " Third Term : Why George W. Bush Loves John McCain . "
Paul Begala says he 's played a behind - the - scenes role in most of the presidential debates of the past 20 years .
( CNN ) -- I have been involved in most of the presidential and vice presidential debates over the past 20 years .
I 've done debate prep , been a spin doctor , convened the greatest comedy writers in Hollywood in a one - liner factory , even played George W. Bush for Al Gore 's practice debates .
So now that I 'm merely observing the debates as a CNN political analyst , I thought I 'd offer our readers and the candidates my Top 10 rules for debates :
1. Debates are easy .
It 's a dirty little secret , but for all the hype , debates are easier than news conferences , town - hall meetings or in - depth , one - on - one interviews on Sunday morning television .
You hit your mark , you deliver your lines , you try not to pass out or throw up , then you declare victory .
So relax , candidates , you might even have fun .
2. 20 questions , 20 answers , one message .
This is not " Jeopardy , " where you 're at the mercy of the topics Alex Trebek ( or in this case , Jim Lehrer , Gwen Ifill , Tom Brokaw and Charlie Gibson ) select .
There is really only one question in an election :
Why should we vote for you and not the other candidate ?
Your answer to that question -- your basic message -- should be marbled throughout your substantive answer on everything from Waziristan to Social Security .
iReport.com : What would you ask Palin , Biden ?
John McCain 's basic message , it seems to me , is , " I 'm experienced , Obama 's too risky . "
Barack Obama's , on other hand , is , " I 'm for change , McCain is more of the same . "
Each answer to each question should be a variation on that theme .
A good debater introduces or ends lots of answers with " That 's another example of why we need change ... ( or experience , or whatever it is he or she is running on ) ... "
3. Familiarity matters .
The best debate preps are like SAT courses ; they focus on test familiarity more than substantive details .
Familiarity brings comfort .
Comfort breeds confidence .
Confidence delivers victory .
In 1992 , we Clintonites were so eager to make our man comfortable in the town - hall debate in Richmond , Virginia , that we brought the stools we 'd used for debate prep to the debate site .
Then someone -- and I 'm not ratting anyone out here -- replaced the " official " stools at the debate site with the ones we'd been practicing with .
We wanted Gov. Bill Clinton to be completely at ease in his surroundings , right down to his butt .
4 . Do n't cram .
If your debate prep is dominated by propeller - heads , you 're in trouble .
I love the nerds , Lord knows , but they can overwhelm you .
In 1984 , the brilliant Richard Darman overloaded Ronald Reagan with minutiae , perhaps in an effort to dispel rumors that the Gipper had lost a step .
The strategy blew up in the Reagan campaign 's face .
In his first debate with Walter Mondale , Reagan stumbled and stammered .
There was too much new information clanging around in his brain .
But by the second debate , he blew away concerns about his age .
He did this not with a rapid - fire recitation of statistics , but with a classic Reagan quip : " I will not use my opponent 's youth and inexperience as an issue in this campaign . "
Which leads me to my next rule :
5 . Wit is sticky .
John Kerry bested George W. Bush in all of their debates , according to the polls .
And yet voters were left without any take - home point .
That 's because Kerry not only lacked a clear , coherent message ( see No. 1 above ) , he did n't use humor .
In fact , I was told that one of his aides later bragged that Kerry had refused to use any of the " cute lines " my Hollywood writers had sent his way -- as if being witty were beneath him .
The most memorable lines are often the funniest .
Think of jug - eared Ross Perot crowing , " If you have a better plan ... I 'm all ears . "
Or former POW McCain saying of a plan to build a museum at the site of the Woodstock concert , " I 'm sure it was a cultural and pharmacological event .
But I could not attend .
I was tied up at the time . "
Chris Rock recently told Larry King that people only laugh at a line if they see some truth in it .
Smart candidates ought to heed Rock 's observation .
6 . The camera is always on .
So , by the way , is the microphone .
Al Gore had been promised that there would be no reaction shots in his first debate with George W. Bush .
That , of course , was wrong .
So , while Gore trounced Bush on the issues , the post - debate cut - and - paste jobs caught Gore sighing repeatedly and rolling his eyes endlessly .
Gore was in fact frustrated , perhaps understandably so .
But never let 'em see you sweat -- or sigh .
No matter what they tell you , the camera ( and the microphone ) is always on .
One of the most important skills for a debater is knowing what to do when the other candidate is attacking you .
Poor Dan Quayle had his famous deer - in - the - headlights moment when Lloyd Bentsen skewered him ( " Senator , you 're no Jack Kennedy . " )
But Obama was better coached .
Every time McCain launched a broadside , Obama would shake his head slowly , paint a half - smile on his face , look down and jot a note .
It does n't matter what he was writing .
It could have been gift ideas for his daughter 's birthday .
But he did not glare angrily or stare blankly .
7. Create a moment .
The voters who will decide the election are unlikely to be watching the debate in its entirety .
Instead , they will see brief clips repeated frequently .
The job of a debater is to force his or her way into one of those clips by creating a moment .
The easiest way to do this is by a direct address : " John , you said we would be greeted as liberators .
You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were .
You were wrong . "
They say actors have a hard time knowing what to do with their hands .
For debaters , the challenge is what to do with their eyes .
The best debaters -- Reagan , Clinton -- spent much of their time creating moments by either fixing their eyes on their opponent when launching a barb or looking directly into the camera .
In the first debate , McCain rarely if ever engaged either Obama or the audience with his eyes , preferring instead to direct all his remarks to moderator Jim Lehrer .
You can bet his team will correct that mistake by the second debate .
8 . Do n't be a lawyer .
I am burdened with a legal education , as are Sens. Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
Civilians think lawyers are good debaters .
Wrong .
They 're often effective advocates , but the structure of a legal argument is often this : facts , reasoning , supporting evidence , conclusion .
A political debater must start with the conclusion , then follow up with reasoning and facts and analysis .
Compare McCain 's strong performance at Pastor Rick Warren 's Saddleback Civil Form with Obama 's thoughtful , but meandering , answers .
It was McCain 's best moment of the campaign thus far .
But by the time the first debate rolled around , Obama had in part stifled his inner law professor .
Still , his habit of conceding a small point to make a larger one , ( " Senator McCain is right when he says we need earmark reform , but ... " ) while effective in a classroom or a courtroom , was taken out of context and caricatured as weakness .
Look for Obama to start more sentences with " Senator McCain is wrong , and here 's why ... " or " Senator McCain just does n't get it , because ... "
9 . Small people make small points .
Both Obama and McCain got lost in the weeds in the first debate over whether Henry Kissinger supports presidential negotiations with Iran .
With all due respect to Dr. Kissinger , who the heck cares ?
McCain should have gone to his larger message : " This is just another example of how dangerous and risky Senator Obama 's lack of experience is . "
And Obama should have gone to his : " The failed , old status quo of Bush and McCain has only strengthened Iran .
I want a tougher , smarter , new approach . "
When Bob Dole was hammering Bill Clinton on what Clinton thought were cheap attacks in their 1996 debate in San Diego , California , Clinton went big , winning the debate not by responding , but by going to his larger message .
" I could respond in kind , " he lectured Dole , " but a political attack never created a single job , a negative ad never educated a child , a cheap shot never comforted a senior citizen or cleaned up a toxic waste site ... "
Clinton went big and he won big .
10 . Debates are more often lost than won .
When Gerald Ford told Jimmy Carter that Eastern Europe was not under Soviet domination in 1976 , it might have cost him the election .
Candidates can be certain that any mistake will be played -- and overplayed -- in the media .
How do you avoid gaffes ?
Well , by observing points 1 through 9 above .
But even more than that , I believe self - confidence is the best defense mechanism .
I coach Little League .
The best way to ensure that a kid strikes out is to tell him as he walks up to the plate , " Do n't strike out , Charlie .
Whatever you do , do n't strike out . "
Politicians are a lot like Little Leaguers ( although I do n't think I 'd trust them with aluminum bats ) .
They crave confidence .
And the more confident they are , the better they 're likely to do .
Before every debate , the last thing I 'd whisper in Bill Clinton 's ear before he walked on stage was , " Trust your instincts .
They 're the best I 've ever seen .
If something pops into your head , say it . "
Of course , it helps if your candidate truly is the best you 've ever seen -- as Clinton was .

All baking has huge costs you can't escape : fuel to heat the oven , all the time you dedicate , and ingredients that are n't so affordable any more .
So I delved into my address book and spoke to some of the great talents out there to see what they advise , and the response was huge ; especially from those baker / writers in the US who for years have encouraged people to tackle challenging recipes rather than hide from any complexity and just passively consume .
So here are their top baking tips from around the world just for you .
United States
1 . From the US I turned to Shirley O Corriher , the scientist turned kitchen sleuth I most admire , and her new book Bakewise is honestly the only one I 've waited patiently for .
For Corriher , getting cakes and cookies to last that bit longer helps when you have to stretch the budget , and she told me how science helps .
" Just substitute an equal measure of vegetable oil for a third of the butter in your cake or muffin recipe and this helps to keep them moist .
The reason : oil greases the flour proteins better than butter and prevents gluten forming , so leaving more water in the batter . "
Brilliant , and it saves money on butter too .
2 . It 's cool to be accurate .
Though baking appears all bish - bash - bosh , the key to achieving those extraordinary loaves is all in the detail .
Jim Lahey , the king of New York bakers at the Sullivan Street Bakery , says : " Measure precisely .
This will avoid unnecessary mistakes and bad food .
Do n't open your oven door while you 're goods are cooking .
If you have leftover ends of bread , try to convert them into another dish .
In these new lean times it 's better that we waste nothing . "
3. Rose Levy Beranbaum at realbakingwithrose.com , the top baking author in the US with The Cake Bible and blog advice pioneer suggested making life easier for others is the kindest thing to offer .
" When you give home baked cakes include the baking tin and recipe .
Ideally , cakes should be long - keeping ones , especially ones with a liqueur or lemon syrup .
Cool the cake completely .
Wash and dry the pan in which it was baked and coat the interior lightly with sunflower oil or non -stick spray .
Return the cake to the pan , wrap it tightly with clear plastic film then finally cover it with beautiful gift paper . "
4 . The über chic Dorie Greenspan , author of Baking : From My Home to Yours goes for boldness at Christmas .
" Bake big , it saves both time and money .
My best go - to sweet is what we call a Bundt cake , a kind butter cake .
It 's quick to make and beautiful as the shape of the pan does all the decorating for you ; and if it 's cut in thin slices – what most people want – you can stretch a Bundt to serve 16 or more . "
5 . Before you launch into baking breads or cakes after googling for a recipe , it 's essential to check if it 's from a good reliable source .
This does n't mean they have to be famous , but check for site reviews , comments and helpful pictures .
Sarah Phillips at baking911.com , home to some of the best baking know - how on the net says , " Be really careful with some of the recipes online from unnamed sources simply because most of them do not work .
Rely on experts , it will save you money . "
6 . Like exquisite couture , the most impressive baking usually has good taste and simplicity at its heart .
David Lebovitz , the savvy American in Paris who writes about chocolate , ice - cream and life 's other essentials , reminded me of that one important piece of advice .
" Keep it simple .
Not only will you use fewer ingredients , but it 'll be less work .
A great spice cake with a scoop of ice cream is just as appealing as a multi- layered extravaganza .
To jazz it up , add a drizzle of caramel sauce . "
Just keep it simple .
7 . Sometimes you can spend to save , especially if you have room in your cupboards to store ingredients .
Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito from Baked NYC in Brooklyn , authors of Baked : New Frontiers in Baking and the handsomest purveyors of sweet love in New York told me , " Buy a good quality chocolate in bulk form , rather than expensive 100g bars , and just break it up yourself .
Also , avoid recipes that need expensive ingredients and make more use of caramel : an easy combo of sugar , water and cream . "
8 . " My advice would be much more about charity at in this difficult time , " says Jeffrey Hamelman , who 's book Bread : A Baker 's Book of Techniques and Recipes really is the bible for serious breadheads worldwide .
" Rather than bake less this Christmas season , bake just a little more than you think you need .
Surely a neighbour or local food charity would be delighted with the unexpected gift . "
9 . Bread can be a beautiful gift too .
I asked Peter Reinhart , the best - selling bread expert and author of Whole Grain Breads : New Techniques , Extraordinary Flavour .
" Sweet fruit breads like German stollen or the Greek Christosomos make wonderful , relatively inexpensive gifts .
And , most importantly , they are always appreciated as a gift from the heart , and symbolize the nativity of Christ and the gifts of the Magi . "
Certainly , it shows more thought than a plastic something .
England
10 . For Yotam Ottolenghi , a little creativity with flavours can make the most of the most unlikely ingredients .
" Take plum pudding , you can crumble it into a simple biscotti mixture instead of using dried fruit and it gives a very rich , gently spiced accent to the biscuit .
Same with leftover fruit mince , fold it though vanilla or yoghurt ice - cream and the combination works really well . "
11 . " I 'll be making lots of mini cheese scones for the freezer , so handy at Christmas " , said Gerhard Jenne , the baker patron from Konditor and Cook .
" Then if you have people calling by you can rustle up snacks with a little smoked salmon , or if you make herb ones you can serve them with small cups of hot soup .
Even if you do n't make your own soup it 's nice to add you own little touch . "
12 . For John Rolfe , the founder of Jamie Oliver 's Flour Station bakery and now baking bread at the home of the best sourdough pizza in London , Franco Manca the secret is to soft moist crumb is simple .
" Put some cooked mashed potato in your bread dough , it 's the quickest way to add moistness and softness to the crumb and it 's literally as cheap as chips .
Or if you have leftover chestnut puree that works really well too .
Surprisingly , it wont turn you bread heavy and you can still get a great crisp crust . "
Scotland
13 .
Flour holds the spirit of the bread you bake , but it 's odd how we then expect miracles from the cheapest we can find .
Robert Winters at the Tapa Bakery in Glasgow , the home of great sourdough in Scotland , says the best tip starts with the flour you use .
" Do n't worry about saving money of the flour you buy , because even at it 's most expensive its still good value .
Find a stoneground flour , preferably wholemeal wheat or rye , and add that to your dough .
You 'll gain so much flavour that way . "
14 .
For the respected Scots food historian Catherine Brown , now is the time to stir up a few forgotten traditions and reawaken the practice of simple hard biscuits like oatcakes .
" If they 're made well and given a good firing , oatcakes taste perfect on their own .
I go a bit mad and make maybe a 100 at a time - cut into big triangles - as this makes best use of the oven .
This way you 've got them all winter , and you can have them with soup or crowdie . "
Ireland
15 . Keep a look out during the year for interesting decorative boxes to pack gifts into , and then squirrel them away in a cupboard .
Rachel Allen , the new star of Market Kitchen and author of Bake told me that a little planning is all that 's needed to turn a simple recipe into a beautiful gift .
" Keep a look out when you travel , then make a recipe that suits the style of the container .
I picked up some beautiful decorative tins from a shop in Paris , and I 'm going to make some delicate butter biscuits to go inside them .
This is the just the kind of present I 'd love to receive at Christmas . "
France
16 .
When it comes to good bread , do n't think quick ; instead encourage a slow undisturbed rise for the dough - forget about airing cupboards and hot water bottles .
Arguably the finest artisan baker in the world , Eric Kayser told me that there really is one piece of advice any aspiring baker must to repeat to themselves over and over .
" Time and rest are all that the dough needs to rise and become good bread .
Keep the yeast to a minimum and do other things while the flavour and texture mature . "
17 . " As we say in French : en cuisine on ne jette rien ( in the kitchen , we do n't throw anything away ) , " says Pascale Weeks , author of Cadeaux Gourmands , and the blogger at scally .
typepad.com who suggests making the best use of your freezer .
" When I make pastry , I always line tartlets cases with the leftovers , which I then freeze .
When I 'm alone for lunch I can then bake a small quiche for myself .
When I use yolks for petits pots de crème au chocolat for example , I freeze the whites .
I can use them after to make financiers , petits moelleux aux chocolat or amaretti . "
18 . Most cookie dough can be chilled in logs and kept in the fridge , which means that you can simply slice and bake what you need .
Clotilde Dusoulier from chocolateandzucchini.com says that tradition does n't have to be sacrificed to make life a little easier this way .
" When I was little , we would make cut - out Christmas cookies , but when I 'm pressed for time I use the same recipe and use the slice - and - bake method .
I roll the edges in unrefined cane sugar for a festive effect , and nobody 's ever complained . "
19 . For Fanny Zanotti in the Côte d'Azur , the talent behind the beautiful idea - packed foodbeam.com the stark realties of baking need n't stop you if you 're careful .
" Baking can turn into an expensive hobby , especially if you 're anything like me : super - conscious about the ingredients ' quality .
To keep costs on the lower side , my best advice is to stay seasonal .
Autumn and winter can seem a little sparse when it comes to harvests but … consider it a challenge and make your best to tingle your imagination . "
Think apples , pears , quinces , and dress them up with jams and a little brandy .
20 .
Getting more done with less seems daunting , but sometimes a little planning helps .
" One ingredient , one oven , two recipes " , says baking blogger Sandra Avital .
" Try making a couple of different kinds of cookies : one using only egg yolks , the second using only whites then bake both the same day , in the same hour , even at the same time to make the best use of the oven . "
This cuts fuel costs and probably saves time too .
Australia and New Zealand
21 . Donna
Hay advises every harassed cooks to go -easy after the Christmas dinner , lighter on the stomach and more likely to leave everyone with a sweet memory .
" My version of a bread and butter pudding has a festive spin but it 's easier to cook than Christmas cake or pudding , uses less ingredients and takes less time to put together , saving you effort , money and time . " says Donna .
" Just use good - quality brioche soaked in brandy - spiked custard , sprinkle it with brandy - soaked muscatels and top it with demerara sugar to form a crunchy crust .
It 's a winner in my house ! "
22 . The great daddy of artisan baking in Australia is John Downes , the guy who started the sourdough movement down - under during the 70s .
His Natural Tucker Bread Book ( 1983 ) was the prescient handbook for hardcore bakers and is still relevant today .
John tells me " if you 've been saying all year , ' gee , I 'd love to try making a sourdough but I do n't have the time ' then Christmas is perfect , " says John , " because you 're in the house , warm but not too hot , around to nurture it through those delicate first steps .
23 . For Dean Brettschnieder , the NZ artisan baker and author of The Global Baker , the best advice is more of an idea for life rather than a baking tip .
" This year I 'm in Shanghai for Christmas .
What I 'm going to do is make a batch of butter shortbread flavoured with dried cranberries and orange zest , and plan to wrap these as beautifully as I can and give them to the people in my life here who might otherwise have been incidental but , if I 'm really honest , have helped me enormously through the last year . "
Canada
24 .
The best way to give your creativity the support it needs is to get organised .
Rather than restricting your style , it will give you the freedom to express yourself .
Elizabeth Baird , author of The Complete Canadian Living Baking Book and food editor of the magazine reminded me that , however obvious it sounds , we all forget sometimes .
" It 's those simple things .
Plan ahead so you have all the ingredients fresh and ready to bake .
Read the recipe first so you do n't forget an all - important ingredient .
Then enjoy the whole process - the great aromas , the first taste and the fun of sharing something you 've made . "
25 . I first tasted the sourdough breads of artisan baker Cliff Leir , made with the rare Red Fife wheat , at the Slow Food Terra Madre in 2006 , and remember being struck with their extraordinary flavour .
I spoke with him as he was setting up Fol Epi , his new bakery on Vancouver Island 's Dockside Green , and asked what his tip was for getting some of that flavour at home .
" Try making your bread dough the day with just a tiny amount of yeast and let it ferment slowly overnight .
Actually , as the nights are cold you can just put the dough in a covered bowl on the back porch rather than using the fridge .
It 's really sweet that way as you work with the elements . "
26 . " The economy may be harsh and cold on either side of the pond " , says Marcy Goldman , editor of betterbaking .com " but home baking helps us feel warm and reassured .
It 's no wonder we bake as we do at holiday times and with a Scrooge - like market , all the more reason .
The first thing I do is sleuth out butter on sale and squirrel away many blocks of unsalted ( sweet ) butter as I can .
Butter is the basenote , as it were , in baking and having lots on hand is inspiring - but its best to find at a great price .
I also refresh my spices .
It 's funny how people dive into baking for the holidays , without thinking twice about using ages - old cinnamon or cloves .
Fresh spices and fresh baking powder is the key . "
Norway
27 . Gunn Borrowman , my favourite Norwegian making utterly perfect cakes up in the Cairngorms at Inshriach Nursery , gave this advice , " Add a small amount of ground almonds to your cakes if you want them to stay moist .
I sometimes replace all of the flour in cake recipes with ground almonds , and customers are so surprised you can get something gluten free and so good . "
Sweden
28 . Johan Sörberg , the award - winning artisan baker at Riddarbageriet in Stockholm told me that very simple rye breads , not much more that rye flour , salt and water mixed to a firm dough and rolled ultra thinly , are almost a Christmas tradition in Sweden .
" You ca n't get easier than that , " says Johan , " and flavoured with anise , black pepper or caraway , cut into " gingerbread " men , and baked till crisp they can be hung from the tree , and then eaten with the meal with soft cheese . "
29 .
From baking maestro Jan Hedh , the skill behind Peter 's Yard in Edinburgh , and the authority on Swedish baking : do n't overlook the breadth of flavour your can get from a little yeast and good flour .
" If you 're stuck for time , stirring a pinch of yeast into an equal quantity of flour and water and leave it somewhere cool for a week ; then use it in place of the same quantities of flour and water in the recipe .
This will act as a powerful flavour enhancer and ferment .
It 's not sourdough , but it 's the next best thing . "
Denmark
30 . Camilla Plum is to Denmark what Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall is to Britain , one of the few celebrities willing to stand up to the supermarkets and challenge consumers without worrying about being loveable .
The key difference is that Camilla is an exceptional baker as well .
Her advice is wise .
" If you do n't buy any kind of ready - made food , just for a week , but actually cook yourself … you 'll save a lot of money .
And this you can use for real butter , lots of currants and raisins , lovely fresh vanilla pods and cardamom .
Then you can do some really wonderful Christmas baking ! "
The Japanese cell phone operator KDDI has today announced the release of the impressive , feature - packed Casio EXILIM W63CA cameraphone , featuring an 8.1 - megapixel camera , a 3.1 - inch AMOLED display , face detection , anti-shake technology and a simple feature rarely seen on cameraphones … a flash .
The clamshell has a wide - angle 28 mm ( 35 mm format ) lens with nine - point autofocus and includes a YouTube mode which records VGA video at 30 fps .
Images and video playback should be clear and crisp thanks to the phone ’s 480×800 AMOLED WVGA display .
The phone includes a Micro - SD slot , Bluetooth , a media player , a web browser and an email client to keep us connected , while a weight of around 123g ( 4.33 ounces ) wo n’t weigh down our pockets .
The W63CA measures 50 mm ( 1.96 ″ ) x 110 mm ( 4.33 ″ ) x 17.4 mm ( 0.68 ″ ) and will go on sale in Japan in November for a price yet to be announced .
No word on a US / UK release .
This is an excellent step for Casio with their EXILIM range .
They seem to have successfully combined camera and phone without sacrificing numerous ( and sometimes essential ) features like the flash .
The only thing holding it back would be the absence of an optical zoom lens … but I guess you ca n’t have everything , right ?

Reader Umair alerted us to the Pakistani auction website Bolee.com , whose front page ( yesterday ) was advertising a “ Kidney for Sale ” ( there were three Ads for this , but all from the same person ) .
Search for the website on Google and you will see a bold “ Welcome to Pakistan ’s First Auction Site . ”
There are , of course , a number of other Pakistan auction website , some seemingly having much more to offer but , luckily , no kidneys .
We have carried a post in the past about someone wanting to sell his kidney to make ends meet , but this Ad on the auction website reaises so many issues and questions that one is left speechless !
Luckily there were no bidders on the kidney when we checked ( and captured this page image ) .
The description read :
I am 26 yaer old healthy person & want to sellout my healthy one kidney for AB + compatible person , My demand is Rs.600,000 ( Operations & other medical expenses ”ll be beard by kidney purchaser ) .
Frankly , its too distasteful a predicament for one to find the Pinglish in this description ( “ yaer ” , “ sellout ” , “ healthy one kidney ” , “ expenses ’ll ” , “ beard ” ) funny .
This is not just about an internet site and a rather ridiculous , maybe friviluous , notice on it .
The problem is real .
And the problem is much bigger .
For example , a recent scholarly article in Transplant International by researchers from the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation ( SIUT ) points out that Pakistan has now emerged as one of the largest centers for commerce and tourism in renal transplantation :
In recent years , Pakistan has emerged as one of the largest centres for commerce and tourism in renal transplantation .
Kidney vendors belong to Punjab in eastern Pakistan , the agricultural heartland , where 34 % people live below poverty line .
We report results of a socioeconomic and health survey of 239 kidney vendors .
The mean age was 33.6 Â± 7.2 years ( M: F 3.5:1 ) .
Mean nephrectomy period was 4.8 Â± 2.3 years .
Ninety per cent of the vendors were illiterate .
Sixty - nine per cent were bonded labourers who were virtual slaves to landlords , labourers 12 % , housewives 8.5 % and unemployed 11 % .
Monthly income was $ US15.4 Â± 8.9 with 2â €“ 11 dependents per family .
Majority ( 93 % ) , vended for debt repayment with mean debt of $ 1311.4 Â± 819 .
The mean agreed sale price was $ 1737 Â± 262 .
However , they received $ 1377 Â± 196 after deduction for hospital and travel expenses .
Postvending 88 % had no economic improvement in their lives and 98 % reported deterioration in general health status .
Future vending was encouraged by 35 % to pay off debts and freedom from bondage .
This study gives a snapshot of kidney vendors from Pakistan .
These impoverished people , many in bondage , are examples of modern day slavery .
They will remain exploited until law against bondage is implemented and new laws are introduced to ban commerce and transplant tourism in Pakistan .
The authors of the article , including the head of SIUT have since launched a very worthy campaign against the illegal and inhuman trade in kidneys from Pakistan and all the ways in whcih this exploits the already poor and vulnerable .
There is talk now of a law to legalize such trade and in the rush to focus on teh so called “ benefits ” of selling one ’s vital organs , there is little attention on what this means for those whose poverty will make them the victims .
A recent article in The Paksitan Link explores these questions :
Health experts are concerned about Pakistanâ€™s unregulated and fast growing kidney transplant trade , where foreigners can buy kidneys from impoverished Pakistanis in contravention of established medical norms .
With more than a dozen hospitals across the country involved in this unscrupulous trade , Pakistan has become the new Mecca for people seeking kidney transplants from across the world .
Transplants are a lucrative business for Pakistani doctors , hospital staff and fixers who exploit the gullible and the needy .
So much so that in some Pakistani villages , most people survive on one kidney .
In Mominpura village in central Punjab , nearly 80 per cent of the residents have sold one of their two kidneys .
Only children , the old and the sick have been spared the scalpel .
“ Anyone above 16 is taken to a hospital for a possible transplant , ” claims a villager .
According to people involved in the kidney trade , besides Pakistan , China is the only country in the world where illegal and unrelated donor organs are transplanted .
In China , kidneys are taken from prisoners on death row .
“ Any transplant that is unrelated is unethical , ” believes Dr Anwar Naqvi , a senior surgeon at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplant ( SIUT ) in Karachi .
Naqvi is campaigning against unrelated transplants in Pakistan .
Take 22 - year - old Sumaira of Mandiala Wala village located 30 kilometers east of Lahore in Punjab province .
She is no different from the hundreds of villagers here learning to live on one kidney .
In Sumairaâ€™s case the choice wasnâ€™t easy .
She and her family could either stay in bondage for life to a brick kiln owner , or she could sell one of her kidneys and pay off the familyâ€™s mounting debts .
Sumaira decided to donate .
In January 2002 , she was brought to a hospital by her parents .
â€ œThere was a maulvi ( religious head ) in our area who took us to the hospital in return for a fee , â€ says Sumairaâ€™s 25 - year - old brother Mohammed Safdar .
The staff conducted pre-operative tests on Sumaira and she was sent home after signing an agreement with the hospital management to donate one of her kidneys .
A month later , she was summoned by the hospital : a recipient had been identified .
In the clandestine kidney market , if a kidney is sold to a local recipient , the donor gets US $ 1,600 but if sold to a foreigner , the payment is double .
As a goodwill gesture , the recipient is introduced to the donors before the transplant .
But in Sumairaâ€™s case , her 32 - year - old recipient , Thor Anderson , a property developer , born in Denmark and living in London , avoided meeting her due to the prevailing anti-West sentiment over the Iraq war .
Of the US $ 3,200 , Sumairaâ€™s family used US $ 1,600 to repay loans .
Over US $ 500 went to a broker , with US $ 250 spent on post - operative care .
They were left with US $ 750 , a sum that didnâ€™t last long , considering Sumairaâ€™s large family .
It is now her brotherâ€™s turn to join the long queue of poor donors willing to sell a kidney for money .
â€
œIt is not risky at all , â€ Safdar contends .
In the West , the vast majority of donor kidneys are taken from people killed in accidents .
But as the number of patients has spiraled the world over , the transplant business in poor countries continues to expand .
Also , in some countries , as in the UK , recipients have to know the ‘ live ’ donors , and cannot pressure them .
This makes legal transplants difficult in such countries .
Patients , therefore , travel to poor countries where there are either no laws or no regulation .
Sadly , most people are no better off after the sale despite the risks .
Sughra Begum sold her kidney for just US $ 1,300 .
Her husband , Muhammad Yar , had also donated his kidney four years ago to repay a loan from their landlord , but the middleman made off with the money .
Thatâ€™s when Sughra decided to sell her kidney .
Though they managed to repay the landlord , the operation took a toll on her health .
Due to her constant illness and her husbandâ€™s critical condition , they were forced to take another loan and are back in their landlordâ€™s clutches .
According to data compiled by the Pakistani organization , Postgraduate Doctors Middle East , in the year 2001 there were 1,244 kidney transplants , of which relatives donated 611 , spouses 80 and unrelated donors 533 .
Due to an increase in donors , several hospitals have started offering less for the kidneys .
SIUTâ€™s Naqvi dreads the future .
“ The very wealthy will end up as buyers of the organs being sold by the very poor .
Such an unequal distribution of health benefits and burdens will be completely unjust , ” he says .
When people become compelled to sell their vital organs on the internet or to unscrupulous traders , it says volumes about just how vulnerable theirÂ lives and livelihoods have become ?
It says as much , or more , about the society that allows this to happen ?
But does anyone in our society care ?
Joe the Plumber , a.k.a.
Samuel Wurzelbacher , landed on the national stage on Oct. 15 , when John McCain brought him up during a debate with Barack Obama .
The Ohio - based tradesman was n't planning on national stardom -- if he had been , he probably would have renewed his plumber 's license -- but he 's managing his time in the spotlight with an agent and a book deal .
An amazingly fast book deal :
It 's due on shelves on Dec. 1 .
Mediabistro's Unbeige has a preview of the cover of " Joe the Plumber -- Fighting for the American Dream . "
The book will be released , Fox News reports , " by a group called PearlGate Publishing and other small publishing houses . "
PearlGate Publishing has released one other book , " Things Forgotten " by author / publisher Thomas Tabback .
In it , " I wanted to marry the account given in the Book of Joshua with direct historical evidence , " Tabback writes on his website .
" You can use the Bible and extra-biblical history together as a roadmap to the past . "
The book 's opening , titled " The Promised Land , " ends with this paragraph :
Yet , as it was written , Israel invaded Canaan and the events that transpired were immortalized within the Bible , forever changing the course of history .
Though acts of God and triumphs and failures of Israel are recorded in poetic detail , lost are the personal accounts of those who lived it .
No account , save the biblical record , has ever been discovered .
Tabback could benefit from the help of a copy editor ( the second " it " has no antecedent ; " personal accounts who lived through those times , " maybe ? ) , but with a release date of Dec. 1 , the publisher has got to be scrambling to finalize the manuscript .
What 's more , he's also the co-writer of " Joe the Plumber -- Fighting for the American Dream . "
That would be a lot of responsibility for a seasoned publishing professional ; Tabback must really have his hands full .
Tabback 's short bio on the PearlGate website does n't reveal any publishing experience other than his own book .
Tabback does have a Southern California connection , though -- he once worked at Universal Studios in Hollywood , and was here during the 1994 Northridge earthquake .
So he 's experienced at least one bumpy ride .

2 recipes pizza dough ( or 2 cans refrigerated pizza dough )
8 oz block mozzarella cheese
4 oz thin sliced pepperoni
2 tsp Italian seasoning ( combine oregano , basil , parsley , and garlic )
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
pizza or marinara sauce
Prepare pizza dough and roughly chop pepperoni .
Cut block of mozzarella into 48 cubes .
If you are going to bake some ( or all ! ) right away preheat oven to 400 °F .
Grease 3 pie pans .
If using refrigerated pizza dough : roll one dough out into a large rectangle and cut into 24 pieces .
Repeat with 2nd pizza dough .
If using homemade dough just pinch off walnut sized pieces as you go .
In each dough piece place a couple pieces of chopped pepperoni and a cube of cheese .
Seal dough around meat and cheese and place seam side down in pie pan .
Repeat , placing approximately 16 dough balls in each pie plate .
Once assembled , combine oil and spices and brush over the dough .
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese .
Now you can cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze or you can bake right away .
When ready to bake : bake at 400 °F for 16 - 20 min .
Serve with warm pizza or marinara sauce .
I used to use the refrigerated pizza doughs for this recipe , but I actually find the homemade dough far easier to work with .
I discovered this dough below from Carmen Cooks when I tried her calzone recipe .
It is very forgiving and easy to work with .
Doubled , it makes the perfect amount of dough for this recipe .
Since then , I use my own dough recipe .
Basic Pizza Dough

Stir to combine .
Once dough starts to come together , turn out onto a floured counter and knead to thoroughly combine - until dough is smooth and elastic .
If it is uncooperative let it rest for a few minutes and come back to it .
Place dough ball in a greased bowl and cover loosely .
Allow dough to rise until doubled , approximately an hour .
What ’s for dinner this week ?

One drawback - or possibly advantage - of being known as an easily riled automated curmudgeon is that people tend to hurl recommendations my way .
" Here , look at this , " they chortle , holding something irritating under my nose .
" You 'll hate it . "
Usually the item in question is merely a bit disappointing .
But the other day someone urged me to buy the latest copy of Tatler and read the Little Black Book section .
" It 's absolutely unbelievable , " they said .
I was intrigued enough to pop to the newsagents and cough up my £ 3.80 .
Even though I do n't think I 've ever read an edition of Tatler in my life , I had a general sense that being seen with it in public was a bad idea , so I turned the magazine around , hiding the cover against my chest as I left so no one could see what I was carrying .
Better to let the passersby assume I 'm carrying a porn mag , I figured - although the whopping great advert for Cartier diamond jewellery on the back probably gave the game away .
I do n't think they advertise in Barely Legal .
Once I was safely out of sight , I gingerly opened the magazine and started reading .
Three seconds later , I was furious .
Before getting to the Little Black Book section , I 'd alighted on an article about a " sexy Holland Park billionairess and her fabulous life " .
She was called Goga Ashkenazi , and she was pictured swathed in fur , diamonds dripping pendulously from her ears .
She was clutching a miniature dog that looked like it'd been peeled ; one of those scrawny upholstered canine skeleton - creatures with the facial tics of a tiny frightened bird .
Given the alarming way these micro-dogs pant 5,000 times a second , I always think they 're about to die , that their pea-sized hearts will suddenly burst like a popcorn kernel inside their mousey little ribcage .
But Goga was n't worried .
She was smiling .
As well she might .
If she wanted , she could buy a million dogs and spend a month hurling them into a threshing machine for chuckles .
According to the article , she 's so rich she " summons private jets like most people hail cabs " , and once lost a " £ 500,000 piece of wrist candy " , shrugged , and simply put on another one .
It describes her as " a sort of 21st - century Holly Golightly " , which seems a bit harsh .
Holly Golightly was a call girl .
Ashkenazi is an oligarch with her own goldmine .
And maybe she 's lovely , but the article was so fawningly , nauseatingly dazzled by how much money she 's got , it'd be impossible for any sane human being reading it not to thoroughly despise her by the end .
Shaken , I turned to the Little Black Book section , which turned out to be an authoritative A - Z of overprivileged arseholes ( most of them still in their early 20s ) , plus the occasional celeb , rated and compiled by the single biggest group of wankers in the universe .
You 're supposed to want to sleep with these people , and the text attempts to explain why .
It 's the ultimate in self - celebratory nothingness , 2,000 times worse than the worst ever article in Heat magazine .
It includes five lords , six ladies , four princes , five princesses , two viscounts , three earls , a marquess , and 16 tittering poshos whose names are prefixed with the phrase " The Hon " ( which , I 've just discovered , means they 're the son or daughter of a viscount or baron ) .
Names like Cressida , Archie , Guy , Blaise and Freddie feature heavily .
How annoying is it ?
Put it this way : James
Blunt is also on the list , and he 's the least objectionable person there .
Each entry takes the form of a chortling mini-biog guaranteed to make you want to punch the person it describes flat in the face .
Thus , we learn that " Jakie Warren " is " the heartthrob who lives in the coolest house in Edinburgh and has the initials of all his best friends tattooed on his thigh .
You can touch them but he 'll make you buy shares in the racing syndicate he co-owns with Ed Sackville ...
Good in bed , we hear . "
Or consider " The Hon Wenty Beaumont " : " The growl , the growl - girls go weak for the growl ...
Utterly divine Christie 's kid who enjoys nothing more than playing Pass the Pig during weekends at the family estate in Northumberland or in Saint - Tropez . "
In other words , the only thing these waddling bags of arseflesh have going for them is unrestricted access to a vast and unwarranted fortune .
Strip away the coins and it reads like a list of the most boring people in Britain .
As an additional poke in the ribs , each entry is accompanied by a tiny photograph , so you can squint into the eyes of the cosseted stranger you 've suddenly decided to hate .
The girls are technically pretty in a uniform , Sloaney kind of way , while the men are more varied , falling into three main categories : dull preening James Blunt types , dull preening indie types , and simpering ruddy - cheeked oafs who look like they 're about to pull a pair of underpants over their head and run around snorting like a hog in a bid to impress a blind - drunk debutante .
In summary , it 's an entire alternate dimension of shit , a galaxy of streaming - eye fart gas , compressed into a few glossy pages .
It will have you alternating between rage , jealousy , bewilderment and distress , before dumping you in a bottomless slough of despond .
Buy a copy .
No , do n't .
Stand in a shop flipping through the pages , deliberately fraying each corner as you go .
Drink it in .
Feel your impotent anger levels peaking .
The headrush is good for you .
Try it .
You 'll hate it .
Thanks for the recommendation .
I 'm off for a cry .
• This week Charlie got halfway through You Cannot Live as I Have Lived and Not End Up Like This : The Thoroughly Disgraceful Life and Times of Willie Donaldson , a biography of Willie " Henry Root " Donaldson : " Now there 's an interesting posho ; a man whose shambolic life reads like a bucket of jokes being kicked down the stairs . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Europe officially fell into recession on Friday and the U.S. economy suffered thousands more layoffs and the biggest retail sales dip on record as world leaders met in Washington to address the worst financial crisis in 80 years .
Leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies said they were working on plans to counter the growing economic threat and prevent future crises , but big breakthroughs were not expected at their meeting in the U.S. capital , given the absence of U.S. President - elect Barack Obama , whose involvement will be key to any global initiatives .
The financial crisis continues to wreak havoc on the world ’s major economies , with official data showing the 15 - nation euro zone economy had shrunk by 0.2 percent for the second quarter in a row , meaning it is technically in recession .
The United States is probably already in recession , most economists agree , but official data showing that will not come out until January .
“ Frankly , we at Dow are looking at an ‘09 that looks like a pretty protracted global recession , probably going into 2010 , ” Andrew Liveris , the chief executive of Dow Chemical Co , the largest U.S. chemical maker , told Reuters .
Signs for the U.S. economy worsened on Friday .
Retail sales fell 2.8 percent in October , according to government data , the biggest decline since comparable numbers were first collected in 1992 .
Citigroup Inc , one of the hardest - hit financial companies , will soon announce job cuts of up to 10 percent of its staff , according to a source familiar with the matter .
That could affect more than 30,000 employees .
Sun Microsystems
Inc said it would slash up to 6,000 jobs , or 18 percent of its workforce , as it looks to save money while demand wanes for its high - end business computers .
Fidelity Investments , the world ’s biggest mutual fund company , told employees it will cut a further 1,700 jobs on top of 1,300 already announced .
Freddie Mac , the second - largest provider of U.S. home loan financing , reported a $ 25 billion quarterly loss as the housing slump worsened , forcing it to draw on a $ 100 billion Treasury Department lifeline .
Meanwhile , approval of a bailout for the big U.S. automakers was in doubt , increasing the possibility of a wave of mass layoffs at General Motors Corp , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC .
The U.S. Senate plans on Monday to take up a bill that would provide emergency aid to automakers , but it remained unclear if there was enough support for it to pass .
The only glimmer of optimism was that U.S. consumer sentiment rose slightly , helped by lower gasoline prices .

Confidence might be raised further by moves to reduce skyrocketing home foreclosures by modifying borrowers ’ loans , but a proposal along those lines by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp met opposition from the U.S. Treasury and the White House .
More help is on the way for ailing banks .
Friday was the deadline for public banks to apply for funds under a U.S. capital injection program that is part of the $ 700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last month .
Treasury expects to approve federal funds for another 20 banks , an official told a U.S. House of Representatives committee .

U.S. stocks closed lower , the Dow losing nearly 4 percent after flirting briefly with positive territory following Thursday ’s strong gains and a winning session in European and Asian stock markets .
Oil fell below $ 57 a barrel .
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said central banks worldwide were ready to do more to support faltering growth and European Central Bank policy - makers signaled further interest - rate cuts were likely .
“ Policy - makers will remain in close contact , monitor developments closely , and stand ready to take additional steps should conditions warrant , ” Bernanke said at an ECB conference in Frankfurt .
With Europe as well as parts of Asia and North America suffering , leaders of the G20 nations opened a two - day summit with a dinner at the White House in a search for ways to resolve the crisis , started by a U.S. housing market crash , and avoid another one .
But agreement among the G20 , which represents 85 percent of the world ’s economy and two - thirds of its population , may be elusive amid divisions over whether more regulation of markets can protect consumers , savers and companies from the fallout .
The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush says there should be no return to greater state control of financial markets .
Much of Europe says that without greater regulation , a repeat of the last year ’s turmoil is inevitable .
A recent Zogby International poll commissioned by the Arkansas - based Drug Policy Education Group has found that a slight majority of respondents favor decriminalization of the adult use and possession of marijuana .
The poll was conducted November 7 - 11 and was based on a Zogby online panel of 436 voters deemed by Zogby to be representative of the state 's adult population .
The margin of error was +/- 4.8 % .
Respondents were asked the following question : " In 2007 , over 7,400 adults were arrested in Arkansas for misdemeanor possession of one ounce or less of marijuana , over half the state 's total drug arrests .
According to a national 2005 study , state and local governments spend an average of $ 10,400 per arrest on police , courts , and jails .
Based on that estimate , 2007 marijuana arrests will cost Arkansas taxpayers nearly $ 77 million dollars .
Knowing this information , would you strongly support , somewhat support , somewhat oppose , or strongly oppose a law that would eliminate the penalties for adult marijuana possession of one ounce or less ? "
Slightly more than 35 % strongly supported changing the pot laws , with another 17 % somewhat supporting it , for a total of 53 % in favor of decriminalization .
On the other side of the coin , 38 % strongly opposed and 7 % somewhat opposed decrim , for a total of 45 % .
Three percent were n't sure .
Democrats and independents supported decrim by a margin of two - to - one , but only 29 % of Republicans supported it .
Intensity is on the side of Republicans , with 63 % strongly opposed compared to 49 % of both Democrats and Independents who are strongly in support .
A slim majority of voters under 64 would support decrim , with the highest proportion among the under - 30 group .
Among the young , 58 % supported decrim .
Majorities of both whites ( 51 % ) and African Americans ( 64 % ) said they would support such a law , while women ( 59 % ) were more likely than men ( 46 % ) to say they would support it .
A similar , but slightly differently worded poll commissioned by the Drug Policy Education Group in 2006 had similar findings .
In that poll , which asked voters if they would support " reducing " the penalties for adult marijuana possession offenses , 61 % said yes , while 35 % said no .
Arkansas has been the scene of drug reform activism , mainly around marijuana , for several years now .
Initiatives making adult marijuana possession offenses the lowest law enforcement priority passed by two - to - one margins in Eureka Springs in 2006 and in the college town of Fayetteville this month .
State drug reform groups like the Drug Policy Education Group and its predecessors have also been tilling the ground in the Razorback State .
Reform bubbles up in the most surprising places , and these poll results suggest Arkansans may be more receptive than most people imagined .

And before you say anything , yeh , it looks major fake ...:)
America was rudely awakened to a new kind of danger on September 11 , 2001 : Terrorism .
The attacks that day left 2,996 people dead , including the passengers on the four commercial airliners that were used as weapons .
Many feel it was the most tragic day in U.S. history .
Four commercial jets crashed that day .
But what if six jumbo jets crashed every day in the United States , claiming the lives of 783,936 people every year ?
That would certainly qualify as a massive tragedy , would n't it ?
Well , forget " what if . "
The tragedy is happening right now .
Over 750,000 people actually do die in the United States every year , although not from plane crashes .
They die from something far more common and rarely perceived by the public as dangerous : modern medicine .
According to the groundbreaking 2003 medical report Death by Medicine , by Drs. Gary Null , Carolyn Dean , Martin Feldman , Debora Rasio and Dorothy Smith , 783,936 people in the United States die every year from conventional medicine mistakes .
That 's the equivalent of six jumbo jet crashes a day for an entire year .
But where is the media attention for this tragedy ?
Where is the government support for stopping these medical mistakes before they happen ?
After 9/11 , the White House gave rise to the Department of Homeland Security , designed to prevent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil .
Since its inception , billions of dollars have been poured into it .
The 2006 budget allots $ 34.2 billion to the DHS , a number that has come down slightly from the $ 37.7 billion budget of 2003 .
According to the study led by Null , which involved a painstaking review of thousands of medical records , the United States spends $ 282 billion annually on deaths due to medical mistakes , or iatrogenic deaths .
And that 's a conservative estimate ; only a fraction of medical errors are reported , according to the study .
Actual medical mistakes are likely to be 20 times higher than the reported number because doctors fear retaliation for those mistakes .
The American public heads to the doctor 's office or the hospital time and again , oblivious of the alarming danger they 're heading into .
The public knows that medical errors occur , but they assume that errors are unusual , isolated events .
Unfortunately , by accepting conventional medicine , patients voluntarily continue to walk into the leading cause of death in America .
According to a 1995 U.S. iatrogenic report , " Over a million patients are injured in U.S. hospitals each year , and approximately 280,000 die annually as a result of these injuries .
Therefore , the iatrogenic death rate dwarfs the annual automobile accident mortality rate of 45,000 and accounts for more deaths than all other accidents combined . "
This report was issued 10 years ago , when America had 34 million fewer citizens and drug company scandals like the Vioxx recall were yet to occur .
Today , health care comprises 15.5 percent of the United States ' gross national product , with spending reaching $ 1.4 trillion in 2004 .
Since Americans spend so much money on health care , they should be getting a high quality of care , right ?
Unfortunately , that 's not the case .
Of the 783,936 annual deaths due to conventional medical mistakes , about 106,000 are from prescription drugs , according to Death by Medicine .
That also is a conservative number .
Some experts estimate it should be more like 200,000 because of underreported cases of adverse drug reactions .
Americans today are used to fixing problems the quick way  even when it comes to their health .
Thus , they rely heavily on prescription drugs to fix their diseases .
For every conceivable ailment  real or not  chances are there 's a pricey prescription drug to " treat " it .
Chances are even better that their drug of choice comes chock full of side effects .
The problem is , prescription drugs do n't treat diseases ; they merely cover the symptoms .
U.S. physicians provide allopathic health care  that is , they care for disease , not health .
So , the over - prescription of drugs and medications is designed to treat disease instead of preventing it .
And because there are so many drugs available , unforeseen adverse drug reactions are all too common , which leads to the highly conservative annual prescription drug death rate of 106,000 .
Keep in mind that these numbers came before the Vioxx scandal , and Cox - 2 inhibitor drugs could ultimately end up killing tens of thousands more .
American medical patients are getting the short end of a rather raw deal when it comes to prescription drugs .
Medicine is a high - dollar , highly competitive business .
But it should n't be .
Null 's report cites the five most important aspects of health that modern medicine ignores in favor of the almighty dollar : Stress , lack of exercise , high calorie intake , highly processed foods and environmental toxin exposure .
All these things are putting Americans in such poor health that they run to the doctor for treatment .
But instead of doctors treating the causes of their poor health , such as putting them on a strict diet and exercise regimen , they stuff them full of prescription drugs to cover their symptoms .
Using this inherently faulty system of medical treatment , it 's no wonder so many Americans die from prescription drugs .
They 're not getting better ; they 're just popping drugs to make their symptoms temporarily go away .
But not all doctors subscribe to this method of " treatment . "
In fact , many doctors are just as angry as the public should be , charging that scientific medicine is " for sale " to the highest bidder  which , more often than not , end up being pharmaceutical companies .
The pharmaceutical industry is a multi-trillion dollar business .
Companies spend billions on advertising and promotions for prescription drugs .
Who can remember the last time they watched television and were n't bombarded with ads for pills treating everything from erectile dysfunction to sleeplessness ?
And who has ever been to a doctor 's office or hospital and not seen every pen , notepad and post - it bearing the logo of some prescription drug ?
Medical experts claim that patients ' requests for certain drugs have no effect on the number of prescriptions written for that drug .
Pharmaceutical companies claim their drug ads are " educational " to the public .
The public believes the FDA reviews all the ads and only allows the safest and most effective drug ads to reach the public .
It 's a clever system : Pharmaceutical companies influence the public to ask for prescription drugs , the public asks their physicians to prescribe them certain drugs , and doctors acquiesce to their patients ' requests .
Everyone 's happy , right ?
Not quite , since the prescription drug death toll continues to rise .
The public seems to genuinely believe that drugs advertised on TV are safe , in spite of the plethora of side effects listed by the commercial 's narrator , ranging from diarrhea to death .
Patients feel justified in asking their physicians to prescribe them a particular drug they 've seen on TV , since it surely must be safe or it would n't have been advertised .
Remember all those TV ads heralding the wonders of Vioxx ?
One might wonder how many lives could have been spared if patients did n't see the ad on TV and request a prescription from their doctors .
But advertising is n't the only tool the pharmaceutical industry uses to influence medicine .
Null 's study cites an ABC report that said pharmaceutical companies spend over $ 2 billion sending doctors to more than 314,000 events every year .
While doctors are riding the dollar of pharmaceutical companies , enjoying all the many perks of these " events , " how likely are they to question the validity of drug companies or their products ?
Admittedly , not all doctors reside in the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies .
Some are downright angry at the situation , and angry on behalf of an unaware public .
Major conflicts of interest exist between the American public , the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry .
And although the public suffers the most from this conflict , it is the least informed .
The public gets the short end of the stick and they do n't even know it .
That is why the pharmaceutical industry remains a multi-trillion dollar business .
Prescription drugs are only a part of the U.S. healthcare system 's miserable failings .
In fact , outpatient deaths , bedsore deaths and malnutrition deaths each account for higher death rates than adverse drug reactions .
The problems run deep and cannot be remedied without drastic , widespread change in the system 's money and ethics .
The first issue  money  is the main reason the medical industry cannot seem to change .
Prescribing more drugs and recommending more surgeries means more profits .
Getting more drugs approved by the FDA , regardless of their safety , means more money for the pharmaceutical industry .
As the healthcare system stands today , physicians and drug companies can't seem to pass up earning loads of money , even if a few hundred thousand people lose their lives in the process .
Even in drastic cases of deadly drugs , everyone involved has a scapegoat : Drug companies can blame the FDA for approving their product and the doctors for over - prescribing it , and doctors can blame the patients for wanting it and not properly weighing the risks .
What ultimately arises is a question of ethics .
In layman 's terms , ethics are the rules or moral guidelines that govern the conduct of people or professions .
Some ethics are ingrained from childhood , but some are specifically set forth .
For example , nearly all medical schools have their new doctors take a modern form of the Hippocratic Oath .
While few versions are identical , none include setting aside proper medical care in favor of money - making practices .
On the research side of the issue , " Death by Medicine " cites an ABC report that says clinical trials funded by pharmaceutical companies show a 90 percent chance that a drug will be perceived as effective , whereas clinical trials not funded by drug companies show only a 50 percent chance that a drug will be perceived as effective .
" It appears that money cant buy you love , but it can buy you any ' scientific ' result you want , " writes Null and his team of researchers .
The government spends upwards of $ 30 billion a year on homeland security .
Such spending seems important .
Since 2001 , 2,996 people in the United States have died from terrorism  all as a result of the 9/11 attacks .
In that same period of time , 490,000 people have died from prescription drugs , not counting the Vioxx scandal .
That means that prescription drugs in this country are at least 16,400 percent deadlier than terrorism .
Again , those are the conservative numbers .
A more realistic number , which would include deaths from over - the - counter drugs , makes drug consumption 32,000 percent deadlier than terrorism .
But the scope of " Death by Medicine " is even wider .
Conventional medicine , including unnecessary surgeries , bedsores and medical errors , is 104,700 percent deadlier than terrorism .
Yet , our government 's attention and money is not put into reforming health care .
Could n't a little chunk of the homeland security money be better spent on overhauling the corrupt U.S. healthcare system , the leading cause of death in America ?
Could n't we forfeit the color - coded threat system in favor of stricter guidelines on medical research and prescription drugs ?
No one is attempting to say that terrorism in the world is not a problem , especially for a high - profile country like the United States .
No one is saying that the people who died on 9/11 did n't matter or were n't horribly wronged by the terrorists that day .
But there are more dangerous things in the United States being falsely represented as safe and healthy , when , in reality , they are deadly .
The corruption in the pharmaceutical industry and in America 's healthcare system poses a far greater threat to the health , safety and welfare of Americans today than terrorism .
If the Bush Administration really wants to save lives -- a lot of lives -- it needs look no further than the chemical war has been declared on Americans by Big Pharma .
Ratings for the show , in its 34th season , are up 50 percent among all viewers this season , a move that defies every viewing trend in network television .
Last week ’s episode was seen by more than 10 million people , a figure that would make it a hit in prime time .
Looking to capitalize on the surge in interest , “ SNL ” will have the first of three prime - time specials Thursday at 9:30 , devoted specifically to the presidential race .
“ There ’s never been an election where we ’ve been at the center of so much , except possibly Bush - Gore in 2000 , ” Mr. Michaels said .
“ It ’s great for comedy , and it ’s also great for broadcast television because it ’s what we do at our best . ”
It ’s not bad for cable television either , in the form of the twin news - oriented late - night shows on Comedy Central .
“ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart ” and “ The Colbert Report ” reached record numbers of viewers last month , even topping some of the broadcast networks ’ late - night shows .
“ I think people are in a highly emotional state because of the election , ” Mr. Stewart said .
“ It certainly is energizing the comedy world . ”
“ The Daily Show ” averaged just under two million viewers for September , by far its best performance ever .
For the first time in the course of a month the show had more viewers per episode than NBC ’s “ Late Night With Conan O’Brien . ”
That show , since it ’s on a broadcast network , is available in about 15 million more homes than “ The Daily Show ” ( although “ Late Night ” is also on 90 minutes later , in the 12:30 slot , when far fewer viewers are awake and available ) .

FOR me and my family , Oct. 31 has always been significant .
Not because it ’s Halloween , but because that ’s the day we arrived as refugees to a free part of the world .
Beginning in August 1972 , thousands of Asian entrepreneurs fled the East African country of Uganda after its dictator , Idi Amin , declared us to be bloodsuckers , seized our property and gave us three months to leave or die .
My family and I had only Ugandan passports , so we could n’t escape to Britain or India like many of our neighbors .
We ’d been in Africa for two generations ; my father and his brothers owned a car dealership in Uganda ’s capital , Kampala .
We did n’t know where to go , but we knew we could n’t stay : Amin viciously enforced his 90 - day deadline .
By the final week of October , the nations that would otherwise accept Ugandan exiles had exceeded their quotas .
My family heard that Sweden and Canada might make room for a few more , and so out of desperation my mother , my sisters and I flew to Montreal , with Dad to follow .
We had no guarantee that Canada would admit us .

Top officials at American International Group Inc. knew of potential problems in valuing derivative contracts long before these risky transactions caused the insurer 's shareholders severe pain , according to documents released by congressional investigators .
The disclosures come as prospects dimmed this past week for AIG 's efforts to quickly sell assets to repay its bulging debt to the government .
The derivative - contract problems would have driven AIG into bankruptcy ; in the past month , the government has made available to ...
LATE IN the afternoon of Sept. 12 , the final chapter was written in the 19 - year legal battle surrounding Troy Anthony Davis .
After receiving a temporary stay of execution last July , Davis was denied clemency by Georgia ’s Board of Pardons and Parole , the last administrative body that could have commuted Davis ’s death sentence .
The Davis case has been one of the most complex , divisive legal struggles Savannah has ever seen , rivaling even the Jim Williams case in every sense except glamour and hoodoo .
The murder of Mark MacPhail was n’t a high society who - dunnit , but the brutal shooting of an off - duty police officer in the early morning hours of a hot summer night .
For those familiar with the case , there ’s no middle ground — one either sides with the prosecution ’s belief that Davis is guilty and deserves to die ; or with the defense ’s claim that he was falsely accused and unjustly incarcerated — and there is no easy answer .
For the District Attorney , there ’s the fact that Davis was convicted and sentenced after the testimony of nine witnesses linked him to the murder .
For the defense , there is the recanted testimony of seven of those witnesses , along with allegations of police coercion and a distinct lack of physical evidence .
The day before the board decided Davis ’s fate , with storm clouds gathering ominously , a group of 40 Savannahians boarded a bus at the corner of Gwinnett and MLK .
Had it not been for the swarm of local news crews , passersby might have assumed it was a church group heading out for a day trip .
But the gathering of people , who ranged in age from 16 – 70 , had a more politically charged purpose .
They were preparing to depart for a rally in Atlanta on the steps of the Georgia Capitol in support of Troy Anthony Davis .
“ This case transcends to people in similar situations , ” says Perrice Austin , one of the people who lead the trip .
“ I ’m not talking about setting guilty people free .
It ’s about a support system for people who never had a voice . ”
The group of locals who boarded the bus — which included members of Davis ’s family , people who knew him and complete strangers who had simply heard about the case — were ready to endure the long trip in hope that their voices could help sway the board to commute Davis ’s sentence until there was certainty whether he was guilty .
“ If he was guilty , it would have been over already , ” says Timmetrieous Bowens , a Coffee Bluff resident who recently heard about the case and wanted to take part in the rally .
“ They do n’t have all the facts , and they do n’t have any evidence .
By helping Davis , we ’re helping the community .
We ’re showing the justice system that we wo n’t allow this to happen . ”
The shared sentiment on the bus is that what happened to Davis , if he was falsely accused , could happen to anyone — a message reinforced later at the rally with T - shirts reading “ I Am Troy Davis , ” and chants of the same message .
The group from Savannah is among the first at the rally .
They are joined by members of Amnesty International , the organization that planned the rally .
Within an hour , the crowd has grown to over 100 , representing a variety of different political and social organizations .
The energy of the crowd is palpable and powerful .
“ It ’s a testimony to the human spirit , ” says Austin , as we stand slightly back from everyone , surveying the scene .
“ People do n’t come together like this for malarkey .
It ’s for something they believe in , and they know the facts .
Some used to think he was guilty , but then they learned more about the case . ”
Rumors circulate that the parole board has received over 25,000 letters on behalf of Troy in the last few days .
Several people mention that you can now send the board text messages as well , and that one radio appearance by Troy ’s sister Martina generated over 1,000 texts in just a matter of minutes .
While Davis ’s supporters chant and wave signs , a stage is erected and a PA system is set up .
As the focus turns to the stage , a series of speakers , including Amnesty International ’s Executive Director Larry Cox , Georgia NAACP Conference President Edward DuBose , advocate Jennifer Thompson - Cannino , and Troy ’s sister Martina Correia , among others , all speak to the crowd , which is now closer to 500 in total .
“ That Troy has lived another year is testament to justice , ” Cox says , referring to the board ’s granting Davis a temporary stay of execution , and then reiterating the board ’s promise from the previous year not to execute if any doubts remained .
Thompson - Cannino , a former rape victim whose false identification put the wrong man in jail for almost a decade , speaks of how , despite her best efforts to remember the features of the man who assaulted her , an innocent man would have been executed if he had not been exonerated later by DNA evidence .
As Correia addresses the crowd , someone steps up behind her and hands her a cell phone .
It is Davis himself on the other end , and he talks to the crowd by speakerphone .
“ Until I ’m free , justice is not done , ” he tells the rapt audience .
As the event comes to a close , in an unexpected act of kindness one of the capitol police officers invites the busload of Savannahians to his church for a fish dinner before beginning the long journey home .
As they enter the wood - paneled church basement where rows of folding tables lead to a buffet line along the back wall , a sense of exhaustion and thankfulness mingles with the familiar smells of home - cooking .
“ Look at what your son brought together , ” someone says to Virginia Davis , Troy ’s mother , reflecting on the day and looking at the packed church hall .
The comment ties in with an underlying theme of the day , that there must be a greater purpose to this man ’s suffering .
But , at the same time that there ’s hope that Davis ’s suffering could lead to reform , there is an unspoken element of distrust in this idea of a greater justice .
Rather than leave it to fate , here are hundreds of people taking action to try and ensure that the right thing is done .
Back on the bus with full stomachs , the mood is positive .
There is talk of holding another rally in Savannah .
“ Remember this was n’t just a one day trip , ” someone says .
“ This is a job . ”
While last year ’s clemency hearing for Davis was one of the longest in state history , this time the board would deliberate less than two hours before making their decision .
And despite all the effort that had gone into the rally one day earlier , the high spirits of those on the bus would be dashed when Davis was denied clemency .
This case , that for so many seemed like it would never end , seems to have come to a close .

It is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile this year of COVID - 19 with anything but a bad dream .
As the contagion moved from Wuhan , China , to parts Occidental , the lights began to go out .
Even before the body count was beyond annual influenza proportions the unwinding of civilization had begun .
Now U.S. deaths alone are well beyond 100,000 and on their way to twice that figure .
That is a shocking figure , and several times beyond the annual influenza death toll , even as it remains unlikely to come anywhere close to the 675,000 U.S. deaths from the 1918 pandemic .
Back then a third of the world ’s population became infected , and 50 million died .
It is an easy historical finding that the modern world changed irrevocably after 1918 , as influenza worked in tandem with the brutality of a world war .
In relatively short order the world economy collapsed .
The old order passed away , replaced by dangerous new forces and dislocations with us still .
The historical parallels with the past are unnerving to those who pay attention .
For me , as no doubt for many others , there remain questions about the ominous lapses and bizarre responses in the roller coaster months of panic .
Perhaps the early assurances that masks were unnecessary was a misplaced plan to keep people calm .
But the continuing lack of general testing for all the population surely means that any figure other than a body count is misleading and that true contagion control is impossible .
It seems that we must fend for ourselves and choose healthy behavior .
Again to history , a bit further back this time .
The plague , the Black Death , which ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1351 , killed up to a third of the population .
Starvation and wars followed , as economic activity almost ceased , fields lay fallow , and the social fabric unraveled .
Why would we think it any different today if we shut down the world economy ?
Race relations in the U.S. have been a suppurating wound since the original sin of slavery , gnawed at in a civil war , salted during Reconstruction , and legally bandaged after the civil rights era— but festering still .
And only a naif would see the issue as one - dimensional .
COVID - 19 dislocations have now guaranteed some sort of radical change — but radically different in which direction ?
For a nation not so up on history beyond the Weems school , the COVID shutdown seems to have provided not only introspection but rejection of the past .
I cannot remember such a tearing down of statues in my lifetime -- only those of the shah shattered on Tehran streets and Saddam toppled by ropes and a tank - pull into the ecstatic crowd provide reference .
Yes , history is nearly always nasty , and heroes are often created by the victors ; but this repudiation of history risks toppling the larger narrative — the larger illusion .
I am afraid that the recasting / identifying of the complex heroes of the republic will end up in a repudiation of the system they ceded to us : the unique set of rules and rights that are recognized in the Constitution : a constitution aiming high enough to escape the implications of two - third personhood and the root insistence on property as happiness .
In the confusion of COVID , with its emerging social alarms , we are witness to the utter destruction of the separation of powers , the once insistence on individual rights and due process , the idea of government deriving from the people , and , most chilling to me , a diminution of true religious freedom and a substitution of what a few years ago in Italy we called Fascism ; which was careful to make an alliance with the church .
On the one hand , there was a strange comfort in the Trump administration assertions of the importance of religious freedom .
On the other a bizarre claim to Roman Catholic leaders made recently that there never in history was a better friend to the church .
I am old enough to remember the fears that a President Kennedy would lay claim to that role .
As it was , he reassured in a speech that he would never allow pope or prelate to dictate policy or compromise the separation of church and state that had long undergirded the healthy state of religious freedom in a civil governance that derived from a Reformation Protestant sensibility .
Nothing in the midst of COVID has startled me more than an odd scene out in front of the White House , played out on TV using the prop of a smallish crowd of manifestly nonviolent protestors at that point .
It was surreal to see the sudden use of flashbang grenades , tear gas , and aggressive actions by security forces that included quite direct physical attacks even on an Australian television crew .
The president , accompanied by the attorney general and a uniformed military general , then walked through the pacified area , across Lafayette Square , and on to St. John ’s Episcopal Church , where he held up a Bible for a photo op .
I do n’t need to cite the chief executive as knowingly complicit in such a travesty of religion and state power .
I can give him the best of intentions consistent with his regular statements of support for religious freedom .
But there is no escaping the larger dynamic that reveals how late in the day it is for liberal democracy and the values once so clearly espoused by a people and the government they empowered .
From the beginning of the COVID panic it was obvious that ad hoc attempts to cope were actually revealing much about the amnesiac state of our freedom psyche .
With little forethought that I can discern , authorities closed down churches as nonessential , and just as unthinkingly parishioners went home to their video games and TV religion .
With morality asleep or revealed to be somnolent , it should not surprise anyone at some of the denizens of chaos then discovered on the streets .
And with charity chained , it should not surprise anyone how quickly things devolved .
It is not very openly shared , but there is an inevitability to continuing infection .
It will take many months till the mass of the population has been exposed and either infected or proved resistant and “ herd immunity ” kicks in : and any likely immunization , as with the flu shots , will slow this process only slightly .
God bless the medical personal coping with the crisis and the researchers and pharmaceutical companies searching for answers .
Let us hope that , contrary to the end - time plagues described so specifically in the biblical book of Revelation , this one leads to introspection and prayer and the application of those higher values that were once invoked in the American experiment and still reside in the words under glass .
Lincoln E. Steed is the editor of Liberty magazine , a 200,000 circulation religious liberty journal which is distributed to political leaders , judiciary , lawyers and other thought leaders in North America .
He is additionally the host of the weekly 3ABN television show " The Liberty Insider , " and the radio program " Lifequest Liberty . "
He said NSW Health should refund patients the cost of medication to treat any infections they picked up in hospital , which is often the result of staff not adequately washing their hands , and staff should wear colour - coded uniforms to be easily identifiable .
Mr Garling , who visited 61 hospitals , took more than 1200 written submissions and heard from 628 witnesses , also said that the health system was plagued by bullying , which he said was " endemic " in hospitals .
His report said that the shortage of doctors in the public system could take years to improve and warned that 22 per cent of nurses in NSW would qualify for retirement in three years .
" To start with , a new culture needs to take root which sees the patient 's needs as the paramount central concern of the system and not the convenience of the clinicians and administrators , " the report said .
" Given the demographic changes and rising costs , it is the case that we have entered into a period of crisis for a public hospital system which has always been free and accessible to all .
We are on the brink of seeing whether the public system can survive and flourish or whether it will become a relic of better times . "
The NSW Health Minister , John Della Bosca , called it a " landmark report " that would significantly improve the way health care was delivered .
But he conceded that the system had been " stressed and stretched " .
The inquiry was begun after criticism from the Deputy State Coroner , Carl Milovanovich , who warned that systemic problems had contributed to the death of teenager Vanessa Anderson at Royal North Shore Hospital .
Vanessa , who was hit by a golf ball in 2005 , died from respiratory arrest due to the depressant effects of opiate medication after a doctor misread her chart .
The Premier , Nathan Rees , said the Government would formally respond to the Garling report by March .
Mr Rees said the report had practical and strategic suggestions that would " set the system up for the way forward " .
Mr Rees said he would support Mr Garling 's recommendation that an independent body report to Parliament on the implementation of the reforms .
However , Mr Rees said he would need advice before committing to a single health service , called NSW Kids , for newborns and children needing acute care .
Kim Oates , the professor of paediatrics and the former head of the Children 's Hospital at Westmead , welcomed the concept of a single health service as long as it was not a cost - saving measure for the Government .
Kerry Goulston , a Royal North Shore Hospital gastroenterologist and spokesman for the Hospital Reform Group , said the successful implementation of the recommendations hinged on bipartisan support and an independent , transparent body overseeing the reform .
Professor Goulston said that senior clinicians were " very confident " that Mr Garling 's report had the potential to turn the tide on the health system .
" We support 100 per cent the whole report .
We think it's an extraordinary thing , " Professor Goulston said .
The Opposition Leader , Barry O'Farrell , welcomed the report , which he said " exposed the decade - long Labor mismanagement of the state 's health system " .

Regnery Publishing , the home of such conservative stalwarts as Swift Boat Veteran John O’Neill ( who wrote Unfit for Command , which contained falsehoods about John Kerry ) and author Jerome Corsi ( who co-wrote Unfit for Command and wrote The Obama Nation , which contained falsehoods about Barack Obama ) just emailed me to promote one of their newest releases .
This time , it ’s The Politically Incorrect Guide to The Civil War , which , you guessed it , reveals how “ conventional ‘ wisdom ’ about the Civil War , slavery , and states ’ rights has been hijacked by Northeast liberals . ”
( Update : I just noticed that the book ’s cover , pictured to the right , advertises an “ Afterword by Jefferson Davis . ” )
Among the book ’s claims : “ How the Confederate States of America might have helped the Allies win World War I sooner , ” and , of course , “ How , if there had been no Civil War , the South would have abolished slavery peaceably . ”
I know it ’s probably just because I suffer from the “ liberal self - hatred that vilifies America ’s greatest heroes , ” but I find the idea of the slave states voluntarily giving up their slaves to be really , really dumb .
The Southern states seceded largely because they did n’t want to be ruled by Lincoln , who had argued against expanding slavery into new territories .
The Confederate constitution says , “ No bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed . ”
But in case you do n’t believe me , I asked retired army Lt. Colonel Robert Mackey , author of The UnCivil War and bona fide Civil War geek .
Dr. Mackey , a combat veteran who was Assistant Professor of Military History at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , says it ’s “ a heaping pile of bulls * *t ” and offers up a few reasons why :
1. Slaves represented real property value .
The South ’s biggest asset was n’t cotton , it was human beings .
That is why the Southern economy collapsed after 1865 — old Nathan Bedford Forrest himself said “ I went into the war a millionaire and came out a pauper . ”
Why ?
All his ‘ wealth ’ was in slaves .
2 . The virtual serfdom of poor whites and blacks in the South after Reconstruction .
The entire economic system , which only fell apart because of the Depression and the great migration of blacks to the North in WWI and WWII , was based on sharecropping .
Sharecropping only worked because the “ New South ” replaced antebellum planters with bankers , etc .
It was a form of slavery as well — just one in which “ the owners ” had no moral or ethical responsibility to care for the slave … since they had no ‘ property rights . ’
3 . There is zero evidence slavery would have naturally ended .
There was no antebellum abolitionist movement in the South .
On the contrary , the entire social system was set up to reinforce slavery .
Lastly , just imagine how easy it would have been for anti-labor industrialists to move factories South , where you not only did not have labor unions , but could contract for workers from their ‘ owners ’ at a set , low rate .
It would have been horror , and the death of any hope of democracy in America .
So I hope that ridiculousness has been suitably debunked .
But Civil War “ political incorrectness ” and Democratic presidential candidate bashing is n’t all Regnery publishes .
They also publish non-peer - reviewed “ science ” written by controversial authors .
In 2003 , Chris Mooney wrote in Mother Jones about John Lott , a Regnery author whose pro-gun social science came under fire :
Pressed by critics , [ Lott ] failed to produce evidence of the existence of a survey — which supposedly found that “ 98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively , they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack ” — that he claimed to have conducted in the second edition of “ More Guns , Less Crime ” .
Lott then made matters even worse by posing as a former student , “ Mary Rosh , ” and using the alias to attack his critics and defend his work online .
Lott ’s pro-gun writing for Regnery must have endeared the company to other gun-toting types , because in February , Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince signed a book deal with the company .
I look forward to the Regnery email promoting “ Blackwater ’s Politically Incorrect Guide to the Iraq War , ” or whatever they end up calling it .
( Mother Jones has covered Regnery many times before .
Last year , Debra Dickerson wrote about how some of the company ’s authors were suing their publisher for depriving them of royalties .
In 2004 , Bradford Plumer — now of The New Republic — interviewed Media Matters for America ’s David Brock on the subject of the “ Republican Noise Machine . ” Regnery comes up . )

These are the first photographs of wild okapi in Virunga National Park An African animal so secretive it was once believed to be a mythical unicorn has been caught on camera in the wild .
Camera traps set by the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) have captured rare pictures of wild okapi .
The giraffe - like mammals , which have zebra - like stripes on their rear , are under threat from the bush meat trade .
The sightings in Virunga National Park prove the species is surviving in the jungle despite years of civil conflict .
Dr Noelle Kumpel , ZSL's bush meat and forests conservation programme manager , said : " To have captured photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing .
" Okapi are very shy and rare animals - which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence . "
Okapis , which have a black tongue designed for grasping and holding , along with distinctive stripes on their behind , are the closest living relative of the giraffe .
The rare mammals , related to giraffes , have distinctive striped coats
They were unknown to the western world until the early 20th Century , but are now known to inhabit three protected areas , of which Virunga National Park is one .
Their abundance in the park is unknown as access to the forests of DRC is limited by civil conflict and poor infrastructure , making survey work difficult .
Poaching
The last official sighting in the area was nearly 50 years ago .
But a survey in 2006 by conservation group WWF found their tracks on the west bank of the Semliki River , in the park 's northern sector .
The latest pictures were taken by traps set by ZSL in conjunction with the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation ( ICCN ) .
Thierry Lusenge , a member of ZSL's DRC survey team , added : " We have already identified three individuals , and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the Virunga Park , which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts . "
In addition to the ongoing civil war , the species is under threat from poaching .
Okapi meat , reportedly from the park , is now regularly on sale in the nearby town of Beni .
The ZSL survey team has warned that if hunting continues at this rate , okapi could become extinct in the park within a few years .

What are these ?
Well , we found no cause of quarrel with the first chapter .
Here the author takes us directly to the barn - yard and the kitchen - garden .
Like an honorable rural member of our General Court , who sat silent until , near the close of a long session , a bill requiring all swine at large to wear pokes was introduced , when he claimed the privilege of addressing the house , on the proper ground that he had been " brought up among the pigs , and knew all about them , " - so we were brought up among cows and cabbages ; and the lowing of cattle , the cackling of hens , and the cooing of pigeons were sounds native and pleasant to our ears .
So " Variation under Domestication " dealt with familiar subjects in a natural way , and gently introduced " Variation under Nature , " which seemed likely enough .
Then follows " Struggle for Existence , " — a principle which we experimentally know to be true and cogent , — bringing the comfortable assurance , that man , even upon Leviathan Hobbes 's theory of society , is no worse than the rest of creation , since all Nature is at war , one species with another , and the nearer kindred the more internecine , - bringing in thousand - fold confirmation and extension of the Malthusian doctrine , that population tends far to outrun means of subsistence throughout the animal and vegetable world , and has to be kept down by sharp preventive checks ; so that not more than one of a hundred or a thousand of the individuals whose existence is so wonderfully and so sedulously provided for ever comes to anything , under ordinary circumstances ; so the lucky and the strong must prevail , and the weaker and ill - favored must perish ; — and then follows , as naturally as one sheep follows another , the chapter on " Natural Selection , " Darwin 's cheval de bataille , which is very much the Napoleonic doctrine , that Providence favors the strongest battalions , ­ that , since many more individuals are born than can possibly survive , those individuals and those variations which possess any advantage , however slight , over the rest , are in the long run sure to survive , to propagate , and to occupy the limited field , to the exclusion or destruction of the weaker brethren .
All this we pondered , and could not much object to .
In fact , we began to contract a liking for a system which at the outset illustrates the advantages of good breeding , and which makes the most " of every creature 's best . "
Could we " let by - gones be by - gones , " and , beginning now , go on improving and diversifying for the future by natural selection , — could we even take up the theory at the introduction of the actually existing species , we should be well content , and so perhaps would most naturalists be .
It is by no means difficult to believe that varieties are incipient or possible species , when we see what trouble naturalists , especially botanists , have to distinguish between them , — one regarding as a true species what another regards as a variety ; when the progress of knowledge increases , rather than diminishes , the number of doubtful instances ; and when there is less agreement than ever among naturalists as to what the basis is in Nature upon which our , idea of species reposes , or how the word is practically to be defined .
Indeed , when we consider the endless disputes of naturalists and ethnologists over the human races , as to whether they belong to one species or to more , and if to more , whether to three , or five , or fifty , we can hardly help fancying that both may be right , — or rather , that the unihumanitarians would have been right several thousand years ago , and the multihumanitarians will be a few thousand years later ; while at present the safe thing to say is , that , probably , ' there is some truth on both sides .
" Natural selection , " Darwin remarks , " leads to divergence of character ; for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure , habits , and constitution , " ( a principle which , by the way , is paralleled and illustrated by the diversification of human labor , ) and also leads to much extinction of intermediate or unimproved forms .
Now , though this divergence may " steadily tend to increase , " yet this is evidently a slow process in Nature , and liable to much counteraction wherever man does not interpose , and so not likely to ' work much harm for the future .
And if natural selection , with artificial to help it , will produce better animals and better men than the present , and fit them better to " the conditions of existence , " why , let it work , say we , to the top of its bent .
There is still room enough for improvement .
Only let us hope that it always works for good : if not , the divergent lines on Darwin 's diagram of transmutation made easy ominously show what small deviations from the straight path may come to in the end .
Growing up in a Catholic household the 1960s , my husband says that most of the living rooms he visited as a child had pictures of Jesus and JFK hanging on the wall .
As a child of the 1970s , I do n’t remember any presidential administration that inspired that kind of iconic reproduction .
Things have changed .
The stream of Barack Obama faces printed on clothing and hats since early summer festivals this year has been steady to overflowing , many using design elements that intentionally evoke Bob Marley , Che Guevara , Martin Luther King , Jr. or Malcolm X . Apparently , we like wearing our new leader , putting forward our faith in his abilities .
Meanwhile , weird art has been emerging from all corners of the Internet , putting forward its own agenda :
A lot of pundits claim that voters have unrealistic , Jesus ( or Fabio ) - like expectations of our new President .
On first view , this illustration seems to underscore that idea .
It was actually intended to poke fun at Obama supporters in Portland , Oregon this past May .
This one comes from Dan Lacey , Painter of Pancakes , who mostly paints political and celebrity figures with pancakes on their heads , although he also has some of famous figures donning jock straps , carrots and “ Minnesota ” toast ” on their noggins .
If you poke around his site , you ’ll find that there are a couple of other nude Obama with unicorn paintings , including a revision of this one with a leaner president - elect .
An Indiana man who calls himself the “ Taco Werewolf ” created a series of “ Obama Taco Underwear ” paintings .
Over the summer , when he finished his shifts at a Mexican restaurant , Mr. Werewolf would nosh on free tacos in his underwear and watch Obama speeches , which filled him with such inspiration he was moved to make these paintings .
Last but not least , here ’s a camptastic one ( pointed out to me by my mom ) , from local artist Paul Richmond .
It is available as a Giclee Print on Etsy .
More pieces , strange and mainsteam , have been dutifully catalogued on a couple of blogs : the Art of Obama and The Obama Art Report .

We ’ve been spending some quality time with the folks at AMD today in sunny Austin , TX .
The team here has been giving us a run-down on their upcoming Phenom II processor along with the enthusiast platform they ’re calling “ Dragon ” .
In short , the Dragon platform is a combination of an AMD Phenom II X4 processor , Radeon 4800 Graphics cards and an AMD 7 series chipset based motherboard .
However , today ’s discussion was keenly focused on AMD 's upcoming Phenom II X4 processor , two models of which will launch in early January that will be socket AM2 + compatible .
In addition , some time in Q1 , AMD will launch new AM3 socket Phenom II X4 processors with support for DDR3 - 1333 memory .
In the short term , ( read CES ’08 time frame release ) specifically , there will be two chips available with clock speeds starting at 2.8GHz but with a lot of headroom for future clock speed ramps as well as some heavy duty overclocking .
In addition , with the transition to 45nm fab process technology for Phenom II , AMD is claiming a 30 – 40 % power consumption reduction under full load and up to a 50 % reduction under idle conditions .
Beyond that , from a clock - for - clock performance perspective , optimizations have been made to the CPU pipeline , including improvements to branch prediction , pre-fetch mechanisms and TLB ( translation look - aside buffer ) optimizations .
In total , along with larger cache sizes ( now 512KB L2 cache per core with a 6MB L3 cache ) and higher clock speeds , AMD claims the new Phenom II X4 should offer a 30 – 40 % performance increase over all .

The National Fatwa Council ‘s non-binding edict said yoga involves not just physical exercise but also includes Hindu spiritual elements , chanting and worship .
Though the council ‘s decisions are not legally binding on Malaysia ‘s Muslim population , many abide by the edicts out of deference , and the council does have the authority to ostracize an offending Muslim from society .
Recently , the council issued an edict banning tomboys , ruling that girls who act like boys violate the tenets of Islam .
There are no figures for how many Muslims practice yoga , but many yoga classes have a sprinkling of Muslims attending .
“ I am mad !
Maybe they have it in mind that Islam is under threat .
To come out with a fatwa is an insult to intelligent Muslims .
It ‘s an insult to my belief , ” Putri told The Associated Press .

CLEVELAND , Nov. 11 ( UPI ) --
The Cleveland home of U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , was the target of paintball - wielding vandals , police records show .
The wife of the congressman and former Democratic U.S. presidential candidate told authorities that vandals , likely teenagers , had hit their home with paint balls , the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday .

The newspaper said police reports indicate Elizabeth Kucinich told officers she heard a banging noise at 1:30 a.m. last Thursday and noticed her house had been vandalized with paint balls .
She said the vandals returned again the next night and lobbed more paint balls .
Police told the newspaper they have no suspects in the case .
Purple ' super tomato ' that can fight against cancer
It looks like a cross between an orange and a black pudding , but this genetically modified purple ' super tomato ' could be the latest weapon in the fight against cancer .
The fruit , which tastes and smells like a normal red tomato , has been given two genes from a snapdragon flower that produce the dark colour .
The distinctive hue is created by antioxidant pigments that protect against diseases including cancer , heart problems and diabetes .
These plum - like tomatoes have been genetically engineered to fight cancer
British scientists behind the crop believe their purple tomato is the respectable face of genetic modification and could help convince the public of the benefits of GM food .
But critics say the potential health benefits are a distraction from the harmful environmental side effects of GM farming .
The tomato - developed by the John Innes Centre in Norwich - contains high concentrations of anthocyanins , pigments found in blackberries and cranberries .
Anthocyanins are chemicals called flavonoids which mop up potentially harmful oxygen molecules in the body .
Although they are produced naturally by tomato plants , they are normally found only in the leaves .
The scientists transferred the genes from the snapdragons using specially adapted bacteria .
Food for thought :
The tomatoes could be on sale within three years - but not in Britain
Professor Cathie Martin , who led the John Innes research - the results of which are published today in the journal Nature Biotechnology - said one tomato contained the same anthocyanins as a spoonful of cranberries .
' Most people do not eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day , ' she said .
' But they can get more benefit from those they do eat if common fruit and vegetables can be developed that are higher in nutrients . '
The scientists found that mice bred to be vulnerable to cancer lived longer when fed the GM tomatoes .
They now hope to test the effects on men at risk of prostate cancer .
Dr Lara Bennett , of Cancer Research UK , said : ' It 's exciting to see new techniques that could make healthy foods even better for us . '
But critics warn that genetic modification is tied in with factory farming methods that harm communities - and that any seeds from a GM tomato could produce unexpected effects on the environment .
Friends of the Earth said : ' GM crops cannot be deemed a " healthy " option . '
Sure , downloading songs and movies is easy these days ( even when done legally ) , but what if you do n't have a computer or internet connection ?
" How would I be reading this post , then ? " you might ask .
Fair point , but there must be dozens of other people out there with portable media players yet no way to fill them , and for this market Sony and Universal have partnered to create POP , the " instant entertainment 24/7 " vending machine hitting the UK this holiday season .
Unlike other boxes that sell media players , this one sells content to fill them , downloaded straight to a memory card , flash drive , PMP , or other ( USB - supporting ) portable device .
You can also purchase media - based content on DVD and Blu-ray if you like , games too , all of which " pop " out shrink wrapped and in full retail garb .
Being able to buy a Blu-ray disc at midnight on a dark corner sounds mildly interesting , but with no mention of file formats or DRM or anything else , you wo n't find us sticking our memory cards into this thing 's slots anytime soon .
Stacy Elizabeth Beshear is Luke Walton 's Stalker
of El Segundo , was arrested on September 18 for pulling up to Los Angeles Lakers Forward 's car and pretending to fire gunshots at him with her hand , according to police Sgt . .
The incident was witnessed by fellow Lakers teammate
The 34 year old appeared in Torrence Superior Court on September 22nd and pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor count of stalking and will stand trial on November 6 , 2008 .
A spokeswoman for the district attorney , Jane Robison said that if convicted , Beshear could spend up to a year in the county jail and face a fine of $ 1,000 .
Walter claims that he has been harassed by Beshear beginning in November and December 2007 .
She was in the habit of waiting outside his Manhattan Beach home repeatedly asking him to sign basketballs after he had already done so .
When he refused , she retaliated by writing on his car with a Sharpie marker .
He had this to say :
" When she pulled up to my house and started yelling at me after she fired a fake gun at me , I could n't help but to start yelling back at her .
She was in my driveway .
But when we were interacting , I could tell by the stuff she was saying that she 's not all there in the head - which makes me feel bad for her .
At the same time , most people who go on killing sprees are people who are n't all there in the head . "
Walton is the son of former NBA great Bill Walton .
He played center for the Portland Trail Blazers , San Diego / LA Clippers and Boston Celtics .

In our special report on the election we analyse the two candidates ’ economic plans .
Here , we ask professional economists to give us their views
Illustration by S. Kambayashi
AS THE financial crisis pushes the economy back to the top of voters ' concerns , Barack Obama is starting to open up a clear lead over John McCain in the opinion polls .
But among those who study economics for a living , Mr Obama 's lead is much more commanding .
A survey of academic economists by The Economist finds the majority — at times by overwhelming margins — believe Mr Obama has the superior economic plan , a firmer grasp of economics and will appoint better economic advisers .
Our survey is not , by any means , a scientific poll of all economists .
We e-mailed a questionnaire to 683 research associates , all we could track down , of the National Bureau of Economic Research , America 's premier association of applied academic economists , though the NBER itself played no role in the survey .
A total of 142 responded , of whom 46 % identified themselves as Democrats , 10 % as Republicans and 44 % as neither .
This skewed party breakdown may reflect academia 's Democratic tilt , or possibly Democrats ' greater propensity to respond .
Still , even if we exclude respondents with a party identification , Mr Obama retains a strong edge — though the McCain campaign should be buoyed by the fact that 530 economists have signed a statement endorsing his plans .
Does their opinion matter ?
Economics is just one of the many things the next president will have to worry about ; voters still seem to prefer Mr McCain on foreign policy .
And even on the economy , economists may not have the same priorities as the population at large .
Arguably , what a president says about economics on the campaign trail is less important than how he responds to the unexpected challenges that inevitably arise once he is in office .
Yet economists ' opinions should count for something because irrespective of any party affiliation , most of them approach policy decisions with the same basic tool kit .
Their assessment of the candidates ' economic credentials and plans represents an informed judgment on how well they will handle difficult trade - offs between efficiency , equity , growth and consensus - building .
Regardless of party affiliation , our respondents generally agree the economy is in bad shape , that the election is important to the course of economic policy and that the housing and financial crisis is the most critical economic issue facing America .
The detailed responses are bad news for Mr McCain ( the full data are available here ) .
Eighty per cent of respondents and no fewer than 71 % of those who do not cleave to either main party say Mr Obama has a better grasp of economics .
Even among Republicans Mr Obama has the edge : 46 % versus 23 % say Mr Obama has the better grasp of the subject .
“ I take McCain 's word on this one , ” comments James Harrigan at the University of Virginia , a reference to Mr McCain 's infamous confession that he does not know as much about economics as he should .
In fairness , Mr McCain 's lower grade may in part reflect greater candour about his weaknesses .
Mr Obama 's more tightly managed image leaves fewer opportunities for such unvarnished introspection .
A candidate 's economic expertise may matter rather less if he surrounds himself with clever advisers .
Unfortunately for Mr McCain , 81 % of all respondents reckon Mr Obama is more likely to do that ; among unaffiliated respondents , 71 % say so .
That is despite praise across party lines for the excellent Doug Holtz - Eakin , Mr McCain 's most prominent economic adviser and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office .
“ Although I have tended to vote Republican , ” one reply says , “ the Democrats have a deep pool of talented , moderate economists . ”
There is an apparent contradiction between most economists ' support for free trade , low taxes and less intervention in the market and the low marks many give to Mr McCain , who is generally more supportive of those things than Mr Obama .
It probably reflects a perception that the Republican Party under George Bush has subverted many of those ideals for ideology and political gain .
Indeed , the majority of respondents rate Mr Bush 's economic record as very bad , and Republican respondents are only slightly less critical .
“ John McCain has professed disdain for ‘ so - called economists ' , and for some the feeling has become mutual , ” says Erik Brynjolfsson , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management .
“ Obama 's team is mainstream and non-ideological but extremely talented . ”
On our one - to - five scale , economists on average give Mr Obama 's economic programme a 3.3 and Mr McCain 's a 2.2 .
Mr Obama , says Jonathan Parker , a non-aligned professor at Northwestern 's Kellogg School of Management , “ is a pragmatist not an ideologue .
I expect Clintonian economic policies . ”
If , that is , crushing federal debt does not derail his taxing and spending plans .
On his plans to fix the financial crisis , Mr Obama averages 3.1 , a point higher than Mr McCain .
Still , some said they did n't quite know what they were rating — reasonably enough , since neither candidate has produced clear plans of his own .
Where the candidates ' positions are more clearly articulated , Mr Obama scores better on nearly every issue : promoting fiscal discipline , energy policy , reducing the number of people without health insurance , controlling health - care costs , reforming financial regulation and boosting long - run economic growth .
Twice as many economists think Mr McCain 's plan would be bad or very bad for long - run growth as Mr Obama's .
Given how much focus
Mr McCain has put on his plan 's benefits for growth , this last is quite a repudiation .
Mr McCain gets his highest mark , an average of 3.5 and a clear advantage over Mr Obama , for his position on free trade and globalisation .
If Mr Obama “ would wake up on free trade ” , one respondent says , “ I could get behind the plans much more . ”
Perhaps surprisingly , the economists rated trade low in priority compared with the other issues listed .
Only 53 % say it is important or very important .
Neither candidate scored at all well on dealing with the burgeoning cost of entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security .
The economists also prefer Mr Obama 's tax plans .
Republicans and respondents who do not identify with either political party see Mr McCain 's tax policies as more efficient but less equitable .
But the former prefer Mr McCain 's plans — 43 % of Republicans say they are good or very good — and the latter Mr Obama's .
Of non-affiliated respondents , 31 % say Mr Obama 's are good or very good .
Either way , according to the economists , it would be difficult to do much worse than George Bush .
The respondents give Mr Bush a dismal average of 1.7 on our five - point scale for his economic management .
Eighty - two per cent thought Mr Bush 's record was bad or very bad ; only 1 % thought it was very good .
The Democrats were overwhelmingly negative , but nearly every respondent viewed Mr Bush 's record unfavourably .
Half of Republican respondents thought Mr Bush deserves only a 2 .
“ The minimum rating of one severely overestimates the quality of Bush 's economic policies , ” says one non-aligned economist .
This is the fourth presidential election in which The Economist has surveyed economists on the candidates and their plans .
Responses , anonymous except where requested , were received between September 18th and 30th .

With Jimmy Carter it was the teeth , big , straight and white as a set of country palings .
With Richard Nixon it was the eyebrows , surely brooding on Hell .
Abe Lincoln had the ears ( and the beard , and the stove - pipe hat ) ; Bill Clinton had a nose that glowed red , almost to luminousness , as his allergies assailed him .
But George Bush 's most extraordinary feature was his nostrils , and they will be missed .
It is not just that they were large , and lent his face a certain simian charm .
They were also uncontrollable .
When the rest of the presidential body was encased in a sober suit , and the rest of the presidential face had assumed an expression appropriate to taking the oath of office , or rescuing banks , or declaring to terrorists that they could run but they could n't hide , the nostrils would suddenly flare and smirk , as if Mr Bush was about to burst out with something outrageous or obscene , or flash a high - five , or hail his deputy chief of staff as “ Turd blossom ” .
Occasionally , a real gaffe was about to emerge .
Watched closely , the nostrils no doubt gave advance warning of the moment when , addressing the Pentagon 's top brass , Mr Bush said : “ Our enemies ... never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people , and neither do we . ”
More often , nothing exceptional was on the way to being said .
But the nostrils ran ahead , twitching like a bull in a rodeo or a frisking wild horse , hinting at danger to come .
When he was debating with Al Gore in 2000 , Mr Bush 's language was polite and the policy statements well coined , but the nostrils declared they could n't take the whole thing seriously .
With hindsight , when the 2000 election became the closest ever , the Florida shenanigans seemed prefigured in that sniggering expression , which less became the 43rd president than Alfred E. Neumann of Mad magazine .
Being bigger and better than most people 's , the presidential nostrils were also more acute .
They could sniff out WMD in Iraq as snappily as hot dogs at a football game , though it took the UN many years to come up with nothing .
Yellow - cake uranium could be nosed as far away as Niger , and Saddam Hussein 's connections to al - Qaeda were as odorous as a Texas feedlot .
The nostrils could smell victory , too , especially on that morning in May 2003 when , standing on an aircraft - carrier with “ Mission Accomplished ” fluttering on a banner behind him , Mr Bush breathed in the tang of the ocean and of power .
The nostrils ran ahead , twitching like a bull in a rodeo or a frisking wild horse , hinting at danger to come
Much else alerted those nostrils when others were indifferent .
Oil , for example , even when buried under hundreds of feet of environmentally protected Arctic tundra .
Cheese , as eaten by the feckless French and other effete gastronomes of old Europe .
Red meat , when demanded by the right - wing base which so often found this president disappointing , in the form of tax cuts and suspended regulations .
And danger , as personified by suspicious individuals from faraway countries , whose proper place was to be in orange pyjamas at Guantánamo Bay , well out of reach of a lawyer .
An aroma of pork
Disloyalty , or the whiff of it , set off a particular quivering .
When Paul O'Neill , Mr Bush 's ex-treasury secretary , revealed that Saddam had been targeted from day one of Mr Bush 's first term , and when Scott McClellan , his former press secretary , wrote that the Bush White House lacked both candour and competence , the nostrils assumed an air of outraged innocence : the same look , in fact , they had assumed on the worst day of Mr Bush 's presidency , when an aide leaned down to tell him of the attack on the twin towers and the president , busy reading “ The Pet Goat ” to a class of Florida children , could not for a moment engage either his brain or his mouth to take the news .
All the stranger , therefore , that the noble orifices had their shortcomings .
They could not smell the putrid mud that covered the ninth ward of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina passed , or the stink of subprime mortgages leaching their poison into the financial system .
They found nothing especially noisesome about the presence of Dick Cheney and his oilman cronies in charge of the national energy task - force .
Sensitive as they were , they were unimpressed by levels of arsenic in drinking water or particulates in the air .
And though Mr Bush had sold himself as a lean - spending , small - government man , they could not resist the aroma of a trillion - dollar budget stuffed with choicest pork .
Most curiously , they failed to detect the poisonous atmosphere that swirled around him abroad .
Granted , the most revolting protesters were kept away .
But even so the nostrils , proudly set even when the eyes blinked and the mouth pursed and wavered , maintained an extraordinary belief in the wisdom of the president and the rightness of his cause .
One day the rest of the world would wake up and be grateful .
One day the Bush administration would come up smelling like a rose .

HMM tutorials
News !
The final tutorial session has been rescheduled for Wednesday 2 June at the same time in the same place , 11:00 - 12:30 in 40 b - AB - 05 ( CVSSP seminar room ) .
Hidden Markov Model tutorial sessions
Overview
The purpose of this series of tutorials is to introduce the principles of hidden Markov models in a way that can be applied to many kinds of pattern recognition problem .
It is aimed at PhD students , research fellows and academics in the CVSSP group , but other researchers are welcome to attend .
The three main elements involve :
calculating the probability of a given path through the model 's states , finding the optimum state sequence for a set of observations , and estimating the model 's parameters during training .

Preparation
None needed , unless you 've missed the earlier sessions ( in which case you should read through the slides ) .
If you are interested in doing some background reading , I would recommend Rabiner 's tutorial article :
L.R. Rabiner .
" A tutorial on HMM and selected applications in speech recognition " .
In Proc. IEEE , Vol. 77 , No. 2 , pp. 257-286 , Feb. 1989 .
Tutorial 1 : Introduction to Markov models and HMMs
The first session will provide a basic probabilistic framework and mathematical notation for describing finite - state models , which will introduce the Markov model and the hidden Markov model .
Tutorial 2 : Likelihood calculation and Viterbi decoding
Using the HMM framework , we will look at how to calculate the probability of a given path through the model 's states , and hence find the optimal path to explain a set of observations .
I will show how the Viterbi algorithm computes a good approximation to the best path efficiently , which can thus be used for decoding .
Tutorial 3 : Maximum likelihood re-estimation
The third key element shows us how to set the model 's parameters .
From some initial values , the parameters are updated by an Expectation Maximisation process , called Baum - Welch re-estimation .
This will be presented first for discrete observations .
Tutorial 4 : Output probability distribution functions
The fourth session will present the corresponding results for continuous observations , beginning with a simple Gaussian probability distribution and building up towards multivariate Gaussian mixtures .
Tutorial 5 : Extensions and applications
Having presented one particular kind of technique , the hidden Markov model , there are a number of extensions that will be discussed which have been developed to overcome one or other of its limitations .
Although I 'll use examples throughout the tutorials to illustrate how the algorithms work , the final session will show a couple of longer worked examples .
Maybe you 'll have tried out a little example yourself by then that you could share with the group !

The UN food agency says it has had to start cutting rations to 4 m people in Zimbabwe because of a lack of funds .
The World Food Programme said it had had no response to its October appeal for $ 140 m ( £ 91 m ) to feed Zimbabwe .
Food could run out entirely by January unless fresh support is provided , the WFP warned , as it takes six weeks for supplies to reach rural areas .
Up to half the 10 m population may need food before the next harvest is expected in April , the agency said .
The WFP said it had cut each person 's monthly cereal ration to 10kg ( 22lb ) from 12kg , and the pulse ration to 1 kg from 1.8 kg , to make current stocks last longer .

WFP spokesman Richard Lee warned that the situation would become " critical " in many parts of the country in the coming months .
" We 're already hearing stories about families living on at most one meal a day , children going into the bush to search for wild food and wild fruit , " Mr Lee told the BBC 's Focus on Africa programme .
" It 's a very serious situation and we 're still four - and - a - half months away from the next harvest . "
The WFP fed 2 m people in October , the first month of a large - scale aid project , but the figure is expected to rise to 5.1 m by early 2009 .
Farms seized
Once hailed as a model economy and a regional breadbasket , Zimbabwe 's fortunes have nosedived since 2000 when President Robert Mugabe seized white - owned farms and handed them over to landless blacks with little experience in farming .
We are seeing large numbers of people across the country who simply cannot access enough food for themselves and their families
Richard Lee
WFP spokesman
Zimbabwe 's hunger pains Mr Lee said drought and inadequate farming inputs were also to blame .
" Large numbers of people in rural areas harvested little , or nothing , this year because of a drought , because of a lack of seed , because of a lack of fertiliser and other inputs , " he said .
Mr Lee said Zimbabweans in the towns as well as the countryside were experiencing problems .
" The economic collapse in Zimbabwe has affected people across the country , and also in urban areas , so we are seeing large numbers of people across the country who simply cannot access enough food for themselves and their families , and require international assistance to see them through to the next harvest in April 2009 . "
Inflation
The country is also hit with inflation running at a staggering 231,000,000 % , and a breakdown in basic services has led to deadly outbreaks of cholera in the capital Harare .
Western nations have said they are ready to release hundreds of millions of dollars in aid , but not while Mr Mugabe retains his grip on power .
Mr Mugabe and Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , have agreed to form a unity government to revive the economy , but they cannot decide how to share out cabinet posts .
Last weekend , Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , warned that at least one million people could starve to death in a year if the political deadlock continues .

Yesterday in Fannie , Freddie Commit to Waste $ 40 Billion a Month Taxpayer Money I talked about the chain reaction of guarantees .
Ireland guaranteed bank deposits putting Germany and the UK at a disadvantage .
After criticizing Ireland , Germany did the same .
The UK stepped in to guarantee bonds so now Germany and the US are at a competitive disadvantage .
Am I the only one who sees how absurd his is ?
Is the final ending point , the government of every nation guaranteeing everything ?
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said Sunday the government will guarantee all bank deposits for a period of three years .
From Sunday , the government will also guarantee all term wholesale funding by Australian banks operating in international credit markets " to make sure they have the best possible access to global capital , " Mr. Rudd said .
The New Zealand government followed Mr. Rudd 's announcement by introducing a bank deposit guarantee program as both countries sought safeguards against turbulence in global credit markets .
The EU and UK get into the Guarantee Business .
" I want Europe to speak with one voice for Europe and for the world because this is a global crisis , " French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters as he greeted European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso at the Elysee Palace in Paris .
Sarkozy said he 's seeking " an ambitious , coordinated plan . "
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , whose government earlier this month rejected French suggestions to form a joint bank - rescue fund , said yesterday the euro region will implement " the same toolbox of instruments . "
Merkel , Sarkozy and their counterparts in the 15 - nation euro region are being forced to shift stance as a deepening slide in financial markets has threatened to tip Europe into a prolonged recession .
The 15 euro countries may agree to guarantee interbank loans of as long as five years to break the credit - market freeze , according to a draft statement cited by Agence France - Presse .
Luxembourg 's Jean - Claude Juncker , who heads the Eurogroup of euro-region finance ministers , said in a statement today that " no financial institution of systemic importance " can be allowed to fail .
Brown 's government has also proposed guaranteeing loans between banks to thaw money markets .
The G - 7 refrained from endorsing the approach two days ago .
The U.K. leader may renew his push today .
The U.K. plans to recapitalize its biggest banks including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and provide 250 billion pounds of bank loan guarantees .
Draft Statement : Europe Guarantees Bank Debt
Countries that use the euro will temporarily guarantee future bank debt to encourage lending and ease the credit crunch , according to a draft statement under discussion by European leaders Sunday .
The declaration says the governments would guarantee " for an interim period and on appropriate commercial terms " new debt issued by banks for up to five years .
" This scheme would be limited in amount , temporary and will be applied under close scrutiny of financial authorities until Dec. 31 , 2009 , " it says .
The leaders of the 15 euro - zone nations held an emergency summit Sunday night in Paris to seek European solutions to the financial crisis engulfing markets worldwide .
The meltdown dominated summits around the world this weekend .
The statement also says that one way governments could save banks would include buying big stakes .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who met with France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy before the euro summit , said the plan " would involve not only more cash in the financial market but also a recapitalization of our banking system .
" And allied to that -- something that I believe is absolutely crucial -- to begin again the funding of businesses and mortgages with a guarantee given by governments .
That can happen and will happen in the next few months , " he told reporters .

Worthless Guarantees and Printing Presses
As October came to a spectacular end , the housing market is still in severe distress .
You would think that all the massive government intervention would at least do something in regards to stabilizing prices but unfortunately for Uncle Sam , prices are determined by local area incomes and fundamental factors .
The massive economic intervention which has taken the form of billions in capital injections to banks has yet to see massive purchases of toxic mortgages .
You may be asking yourself like the diligent citizen that you are , what are some local area factors in determining household prices :
( a) Household incomes
( b) Neighborhood safety
( c ) Schools
(d) Employment outlook
When you look at the above 4 items , you quickly realize that the government intervention does nothing to address any of these .
First , pumping money into banks will not increase the household income of families .
Next , neighborhood safety or quality of life issues will have minimum impacts based on this massive bailout .
Many schools derive their income from local property taxes so a declining market hurts their budgets .
And finally , the market intervention does nothing to the overall employment outlook unless you are one of the few banks that can go to the U.S. Treasury and get a government sponsored corporate welfare check .
Banks are hoarding the money because in order for them to make loans , they need a qualified populace .
The government can scream all they want but responsible lenders , the few that are out there do n’t want to give money with no standards and return to the genesis of this economic crisis .
One of the new measures is massive loan modifications .
But in the world of unintended consequences , many borrowers do n’t want their loans modified !
Why ?
It is hard to determine how many people bought homes with the idea they were going to flip the property for a nice sum of cash .
They may have no intention of staying in the place .
IndyMac Bank , now under the auspices of the FDIC is trying a massive loan modification program .
There ’s only one significant catch .
People are n’t responding !
Bwahahaha !
“( L.A. Times )
But of the 35,000 seriously delinquent IndyMac customers who were sent letters about the possibility of such modifications , more than half have yet to be heard from , officials said this week . ”
And this is n’t for lack of incentives either :
( a) Reducing the borrower ’s interest rate to 3 % .
( b) Extending the loan terms to 40 years .
( c) Waive a portion of the interest on the mortgage .
Where do I sign up ?
I ’d like to put some my investment properties under these terms .
Unfortunately , I pay on time and have not been late so I guess that excludes me .
If you own your home and pay on time , would n’t you like similar terms to the above ?
Those numbers look like a beautiful coastal sunset yet some people have their eyes closed .
Yet the government is saying sorry , you are prudent and responsible and unlike aspiring flippers or Wall Street gamblers you did not take unwarranted risks therefore you get to sit back and watch your money be squandered .
Therein lies the rub .
The government is operating under the impression that people will “ do the right thing ” and fight to stay in their homes .
However , many of these people flat out lied on their loan applications with the help of mortgage lenders , both complicit to varying degrees , and entered into the deal together .
Even back on June 1st of 2007 I reported that there was a survey that found that 50 % of stated income loans had incomes with 50 % or more of their household income inflated .
This had nothing to do with some government mandate forcing poor people to buy homes .
This in fact was greed on many levels .
Therefore , you have a massive amount of no documentation loans that from day one started on false pretenses and included both poor and rich alike .
If the loan started out on a massive lie , who is to say what the intention of these folks is ?
Maybe the borrower was a suburban couple who watched too much HGTV and thought they could flip a home .
Heck , each week we saw a new group of aspiring flippers on shows like Flip this House and most of the time they were middle to upper class folks .
If they got in way over their heads , why would they want to stay in that home even on generous terms ?
You also have to think like a shady person .
Lying on a mortgage application is flat out fraud .
Now , IndyMac
Bank which is under the FDIC , a government backed institution is trying to get a hold of you shady borrower .
You know you lied and committed fraud and now you ’re getting a government letter ?
Hmmm , guess how a few of the borrowers are going to respond ?
They ’d rather let the home foreclose and be gone .
The government ’s premise is that fraud is n’t as rampant as I think it is .
After all , much of the fraud can only be seen after the fact .
That is why it is fraud !
There is n’t a housing fraud data bureau .
Yet anyone with an ounce of common sense could see what was going on .
Especially in places like California where IndyMac made a large amount of loans fraud was the case and not the exception .
In this article , we are going to look at 7 of the hardest hit areas in the country and also give you 7 home examples that put this housing bubble into a nationwide perspective .
Some readers think that only California and Florida had delusional and greedy people .
Too bad greed is a global human vice .
Today we salute you America with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
A Real Country of Genius
First , we will be going by the Case - Shiller metro areas .
This monthly report is one of the most widely used housing health indicators since it tracks same home sales over a period of time .
Unlike most reports that look at monthly sales and then the current monthly price , this report tracks the same home over time .
Some have been critiquing the median prices as an overall indicator of market health but even looking at other measures , the housing market is very unhealthy and in need of help .
Let us look at an excellent graph put together by Calculated Risk :
* Source : Calculated Risk
From this list , we will be looking at the following areas :
(1) Phoenix Arizona
(2) Las Vegas
(3) Miami
(4) San Diego
(5) Los Angeles
(6) San Francisco
(7) Detroit
It is stunning to see that the top 5 declining areas have seen prices decline from their peak by over 30 % and in 2 cases , by over 35 % .
All 7 areas above have seen prices decline by 25 % .
Let us now look at each individual area and give you an example of what kind of insanity took place during the height of the housing bubble .
Area # 1 – Phoenix , Arizona
Decline from peak : - 36.3 %
Peak reached on : June 2006
Peak sale price on home : June 2005 for $ 340,000
Current list price : $ 189,900
Phoenix Arizona is the epitome of the housing bubble .
Builder after builder erected enormous McMansions thinking this housing bubble would last forever .
In few other states can you find this many oversized McMansions that are selling now at fire sale prices .
The Inland Empire in Southern California is a touch of Arizona for those who never ventured out of the state .
The above home was built in 2004 , has 4 bedrooms and 2 baths , sits on 2,190 square feet and as you can see from the picture is a good sized home .
This home is currently foreclosed and selling 44 % below the peak price .
Only one small and tiny problem .
The employment situation in Phoenix is poor .
This of course is dragging the housing market down while many McMansions sit empty .
Prices are coming down hard and until the fundamental factors improve , this will continue to be the case .
Area # 2 – Las Vegas , Nevada
Decline from peak : - 35.8 %
Peak reached on : August 2006
Peak sale price on home : October 2006 for $ 315,000
Current list price : $ 172,900
Las Vegas , the neighbor of Arizona always has a flavor for the get rich quick dream .
Why keep gambling inside of air conditioned casinos when you can easily gamble on McMansions galore ?
Many people left the penny slots to go flipping in sin city .
The above home has 4 bedrooms , 2 baths , and sits on 1,890 square feet .
Built in 2004 ( see a pattern here ) this is a nice place .
But again , the major caveat is employment !
The local household income is $ 67,000 so the peak price of $ 315,000 never ever made any sense .
It put the home to income ratio at 4.7 .
The current income to home price ratio is now at 2.5 which makes a bit more sense .
As I discussed previously , the simple equation in determining a suitable price for a home that you can afford is :
I ’d like to point out that the equation above should reflect the actual mortgage balance .
That is , do not get a home loan that is more than 3 times your income .
So if that is the case , is the home above a deal ?
Doubtful .
You need to remember that we are now working in reality and we have to go with things beyond the price .
The economy in Las Vegas is n’t exactly booming .
Energy costs are still high and you have to factor that in since AC will cost you a good sum for over half the year .
What we are now coming to realize is that buying a home requires a patient and thoughtful process .
This in fact is the biggest purchase most people will ever make .
Area # 3 – Miami , Florida
Decline from peak : - 34.6 %
Peak reached on : December 2006
Peak sale price : March 2006 for $ 165,000
Current list price : $ 29,900
This my friends , is the biggest single percent price decline I have seen on any home .
The price decline from the peak is a stunning 81.8 % !
Where the Phoenix and Las Vegas homes were nice McMansions in the middle of the desert , here we have a true Real Home of Genius in Miami .
If you think someone made one delusional move in paying that peak price just look at the sales history :
03/25/2006 : $ 165,000
12/29/2003 : $ 113,000
11/07/2003 : $ 74,000
This home is a 3 bedroom and 1 bath home .
It is 1,174 square feet and features the new patented Garbage Can 2.0 photography :
The household income of the area is slightly over $ 30,000 so the current price may or may not be a bargain depending if safety and good schools are a concern for you .
As an investor , who knows how the vacancy rates are in this area .
3 times this home sold at inflated prices and there was no justification for those $ 100,000 + sales .
Florida and California had shacks selling for absurd prices as well .
Are n’t you happy that your tax dollars are going to bailout lenders that actually gave out money on these places ?
The next 3 areas are all in the sunny state of California .
Area # 4 – San Diego , Calfiornia
Decline from peak : - 32.7 %
Peak reached on : November 2005
Peak sale price : April 2007 for $ 430,000
Current list price : $ 199,900
When this housing market reaches a bottom in the long future ( California wo n’t see a bottom until May of 2011 and I ’ll give you 10 reasons ) the nominal amount of money lost will come disproportionately high from one state , California .
People bought up homes in the inner city , outer city , the valley , mountains , and anywhere with a California address .
It was complete and utter insanity reminiscent of the 1920s Florida housing bubble that included trustworthy characters like Charles Ponzi who sold “ prime Florida property . ”
Where have we heard that language before ?
This home is located in Chula Vista , a city in San Diego County .
San Diego was one of the first counties to reach a price peak .
It was the canary in the coalmine .
This home above is down an eye popping and gut busting 53 % in slightly over a year but this is n’t uncommon given that the entire region is down nearly 40 % from the peak reached last year .
This home has 4 bedrooms and 2 baths and is 1,508 square feet .
Built in 1953 , it is actually newer since some homes in California were built during the Great Depression .
It has been on the MLS for 96 days even after having the price reduced to this level .
Why ?
Well the average household income in the area makes $ 60,000 so the recent price reduction on 10 / 20 may cause some eyes to look here since it puts it near that 3 times income ratio .
Yet this house needs work :
You ’ll have to factor in whether you want to spend the time to get this place ready to go .
And that is another minor item .
During the boom , it was n’t uncommon for banks to also give you additional funds for you to fix a place up .
If the bank did n’t help just take a cash advance on your credit card .
Now , let us say a home will require an additional $ 20,000 in work you will need that plus a 10 to 15 percent down payment .
Even with these slight standards , the market is drying up .
People are broke .
That is why they needed easy credit in the first place !
Area # 5 – Los Angeles , California
Decline from peak : - 30.9 %
Peak reached on : September 2006
Peak sale price : December 2005 for $ 305,500
Current list price : $ 85,000
I ’ve been hearing some absurd pundits blaming lower income folks for causing this economic calamity .
What a shock that they do n’t blame lenders who were “ professionals ” and had a fiduciary responsibility for making boneheaded loans .
Last time I checked , lower income families were n’t investing in credit default swaps or jumping into high yield bonds .
This is a red herring and a distraction .
In fact , who cares if lenders made bad loans in these areas right ?
I would n’t care if say , IndyMac Bank , wanted to make loans to people with no ability to ever repay them .
I do care when the government ( aka you ) gets involved to bail them out .
That is then a major issue .
That is why I am adamant that many lenders should still fail or be forced to write down mortgages to current appraised values if they want government help .
If it forces some institutions to collapse , so be it .
They never belonged here anyways .
Some are also wanting to blame Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for this entire mess .
They miss one tiny fact however .
They were n’t the biggest players in the toxic market !
As of November 2007 , Fannie Mae had $ 57.9 billion in subprime loans .
Not a small number at all .
As of 2006 , $ 600 billion in subprime loans were originated .
These were originated by many aggressive mortgage outfits like New Century Financial , Countrywide , and Ameriquest trying to satisfy the appetite of Wall Street firms looking for mortgage backed securities and a method of allowing side bets in derivatives based on the housing market .
Plus , you have an even larger Alt - A market that catered to middle / upper class candidates who frankly , decided to speculate in the market .
The credit default swap market is over $ 50 trillion in value .
There are over $ 10 trillion in residential mortgages in the United States .
Let us blame the approximately $ 1 trillion subprime market ( much of which has already foreclosed ) for all the ills of our economy .
This above home is truly a Real Home of Genius .
Whichever lender made this loan should be banned from the government TARP program .
This home is 756 square feet with 2 bedrooms and 1 bath .
From the peak sale price this home is now down 72.1 % .
This home is located in Compton and I put together a montage of the current foreclosed homes on the market :
( click for a clearer picture )
California was truly a wonderland for this decade .
Area # 6 – San Francisco , California
Decline from peak : - 30.6 %
Peak reached on : May 2006
Peak sale price : April 2004 for $ 400,000
Current list price : $ 214,900
It is hard to imagine an area that had a bigger housing bubble than Southern California but leave it to our neighbors in Northern California to beat us out .
Our next home takes us to East Palo Alto .
For those of you from the area , you will know that unlike Palo Alto , the east side does n’t carry a heavy premium .
This 760 square foot home with 2 beds and 1 bath sold at the peak price of $ 400,000 .
The current list price is at $ 214,900 .
As you can see it is n’t hard to find homes in California that are 50 % or more off from their peak sale price .
Only time will tell if we are approaching a bottom but from my assessment and looking at fundamental market conditions , we have a few years before hitting a trough .
Doubt it ?
Take a long and hard look at these homes once more .
Area # 7 – Detroit , Michigan
Decline from peak : - 27.2 %
Peak reached on : December 2005
Peak sale price : March 2007 for $ 65,000
Current list price : $ 100
Okay , it only took me a few hours to find a larger percent decline than our Miami home .
This above “ home ” is now off 99.8 % off its peak value !
It is practically being given away .
Detroit is actually facing a fundamental collapse in their economy .
This has more to do not with bubble prices but simply a purely economic driven price decline .
If you need any more convincing this is a good deal :
I ’m not exactly counting 4 bedrooms here .
What are you going to do with this ?
It is going to cost you a ton of cash to knock the place down .
You have taxes as well .
What about the rental market ( if there is one ) here ?
I ’d like to see some of the HGTV folks be sent here on a boot camp 2 month mission to see what they can do with this place .
I doubt granite counter tops would do the thing here .
This is a global problem .
You have now seen 7 major areas and homes that sold for absurd prices .
Sometimes it helps to put a face to the actual problem .
Hopefully this will solidify how bad an idea it is for this bailout to pay face value for any mortgages .
Transparency is going to be so vital that money is n’t squandered into the abyss .
If this were a crime case ( which it may become ) these examples would probably convince the jury to sentence many lenders to a lethal injection of no-capital .
Today we salute you America with our Real Home of Genius Award .

How could the man who ' raped ' me be cleared because he was sleepwalking ?
A rape victim has hit out at the law after the man accused of attacking her was cleared because he was sleepwalking .
Jane McKenna , 33 , was asleep at home when a friend 's husband , who had been a guest at a barbecue , walked into the bedroom and started having sex with her .
Jason Jeal , a 37 - year - old roofer with no medical history of sleepwalking , admitted sex had taken place .
But he was cleared of rape after he insisted he had been asleep and had no idea what he was doing .
Victim : Jane McKenna has waives her anonymity but chose to pose like this because she does not want her face to become widely recognisable
Mrs McKenna , a middle - class mother of one whose husband holds a respectable full - time position , said the acquittal in June had left her feeling ' shocked and degraded ' .
Last night , she waived her right to anonymity to highlight her concern that attackers will increasingly use the defence that they were asleep .
She has already gained the support of MPs and campaigners who argue the sleepwalking defence ' defies common sense ' .
Speaking at her smartly - decorated terraced home in Hampshire , she said : ' When I found out this man had been acquitted , I cried my heart out and my husband was devastated .
' It is something that has taken away my dignity .
I am married and I believe that when you get married you stay faithful .
' Someone has come along and stolen something that is so important to me and it has made it difficult for me to be me , and it has made it difficult for me to have a proper relationship with my husband .
I feel angry and hurt about that .
' I could find only a handful of cases similar to mine , but I want to know what the true figures are .
I want to speak up for other women , I want women to come forward if this has happened to them , and I want a change in the law to stop this happening again . '
Mrs McKenna 's ordeal took place in July last year after she and her husband invited Hayley Jeal , at the time a close friend of Mrs McKenna , and her husband to a barbecue .
During the evening , Mrs Jeal had an argument with her husband and went home .
The McKennas then went to bed , leaving Mr Jeal asleep on the sofa downstairs .
Mrs McKenna fell asleep in the same room as her nine - year - old daughter after trying to settle her .
Some time later Mrs McKenna , a deep sleeper , was woken by her daughter who had noticed Mr Jeal 's body hovering above her mother , and was then horrified to realise the assault was taking place .
' I was sleeping on my front and I was very confused and thought , what is my husband doing ? ' she said .
' He was wearing my husband 's jumper which he had borrowed .
' Then I saw his hand next to me , which was darker than my husband's .
When I realised what was happening I threw him off in a panic and ran downstairs with my daughter and called the police straight away .
Jason Jeal was acquitted of rape because he was sleepwalking
' He had apparently walked upstairs , past the rooms where my husband and son were sleeping , and into my daughter 's bedroom .
It begs the awful question of what would have happened if I had not been in there with her . '
The trial at Portsmouth Crown Court heard Mr Jeal 's DNA was found on Mrs McKenna .
Mr Jeal insisted during his trial that he had no recollection of the event .
In his closing speeches , Mr Jeal 's barrister suggested to the jury that he had been sleepwalking at the time of the attack , giving examples of things people had done while asleep , such as ' going to the toilet in the wardrobe ' .
It was left to the jury to decide whether Mr Jeal was sleepwalking .
The case has angered Labour MP Harry Cohen , who introduced a Private Members '
Bill last month to highlight the issue .
He said : ' A rape is a rape and should be treated as such .
' This lady is a victim .
At the least there should be some follow - up treatment for defendants .
What they should n't be allowed to do is walk away scot - free . '
Mrs McKenna added : ' I feel as if I have got this for the rest of my life yet the person responsible has n't been punished .
To be subjected to the ordeal I went through in your own home was the last thing you expect when you invite someone round to a barbecue .
People need to realise that this could happen to anyone .
' I can't fault the police as they have been absolutely fantastic as was my local sexual assault referral centre .
I think the police were very disappointed at the outcome .
' These people should not just walk free - they should either be given a prison sentence or medical treatment , otherwise we could find more and more people finding this defence on the Internet and using it . '
Mr Jeal , a father of three who has since separated from his wife , yesterday maintained he did not know what he was doing at the time of the attack .
Speaking outside his home in Portsmouth , the former member of Portchester Cricket Club said : ' I did not use sleepwalking in my defence as I did not have any doctor 's evidence or anything to back that up , ' he said .
' With me , sleepwalking normally comes on through drink .
People have told me I 've done it before . '
So - called ' sexsomnia ' , in which sufferers carry out indecent acts in their sleep , is considered to be a form of automatism , a condition which has been used as a defence across criminal law .
Last year , RAF mechanic Kenneth Ecott , 26 , was acquitted after he pleaded that he was sleepwalking when he had sex with a 15 - year - old girl .
Bournemouth Crown Court heard he had sexsomnia .
James Bilton , 22 , was also cleared by a jury of three counts of rape in 2005 .
The 22 - year - old victim said she woke to find Mr Bilton assaulting her , but he said he could not remember the incident at his flat in York .
Det Con Richard Rock , from Hampshire Police , said : ' I would like to see some sort of reverse burden of proof where the defendant has to come up with evidence to prove they have a history of sleepwalking , doctors ' reports , and witnesses .
Otherwise anyone can simply say " I was asleep " . '
Solicitor General Vera Baird said she believed it would be difficult to change the law but added : ' What we need to do is to ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service have their eye on the ball at all times about this defence , and protest very strongly about it being raised without medical evidence . '
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said : ' Cases in which automatism is used as a defence are very rare , and there must be clear evidence to substantiate the claim that the conduct was involuntary and unintentional .
' It is important that when such incidents do arise , the focus is on ensuring the victim receives proper support and counselling and the person responsible receives the medical help they need .
' If there is a suggestion a person continues to pose a risk then the police can explore using existing powers to regulate or monitor their behaviour . '
What the law says
Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 , a defendant is guilty of rape if an attack is intentional .
In the case of Jason Jeal , the jury were left to decide whether they believed his argument that he could not remember what he did because he was apparently asleep .
Their not guilty verdict indicates that the jury agreed he was sleepwalking - or at least could not agree ' beyond reasonable doubt ' that he was not .
As a result , he could not be held accountable for his actions and the attack was not intentional .
Victims of rape or alleged rape may choose to waive their right of anonymity if they wish .

Art Laffer offers this succinct summary of Bernankeconomics :
No one likes to see people lose their homes when housing prices fall and they ca n’t afford to pay their mortgages ; nor does any one of us enjoy watching banks go belly - up for making subprime loans without enough equity .
But the taxpayers had nothing to do with either side of the mortgage transaction .
If the house ’s value had appreciated , believe you me the overleveraged homeowner and the overly aggressive bank would never have shared their gain with taxpayers .
Housing price declines and their consequences are signals to the market to stop building so many houses , pure and simple .
But here ’s the rub .
Now enter the government and the prospects of a kinder and gentler economy .
To alleviate the obvious hardships to both homeowners and banks , the government commits to buy mortgages and inject capital into banks , which on the face of it seems like a very nice thing to do .
But unfortunately in this world there is no tooth fairy .
And the government does n’t create anything ; it just redistributes .

In addition to the two Yahoo accounts that were already known – including one that was hacked earlier this month – the Washington Post has learned that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin had a third private e-mail account on a closed network that she and her staff used to communicate outside of the government 's official e-mail system .
The owner of ITS Alaska , a tech company based in Wasilla , told the Post that an e-mail system was set up last spring under the domain that Palin had used for her campaign for governor – PalinForGovernor.com – and that access to the system was confined to " her closest confidants and coworkers and advisers and the person she sleeps with . "
An ITS worker said there appeared to have been 10 to 15 addresses set up under the domain , but they were all shut down on September 17 after a hacker penetrated one of Palin 's private Yahoo e-mail accounts and posted some of its contents online .
Frank Bailey , a Palin aide who was said to maintain the system before it was closed , denied that the domain was being used for Palin and aides to communicate , and said the domain had n't been used at all for a long time .
But the McCain - Palin campaign contradicted his claim with a statement it released to the Post .
" As a champion of government accountability and transparency , Gov. Palin was exercising an abundance of caution to ensure that all state and personal business matters were being kept separate , " said Meghan Stapleton , Palin 's press secretary .
" Gov. Palin is committed to serving with the highest regard toward ethics . "
Stapleton was one of several close Palin aides who had sent correspondence to a Yahoo account of Palin 's that was hacked last month .
The contents of that e-mail are not known but a screenshot of Palin 's inbox that was posted online showing the subject line of Stapleton 's e-mail to Palin indicated that it was about the " Motor Fuel Tax Suspension . "
With regard to the third account that has now been made public , an ITS worker said that Bailey wanted an e-mail system that Palin 's group could control , and that Bailey had asked about encrypting e-mail passing through the private system but had opted against installing encryption after being told the cost would be $ 1,000 .
Palin has been under scrutiny for routinely using a private e-mail account – gov.sarah@yahoo.com – to conduct official government business , raising questions about transparency and whether she and aides used the account to bypass a public records law .
After news reports in early September disclosed the existence of the gov.sarah@yahoo.com account , a hacker discovered a second private account – gov.palin@yahoo.com – and accessed it by resetting the password on the account .
Screenshots of that account , which the hacker posted online , included a number of e-mails from Stapleton and other Palin aides that appeared to be work - related .
The subject line of an e-mail from Randall Ruaro , Palin 's deputy chief of staff read , " Draft letter to Gov. Schwarzenegger . "
The subject line from other e-mails from Ruaro indicated they were about " Court of Appeals Nominations " and employee and budget issues for the DPS .
DPS is how Alaska refers to its Department of Public Safety .
Palin's chief of staff , Michael Nizich , sent her an e-mail August 22 with the subject line , " Using Royalty Oil to Lower the Cost of Fuel for Alaskans . "
The subject line of another e-mail from Nizich read , " CONFIDENTIAL Ethics Matter . "
Since June , Andree McLeod , a Republican and former legislative staff member in Alaska , has been seeking to obtain more than 1,000 e-mails that Palin has refused to hand over in a public records request examining possible ethical lapses by Palin .
" By withholding these e-mails , Sarah Palin has broken on her promise of being open , honest and transparent , " McLeod said in a statement a week before Palin 's Yahoo account was hacked .

A research team , led by investigators at the Department of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University and the Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson , has achieved a substantial " kill " of pancreatic cancer cells by using nanoparticles to successfully deliver a deadly diphtheria toxin gene .
The findings – set to be published in the October issue of Cancer Biology & Therapy – reflect the first time this unique strategy has been tested in pancreatic cancer cells , and the success seen offers promise for future pre-clinical animal studies , and possibly , a new clinical approach .
The researchers found that delivery of a diphtheria toxin gene inhibited a basic function of pancreatic tumor cells by over 95 percent , resulting in significant cell death of pancreatic cancer cells six days after a single treatment .
They also demonstrated that the treatment targets only pancreatic cancer cells and leaves normal cells alone , thus providing a potential ' therapeutic window . '
Further , they are targeting a molecule that is found in over three - quarters of pancreatic cancer patients .
" For the pancreatic cancer world , this is very exciting , " says the study 's lead author , molecular biologist Jonathan Brody , Ph.D. , assistant professor , Department of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University , who works closely with the Samuel D. Gross Professor and Surgeon , Charles J. Yeo , M.D. " There are no effective targeted treatments for pancreatic cancer , aside from surgery for which only a minority of patients qualify .
We are in great need of translating the plethora of molecular information we know about this disease to novel therapeutic ideas .
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer - related mortality in the U.S. , reflecting the generally short survival time of patients - often less than a year from diagnosis .
This approach was originally developed in ovarian cancer cells by study co-author Janet Sawicki , Ph.D. , a member of the Kimmel Cancer Center , and professor at the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research in Wynnewood , Pennsylvania .
She and her group had recent success in reducing the size of ovarian tumors following treatment with diphtheria toxin nanoparticles .
The strategy is based on the fact that both ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells significantly over - express a protein found on the cell membrane , called mesothelin .
The function of that molecule is unknown , but it is found in the majority of pancreatic tumors and ovarian cancer tumors .
Other solid tumors also express mesothelin , but not at such a high rate .

" We do n't know completely why cancer cells repeatedly turn on mesothelin genes to produce thesemembrane proteins , but it gives us a way to fool the cell and hijack its machinery , to trick it into making other more potent genes that will be detrimental to the cancer cells , " Brody says .
To do that , the researchers devised an agent that consists of a bit of mesothelin DNA connected to the gene that produces the toxin from diphtheria , a highly contagious and potentially deadly bacteria , which is now controlled through childhood DPT vaccination .
" Naked " DNA is then coated in a polymer to form nanoparticles that are taken up by the cancer cells .
Inside the cells , the agent performs its trickery .
The nanoparticles biodegrade and the cell machinery senses genetic material from mesothelin .
It activates the diphtheria toxin gene , which then turns on production of the toxin which allows the toxin to then do its work on the cancer cells , Brody says .
Within 24 hours of delivery , the toxin disrupted production of protein machinery by over 95 percent , and within six days , a number of cancer cells die or are arrested .
" The cancer thinks it is turning on mesothelin and once it gets started reading that genetic code , it can't stop , " he says .
" So it will read the bacteria 's DNA and produce the toxin which shuts down protein production in the cancer cells . "
" It worked well in our cell culture models and now we are moving into pre-clinical experiments , " Brody says .
The agent will not attack normal cells because the molecular machinery needed to turn on mesothelin is not found in normal cells , Brody says .
Additionally , Sawicki has modified the diphtheria DNA to ensure that toxin that might be released from dying cancer cells is not taken up by healthy , normal cells .
But the researchers are now perfecting even more stringent measures to ensure safety , he says .
" We can't help being hopeful , " he says .
" Our findings suggest that such a strategy will work in the clinical setting against the majority of pancreatic tumors . "

At a closed door meeting in Vienna today , UN International Atomic Energy Agency director general Mohamed ElBaradei revealed that the reason the group ’s investigation into whether Syria was pursuing a nuclear program has been delayed is that its main Syrian contact has turned up assassinated .
“ The reason that Syria has been late in providing additional information ( is ) that our interlocutor has been assassinated in Syria , ” ElBaradei told a closed - door session of the International Atomic Energy Agency ’s 35 - member board .
A recording of his remarks was obtained by AFP .
ElBaradei apparently did not provide any details on the circumstances of the murder of the group ’s liaison , nor on his identity .
But the AFP cites various Arab media reports noting the assassination of Brig .
Gen. Mohammed Sleiman ( or Mohamed Suleiman ) in the northern port town of Tartus in early August , describing him as a military advisor to Syrian president Bashar al Assad and Syria ’s liaison to Hezbollah .
The LAT says intelligence experts have long suspected Suleiman was in charge of Syria ’s alleged nuclear and chemical weapons programs .
ElBaradei has apparently been pushed by some dozen IAEA members , including the US , to complete his report on the Syria investigation by November .
He insisted to the closed door meeting today that he was not being evasive .
“ We have not provided a report and we will provide a report as and when we have enough facts assessment to provide a report , ” he said .
“ Our decision on the report will be based , not on politics , but on when we are ready with assessment and facting .
… I ’m just telling you how difficult , how complex the situation has become , particularly after the evidence has been eliminated and if we were not to find nuclear material . ”
“ We are in a very awkward situation , because the corpse has gone , and we are now at a stage when we have to reconstruct a facility that is not there , ” ElBaradei concluded , referring apparently not to the corpse of the group ’s Syrian liaison , but the corpse of the building struck last September by the Israeli Air Force , in a hush - hush operation dubbed Operation Orchard .
It ’s not hard to understand why ElBaradei , who has been a target of US hardliners ’ wrath for his insistence that the absence of evidence does not necessarily prove that various rogue regimes are hiding banned weapons programs , recently announced that he plans to retire when his IAEA term is up in November .
Mirror , mirror , on the wall , who are the greatest geeks of us all ?
That question — posed in an Australian iTnews article , “ The Top 10 Greatest Geeks of All Time ” on Monday — sparked quite a discussion in the blogosphere last week , garnering more than 1,300 Diggs and 280 comments by Friday .
Who was top of the list ?
We ’ll give you a hint :
He ’s the father of our favorite operating system .
Other notables on there ?
Richard Stallman in 9th position , and Paul Allen at 10 .
‘ Long - Term Brilliance ’
“ Torvalds was always going to be in our top three but for consistent and long term brilliance we decided he had to get the top spot , ” explained the authors of article .
“ We have yet to see the full effect of Torvalds ’ invention on the computing sphere but it ’s going to be fun watching it develop . ”
It seems fairly safe to assume that few readers of these pages would debate Torvalds ’ topmost position .
Where much of the debate arose , however , was on the rest of the list .
“ There ’s some notables missing from this list , ” charged SupaDawg on Digg , for example .
“ Not including Jobs and Gates is asinine .
Those two were visionary geeks .
If not for them , the world would likely be a much different place . ”
What , No Gates ?
What say you , dear readers ?
Should Gates or Jobs be on the list ?
LinuxInsider could n’t resist asking around .
“ Linus Torvalds for greatest geek of all time , without a doubt , ” blogger Robert Pogson agreed .
“ He worked on a Master ’s project and changed the world . ”
Master ’s degree projects “ are supposed to be about the state of the art , not making such a statement , ” Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ Geeks are the last ones to know when they have changed the world . ”
Second place on Pogson ’s list would go to Stallman .
“ He laid the ground work , ” Pogson explained .
“ He spawned a generation of geeks who instantly valued Linus ’ project for the challenge that it was and the opportunity to make the world a better place . ”
One could argue that Stallman was “ the head geek , but he tried and failed to bring Hurd in on time , ” Pogson added .
“ Linus showed how that kind of thing is done .
We must give Linus high marks for project management . ”
Yes , Gates !
Then again , “ I ’d say Bill Gates has several reasons to be on that list , ” Monochrome Mentality blogger Kevin Dean told LinuxInsider .
“ Microsoft , like it or not , made computers cross the threshold from ‘ business tools ’ to ‘ personal devices . ’
This would n’t have been as likely without Windows , and I do honor and respect that fact . ”
Of course , “ if Windows had n’t been made as poorly as it had , the open source world would have a lot less contributors , users and innovators , ” Dean added .
“ People change and move operating systems because they fail to meet their needs .
Without Windows failing so frequently , I shudder to think where Linux and the BSDs might be . ”
Another geek Dean would add to the list is Electronic Frontier Foundation cofounder John Gilmore .
“ A longtime hacker , John is still active in several technology fields , ” Dean explained .
“ While no single accomplishment may rank up there with some of the things mentioned on the list , his overall accomplishments may have a much broader influence on computing today than say , Richard Stallman’s . ”
Gilmore has been “ a constant voice in the encryption arena , focusing on privacy and security of user data , ” Dean noted .
“ Most of the guys on the list took a specific problem and used computers to solve that problem , ” he said .
“ John is different in the sense that he applies a consistent , principled concept ( that is , freedom ) and builds ways to apply that concept to various things , including computers .
For including freedom in the very fabric of how we use computers , I applaud John Gilmore even if he does n’t make other users ’ lists . ”
‘ Interesting Omission ’
Others saw it differently .
“ Interesting list , interesting omission , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ I ’m sure the one glaring omission many will cry foul over is Bill Gates .
I happen to agree he does NOT belong on this list — he would not even make my honorable mention list . ”
More deserving inclusions , in yagu ’s opinion ?
“ Richard Feynman , one of the great physicists of modern times with a deep and abiding connection to the world , ” yagu said .
“ He had smarts , and he had a sense of humor about it . ”
Also “ Bob Metcalf , one of the co-inventors of Ethernet , upon which most network topologies are based today ( my opinion ) , ” he added .
And , finally , “ Bill Joy , author of ‘ vi ’ editor , one of the most nimble yet powerful text editors ever conceived , ” yagu explained .
‘ Microsoft ’s Linux Killer ’ ?
Debating the relative geekiness of all the many contenders makes for interesting conversation , but meanwhile another , much more disturbing discussion was taking place on the blogs last week as well .
Specifically , an alarm was sounded marking the existence of a new potential threat to Linux — a threat called “ Windows 7 . ”
Computerworld ’s Preston Gralla was among the loudest ringers of the bell with his posts titled “ Windows 7 : Microsoft ’s Linux Killer ? ” “ More reasons Windows 7 Will Kill Linux ” , and so on .
The topic was picked up by TechRepublic ’s Selena Frye , among others , even as other bloggers sounded separate alarms — discussing charges that Linux “ sucks ” at being user friendly , for instance , or that Ubuntu has “ lost its credibility . ”
Far be it from us to panic prematurely , but we ca n’t help but wonder : Is Linux in trouble ?
‘ That ’s a Stretch ! ’
“ Wow , that ’s a stretch ! ” yagu asserted .
“ Microsoft stumbled badly with Vista , and are poised to do the same with Windows 7 . ”
Linux will make or break itself , he added .
“ Linux maintains its high standing in the technical circles that count .
Windows still looks in from the outside .
Windows 7 wo n’t change that , and if Microsoft stumbles with 7 as they did with Vista , their ( Microsoft ’s ) position worsens and Linux ’s improves . ”
Recent Microsoft iterations “ promised much and delivered little , ” yagu added , “ and because their hype did n’t come close to their reality they tarnished the Microsoft brand .
Meanwhile , Linux , much like the tortoise , moves steadily and methodically to truly improved product . ”
In short , “ Microsoft seems to go for the sizzle , but Linux continues to bring the steak , ” yagu concluded .
“ Anyone predicting Windows 7 is somehow Linux ’s demise completely misses the point . ”
The Winning Tortoise ?
Along similar lines , “ Windows 7 is almost irrelevant to GNU / Linux , ” Pogson asserted .
“ M$ has shown it cannot produce what it promises on - time and under - budget , so what we have is what we are going to get for years .
GNU / Linux beats that other OS clearly in the netbooks space , effortlessly taking a 30 percent share of seats . ”
With the economic downturn , “ manufacturers are going to have to compete on price , ” Pogson pointed out .
“ M$ will be just another competitor in a year or so by the time ‘ 7 is a gleam in the customers ’ eyes .
M$ has given GNU / Linux a head start of years and , like the tortoise and hare , the tortoise is going to win . ”
There ’s that tortoise comparison again !
‘ A Bit Narrowminded ’
Putting it another way , Gralla “ seems a bit narrowminded , ” Dean charged .
Linux is a kernel , and not always equivalent to desktop Linux , Dean pointed out .
“ The narrow - mindedness that I speak of comes into play when attempting to make any judgment about ‘ Windows 7 killing Linux ’ based on a small subset of all computers ” — namely , netbooks , he said .
“ Windows 7 may offer improvements and innovations , and good on Microsoft for delivering that , ” he said .
“ Competition benefits the entire software ecosystem and I ’m sure FOSS hackers around the world will quickly adopt and adapt any useful innovations in Windows 7 .
I think there might be some pluses Windows 7 has over Linux , but will I sound Linux ’s death knell because of user preference in the netbook market ?
Not likely . ”
Friendly , Schmiendly
Indeed , “ I do n’t see Windows 7 affecting Linux much , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack agreed .
“ While faster than Vista , it will still be slower and more memory - hungry than XP .
Meanwhile , Linux developers have been working to lower the Linux memory footprint . ”
As for Linux ’s purported unfriendliness to users ?
“ Hardly ! ” yagu exclaimed .
“ There are excellent distributions out there that are as user friendly as it gets .
User friendly ?
You bet !
Same as Windows ?
Not exactly . ”
Several bloggers chalked up such unfriendliness fears to so much “ whining . ”
‘ I ’d Rate That Piece - 1 , Troll ’
To wit : “ Most of these whinings are irrelevant to a factory - installed distro with a GUI for installing printers , etc. , ” Pogson charged .
“ Get over it .
GNU / Linux on the desktop is here .
We have motherboards that boot into it in seconds .
Anybody ’s grandmother can use it . ”
Such complaints “ remind me of commercials for bathroom cleaning products that show how bad the ‘ other guy ’s ’ toilet brush is — if you need to contort your face and body to use an insignificantly different product , you ’re probably doing it wrong , ” Slashdot editor Timothy Lord told LinuxInsider .
“ Winders also fuzzes the line between kernel developers and all developers generally , which includes a lot of very smart UI and QA specialists , and ignores the overlap between any of these categories — then , without evidence , accuses kernel developers of having ‘ no love ’ for users , ” Lord added .
“ On Slashdot , I ’d rate that piece - 1 , Troll . ”
‘ It ’s Just Selective ’
And finally , a philosophical perspective : “ It was once said , ‘ Linux is very user friendly , it ’s just selective about who it becomes friends with , ' ” Dean noted , and “ I ’m not sure that ’s a bad thing .
A crucial part of business is identifying your audience and targeting them . ”
It was n’t “ Linux sucking ” that caused the high return rates for Linux netbooks , Dean asserted .
Rather , it was “ not meeting customer expectations .
Linux is n’t user unfriendly , it ’s just not friendly to the same demographic targeted by Mac OS X . ”
Far from a problem , that , in turn , is actually a benefit , he added .
Strength , Not Weakness
“ The flexibility and control that is derided in the desktop is what made Linux a candidate for use in Android and Openmoko and the variety of embedded devices becoming increasingly popular , ” Dean explained .
“ Linux ’s best point is that it ’s what you make it , ” he said .
“ It might be grating to some people that they ca n’t make it friendly for them , but for those that have that capacity , it ’s a very good thing .
“ The great thing about choice in the market overall is that customers have choice , ” Dean concluded .
“ Mac OS X seems to have gotten the ‘ user friendly ’ part down pat for nonprogrammers , and until the people complaining step up and change the status quo , it ’s nothing more than another voice complaining . ”
Westminster Theological Seminary ’s bookstore almost went out of business last Christmas , largely because they have a hard time competing with Amazon.com ’s prices , which are so low that even Amazon itself can’t make a profit .
In a recent email to their customers , they lamented :

( CNN ) -- U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey suffered a fainting spell Thursday night , according to Gina Talamona , spokeswoman for the Department of Justice .
Michael Mukasey is helped as he begins to collapse during his speech Thursday night .
Mukasey , 67 , did not suffer a stroke or experience a heart attack , she said Friday morning .
Mukasey collapsed while giving a speech Thursday at the Federalist Society dinner at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington .
He was giving a spirited defense of the Bush administration 's legal policies when his speech began to slur and he lost track of his thoughts about 30 minutes into his talk .
Seconds later , he became rigid and then began to slump .
Watch Mukasey 's speech and collapse »
Mukasey was rushed to George Washington University Medical Center , said Peter Carr , a Justice Department spokesman .
" The attorney general is conscious , conversant and alert , " Carr said Thursday night .
" His vital statistics are strong and he is in good spirits .
President Bush placed a call to Mukasey Friday morning .
" The AG sounded well and is getting excellent care , " presidential spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
Mukasey was telling jokes and was ready to go home from the hospital , said a Justice Department official , who was not authorized to speak on the record about Mukasey 's condition .
As Mukasey began to collapse , two people grabbed him and laid him on the stage .
On a tape of the speech , a voice can be heard saying " Oh , no oh !
Oh my God ! "
He was given medical attention on stage by a woman and three men before he was rushed to the hospital .
EMS personnel arrived on the scene less than 15 minutes after his collapse .
Watch update on Mukasey 's condition »
Before the EMS arrived , one man is heard asking people to please stay in their seats .
In the background , a voice is heard saying " bring his feet up . "
While Mukasey was being attended to , the audience remained seated and quiet .
Outside the hotel , numerous police cars rushed to the scene .
Moments later , a fire truck arrived and then an ambulance .
White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto told CNN that President Bush has been informed of the situation and has Mukasey in his " thoughts and prayers . "
Watch Jeffrey Toobin 's comments on Mukasey »
As he approached the podium and during the bulk of his appearance , Mukasey showed no signs of ill health .
During his speech , he praised the administration for " nothing less than a fundamental reorganization of our government " after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and blasted the " relentless critics of the very policies that have kept us safe . "
Early in his speech , Mukasey noted Supreme Court justices were in attendance , and he praised John Roberts and Samuel Alito as " remarkably accomplished justices . "
His speech was punctuated several times by applause from the audience .
Mukasey is a retired federal judge appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan .
Mukasey was nominated to be attorney general by President Bush in September 2007 and was confirmed by the Senate in November 2007 .
As a judge , Mukasey ruled that the U.S. government 's detention of " dirty bomb " suspect Jose Padilla was constitutional , but that he must be allowed to meet with his attorneys .
During his attorney general confirmation hearings , Mukasey said he would make legal decisions based " on facts and law , not by interests and motives . "
Mukasey also said he would resign from office if faced with a presidential order he believed was unconstitutional .

Since 1993 , Wayne Sawchuk , a former logger and grizzly bear hunter , has been working tirelessly to protect “ the biggest well - kept secret in North America . ”
Wayne Sawchuk recently found some atonement for decades of his life spent logging , partying and grizzly hunting .
Funded mostly by private donors , Sawchuck played a major role in the conservation of the MuskwaKechika Management Area in Northern British Columbia .
Taking a month to cross , even with horses , the land has been touted as “ the biggest well - kept secret in North America , ” and “ North America ’s Serengeti . ”
Teeming with grizzly , black bear , wolf , lynx , caribou , elk , moose , bison and stone sheep , it is the largest intact wildlife habitat in the entire Rocky Mountain chain and only slightly smaller than the state of Maine .
In the early 1990 ’s , the government of British Columbia came under pressure to make a final decision on how to manage the province ’s resources .
Wayne Sawchuk , still a logger at the time , recognized the opportunity of a lifetime and teamed up with other key players to protect the tract of land .
[ social_buttons ]
Involved in the efforts were guide outfitters , recreational hunters , the oil and gas industry , snowmobilers , businesspeople , environmentalists , timber industries and government officials .
Sawchuk had a tremendous impact in the conservation efforts , as he led the media , government and scientists through the area on horseback so that they could get a first hand glimpse at what they were talking about .
Harvey Locke , founder of the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative said : “ He was n’t the only guy , but boy oh boy– without him , I do n’t know if it would have happened . ”
After nearly ten years of negotiations , the final deal that was agreed upon allotted 25 % of the land to become part of the provincial park system .
60 % of the land was designated as “ special managements zones , ” open to limited oil , gas and mineral development , and 15 % became “ special wildlife zones ” where logging is not allowed .
“ We argued over every last foot , ” said Sawchuk .
“ If we could n’t come to an agreement , the government would decide for us , and that scared the hell out of everybody . ”
Today the MuskwaKechika Management Area represents a major link in the 2,000 - mile - long wildlife corridor from the Yukon Territory to Yellowstone National Park .

OCTOBER 23--Shortly before a John McCain campaign volunteer was reportedly robbed at knifepoint and had a ' B ' carved in her face after her assailant noticed that her car carried a McCain bumper sticker , the woman blogged last night that she was ' Stubbornly searching for a bank of america to avoid ATM fees ' and had somehow ended up ' on the wrong side of pittsburgh . '
Ashley Todd , a 20 - year - old Texas college student , told cops that she was robbed of $ 60 by a 6 ' 4 ' black man who weighed about 200 pounds .
Todd claimed that when her assailant noticed the McCain sticker on her vehicle , he punched her in the head and carved the letter on her right cheek ( a battered Todd can be seen at right ) .
Shortly before the reported 9 PM attack , Todd updated her Twitter page with a post noting that she was , ' Stubbornly searching for a bank of america to avoid ATM fees . '
Soon after , she blogged , ' Pretty sure I 'm on the wrong side of pittsburgh . '
Three hours after that update , Todd wrote , ' Oh the blog I will be making soon ... Its been a rough night . '
A screen grab of Todd 's Twitter page -- which was linked from her page on a College Republican National Committee web site -- can be found here .
At about 6 PM ( est ) tonight , Todd 's Twitter page became protected and was no longer publicly available .

The timing of the PBS documentary on Lee Atwater titled “ Boogie Man ” last night could not be better .
As the inventor of the kind of dirty tricks that John McCain used unsuccessfully , Atwater symbolizes the bare - knuckle politics that have worked so well for Republicans since Reagan ’s election .
Unfortunately for them , the recent financial crisis delivered a knockout punch to such politics–at least until the Democrats succumb to a new round of ineffectual governance that will render them vulnerable once again .
When asked by a PBS interviewer about his views on the 2008 election , director Stefan Forbes responded :
There was an election ?
I ’ve been stuck in the edit room for the last two years , so I feel a little like Rip Van Winkle .
People ask me if the Atwater playbook is over , if hope has beaten fear once and for all .
I ’m not so sure .
Fear may have actually won .
Peoples ’ very real fear of losing homes and 401 ( k ) s bested the trumped - up fears that Obama was a Muslim or an elitist socialist in league with Hamas .
In future elections , where there ’s no urgent issue , these sorts of attacks may regain their powerful emotional hold over the American voter .
Atwater died of brain cancer at the age of 40 in 1990 .
It is not hard to see his death as punishment for a misspent life .
This morality tale even includes well - publicized reports of Atwater going through a death - bed conversion .
The riveting documentary surmises that this could have been just another example of Atwater deception since the Bible he requested in his dying weeks remained covered in the cellophane it came in .
You can watch excerpts of the documentary at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/atwater/view/, but the entire DVD must be ordered from the PBS website .
For those who do n’t want to spend the money , I recommend looking for the printed transcript which should be online in a week or so .
Just check : http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/atwater/etc/tapes.html
Stefan Forbes skillfully draws out the dramatic class differences between Atwater and the George Bush family that relied on his scuzzy talents .
No matter how much Atwater sought to become part of the Connecticut Patrician world that the Bush family inhabited , they never regarded him more than a kind of elevated household servant .
As an authentic redneck from South Carolina , Atwater helped the Bush ’ 41 campaign define itself as a “ good old boy ” defense of American values against the effete brie-eating Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis , who is interviewed throughout the film .
Dukakis offers ex post facto refutations of Atwater ’s lies that are quite eye - opening .
It was too bad , as one commentator notes , that they were not used during his feckless campaign .
For example , Atwater cooked up the infamous Willie Horton ads that blamed Dukakis for allowing the convicted African - American felon to get a weekend furlough from prison that allowed him to go on a killing spree .
Dukakis notes that this program was inspired by another governor , namely Ronald Reagan from California .
Atwater also produced ads that charged Dukakis with opposing various weapons systems that would have left America defenseless against the dirty Russians .
Dukakis explains that as governor of Massachusetts , he was in no position to vote on any kind of weapons system .
In a period of deep reaction , such as the kind that allowed a Reagan or a Bush to triumph , it mattered little if such ads were true or not .
American voters allowed their prejudices to take over , a luxury ill - afforded in a period of rising unemployment .
Of course , it remains to be seen whether a Democratic administration can do much about this , given its free market fundamentalism .
Despite his racism , Atwater made a big thing about his affinity for Black people that was mostly expressed through his love for the blues .
Atwater played backup guitar for Percy Sledge during the 1960s and sat in with bluesmen such as B.B. King .
At the night of his greatest triumph , the election of George Bush the elder in 1988 , Atwater played guitar with a virtual all - star band made up of Black musicians .
You can see him and President - elect Bush mugging on the stage surrounded by Blacks in an updated version of the minstrel show .

Ishmael Reed , one of the movie ’s more adept interviewees , commented on the irony of such a spectacle attending the most racist election campaigns in American history .
Believing his own bullshit , Atwater was invited to serve on the board of Howard University , one of the country ’s most prestigious Black colleges , fully expecting the same kind of warm reception he got from blues musicians .
He was bitterly disappointed as the Boston Globe reported .
The article is worth quoting at some length since it shows the potential of the Black student movement once it gets aroused about an issue , as well as the class divisions in the Black community :

Atwater ’s approach to black community hits dead end at Howard
By Jerry Thomas , Globe Staff
The appointment of Lee Atwater to Howard University ’s board of trustees appeared , at first , to be an easy way for the Republican Party to make inroads into the African - American community .
Howard , a historic black institution that still considers itself a mecca for the black mainstream and that attracts the sons and daughters of some of the world ’s most influential and visible blacks , already has strong links to the party .
The university has flaunted its conservative views and its Republican student organization , although the majority of its 12,000 students and the faculty are Democrats .
James Cheek , the president of Howard for 20 years , is a Republican who received the “ Freedom of Peace ” award from former President Ronald Reagan .
Thaddeus Garrett , one of 32 trustees , is a top aide to President Bush .
Last year , the school received a $ 179 million appropriation from Congress , which founded the school in 1867 and pays some of the tuition for more than 60 percent of Howard ’s students .
Atwater would have been one of more than 11 whites on the board of the university , whose first students were five white women .
The university thought Atwater , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , could add to the wealth and prestige of the school named after Gen. Oliver Otis Howard , the commissioner of the Freedmen ’s Bureau and the school ’s first president .
Plus , Atwater , busy schedule and all , seemed accessible .
He met with students several times after his appointment .
The first meeting , students say , was on a Thursday in February , shortly after 7 p.m .
The setting was a nightclub on a ritzy part of Pennsylvania Avenue .
Just several feet from the guitar strings of blues legend B.B. King sat Atwater , waiting for several guests : six students from Howard .
It was politics at first sight , the students said .
Both sides played it cool .
They shook hands and talked over drinks .
Robert Turner , a senior from New Orleans and vice president of the Howard University Student Association , said that there appeared to be strategy behind Atwater ’s approach .
Turner recalled in his own words Atwater ’s introduction , “ Hey !
How are you doing ?
I ’m Lee Atwater , a down home country boy ; I even like rhythm and blues . ”
Atwater introduced the students to two of his black aides .
He agreed to talk to the students again .
The aides took over the next night , meeting some of the same students at a local dance club for “ upscale blacks , ” the students said .
The aides spoke highly of Atwater and the Republican Party .
They noted that Atwater could do good things for Howard .
They told the students that supporting Atwater ’s appointment would not hurt job contacts and could strengthen their networking at graduation .
Atwater had a second meeting with the students .
It was the following Sunday at his Capitol Hill office , where he told them how he keeps abreast of some issues , including black concerns .
The political magic was working , and the students were willing to consider what Atwater might offer .
But within weeks , the Republican strategy would backfire .
What the party did not anticipate was a backlash from Howard students – many of whose parents and teachers participated in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s – who saw the appointment of Atwater as an insult to the student body and a bad signal to the black and African community worldwide .
On Friday , March 3 , shortly before 10 a.m. , things took an unusual twist on the campus .
Bill Cosby , the actor and author , was to give the Founder ’s Day address in the school ’s Cramton Auditorium , where the trustees , the administration , the faculty , students and alumni were to gather to commemorate the school ’s 122d birthday .
Instead of hearing Cosby , 1,500 students took over the ceremonies and announced “ The Black Agenda . ”
The protesters ’ key demand was that Atwater , who they say was handpicked by Cheek and who was appointed unanimously by the board of trustees in January , step down .
Atwater was accused of using racist tactics as Bush ’s presidential campaign manager .
He was the architect of the furlough issue , which focused on the release of Willie Horton , a convicted murderer , from a Massachusetts prison .
The students argued that Atwater ’s campaign methods portrayed blacks in a negative manner and fueled the successful campaign of David Duke , a former member of the Ku Klux Klan , in Louisiana .
“ We are here to oppose Lee Atwaterism , ” Ras Baraka , a junior from Newark , told a crowd of protesters .
“ It is not the man , Atwater , but the ideologies he represents .
It ’s the conservative view he represents .
It ’s the Borks that he represents and the David Dukes he represents . ”
Baraka , one of the protest leaders , is the son of Amiri Baraka , a poet and 1960s activist .
The students , much to the Cheek administration ’s dismay and embarrassment , remained in the auditorium for several hours .
They demanded that Cheek address the crowd on several issues , including the appointment of Atwater , requests for a graduate department of African - American studies , improved security and student involvement in school governance , but Cheek never did .
The annual Founder ’s Day ceremony was canceled .
The following Monday , hundreds of protesters moved from the auditorium to the Mordecai Wyatt Johnson Administration Building , where they barricaded themselves inside .
The protests forced Atwater to resign Tuesday .
He said that he was “ deeply saddened ” by the resignation and that he had been miscast as a racist .
He said that he had hoped , as a Howard trustee , to help the university administration and aid fund - raising efforts among GOP donors .
The film concludes with Atwater ’s illness and death , including grotesque images of his face blown up twice its normal size due to steroids used to treat the effects of radiation therapy .
It is not a pretty sight .
As might be expected , the documentary relies heavily on the analyses of liberal commentators such as Eric Alterman , Joe Conason , and Howard Fineman .
For them , the Lee Atwaters and Karl Roves of the world serve as convenient demons whose expulsion will lead to a kind of re-establishment of Camelot with the Obamas as the new Kennedy ’s .
Such is the state of our degraded electoral politics that both factions in the ruling party of capitalism can keep people mesmerized by celebrity of the right or the left .
Since the entire society is drenched in advertising , it is no surprise that this is the kind of politics we get with an Empire in its dotage .

ANN ARBOR , Mich . --
Michigan sank to an all - time low on a day as miserable as its season .
C.J . Bacher threw touchdown passes on his first two drives of the second half to lift Northwestern to a 21 - 14 win Saturday over the Wolverines , handing them eight losses overall and five at home for the first time in the storied program 's 129 - year history .
" I 'm sick to my stomach right now , " senior safety Brandon Harrison said .
Many fans likely felt the same way , leaving Michigan Stadium mostly empty in the second half because of subfreezing wind chill , rain , sleet and snow along with poor play .
" It was tough to stay , " coach Rich Rodriguez said .
" It 's our job to put a team out there that everybody is proud of . "
College football 's winningest program had already sealed its first losing season since 1967 and snapped a 33 - season bowl streak .
The latest loss guaranteed the Wolverines ( 3 - 8 , 2 - 5 Big Ten ) would fail to win consecutive games for the first time since 1962 in Rodriguez 's debut season .
" Everybody 's going to judge you on your record , and that 's fair , " Rodriguez said .
" I do think we 're making some steps that will eventually show up on game days . "
At least one Wolverine said the season can be salvaged by upsetting rival Ohio State next week .
" If we can come out and beat O - State that would clear everything up , " Harrison said .
Northwestern ( 8 - 3 , 4 - 3 ) will close the regular season at home against rival Illinois , hoping to improve its bowl destination while preventing the Fighting Illini from winning their sixth game to be eligible for the postseason .
" It 's special to have November be a significant month , " coach Pat Fitzgerald said .
The Wildcats have won eight games for the first time since 2000 -- the last time it beat Michigan -- and for just the fifth time since 1905 .
They won at the Big House for the first time since 1995 , when its coach was a star linebacker .
" This was a big program win for us , " Fitzgerald said , " to come back and respond again and beat an improved Michigan team that was playing their best football of the year on their senior day . "
Michigan led 14 - 7 midway through the second quarter , then fell behind after Northwestern scored back - to - back TDs to open the third .
The Wolverines had two chances late in the game to drive for an overtime - forcing TD , including having the ball at its 42 with 1:46 to go and no timeouts left , but failed to do much with the ball .
Bacher was 17 - of - 29 for 198 yards with two TDs and two interceptions .
Ross Lane had seven receptions for 77 yards and a TD while Eric Peterman caught five passes for 79 yards , including a 53 - yard score .
Northwestern quarterback Mike Kafka was sidelined in the second quarter with a concussion and replaced by Bacher , who started the game .
Michigan 's Nick Sheridan was 8 - for - 29 for 61 yards and ran for a score .
Steven
Threet replaced him in the second half , but left the game with an injury late in the fourth quarter after completing 4 of 7 passes for 22 yards and an interception .
Carlos Brown had a season - high 115 yards rushing for the Wolverines .
The game started off as ugly as the conditions with an interception , a blocked field goal and a muffed punt return in the first 3 - plus minutes .
Northwestern took advantage of the mishandled punt return , taking a 7 - 0 lead on Stephen Simmons ' 21 - yard run on third - and - 18 .
Michigan tied it late in the first quarter on Sheridan 's run .
Michael Williams blocked a punt and Ricky Reyes returned it a few yards for a TD , giving the Wolverines a 14 - 7 lead at halftime .
" All of a sudden you come out in the second half and it 's snowing , " Fitzgerald said .
" It 's beautiful Big Ten football weather day . "
Bacher tied the game , throwing a 17 - yard pass to Lane on third - and - goal .
Bacher put the Wildcats ahead 21 - 14 when he connected with a wide - open Peterman , who ran 53 yards untouched .
Threet , who had been sidelined by concussion - related symptoms , entered the game after Michigan opened the second half with four straight three - and - out possessions .
He threw behind an open receiver in the end zone and Jordan Mabin intercepted it early in the fourth quarter .
Threet was hurt after running for a first down with 4:21 left and was replaced by Sheridan , who turned the ball over on downs at the Northwestern 34 .
The Wolverines got the ball back again , but Sheridan could n't complete a pass and Northwestern 's seniors avoided going winless against the once - mighty program .
" Being a fifth - year senior , I 've been a part of beating every Big Ten team , " Lane said .
" It 's like a dream come true . "
Looking back on Selling Gravatar to Automattic
For an entrepreneur , the line between horrible mistake and runaway success can be so thin that even Kate Moss would be envious .
I lived with Gravatar for nearly four years before that line even became thick enough to measure .
As it ’s become one of my favorite parables , I ’ll save the details of how I came up with the idea for Gravatar for a future post .
What ’s important to know is that the idea was spawned not from a business perspective , but from a desperate desire to create something new in the world of blogging .
Spin the clock back four years and you ’ll find me sitting at my Windows desktop machine in my underwear with a box of Life cereal to my left and a day old Coke to my right .
Since I ’d been laid off from my job as a Java developer some months earlier , I ’d decided to take the entrepreneurial plunge doing what I knew best : web design .
Working in a cone of isolation , I ’d become accustomed to waking up late , swinging my legs over the right side of the bed , and in one fluid movement sliding over to the ratty chair I stole from my old college dorm room .
I ’d spend most of the day working on client projects in ColdFusion or PHP .
It was hard work and could become a bit tiresome .
I needed an outlet , something that did n’t have a suit on the other end of a telephone telling me how blue was the wrong color and things would be so much better if only the photo had a slightly bigger border .
Gravatar would become that outlet for me .
I was really big into web standards at the time , having recently read Zeldman ’s seminal work , and became a true believer .
Eric Meyers , Dan Cederholm , and Jon Hicks became like gods to me .
I worked very hard at making relevant and witty comments around the right kinds of blogs .
Being a part of that movement became a significant goal for me .
My Movable
Type weblog rarely went more than two days without a post on design or standards .
Two weeks after I had the idea for Gravatar the first version was written and deployed .
Every request hit the database and dynamically generated a properly sized gravatar via PHP ’s gd2 api .
Premature optimization and all that , right ?
The first thing I did after getting the system to a workable state was email all the bloggers I looked up to ( and that had no idea who I was ) .
Blog comments at the time were a pretty dreary affair and I guess Cederholm was intrigued enough by my idea that he linked to it in a sidebar micro-post on simplebits.com .
That single mention kicked off a slow but steady trickle of interest in the system .
A few blogs here and there installed the plugin and the world started seeing avatars that mysteriously followed them around .
At the same time , just as people must have thought Cheez Whiz was a stupid idea when it first came out , some bloggers started railing against Gravatar , calling it frivolous , inefficient , and “ an abomination . ”
This was my first nibble at the smorgasbord of what was to become the “ horrible mistake ” aspect of Gravatar .
Due to the inherently self - advertising nature of gravatars ( the “ what the hell is that and how do I get one ? ” brand of advertising ) , Gravatar adoption increased at a rapid rate .
Having crafted the idea for Gravatar without any semblance of business model or growth projection or build - out strategy , things took a rather dramatic dive away from “ runaway success ” as my server ( yes , singular ) buckled under the pressure of tens of requests per second !
As it turns out , regenerating a gravatar on every request is not very CPU efficient .
Gravatars worldwide suddenly turned into little red Xs .
Then , in what has become known as the Twitter Effect , a barrage of emails hit me complaining about how the free service on which they had come to depend was down , and how this would adversely impact my well - being .
I fixed the code .
Gravatar came back online with caching .
All the while I ’d had the bright idea that gravatars would be rated for content , MPAA - style .
Because users clearly were not fit to rate their own images , I was manually rating 400 or more avatars each day .
If I missed a day , I ’d have damn near a thousand waiting for me the next day .
In addition to the angry mob , I was very fortunate to have an amazingly supportive group of users that volunteered to help me rate images .
I owe them my sanity , and it freed up enough time for me to work on the next iteration of the site .
G2 , as I called it , would be written in Rails and use lighttpd plus a convoluted directory structure of symlinks to enable me to pre-render every gravatar ( 1x1 up to 80x80 ) and serve only static images .
I did this to avoid having to rent or buy the kind of hardware necessary to hook up a properly scaled system .
Up until the end I ran Gravatar on a maximum of two rented commodity servers that set me back a mere $ 300 / month , a pittance for the kind of traffic I was serving .
I say it was a pittance , but that ’s not really true .
Donations did n’t even come close to covering that cost .
At some point early in the development of G2 , Toni Schneider , the CEO of Automattic ( the company behind WordPress.com and Akismet ) contacted me after hearing my interview about the future of Gravatar on the WordPress podcast .
This was exciting news !
How perfect a fit would it be for Gravatar to be bought by Automattic ?
I was already planning a trip up to San Francisco to meet with the Powerset guys , so the timing worked out perfectly for me to meet in person with Toni .
I ended up having lunch with Toni and Matt Mullenweg at 21st Ammendment on 2nd Street .
It was a bit intimidating to come to the mecca of tech startups to meet with such huge players in the blogging community .
Turned out that both Matt and Toni are great guys and so we had drinks for about two hours , talking about my ideas for Gravatar and how we might be able to work together .
Everything seemed great — I was jazzed and they seemed excited — but a few weeks later Toni let me know that the timing was wrong and they could n’t make a play at that time .
He suggested I proceed with G2 and they ’d proceed with their own avatar system .
I was pretty bummed about the outcome , but I took their advice and kept going .
A few weeks before G2 was finished , the site imploded in a big way .
One machine .
Hundreds of requests per second .
That poor CPU must have thought it was the End Times .
Instead of wasting time on getting the existing system back up , I put on my headphones , turned it up to eleven , and got back to work on G2 .
I ’m not sure if you ’ve ever had to work on a project while your users are publicly skewering you on your blog for allowing the service to go down , but it ’s as close to depression as I ’ve ever come .
If I ’d had less pride , I would have popped everyone a huge middle finger and let the service die , but instead I waded through the hundreds of comments and deleted the ones with threats , hatred , or my favorite , the words “ fuck you ” repeated 600 times .
It was n’t fair , I told myself , that I should be sitting here with high blood pressure trying to raise Gravatar from the dead while the unappreciative masses do what they do best on the internet .
The only thing that kept me going was never being able to tell which side of the mistake / success boundary I was sitting on .
It was hard to think of the situation as anything but a huge failure , but the shitstorm the downtime was causing indicated that people found the service valuable .
I want to say that Twitter went through the same thing , but they suffered their downtime with millions of dollars in the bank .
The only thing I had was a full time job unrelated to Gravatar and a credit card that reminded me every month of my bad judgment .
Finally G2 was done , deployed , and fully operational .
I have no idea how many users I lost due to the several weeks of downtime , but I do n’t think it was very many .
There seems to be a corollary to the Twitter Effect that I ’d call the Forgiveness Effect .
It dictates that if a user enjoys a free service and that service is currently up , all past atrocities will be easily and quickly forgiven .
With the site running again , things looked to be shifting back towards a success .
Things were not all rainbows and unicorns though .
My Rube Goldbergian architecture had a few quirks that needed to be dealt with .
The site still had some elusive bugs from the overly - rapid development cycle .
And just like new lanes on freeways always fill up immediately , the two new servers I was running started causing expensive bandwidth overages .
I had taken a job at Powerset at this point and the combined pressures of these two commitments started to weigh me down .
Once again I started feeling like all the effort I put into Gravatar was for nothing .
Like I would never benefit from any of it .
In a last ditch effort to save Gravatar from final doom , I emailed Toni and pitched him again on Gravatar .
I figured it was a long shot , but what the hell , could n’t hurt .
Things must have changed in the prior 6 months because Toni was very receptive to the idea .
We met again , at 21st Ammendment , and hashed out a tentative deal over drinks .
I ’d never sold anything like this before , so my technique was probably very amateurish .
I ’m almost certain I could have gotten a better deal out of it , but I had the smell of desperation about me and I really did want to see Gravatar end up in Automattic ’s hands .
Four days later , Automattic made their official offer .
On September 21st , 2007 we inked the deal and Gravatar became both the first company that I ever sold and the first company that Automattic ever acquired .
I am quite satisfied with the sale to Automattic .
Some will say that I should have pursued VC funding .
Indeed , I was contacted by several firms but never travelled very far down that road .
I always felt like Gravatar was a feature , and I was n’t comfortable building a company on such a tiny foundation .
Reinforcing this decision , no viable business model ever coalesced during the time I was building the site .
It was also made clear by Toni that Automattic would maintain Gravatar as a separate brand and continue its evolution ( instead of just absorbing it into WordPress ) .
This appealed to my ego .
Most companies kill or maim everything they acquire , but here was a chance for Gravatar to carry forward with all of Automattic ’s resources behind it ( instead of two measly servers ) .
Part of me just wanted to see what Gravatar could become with time , money , and man -power moving it forward .
Things always seem so clear in retrospect .
But it was pride and persistence that kept me in the game long enough to have anything to look back on at all .
While the line between horrible mistake and runaway success may be difficult to see , you can still find it if you look hard enough .

Chinese and Hong Kong media said he was being questioned by the Public Security Bureau , with some reports focusing on stockmarket manipulation , others on corruption and one Hong Kong report referring to general " bribery and embezzlement earlier in Mr Huang 's career " .
The media 's enthusiasm for the story , despite the absence of any official confirmation , illustrates how many Chinese journalists and readers have come to expect that successful business people and officials cut corners to succeed .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. stocks dived and risk aversion rose on Wednesday as the financial crisis sparked a fresh round of bleak news and gave U.S. president - elect Barack Obama a grim welcome a day after his historic election .
With Obama ’s victory less than 24 hours old , U.S. and European equity markets tumbled and American and euro zone government debt rose in a flight to safety after data from the services sector pointed to a prolonged worldwide slowdown .
The three major U.S. equity indices all fell more than 5 percent , with the Dow pulled down the most by industrial icons Exxon Mobil , Boeing and United Technologies .
Company reports underscored the daunting task Obama faces when he takes office in January and tries to lead the United States and the world out of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
“ Even though there ’s a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement around the new president , I think it ’s going to be very difficult for anything quick to happen , ” said Dean Barber , president of investment firm Barber Financial Group in Kansas City .
“ Today we just had reality set in that , ” Barber said .
“ We ’re still losing jobs and we still have consumer spending at very low levels and we are heading into a holiday season that looks like it could be one of the worst . ”
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 486.01 points , or 5.05 percent , at 9,139.27 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX was down 52.98 points , or 5.27 percent , at 952.77 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 98.48 points , or 5.53 percent , at 1,681.64 .
Finance company GMAC LLC reported a $ 2.52 billion loss in the third quarter , hurt by slumping housing and auto markets , and said its Residential Capital LLC mortgage unit may fail .
United Technologies Corp UTX.N said it stood by its 2008 profit forecast , though a strengthening dollar could put results near the low end of the range .

United Technologies fell 6.2 percent .
In Europe a slew of bank results did little to lift a gloom that has darkened on a recurring trend of falling profits and rising provisions stemming from the deepening global crisis .
Euro zone service sector activity touched a fresh decade low in October , a final index reading showed , while a U.S. non-manufacturing report displayed weakness all around , with employment at its lowest on record and new orders tumbling .
“ The surveys continue to show record pessimism , ” Guillaume Menuet , an economist at Merrill Lynch in London , said about the European services data .
“ Sentiment has continued to deteriorate and it ’s obviously bad news for the economy in the fourth quarter . ”
European shares fell after six straight rising sessions as commodity shares tracked sharp losses in oil and metal prices .
ArcelorMittal MTP.PAISPA .AS , the world 's No. 1 steelmaker , forecast a weaker final quarter , slashed output and froze growth plans in the face of a global slowdown .
Its shares fell almost 16 percent .
Commodity stocks were one of the biggest sectoral losers on the index as crude oil prices fell about 6 percent , and copper , zinc and nickel prices slipped by between 3.7 and 6 percent .

“ Nothing immediately is going to change as a result of the election victory .
We still have n’t broken the downtrends , ” said Darren Winder , head of economics and strategy at Cazenove .

Just how low can Marilyn Musgrave go ?

I almost feel like the Presidential election did n’t happen .
You see , for the entire second half of Election Day , from almost noon until after midnight , Eastern time , I was aboard a Continental flight to Tokyo .
We had video - on - demand systems but not live satellite television , so as we arced over Canada , Alaska , and the northern reaches of the Pacific Ocean , we flew in ignorance .
As Jeremy Keith put it regarding his own flight to Japan , we were aboard Schrödinger ‘s Airplane .
For me , the wave collapsed as we began the initial descent toward Narita .
One of the flight attendants , having announced that they were starting the initial - descent procedures and would like us to check around our seats for any personal items we might like to start stowing , added : “ And for those of you interested in the results of the election , we have a new President : Barack Obama . ”
There was a burst of applause from the economy section of the plane .
In business class , there was silence .
Well , not quite .
I was myself sitting in business class , thanks to a great big pile of reward miles and some lucky timing in calling the airline .
As I heard her say Obama ’s name , I let out an involuntary “ Wow “ .
Because until that moment , deep down I had believed , truly believed , that Mr. Obama would not win the Presidency .
That was not the outcome I desired , but it was the outcome I expected .
I am in many ways ashamed of my doubts and fears , because I had thought less of my fellow Americans than they deserved .
Since then , from here in Tokyo , I ’ve felt weirdly disconnected from what ’s happened .
In time zone terms , I ’m fourteen hours in my home ’s future , half a day ahead of everyone back home .
But because I received word after it was all over and soon after slept through America ’s Wednesday daylight hours , I feel like I ’m a day behind .
Time and distance combine to create a feeling of disconnectedness from the end result , as though I ’m getting word of election results in Germany or India or Australia : interesting , but something seen at a remove .
It ’s odd .
I ’m used to being an observer , but this is something else entirely .
I think it ’s pure astonishment .
Quebec City , November 26 , 2007 - - Omega - 3 fatty acids protect the brain against Parkinson 's disease , according to a study by Université Laval researchers published in the online edition of the FASEB Journal , the journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology .
This study , supervised by Frederic Calon and Francesca Cicchetti , is the first to demonstrate the protective effect of a diet rich in omega - 3 fatty acids against Parkinson's .
Parkinson 's disease is caused by the progressive death of the neurons responsible for producing dopamine , a neurotransmitter closely linked with movement control .
The disease is usually diagnosed when 50 to 80 % of these neurons are already dead , and there is currently no medication to stop that process .
The Université Laval research team 's findings could help prevent the disease and , potentially , slow down its progression .
The researchers observed that when mice were fed an omega - 3 rich diet , they seemed immune to the effect of MPTP , a toxic compound that causes the same damage to the brain as Parkinson's .
" This compound , which has been used for more than 20 years in Parkinson 's research , works faster than the disease itself and is just as effective in targeting and destroying the dopamine - producing neurons in the brain , " points out Calon .
By contrast , another group of mice that were fed an ordinary diet developed the characteristic symptoms of the disease when injected with MPTP , including a 31 % drop in dopamine - producing neurons and a 50 % decrease in dopamine levels .
Analyses revealed that omega - 3 fatty acids -- in particular DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) , a specific type of omega - 3 - - had replaced the omega - 6 fatty acids already present in the brains of the mice that had been given omega - 3 supplementation .
" This demonstrates both the importance of diet on the brain 's fatty acid composition and the brain 's natural inclination for omega - 3 fatty acids , " observes Calon .
Since concentrations of other types of omega - 3's had remained similar in both groups of mice , researchers suggest that the protective effect against Parkinson 's comes essentially from DHA .
Another conclusion to be drawn from this finding is that a brain containing a lot of omega - 6 fatty acids may be a fertile ground for Parkinson 's disease .
These fatty acids , abundant in foods rich in either vegetable oil or animal fat , are already under suspicion for their role in the body 's inflammatory response , cardiac disease , arthritis , and Alzheimer's .
In a balanced diet , the ratio between omega - 6 and omega - 3 fatty acids should be 4 to 1 .
However , the average Western diet contains 10 to 20 times more omega - 6's than omega - 3's .
" In North America , the average intake of DHA is between 60 to 80 mg a day , while experts recommend a daily minimum of 250 mg , " explains Calon .
" Our results suggest that this DHA deficiency is a risk factor for developing Parkinson 's disease , and that we would benefit from evaluating omega - 3's potential for preventing and treating this disease in humans , " concludes the researcher .

So it has come to this .
Reviewing a tearoom .
What is the world coming to ?
Its senses ?
Because if this crisis does n't bring back the tearooms of yore , then I do n't know what will .
We do n't want Burgundy and foie gras , we want a nice cuppa and a scone .
As if they could see this whole thing coming , Marianna Hadjigeorgiou and Achilleas Agridiotis have knitted together an idyllic little tearoom on a sunny riverside street corner in villagey Barnes , south - west London .
Walls are lined with glossy tea canisters , while a marble - topped wooden counter is laden with cake stands and glorious - looking Konditor & Cook creations under a romantic chandelier .
Tucked in behind are three little rooms with white brick walls , wooden tables , kitsch tea cosies and darling little floral cups and saucers set on wooden panels as if caught mid-throw .
The simple , no - nonsense food runs to salads , house - made pies , pâté and cheese platters , cakes and scones , eggy breakfast options , and a vast array of made - to - order sandwiches .
I order two sarnies on doorstopper - thick wholemeal bloomer – one of moist , hand - carved Cypriot lounza ham and good cheddar ( £ 4.50 ) , the other of moist , lightly smoky salmon and lettuce ( £ 5.10 ) .
Both are a million miles from the over - refrigerated , overpackaged high - street strain .

Less successful is a bowl of minestrone soup ( £ 4.70 ) that is n't canned , but tastes as if it is , and a dull , solid wedge of cold chicken , asparagus and ham pie ( £ 7.50 ) .
Looking on the bright side – as we all must – this just leaves more room for cake and scones .
Hurrah !
A fruit scone comes with a little bowl of good jam and a big dollop of crusty clotted cream , for £ 2 .
It is , quite simply , a beautiful thing ; fresh and light , with none of the nasty bicarb aftertaste that has marred my last nine - trillion scones .
A slice of home - made walnut and coffee cake ( £3 ) also has a fine , moist crumb , without the gratuitous whipped cream or fashionable high - rise icing that ruins most contemporary baking .
And the tea ?
Having won the Time Out Award for London 's Best Tea Room 2008 , nobody here is about to toss a teabag into a mug any time soon .
Indeed , water temperature and infusing times are particular to each tea , and tea leaves are removed before serving to maintain a consistent tea strength ; all intelligent signs of respect for the only beverage that can save this nation from despair .
When I suggest Darjeeling , the manager frowns .
" Will you be taking milk ? "
She recommends a feistier Ceylon , which soon arrives in a fat - bellied pot ( £ 3.50 ) , beautifully brewed , clear and harmonious , with hints of vanilla and smoke .
I believe there is coffee here , too , but that 's not quite the point , is it ?
It was caffeine - fuelled , soy - milk latte - sippers who got us into this mess in the first place .
It is tea , and tearooms such as this , that will help us get through it .

The way we were : room with a brew
By Kate Burt
In the 1950s , Lyons teashops were a high - street institution .
With the need to blank out postwar gloom , but little money with which to do so , the British masses flocked to Lyons for a cup of tea , an affordable snack and a vital dose of escapism .
Having opened its first branch in 1894 , the Lyons teashop chain was followed in 1909 by the Lyons Corner House , a cross between a food hall and a modern shopping mall .
The scale was immense : each Corner House was spread over several floors with different restaurant styles on each – including the first Wimpy bars .
Ground floors featured musical entertainment and a food hall , selling items served in the cafeteria , which was the heart of each Corner House .
Before the war , customers had had table service from uniformed waitresses .
After it , the self - service cafeteria was born .
Such was the popularity of the idea that , in the early 1950s , queue barriers were routinely installed to control the crowds eager to gain entrance .
As Jonathan Pollard enters his 24th year in prison , his wife Esther says now is the most opportune time to demand his release .
Jonathan Pollard , the United States agent sent to jail for giving Israel information critical to the country 's security , is entering his 24th year in prison on Friday .
His wife Esther says now is the time to ask for clemency .

Esther Pollard called on supporters to let both the U.S government and the Israeli government know that people want Jonathan to be set free .
Supporters should pray as well , she added , saying “ We have to let the A - lmighty know that we the Jewish people , with all of our heart , are sorry that we let Jonathan languish for 24 years , and we want him home . ”
Police probe ' vigilante firebomb ' attack on home of man named on BNP list
A self - employed businessman whose name appeared on the leaked BNP membership list is believed to have been the intended target of vigilantes after a car was fire - bombed outside his house .
Jonathan Senior , 26 , who was a member of the far - right party until last year , was away from home when a vehicle belonging to his next door neighbour was set alight on Thursday evening .
The father - of - one was among 13,500 named on a list of members belonging to the BNP as of last year which was leaked on the internet and details occupations , phone numbers and email addresses .

Those identified on the list also include teachers , ministers of religion , doctors , nurses , two solicitors , members of the armed forces , several ' government employees ' and a small number of police officers .
One serving officer from Merseyside police has since been suspended from duty pending an investigation as the law forbids them from belonging to the BNP .
Mr Senior said he was on holiday when he received a telephone call from his sister - in - law telling him that a car had been fire - bombed in the street where he lives in Liversedge , West Yorkshire .
' I 'm not a member of the BNP , ' he said .
' I was last year but I let my membership lapse .
' As you can imagine I 'm pretty worried about what has happened as I have a young son .
' I heard about the list being published on the internet but I did n't think it would affect me because I 'm a lapsed member so it was an awful shock when I heard what had happened .
' My membership of the BNP was never a secret .
It 's just the political views I hold .
I 'm not racist either , it 's got nothing to do with colour .
' I joined the BNP because of local politics when I lived in nearby Heckmondwike .
At the time there were a lot of attacks carried out by Asian youths .
' There are still some streets you can't walk down without being attacked if you are white .
But after I moved from Heckmondwike there seemed no point of being a member of the BNP so I let it lapse . '
Mr Senior described the ' out - dated ' list as dangerous and said he was now considering moving to protect his family .
Police are now investigating the motive for the attack but say that Mr Senior 's inclusion on the BNP list is one of many lines of investigation .
Firefighters and police were called to the address at 10.40 pm and found a Peugeot 206 engulfed by flames .
No one was hurt , said a spokesman .
Eight houses on Eighth Avenue , in Liversedge , were cordoned off by police tape yesterday morning whilst two uniformed police officers stood by the cordon at either end of the road .
Firebomb : Police are investigating the burning of a car near the home of a BNP member
A charred patch of debris was also visible on the road and path outside one of the red brick semi-detached houses .
One resident , who did not want to be named , said the car belonged to her female next - door neighbour , and not Mr Senior .
' I was just nodding off when I heard this boom , ' she said .
' I looked out of the window and the car was on fire .
' My kids slept through it so I got them up , we jumped out of the back and ran .
' I honestly thought it was my house .
I thought someone had thrown something through my window . '
She added : ' There was nothing left of the car .
The roof was blown off , the windscreen was blown off , there were bits of car in my garden and bits of car in next door 's garden . '
Andrew Purdy , who lives on Eighth Avenue , said he was watching television when he heard the explosion .
' I looked outside and could n't see anything except black smoke .
' There were flames coming out of the car .
It was like a baked bean can , splattered all over .
The windscreen was in front of my house . '
The attack comes after Pc Steve Bettley , of Merseyside Police , was suspended as an investigation was launched into how his name appeared on the list .
The officer , who returned home early from a holiday , once worked for a temporary six - week period as personal driver for the force 's chief constable , Bernard Hogan Howe .
Liversedge is a small town just outside Huddersfield in West Yorkshire .

Officers are banned from joining or promoting the BNP because it would damage race relations , according to the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) .
The BNP list , which was removed from the original blog where it was posted , but remains available on other websites , names a number of current and former servicemen , along with ex-policemen .
BNP members first blamed former party staff for the leak , but later took the line that it was a plot hatched by Labour supporters .
Leader Nick Griffin pledged to take court action against those behind the leak , but he welcomed the wave of publicity that was generated .
David Exley , Kirklees organiser for the BNP , said he was ' shocked and surprised ' about the incident .
He said : ' I 've spoken to the police and they have confirmed that a car was fire - bombed and that one of the lines of inquiry is the person who lives next door to whose car it was is on the list on the internet .
' I can confirm that the gentleman confirmed , whose house the car was outside , is not a member of the BNP and is not a current supporter of the BNP . '
Mr Exley said it was disgraceful that the list had been published .
' That list covers everybody who has ever contacted our head office for whatever reason , ' he added .

It seems appropriate to initialise this blog with a release announcement , so here it is : the GHC developers commend the new GHC 6.10.1 release to the community !
There ’s plenty of juicy stuff in this release , here ’s the headlines :
New language Features Record syntax : wild - card patterns , punning , and field disambiguation Generalised quasi-quotes Generalised list comprehensions View patterns
Type families have been completely re-implemented
Now comes with Haddock 2 , which supports all GHC extensions
Parallel garbage collection
Base provides extensible exceptions
The GHC API is easier to use
External core ( output only ) now works again
Data Parallel Haskell ( DPH ) comes as part of GHC
Get all the details in the full release notes .
What ’s more , this release has undergone more testing and polishing than ever before , so we hope this will be one of the highest - quality GHC releases ever .
Our test suite has over 2200 individual test programs , each run 6 ways as part of our automated nightly builds , and at release time we had zero unexpected failures ( that is , all known bugs are logged in the bug tracker ) .
The Haskell Platform team have also been testing GHC 6.10.1 pre-releases against all of the packages on Hackage , to ensure that we can make this transition as smooth as possible .
You might notice some other improvements , such as parallel performance : there is ongoing work to analyse and improve the performance of parallel code , and some of that work made it into into 6.10.1 ( but there ’s a lot more to come , some of which can be found in the HEAD ) .
We have a new parallel garbage collector , which should probably be considered a “ technology preview ” : you get it by default when enabling multi-core execution with e.g.
+RTS - N4 , but keep an eye on the GC time with +RTS -s .
If you find that parallel GC is n’t helping , or is even making things worse , then tell us about it , and disable the parallel gc with - g1 .
Enjoy , and send us your bugs and feedback !
The Nike Air Classic BW is often overlooked by other Nike models that are usually more hyped , but surely this time will be an exception .
This Air Classic BW is inspired by the original Nintendo Entertainment System that was invented in the 1980’s .
Featuring many attributes of the game console , this pair of Air Classic BW was released this week at certain Nike retailers .
The two tones of gray used on this pair is split by a red stripe that goes around the whole shoe .
The effort put into this shoe by Nike is evident by the detail that can be seen through all the references to the NES such as the select / start buttons on the upper and the repeating image of the control pad seen from the swoosh on one side to the swoosh on the other side .
If you are interested , you might want to head quick to your Nike retailer because these will sell out quick .

The Republican National Committee apparently shelled out an eye - popping $ 150,000 to keep running mate Sarah Palin looking stylish in the short time since she was picked for the ticket , it was reported last night .
Among the expenses to keep the Alaska governor looking sharp were $ 49,425 at Saks Fifth Avenue stores in New York and St. Louis , Politico.com reported .

And there were also high - end shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis – a few miles from where the GOP National Convention was held – early last month , including one that produced a bill of $ 75,062 , the Web site reported .
Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt released a statement saying it was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign .
No expense was spared on hair and makeup either , according to the RNC ’s federal filings , with $ 4,716 going to those costs in Sep tember .
Disclosure reports prior to Palin ’s pick as John McCain ‘s running mate do n’t include any similar expenses , Politico said .
Palin spokeswoman Maria Comella told the Web site only , “ The campaign does not comment on strategic decisions regarding how financial resources available to the campaign are spent . ”
Palin ’s high - end designer clothes and her signature coif have landed her photos in several fashion magazines .
Meanwhile , Palin yesterday mocked Joe Biden for telling voters that America ’s enemies will immediately test Barack Obama if he ’s elected president .
“ He guaranteed that if Barack Obama is elected , we ’ll face an international crisis within the first six months of their administration , ” she said .
“ He told Democrat donors to mark his words – that there were ‘ at least four or five scenarios ’ that would place our country at risk in an Obama administration , ” Palin said on the stump in Reno , Nev .
“ I guess we gotta say , ‘ Well , thanks for the warning , Joe ! ’ ”
Palin said foreign dictators and terrorists will be less inclined to challenge McCain .
Palin also blasted Obama ’s positions on negotiating with Iran , the Iraq war , the Russian invasion of Georgia and invading Pakistan without the support of that country ’s government .
“ But I guess the looming crisis that most worries the Obama campaign right now is Joe Biden ’s next speaking engagement .
Let ’s call that crisis scenario number five , ” she quipped .
Also yesterday , Palin ripped Obama in her strongest language ever for not putting Hillary Rodham Clinton on his ticket .
“ When the time came to make a decision , Barack Obama could n’t bring himself to pick the woman who got 18 million votes in the primary , ” she said in Henderson , Nev .
“ The qualifications are there , but for some reason , the promotion never comes . ”
She then slammed Obama for paying women on his Senate staff only 83 cents for every dollar men earn .
An Obama spokesman said the men held more senior posts , and added that the Democratic candidate is stronger on the issue of equal pay for equal work .

There ’s been speculation for years that McCain ’s cancer may have metastasized , and yesterday , the NYT ’s medical expert echoed the same concerns .
Why does it matter ?
Because if McCain ’s serious bout of melanoma in 2000 was a metastasis , then his chances of living through his entire presidency plummet drastically .
And that means , President Palin .
It is n’t pretty , and it is n’t nice , to talk about whether John McCain will die in office .
But ignoring the prospect , and ending up with another president who is a blithering idiot ( Palin , like Bush ) , is not an acceptable option .
America went that route once .
Never again .
Here are some choice excerpts from the Times piece :
Last May , his campaign and his doctors released nearly 1,200 pages of medical information , far more than the three other nominees .
But the documents were released in a restricted way that leaves questions , even confusion , about his cancer .
A critical question concerns inconsistencies in medical opinions about the severity of his melanoma ; if the classification of his melanoma is more severe , it would increase the statistical likelihood of death from a recurrence of the cancer . …
By not allowing reporters to interview him or his doctors extensively about his entire medical history , he has made it impossible to get a complete picture of his diagnoses and treatment ….
In early August 2000 , just as Mr. McCain ’s rival George W. Bush was about to receive the Republican presidential nomination , Dr. John F. Eisold , the attending physician at the United States Capitol , detected two more melanomas , Mr. McCain ’s second and third .
One on Mr. McCain ’s left arm was determined to be the least risky type , in situ .
But the one on his left temple was dangerous .
A few days after detection of the melanomas , Mr. McCain sought care for them at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign said this year that the left - temple melanoma was 2.2 millimeters at its thickest part and graded as Stage IIA on a scale in which Stage IV is the worst .
Stage II meant that the melanoma had not spread into the lymph nodes .
The number of melanomas is less significant than the thickness measured in the pathology assessment of any one of them … .
The doctors said that a fourth melanoma they detected on the left side of his nose in 2002 was also in situ , the least dangerous type .
All four melanomas that Mr. McCain experienced were primary , or new , and there was no evidence that any of them had spread , the doctors said .
However , the reporters ’ summary cited a report dated Aug. 9 , 2000 , from two pathologists at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington who examined a biopsy of the melanoma taken from Mr. McCain ’s left temple a few days earlier .
The Armed Forces pathologists suggested that the left - temple melanoma had spread from another melanoma , known as a metastasis or satellite lesion .
“ The vertical orientation of this lesion , ” the report said , “ with only focal epidermal involvement above it is highly suggestive of a metastasis of malignant melanoma and may represent a satellite metastasis of S00 - 9572 - A , ” which is the “ skin , left temple , lateral ” biopsy … .
The Armed Forces pathologists did not speak in the teleconference in May 2008 , and questions raised by their report have remained unanswered .
The selected reporters did not ask about that report , and the Mayo Clinic doctors did not discuss it .
A complete Mayo pathology report was apparently not included in the pool summary .
In interviews , several melanoma experts questioned why the Mayo Clinic doctors had performed such extensive surgery , because the operation was usually reserved for treatment of Stage III melanoma , not Stage IIA … .
If Mr. McCain ’s 2000 left - temple melanoma was a metastasis , as the Armed Forces pathologists ’ report suggested , it would be classified as Stage III .
The reclassification would change his statistical odds for survival at 10 years from about 60 percent to 36 percent , according to a published study .
The greatest risk of recurrence of melanoma is in the first few years after detection .
His age , his sex and the presence of the melanoma on his face increase the risk .
The fact that Mr. McCain has had no recurrence for eight years is in his favor .
But cancer experts see the 10th anniversary as an important statistical benchmark , and that would not occur until 2010 .…
Melanomas can spread to various areas in the body , including the skin and any internal organ .
In general , such spreading means the melanoma would not be curable .
Treatment would depend in part on what organ or tissues are involved and could include additional surgery , chemotherapy , biologics , vaccines and radiation .
Many such treatments can be debilitating and impair an individual ’s physical and mental stamina .
If the patient was the president , the location of a recurrence and its treatment could raise the need to invoke the 25th Amendment , elevating the vice president to president , at least temporarily .
On the trail , Mr. McCain has played down concerns about his age by pointing to the vigor of his mother and her twin sister at age 96 .
Mr. McCain ’s father died in 1981 at age 70 after a heart attack .

We first learned about Mark Oshiro while following his Twitter updates as he marched on the Mormon Temple in Los Angeles last week .
Under the name Panasonicyouth , he provided other protesters and interested folks with a play by play of what was happening .
Then an update appeared : “ Holy shit some asshole in a truck ” and he went silent .
In a sign of how much the internet is shaping the protests , Twitter users spread news that something had happened to Oshiro and even ABC7 got involved in the story .
Hours later , another update : “ pacific station .
arrested .
help ” .
Oshiro , who along with his co-worker Richard Flores , was released later that night and are facing charges from the LAPD .
Â
Queerty asked him about the experience , what happens now and his advice to future protesters .
QUEERTY : I know you ca n’t talk about the events leading up to your arrest , but can you tell me what happened after ?
Mark Oshiro : Richard and I were both arrested after trying to help Maurice Carriere ( the protester assaulted by the guy in the truck with the Yes on 8 poster ) .
For what ?
We did n’t know , as we were n’t told ( definitively ) what our charges were going to be for over two and a half hours .
We spent a lot of time handcuffed to a bench with our heads against a wall .
My blog entry on the ordeal goes into detail more about the whole experience , but suffice to say it was pretty traumatizing , especially when you learn you ’re charged with battery on a peace officer .
I mean , really , I could n’t imagine a worse charge .
My brother thankfully bailed me out around 11:30 pm and my best friend Ramon was kind enough to bail Richard out ( literally ) right before midnight .
If he had been 5 minutes later , Richard would have had to stay in jail all night .
Why were you protesting ?
I know that sounds like an obvious question , but I think it ’s one people want to know .
Both gay rights and civil rights are important issues to me , so I ’ve been protesting various causes since I was in high school .
I had learned of the protest outside the Mormon temple at the rally the night before in West Hollywood .
I felt there was nothing more symbolic than protesting outside of a church that told its followers to pass a proposition that did n’t affect them , but affected those they were voting against .
I ’d met gay couples who had become married since our state Supreme Court had overturned Prop 22 and saw how destroyed they were that their marriage license might be dissolved because of a popular vote .
It seemed , to me , to be imperative that , as a gay man and as an activist , I show up and give my support and my voice to those who did n’t have it or who it needed it in unison with theirs .
You were Twittering while protesting and while you were arrested , people started talking about what was happening to you via Twitter .
When did you find out you ’d become an internet sensation ?
How did you feel ?
Oh man , thank the LORD for Twitter .
I do n’t know if anyone would have even known Rich and I were in jail if it was n’t for that godsend .
I had no idea if anyone knew what happened to us , so while I was being booked in , I asked for my phone to get phone numbers out to call my brother and my mom .
( This was n’t actually a lie ; I seriously did n’t know their numbers . )
While the officer was talking to the booking officer , I tried to send a Twitter ; my service went out immediately after I hit send .
So I opened my web browser and tried sending one that way .
I got the numbers out of my phone in the meantime and was then ordered to shut off my phone .
And that ’s when my infamous Twitter was sent out to the world : “ pacific station .
arrested .
help . ”
Even when I Twitter , I ’m melodramatic .
Awesome .
It was n’t until I was bailed out and turned on my phone that I realized the full scope of the last 11 hours .
I literally had so many text messages my SIM card on my Sidekick went haywire .
I had so many emails , it exceeded the capacity on my phone .
Then my friends in the lobby all told me about the liveblog on Buzznet and the ridiculous Twitter strings and the existence of a video they described as “ disturbing ” and “ horrifying . ”
What ’s going on with your case now ?
I wish I knew !
Richard and I spoke with the LA Gay and Lesbian Center ’s legal department yesterday and set up a consultation meeting ; we have an appointment with a Lambda Legal lawyer later this afternoon .
So , as far as we know , we ’re still charged with battery on a peace officer .
Our court date is December 3rd .
All we ’re doing is trying to spread the word about what happened to us and the importance of this issue , both here in California and in the rest of the country .
Richard ’s not too keen on the spotlight , but I myself am terrified of seeing this swept under the rug .
I know how often cases like this fall off the radar so quickly and perhaps because I ’m personally involved , I really do n’t want to see this happen .
There are protests scheduled for tomorrow in New York and across the country .
What words of advice do you have for demonstrators ?
Do n’t be anti-religious bigots , for one .
Protest a church ’s involvement in an election and protest their contribution to passing Prop 8 .
But do n’t turn it into a free - for - all on that church ’s tenets or members .
One , it makes absolutely no sense to do that .
Why protest the Mormon church ’s practice of polygamy , which was outlawed AGES AGO ?
It ’s no longer relevant .
Why protest anything else they believe in ?
Protest what they did , not who they are .
Do n’t be racist .
While I do n’t agree with the number of “ 70 % ” when it comes to how many people in the black community voted for Prop 8 , there ’s no denying the rampant homophobia that runs through that community .
But holy fuck , please do not turn this into a racist tirade against black people .
Not only is it not the point of the protest , but you ’re perpetrating the same hatred and ignorance you ’re charging them with .
Grow up and be mature about your charges against them .
Again , protest what they did , not who they are .
Do you plan on continuing to protest ?
Absolutely .
I went to the gigantic protest in Silverlake last Saturday ; I ’ll be attending a rally on the 15th , along with hundreds of thousands of other people around the world .
And I ’m trying to find a way to Sacramento on the 22nd to ( hopefully ) be one of a million people there .
I just plan on walking the opposite direction whenever I see riot gear .
Boston.com :
Ever since John McCain discovered " Joe the Plumber , " he has exalted " small business " owners -- inviting them to announce their professions on signs at rallies -- as the country 's only virtuous economic movers .
But now McCain has begun to define the term upward , leaving no mogul or tycoon behind .
On Thursday in Sarasota , Governor Charlie Crist introduced J. Robert Long , the CEO of Marine Concepts as a " small businessman . "
The man McCain dubbed " Bob the Boat Builder " spent , as Crist noted , most of his career at Wellcraft Marine , which reported revenues of $ 67 million last year , according to Yahoo !

Starting the week off on a sour note is nothing new for the markets .
Falling over 500 points today , the Dow continues a trend it started three months ago .
Since July , the Dow has posted gains on only 2 of the last 13 Mondays ( including today ) .
In fact , the index ’s performance on each of the last three Mondays has been particularly weak – with declines of 504 , 373 , and 778 points .
Other notable numbers on this weak Monday :
The Dow Industrials fell below 10,000 for the first time since October 2004 .
Recall , it first closed above 10,000 in March 1999 .
The Nasdaq Composite is poised for its first close below 1,900 since September 2004 .
The CBOE Volatility Index , often referred to as “ The VIX ” , has soared to levels not seen since the late 1980s .
Often used as a measure of fear in the markets , the VIX hit a high today of over 56 .
If these highs hold at the close , it will be the first time the VIX closes above 50 since November 1987 .

looks like you put a lot of work into these .
Too bad most of the abilities make them pure jokes .
You could easily modify these to be playable , then print them out .
If you use sleeves you can put them in front of regular cards and draft them , though you would need more cards than this to have a real game .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Some 40,000 Deutsche Post DPWGn.DE in the United States are at risk as the group steps up plans to turn round its loss - making DHL express delivery company there , a German newspaper report said on Sunday .
Citing internal sources , the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung ( FAS ) said of the total , 20,000 of jobs were threatened directly at Deutsche Post ’s U.S. express unit and the other half at U.S. partner firms .
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Post , which on Monday is due to report third - quarter earnings , on Sunday declined to comment on the figures mentioned in the newspaper report .
The U.S. business has been hit by shrinking investments from businesses amid the global economic crisis .
A Deutsche Post spokeswoman had said in October that her firm was cutting its U.S. ground network capacity by 30 percent faster than planned and could take further measures if necessary .
The company in May announced a $ 2 billion restructuring program for the U.S. express business , for which it expected to post a $ 1.3 billion loss before interest and tax this year .
THE SHOOTING : VIOLENCE VISITS SCIENTOLOGY
Thursday , September 26 , 1996
By Bryan Smith and David R. Anderson
of The Oregonian
Seven months ago , Jairus Chegero Godeka threatened to kill everyone in the Portland Church of Scientology unless they gave him $ 50,000 for ruining his life .
On Wednesday , police say , Godeka walked into the church 's downtown Portland office and shot and wounded four people , including a pregnant receptionist .
Godeka set a fire and briefly took another woman hostage at the church 's Portland Celebrity Centre before a police officer persuaded him to surrender .
The attack brought activity on Southwest Salmon Street and Broadway to a halt as police and firefighters massed in front of the office .
Workers in and around the Scientology center scrambled for cover after hearing shots , some turning back to see a bloody victim clutching his chest stumble onto the sidewalk .
Godeka apparently was motivated by a grudge against the church .
He blames the organization for ruining him financially and thinks it has kept him from bringing his sister here from Kenya to study , according to police reports .
In San Francisco , where Godeka lived recently , he sent a remote - controlled toy tank in front of the Church of Scientology branch , with the message : " Next time , it will be real . "
In February , he called the Portland offices , repeatedly demanding money for the ruin of what he described to police as a San Francisco company that sold lighting equipment .
The receptionist , Helen M. Burke , apparently was the primary target of Godeka 's threats because she was the one who answered the phone .
Burke , 44 and pregnant , was in critical condition Wednesday night at University Hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest and an abdominal injury .
Doctors said she had some paralysis from the bullet , which lodged near her spine , but that it was too early to tell whether the condition would be permanent .
Burke is in her second trimester ; the fetus was unharmed .
Two other victims , Steven Roy Crandell , 45 , and Carlos Colon , 24 , were in serious condition .
Crandell , executive director of the church , was shot in the abdomen .
Colon , a visitor from the church 's Clearwater , Fla. , branch , suffered a gunshot wound to the chest .
A third man , Jim M. Stone , was shot in the hip but did not realize he had been injured until nearly an hour later , when he pulled out his wallet and discovered a bullet had pierced it .
He smiled and waved as rescue workers wheeled him to an ambulance .
He was treated and released .
Wednesday 's attack occurred as the lunch crowd began to fill the downtown sidewalks near the church 's center at 709 S.W. Salmon St. , across from the Heathman Hotel .
Police said the gunman walked in the front door , carrying a red plastic gasoline container and a .45 - caliber Ruger semiautomatic handgun .
He shot Burke , who sat in the lobby just inside the door .
Crandell and Colon came downstairs , and he shot and wounded them .
Others hit the floor , while workers upstairs fled through a back door .
The gunman spread gasoline and started a fire that set off two sprinklers .
He grabbed a woman , Jacqueline Stone , the wife of Jim Stone , and headed through interior passages to a fire exit on the west end of the building .
Meanwhile , witnesses rushed to call 9 - 1 - 1 , including a man from inside the church who ran to Macheezmo Mouse next door .
" He was frantic , " said Jen Kneedler , 21 , who was working at the restaurant .
" He kept asking where a phone was and said that a person had been shot next door .
. . .
He said he had been shot at . "
Charles Mann , a course instructor who was upstairs in the church office , said , " We knew we had to get out of there .
We just heard shots and took off . "
Mel Murphy , on his way to lunch with a co-worker , saw men running and flames inside the building .
Crandell was hobbling down the sidewalk .
" He said , ' I 've been shot , I 've been shot , I 've been shot , ' " Murphy said .
Murphy , who had called 9 - 1 - 1 on a cellular phone , saw a second man , Colon , who had been shot in the stomach .
As Murphy helped with the two men , a co-worker Mike Picco tried to get in a door to help Burke .
Before he could , he said , " Someone yelled , " Gun !
There 's a guy with a gun !
Everyone dives behind cars . "
Portland firefighter Rob L. Burson was among the first to arrive .
He rushed to the office door just as the gunman burst out with his arm around Jacqueline Stone , a gun to her head .
" I saw what was going on , and I knew I did n't want to be there , " he said .
" I yelled ' gun ' and then ran and told others to get back . "
As the gunman opened a metal fire door , Portland police Officer Tom Mack and homicide Detective Sgt. Dave Rubey were on the sidewalk .
The gunman stepped back inside .
" My assessment was he wanted it to end right there , " Mack said .
" He said , ' I do n't want to die .
I do n't want you to shoot me . ' "
Mack decided a quick resolution was better than pushing the gunman back into a burning building with Stone .
Mack talked him into opening the door a crack .
He convinced the gunman that police would n't hurt him .
" My word was n't good enough for him , " Mack said .
The gunman wanted Mack to put down his gun .
First Mack tried to hide his gun behind his leg .
" He 's not that crazy , " Mack later reflected .
Mack agreed to put his gun down if the gunman did .
Mack knew there were other officers nearby .
Mack holstered his gun first .
But the gunman balked when he spotted another officer across the street with a gun .
So Mack went a step further , turning his back , briefly , on the gunman .
Mack told the officer to move .
" I think that was the turning point , " Mack said .
The gunman allowed Stone to kneel and then put down his gun behind her .
Then Godeka knelt and let Mack handcuff him .
Mack said everyone stayed cool during the standoff , which did n't last much longer than a minute .
Even the hostage did well .
Stone yelled through the closed door that Godeka was trying to talk to Mack .
She also told Mack to step closer and show his empty hands .
" She seemed pretty calm , " Mack said .
" I thought she handled herself really well . "
Firefighters quickly doused the blaze .
Godeka is accused of four counts of attempted aggravated murder , arson , kidnapping , three counts of first - degree assault , one count of second - degree assault and a count of burglary .
He will be arraigned today .
Wednesday 's attack was apparently the culmination of Godeka 's longstanding grudge against the Portland and San Francisco Church of Scientology offices .
Godeka has listed several addresses in Portland and San Francisco after numerous arrests on traffic violations , including drunken driving and driving without insurance .
In February , Godeka pleaded no contest to attempted coercion in connection with the calls to the church 's Portland branch .
" He could give me no specifics of what we had actually done to him and what his business was , " Burke told Portland police in February .
" He said he had lost everything that was dear to him . "
At one point , Godeka told Burke that his anger stemmed from something that had happened at the San Francisco branch , but that the Church of Scientology is all " the same thing . "
She said Godeka first came to the Portland office five or six years ago and took a free personality test and bought some books .
She thinks he might also have signed up for a home study course .
At least one earlier police report involved extortion attempts against the church , but details were not available Wednesday .
After Godeka was introduced to Scientology , " they imprisoned my mind to do what they wanted me to do , " he told police in February .
He also complained to police that the church got him deported to Kenya in 1986 and that Burke was controlling his mind .
The organization is a self - enhancement movement that emphasizes counseling and an approach to problem - solving called Dianetics that was created by church founder L. Ron Hubbard .
Jeff Quiros , special affairs director for the San Francisco church , said Godeka also had threatened workers there in recent months .
" He was just babbling and threatening to kill everybody .
He was just saying things that did n't make sense , " Quiros said .
The news Wednesday shocked the San Francisco church .
" How can you make sense of senseless acts of violence ? " Quiros said .
" It 's a scary thing .
I do n't know what would make someone do something like that . "
" It 's disturbing , and it 's shocking , " added Angie Mann , public affairs director for the Portland center .
" Scientologists are honest , ethical people who want to help .
Our goal is toward a world without crime and a world without insanity . "

GODEKA'S ODD ACTIONS TRACE BACK TO 1987
Friday , October 4 , 1996
By Phil Manzano
of the Oregonian Staff
Jairus C. Godeka conversed freely with the television set .
He would laugh aloud for no reason .
He said the FBI was watching him and bugging his telephone .
He heard voices that commented incessantly on his behavior .
Godeka spun out these and more suspicions and fears during a 1987 interview at a Northeast Portland mental health clinic .
But never once did he mention what was to become a grinding obsession - the Church of Scientology .
Godeka is scheduled to be formally arraigned today on 13 counts accusing him of shooting and wounding four people , holding a fifth person hostage and trying to set fire to the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre in downtown Portland on Sept. 25 .
Church officials say Godeka was n't a member and are baffled by the attack and his claims that Scientology drove him crazy , ruined his business and owed him $ 50,000 .
Godeka 's mental state and fixation with Scientology are apt to be key issues in his trial .
No trial date has been set .
But a review of public documents and an interview with his former wife show Godeka already was a troubled soul in a foreign land , lost in dreams of success and alcohol - fueled paranoia long before he walked into the Celebrity Centre with a .45 - caliber Ruger semiautomatic handgun .
He was a long way from home .
" He came here to get an education in business and marketing , " said Christina Hamilton , who was married to Godeka for several years in the 1980s .
" He wanted to make his parents proud . "
Born and raised in Nairobi , Kenya , Godeka , 38 , is the second - oldest of nine children .
He came to the United States about 1979 and was a student at Clark College in Vancouver , Wash .
He was working at a restaurant when he met Hamilton .
On Dec. 27 , 1980 , they married .
" It was n't so bad when we were first married , " Hamilton said , but it soon soured .
She said she left when she could n't handle Godeka 's drinking and fighting .
Hamilton said Godeka had an almost - daily drinking habit , but underneath it all , he was a good and intelligent man .
He spoke four or five languages and wanted to succeed .
" He wooed me off my feet , " Hamilton recalled , and he also impressed her parents , who often took him camping and fishing .
She thinks it was about 1985 , with their relationship almost over , when Godeka first mentioned Scientology to her .
He had gone by their downtown center at 709 S.W. Salmon St. , bought a few books and possibly taken a personality test .
- Church not mentioned again
She was angry that he had spent the money , about $ 200 , but he never talked about it again .
Scientology spokeswoman Gail Armstrong said Godeka did buy some books but said the most he would have spent was $ 60 .
In police reports , Godeka said he only gave the church $ 40 one time .
" That would 've been the long and short of it , " Armstrong said .
She and other church officials are galled that Godeka blames Scientology for his troubles .
They see the shooting as evidence of their belief that psychiatric treatment does n't help its patients but instead makes them worse or violent .
By 1987 , Godeka 's marriage was finished and his mental state crumbling .
Godeka 's longtime friend , Ahmed Brima , took him to the North / Northeast Community Mental Health Center in Northeast Portland .
Brima was concerned about his roommate 's bizarre behavior : talking to the television set , hearing voices and laughing oddly .
Godeka denied he had any problems , but an intake assessment said he admitted hearing voices , feared the FBI was watching him and harbored suicidal thoughts .
But he had no plans to harm himself , " especially since this would bring shame to his parents in Africa , " the mental health center report said .
" He would rather go home to Africa than to hang himself in the United States . "
- Clinic prescribes medicine
The report said Godeka admitted drinking heavily but that he had tried to quit cold about six weeks earlier .
He exhibited signs of paranoid schizophrenia , for which the clinic prescribed medication .
Two days after the exam , Godeka was arrested in Vancouver when he threw a brick through the window of a bank .
He was released after several days but never showed up for his trial .
After police caught up with him , he pleaded guilty in November 1988 to malicious mischief and bail jumping .
The troubled thoughts he described at the mental clinic in 1987 became part of that court record .
By 1989 , it was clear Godeka had a fixation with Scientology .
He had stopped seeing his Vancouver probation officer .
After their last visit in July , the officer wrote that Godeka appeared confused and agitated .
" He stated that his deteriorating mental condition was brought on by the Church of Scientology , where he had taken a communications skills class four years ago in Portland , Oregon , and whenever he goes to Portland they have mind control over him , and he can no longer control his behavior . "
In February 1993 , Godeka was living in San Francisco and had his own business , called Phoenix Lighting , where he went door - to - door to downtown businesses and sold lights .
- More contacts with church
But Godeka 's contacts with Scientologists escalated .
Church officials in San Francisco said Godeka appeared outside the church occasionally during the past two years and threatened them .
One time , they said , he showed up at the church with a remote - controlled toy tank bearing the sign " Next time , it will be real . "
In Portland , Scientology officials called police in February 1994 because Godeka called and allegedly demanded $ 50,000 or he would kill them .
Then in February , Portland police arrested Godeka after he demanded money and made death threats at the Celebrity Centre .
Police confiscated two handguns and ammunition from Godeka 's North Portland motel room .
Godeka was jailed briefly , then released .
He returned to San Francisco , where he got into trouble in July .
He attacked a man on the street with a hammer , but the victim was afraid to pursue the case .
Hamilton had n't seen Godeka for nearly 10 years .
Then on Sept. 25 , she saw her ex-husband 's face , a photograph on television .
" I was shocked , horrified , dumbfounded , at a loss for words , " she said .
" He must have been drinking to have done that kind of violence .
His face had that look he used to have when he was drunk .
That was not the face of the man I married . "
Thursday , a Multnomah County grand jury indicted Godeka on 13 counts , including attempted aggravated murder , kidnapping , and arson .
He is being held at the Justice Center Jail on nearly $ 800,000 bail .
All but one of the four people shot at the Celebrity Centre that day are recuperating at home .
Helen Burke , 44 , remains in fair condition Thursday at University Hospital .
Carlos Colon , 24 , and Steven Crandell , 45 , have been released from the hospital and are expected to make full recoveries .
Jim M. Stone , 43 , who was only grazed by a bullet , was treated and released the day of the shooting .
Godeka 's lawyer , Kerry Chipman , said his client will plead not guilty .
Stuart Tomlinson and John Painter Jr. of The Oregonian staff contributed to this report .

COURT PLANS TO CONSIDER SCIENTOLOGY SHOOTINGS
Friday , March 20 , 1998
By David R. Anderson
of The Oregonian
The man who went on a shooting rampage and set fire to downtown Portland 's Scientology Celebrity Centre probably will agree to be found guilty but insane today .
Jairus Chegero Godeka , 39 , could spend the rest of his life in the Oregon State Hospital , said his attorney , Kerry Chipman .
`` Given the facts of the case , it 's certainly a better resolution than several consecutive 20 - year terms in prison , '' Chipman said .
At the least , Godeka probably would spend 20 years in the hospital under the supervision of the Psychiatric Security Review Board , Chipman said .
Psychologists chosen by the state and Godeka 's defense agreed that Godeka suffers from schizophrenia , Chipman said .
For about the past 15 years , Godeka has heard voices and thought he is controlled by other people and that ideas are being planted in his mind .
That was the case on Sept. 25 , 1996 , when Godeka walked into the Scientology center at 709 S.W. Salmon St. Police said he went into the center 's reception area with a red can of gasoline and shot a woman at the lobby desk .
The gunshot paralyzed her from the waist down .
Godeka also is accused of shooting two men who went to the woman 's aid in the center .
A third man discovered he had been wounded about an hour after the incident .
All four survived the shooting .
Godeka held a fifth person hostage before police talked him into surrendering .
`` He truly believed the Scientologists in general had ruined his life , had controlled him with mind control and got him to do things unconsciously , '' Chipman said .
`` He was quite convinced that Scientology was a threat to the world at large . ''
Godeka had limited contact with Scientologists in Portland and San Francisco before the incident .
Under medication and treatment at the state hospital since January 1997 , Godeka was found in February to be able to help in his defense .
`` When he 's not delusional , he 's a very nice guy , '' Chipman said .
Greg Horner , a Multnomah County deputy district attorney , confirmed Thursday that Godeka faces a stipulated facts trial today before Multnomah County Circuit Judge William Keys .
He would not comment further on the case .
In a stipulated facts trial , the defense and prosecution agree that witnesses and police would testify to certain facts , if there were a trial .
Police reports will be presented to the judge , but no one will testify .
Godeka faced four counts of attempted aggravated murder , arson , one count of kidnapping , three counts of first - degree assault , one count of second - degree assault and one count of burglary .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. soldier convicted of rape and murder two decades ago will be executed December 10 in the nation 's first military execution since 1961 , the Army said Thursday .
Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military 's death row at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , since 1988 .
A court - martial panel sitting at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the Fayetteville , North Carolina , area , and sentenced him to death .
Gray 's execution by injection will be carried out by Fort Leavenworth soldiers at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute , Indiana , the Army said in a news release .
Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg .
He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post .
Both military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes , which were committed between April 1986 and January 1987 .
Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms .
The general court - martial at Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes .
In July , President George W. Bush approved the Army 's request to execute Gray .
" The president took action following completion of a full appellate process , which upheld the conviction and sentence to death , " the Army said in the news release .
" Two petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied during the appellate processing of Pvt. Gray 's case . "
Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history , but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , the military 's modern - day legal system .
The Army also sought Bush 's authorization to execute another condemned soldier , Pvt. Dwight Loving , who was convicted of robbing and killing two cab drivers in 1988 .
The last U.S. military execution was in 1961 , when Army Pvt. John Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11 - year - old Austrian girl .
Bennett was sentenced in 1955 .
The U.S. military has n't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since President John F. Kennedy commuted a death sentence in 1962 .
Nine men are on military death row .

Zaidi also flogged himself during the ceremony A devout Shia Muslim has been given a suspended prison sentence for making two boys beat themselves during a religious ceremony .
A jury at Manchester Crown Court found Syed Mustafa Zaidi , 44 , guilty of two counts of child cruelty last month .
The boys , aged 13 and 15 , were urged to beat themselves with a zanjeer whip , with five curved blades .
Zaidi , of Station Road , Eccles , was given a 26 - week sentence , suspended for 12 months .
A second order which will also last for 12 months means that if Zaidi is found to have allowed or encouraged anyone under the age of 16 to beat themselves he could be returned to court for sentencing .
Zaidi was convicted by the jury last month after they accepted the prosecution 's case - namely that he had made the boys take part in the ceremony .
However , Judge Robert Atherton , sentencing on Wednesday , said : " I reject the suggestion that they were forced to participate , although I consider it likely that the fervour of events is also likely to have affected their wish to participate . "
The sensitivities this case raised are significant
Supt Paul Savill
The boys both received multiple lacerations to their backs , mainly superficial , with several deeper cuts caused by the bladed whip .
They admitted they wanted to beat themselves , but not under duress and not using Zaidi 's zanjeer .
Zaidi also flogged himself during the Ashura ceremony , which commemorates the death of Husayn - a central figure in the Shia faith - in January this year .
He admitted he allowed the boys to use the bladed whip , but denied his actions were wrong , saying : " This is a part of our religion . "
Wrongful act Judge Atherton said that the jury 's verdict was " not a comment " on the Ashura ceremony .
" No - one should misinterpret it as being such , " he said .
" You must realise that the law recognises that children and young persons may wish to take part in some activities which it considers they should not .
" It is sometimes expressed as protecting themselves from themselves .
" Your wrongful act was providing the means by which they were able to participate . "
The boys both suffered cuts from the zanjeer
He said Zaidi ignored a decision by mosque elders that under - 16s could not participate in the ceremony .
Supt Paul Savill , of Greater Manchester Police , said : " This man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but also went against the wishes of his own community , as well as knowingly breaking the law .
" The sensitivities this case raised are significant and we have been working closely with community leaders throughout . "
A code of conduct for adults about involving children in the self - flagellation ritual has been drawn up since Zaidi was convicted , Supt Savill said .
Local Muslim leader Safdar Zia said the ceremony could not be eliminated .
" We can and will work to a code of practice so that the children do n't get hurt , the law is n't broken , and the people who do want to take part do n't get prosecuted , " he said .
" But we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance we 've got to prevent any harm being brought against any children . "
The case was unprecedented - the first of its kind to be prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales .

When I say broke , we were the first news site OR blog to run the story .
About 80 - 90 minutes after our post went up , ZDNet Australia ran the same story with identical talking points .
Not out and out plagiarism , but the similarities were very strong .
The next outlet to run with it was 2 hours later again .
When I put the post up , I ’d manually linked to the post on Twitter because I thought it might be of interest as well .
I do n’t begrudge the fact that ZDNet lifted the story at all , or even basically copied the talking points with a slight re-write .
But I do take great umbrage with the fact that they did n’t attribute it .
I Twittered my disgust on Tuesday , and thought really nothing more about it until today , when I receive a tweet from ZDNet News Editor Renai LeMay asking for details .
I sent him my concerns , and this is the response I got .
Firstly let me say that I completely understand your concerns .
Thanks for your email , and I hope everything is well at the Inquisitr .
I respect what the Inquisitr is doing as an independent Australian media organisation , and what you are personally doing as a leading light of new media internationally and in this country .
The article you were referring to was written by Alex Serpo , one of our in - house journalists , and edited by myself .
Firstly , let me say that I think this email exchange illustrates the fact that there are different points of view on this sort of issue from different media organisations .
When a story breaks elsewhere , that ZDNet.com .au wants to have on its site , we attempt to find primary sources ( eg , a press release , or calling people up for info ) , and write our own article .
We do n’t usually refer to or use material from other media organisations as we have no way to verify whether their information is correct ( and they may have left something out ) .
Given we are part of CBS , and our articles are re-published worldwide , for us to take any other approach would be inappropriate .
We do n’t generally link back to whoever has broken a story first .
I am aware that this is a standard technique in the blogosphere , but we do n’t follow it here as per current editorial guidelines .
The bolding is mine , but it ’s the key line .
We also WERE the primary source .
And then he takes the cowards defense after all but fessing up to the fact they ’d lifted the story .
I ’d note at this point that 2 hours after they posted , news.com.au in their article noted that they were unable to confirm the story with the Prime Ministers office or ANY OTHER PLACE ; so ZDNet magically got a better source than Australia ’s largest media organization ?
The story was n’t on either the KevinPM site or the official PM site , there was no press release , nothing at the time ( I did my homework … indeed , I ’d sat on the story for nearly an hour trying to confirm it ) .
The only thing confirming at the time was a link to the Twitter account from the KevinPM site .
Also I ’d note , the talking points they ran were nearly IDENTICAL to our post .
I do n’t believe in coincidences , at least not this many .
In this specific case , that story broke simultaneously in a number of different ways — on the Inquisitr , on Rudd ’s own site , people messaging us to let us know , etc .
With this in mind , we went back to primary sources ( Rudd and Turnbull ’s own pages , and our own kn ) and wrote our own story .
Most of all I ’m disappointed by LeMay ; he was a great journalist at the Financial Review , but anything he learned in journalism school has been replaced by him doing his employers bidding .
This idea that your do n’t source stories in rubbish ; mainstream media sites reference stories day in , day out , in both articles and blogs , and give me 2 hours and I could probably find thousands of examples in the mainstream media of them doing so ; at the least saying where it came from without a link , with best practice with the link .
ZDNet , at least in Australia , is morally bankrupt .
If what LeMay says is true of the whole organization , then the entire company is .
Responding to the economic downturn , Wal - Mart Stores Inc. plans to give more than 90 million pounds of fresh food annually to the nation ’s largest nonprofit organization addressing hunger , Feeding America .
The program , which is being formally announced on Wednesday , comes as food banks across the nation are reporting increased demand , though Margaret McKenna , president of the Wal - Mart Foundation , which oversees the company ’s giving program , said the gift would continue far beyond the immediate crisis .
“ We are a strong company , and we share what we have with people in need , ” Ms. McKenna said .
The company will not seek a tax deduction for its gift , she said , and thus could not estimate its dollar value .
Wal - Mart ’s annual donation will account for more than 4 percent of the roughly 2.2 billion pounds Feeding America , formerly known as America ’s Second Harvest , distributed last year .
Vicki Escarra , president and chief executive of the organization , said it planned to increase that amount to 3 billion pounds a year over the next four years .

WASHINGTON -- National City Bank weathered the Civil War and the Great Depression , but it could n't survive a Treasury Department plan that was supposed to help banks .
So a Northeast Ohio congressman on Tuesday called a higher authority : President Bush .
This was the latest attempt by Rep.
Steve LaTourette , Republican of Bainbridge Township , to keep the Cleveland bank from a year - end , fire - sale purchase by PNC Financial Services Group of Pittsburgh .
" I want President Bush to know what 's going on , " LaTourette said in an interview after a congressional hearing at which he asked the Treasury Department to reconsider its denial of federal bailout money to help National City .
" He may stand behind his man ; he 's a pretty loyal guy , " LaTourette said , referring to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as the president 's man .
" But I would hope they participate in a way that says , ' Let 's look at the facts . ' "
Video of LaTourette - Paulson exchange by American News Project .
LaTourette 's proposed meeting with Bush or his representative , Paulson and Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan has not been scheduled , although the congressman hopes to know by the end of the week when and where it might take place .
LaTourette said he wants the meeting " because National City Bank was one of the best capitalized banks in the country , " yet one that , according to banking analysts , " was taken down by the government .
That 's not what this program was supposed to do . "
Treasury Department regulators in October determined that despite nearly $ 100 billion in deposits and $ 150 billion in assets , National City was in too poor of shape to qualify for TARP , the Troubled Asset Relief Program that is part of the financial services bailout bill Congress approved last month .
That lack of confidence apparently was due in large part to National City 's nearly $ 20 billion in risky loans .
After the Treasury Department 's decision , National City 's board of directors recommended selling the Cleveland institution , which dates to 1845 , to PNC for $ 2.23 a share .
LaTourette said he understands the part about the bad assets .
" But that evaluation is presuming that the economy never gets better , those assets never have any value , and that 's not a good way to measure something when you 're dealing with a bank that 's been around forever . "
At the hearing Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee , he asked Paulson why he refused help to a bank with 29,000 employees in nine states , and urged him to reconsider .
Paulson said he would be " perfectly happy " to discuss the decision with Dugan .
But Paulson also stressed his " great confidence " in Dugan 's judgment .
" I believe , based upon generally what I know , that he made the right decision , " said Paulson , who emphasized that he relies on regulators like Dugan to be sure the TARP is n't " used to prop up failing banks , or banks that might fail . "
" If there 's a bank that is in distress and it is acquired by a well - capitalized bank , there is more capital in the system , more available for lending , better for communities , better for everyone , " Paulson said .
PNC not only is well - capitalized , but it also has been approved for TARP money -- and will get National City 's would - be share , too , estimated at up to $ 4 billion , if the $ 5.6 billion sale goes through .
PNC also will get a $ 5 billion tax break for assuming National City 's bad loans .
" Basically , they are going to purchase the seventh - largest bank in the country for free , " LaTourette said .
National City would not discuss whether it would accept TARP money if Paulson changed his mind .
" We have no comment on today 's hearing , " said spokeswoman Kristen Baird Adams .
North Carolina Democrat Mel Watt echoed LaTourette 's concerns about the Treasury Department " influencing who is a winner and is a loser . "
Watt cited Treasury 's treatment of Charlotte 's Wachovia Bank , which Wells Fargo is purchasing .
" There are a number of people in my community who believe that had a different set of decisions been made regarding Wachovia , Wachovia would still be a viable institution today , " he said .
Other committee members grilled Paulson on his failure to use money in the $ 700 billion bailout package to reduce mortgage foreclosures .
Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the committee , put in the hearing record a letter from Rep. Dennis Kucinich in which the Cleveland Democrat urged Congress to withhold more TARP money from the Treasury Department because of its failure to act on foreclosures .
New York Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman called the Treasury Department 's decision to avoid buying troubled mortgages from banks , as it originally promised , " the second - largest bait - and - switch scheme that history has ever seen , second only to the reasons given us to vote for the invasion of Iraq . "
Paulson said that the money had to be used to prevent a collapse in the financial system and that the Treasury Department is still looking for ways to reduce foreclosures .
Others questioned Paulson about whether he would favor using TARP money to aid automobile manufacturers .
Paulson suggested that instead , Congress help the industry with money from a bill that included $ 25 billion for auto plants to produce higher - efficiency vehicles .
But , Paulson added , " We do not believe that it is desirable to have an auto company fail with the economy in its current situation . "

This is the first in a three - part series on the outsourcing of passports .
The United States has outsourced the manufacturing of its electronic passports to overseas companies — including one in Thailand that was victimized by Chinese espionage — raising concerns that cost savings are being put ahead of national security , an investigation by The Washington Times has found .
The Government Printing Office ’s decision to export the work has proved lucrative , allowing the agency to book more than $ 100 million in recent profits by charging the State Department more money for blank passports than it actually costs to make them , according to interviews with federal officials and documents obtained by The Times .
The profits have raised questions both inside the agency and in Congress because the law that created GPO as the federal government ’s official printer explicitly requires the agency to break even by charging only enough to recover its costs .
Lawmakers said they were alarmed by The Times ’ findings and plan to investigate why U.S. companies were n’t used to produce the state - of - the - art passports , one of the crown jewels of American border security .
“ I am not only troubled that there may be serious security concerns with the new passport production system , but also that GPO officials may have been profiting from producing them , ” said Rep. John D. Dingell , the Michigan Democrat who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Officials at GPO , the Homeland Security Department and the State Department played down such concerns , saying they are confident that regular audits and other protections already in place will keep terrorists and foreign spies from stealing or copying the sensitive components to make fake passports .
“ Aside from the fact that we have fully vetted and qualified vendors , we also note that the materials are moved via a secure transportation means , including armored vehicles , ” GPO spokesman Gary Somerset said .
But GPO Inspector General J. Anthony
Ogden , the agency ’s internal watchdog , does n’t share that confidence .
He warned in an internal Oct. 12 report that there are “ significant deficiencies with the manufacturing of blank passports , security of components , and the internal controls for the process . ”
The inspector general ’s report said GPO claimed it could not improve its security because of “ monetary constraints . ”
But the inspector general recently told congressional investigators he was unaware that the agency had booked tens of millions of dollars in profits through passport sales that could have been used to improve security , congressional aides told The Times .
Decision to outsource
GPO is an agency little - known to most Americans , created by Congress almost two centuries ago as a virtual monopoly to print nearly all of the government ’s documents , from federal agency reports to the president ’s massive budget books that outline every penny of annual federal spending .
Since 1926 , it also has been charged with the job of printing the passports used by Americans to enter and leave the country .
When the government moved a few years ago to a new electronic passport designed to foil counterfeiting , GPO led the work of contracting with vendors to install the technology .
Each new e-passport contains a small computer chip inside the back cover that contains the passport number along with the photo and other personal data of the holder .
The data is secured and is transmitted through a tiny wire antenna when it is scanned electronically at border entry points and compared to the actual traveler carrying it .
According to interviews and documents , GPO managers rejected limiting the contracts to U.S. - made computer chip makers and instead sought suppliers from several countries , including Israel , Germany and the Netherlands .
Mr. Somerset , the GPO spokesman , said foreign suppliers were picked because “ no domestic company produced those parts ” when the e-passport production began a few years ago .
After the computer chips are inserted into the back cover of the passports in Europe , the blank covers are shipped to a factory in Ayutthaya , Thailand , north of Bangkok , to be fitted with a wire Radio Frequency Identification , or RFID , antenna .
The blank passports eventually are transported to Washington for final binding , according to the documents and interviews .
The stop in Thailand raises its own security concerns .
The Southeast Asian country has battled social instability and terror threats .
Anti-government groups backed by Islamists , including al Qaeda , have carried out attacks in southern Thailand and the Thai military took over in a coup in September 2006 .
The Netherlands - based company that assembles the U.S. e-passport covers in Thailand , Smartrac Technology Ltd. , warned in its latest annual report that , in a worst - case scenario , social unrest in Thailand could lead to a halt in production .
Smartrac divulged in an October 2007 court filing in The Hague that China had stolen its patented technology for e-passport chips , raising additional questions about the security of America ’s e-passports .
Transport concerns
A 2005 document obtained by The Times states that GPO was using unsecure FedEx courier services to send blank passports to State Department offices until security concerns were raised and forced GPO to use an armored car company .
Even then , the agency proposed using a foreign armored car vendor before State Department diplomatic security officials objected .
Concerns that GPO has been lax in addressing security threats contrast with the very real danger that the new e-passports could be compromised and sold on the black market for use by terrorists or other foreign enemies , experts said .
“ The most dangerous passports , and the ones we have to be most concerned about , are stolen blank passports , ” said Ronald K. Noble , secretary general of Interpol , the Lyon , France - based international police organization .
“ They are the most dangerous because they are the most difficult to detect . ”
Mr. Noble said no counterfeit e-passports have been found yet , but the potential is “ a great weakness and an area that world governments are not paying enough attention to . ”
Lukas Grunwald , a computer security expert , said U.S. e-passports , like their European counterparts , are vulnerable to copying and that their shipment overseas during production increases the risks .
“ You need a blank passport and a chip and once you do that , you can do anything , you can make a fake passport , you can change the data , ” he said .
Separately , Rep. Robert A. Brady , chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing , has expressed “ serious reservations ” about GPO ’s plan to use contract security guards to protect GPO facilities .
In a Dec. 12 letter , Mr. Brady , a Pennsylvania Democrat , stated that GPO ’s plan for conducting a security review of the printing office was ignored and he ordered GPO to undertake an outside review .
Questionable profits
GPO ’s accounting adds another layer of concern .
The State Department is now charging Americans $ 100 or more for new e-passports produced by the GPO , depending on how quickly they are needed .
That ’s up from a cost of around just $ 60 in 1998 .
Internal agency documents obtained by The Times show each blank passport costs GPO an average of just $ 7.97 to manufacture and that GPO then charges the State Department about $ 14.80 for each , a margin of more than 85 percent , the documents show .
The accounting allowed GPO to make gross profits of more than $ 90 million from Oct. 1 , 2006 , through Sept. 30 , 2007 , on the production of e-passports .
The four subsequent months produced an additional $ 54 million in gross profits .
The agency set aside more than $ 40 million of those profits to help build a secure backup passport production facility in the South , still leaving a net profit of about $ 100 million in the last 16 months .
GPO was initially authorized by Congress to make extra profits in order to fund a $ 41 million backup production facility at a rate of $ 1.84 per passport .
The large surplus , however , went far beyond the targeted funding .
The large profits raised concerns within GPO because the law traditionally has mandated that the agency only charge enough to recoup its actual costs .
According to internal documents and interviews , GPO ’s financial officers and even its outside accounting firm began to inquire about the legality of the e-passport profits .
To cut off the debate , GPO ’s outgoing legal counsel signed a one - paragraph memo last fall declaring the agency was in compliance with the law prohibiting profits , but offering no legal authority to back up the conclusion .
The large profits accelerated , according to the officials , after the opinion issued Oct. 12 , 2007 , by then - GPO General Counsel Gregory A. Brower .
Mr. Brower , currently U.S. Attorney in Nevada , could not be reached and his spokeswoman had no immediate comment .
Fred Antoun , a lawyer who specializes in GPO funding issues , said the agency was set up by Congress to operate basically on a break - even financial basis .
“ The whole concept of GPO is eat what you kill , ” Mr. Antoun said .
“ For the average taxpayer , for them to make large profits is kind of reprehensible . ”
Likewise , a 1990 report by Congress ’ General Accounting Office stated that “ by law , GPO must charge actual costs to customers , ” meaning it ca n’t mark up products for a profit .
Like the security concerns , GPO officials brush aside questions about the profits .
Agency officials declined a request from The Times to provide an exact accounting of its e-passport costs and revenues , saying only it would not be accurate to claim it has earned the large profits indicated by the documents showing the difference between the manufacturing costs and the State Department fees .
Questioned about its own annual report showing a $ 90 million - plus profit on e-passports in fiscal year 2007 alone , the GPO spokesman Mr. Somerset would only say that he thinks the agency is in legal compliance and that “ GPO is not overcharging the State Department . ”
Mr. Somerset said 66 different budget line items are used to price new passports and “ we periodically review our pricing structure with the State Department . ”
Public Printer Robert Tapella , the GPO ’s top executive , faced similar questions during a House subcommittee hearing on March 6 .
Mr. Tapella told lawmakers that increased demand for passports — especially from Americans who now need them to cross into Mexico and Canada — produced “ accelerated revenue recognition , ” and “ not necessarily excess profits . ”
GPO plans to produce 28 million blank passports this year up from about 9 million five years ago .
A State Department consular affairs spokesman , Steve Royster referred questions to GPO on e-passports costs .
Congress to weigh in
GPO ’s explanations have not satisfied lawmakers , who are poised to dig deeper .
Mr. Dingell , the House Commerce chairman , said The Times ’ findings are “ extremely serious to both the integrity of the e-passport program and to U.S. national security ” and he has asked an investigative subcommittee chaired by Rep.
Bart Stupak , Michigan Democrat , to begin an investigation .
“ Our initial inquiry suggests that more needs to be done to understand whether the supply chain is secure and fully capable of protecting the manufacturing of this critical document , ” Mr. Dingell told The Times .
Mr. Stupak said that considering the personal information contained on e-passports , “ it is essential that the entire production chain be secure and free from potential tampering . ”
He added : “ The GPO needs to make every effort to ensure that future passport components are made in America under the tightest security possible . ”
Michelle Van Cleave , a former National Counterintelligence Executive , said outsourcing passport work and components creates new security vulnerabilities , not just for passports .
“ Protecting the acquisition stream is a serious concern in many sensitive areas of government activity , but the process for assessing the risk to national security is at best loose and in some cases missing altogether , ” she told The Times .
“ A U.S. passport has the full faith and credit of the U.S. government behind the citizenship and identity of the bearer , ” she said .
“ What foreign intelligence service or international terrorist group would n’t like to be able to masquerade as U.S. citizens ?
It would be a profound liability for U.S. intelligence and law enforcement if we lost confidence in the integrity of our passports . ”

A California legal reader I trust writes :
I 've just read the NCLR brief challenging the validity of Prop. 8 , and it is not at all frivolous :
The difference between a constitutional " revision " and a constitutional " amendment " is quite important under California constitutional law , and I have worked on cases dealing with it in the context of insurance regulation .
Briefly , an amendment to the constitution may be accomplished by a simple vote of the people , but a revision to our constitution must begin in the Legislature and then go to the voters .
In my opinion , this brief makes a very good legal argument which , in a non-political context , would be pretty persuasive .
However , we have here a hyper - political context , and I think the courts will have a very hard time overruling Prop .
8 . Still , I think this is a responsible brief -- if a dangerous and risky political move .
Eugene Volokh counters here .
I 'm no legal expert , but as a political matter , I do not favor litigating this .
I favor continuing the work in educating people about marriage equality , about gay couples , and the good , integrative effect of allowing this reform .
And I think the greatest way to do this will not be lawsuits but the witness and example of thousands of legally married couples in California .
That 's how fears of miscegenation abated in time : seeing inter-racial couples live and breathe defused the opposition .
Remember , the anti-marriage equality forces lost over ten points in eight years in two consecutive initiatives .
We 're winning .
Just not all the time .

Hi .
My name 's Rebecca , although most people know me as Becky .
I 'm guessing most of you will have come across an organisation called " JABS " - " Justice Awareness and Basic Support " ( they did n't have the decency to put a comma in there ... )
It claims to support the parents of " vaccine damaged " children .
I joined the forum , interested to see if there was any good evidence of harm caused by vaccines .
( Short answer - no . ) What I actually found was a single issue pressure group , dedicated to stamping out vaccination in all forms , and a forum populated by utter nutters .
The worst kind of shit - for - brains internet mentalist .
I mean , real " heads down no -nonsense mindless WOOOOOO !!!! " idiots .
The scary thing is , the BBC links to the site whenever there 's a story in the news about the " MMR Controversy " .
Parents who may still be worried could be looking at this stuff , and putting their children at far greater risk by following the advice in the forum .
So the original purpose of this blog was to show quite how batshit bonkers the JABS forum is , by posting an ( almost ) daily quote from one of its regular contributors .
However , now that JABS is moderated , it appears that some of the more insane ( and hence bloggable ) stuff does n't get past the moderator , I 'll also be turning my eye towards other sources of evil bastardry - mainly Age of Autism and The Australian Vaccination Network ( AVN ) .
The story about Banco Santander and the UK ’s taxpayers £ 18 billion still has not made it into the press .
It just shows you the power of Labour spin , and the cleverness of their media manipulation .
The story is there on the Treasury website , hidden but clear to anyone who wants to read it .
We were told by the government and the media that the deposits of Bradford and Bingley along with their branches had been sold to Banco Santander for a positive sum .
This was never very likely , as deposits are liabilities .
You have to pay someone to take them away .
Indeed , that is what has happened .
The UK taxpayer is borrowing £ 18 billion to send £ 18 billion in cash to a Spanish bank to take the deposits over .
The questions that flow from this include :
Did UK based banks have the chance to bid for these deposits with the cash that went with them ?
How did they determine the amount of the cash to send ?
Why is £ 14 billion of it being routed through the Financial Services Compensation Fund , which has been offered a government guarantee and a promise of government refinancing of the £ 14 billion ?
Would n’t it have been easier and cheaper just to make it all a straight Treasury payment from Day One , as £ 4 billion is ?
Why did n’t the government tell us it was spending another £ 18 billion of our money in this way ?
How much of this does it expect to get back eventually from the mortgage book it has kept ?
Did the government know when it chose Santander that Santander had poorer capital ratios than the stronger UK banks and was likely to need to raise new capital ?
It has recently announced that it is raising E7 billion in new share capital to improve its Tier One Ratio from 6.3 % to 7 % .
Shareholders in Bradford and Bingley still await the detailed terms of any compensation for them .
B and B is not offering any new mortgages , so like Northern Rock once nationalised it is efectively in run off .
Why is the taxpayer having to take the risk and pay all the bills for two mortgage banks who are unable to help the housing and mortgage market by making new advances ?
Ben Porritt said the McCain Campaign has , “ No Lobbyists ” .
That he was not familiar with Timmons background at all .
That we should be discussing Obama ’s connections .
I will give him this , he lies as good as Tucker Bounds .
By the way , where is he ?
Did he get tired of being beat up on a daily basis ?

Frank Luntz , kicking off an RGA panel session looking back at ' 08 , promised candor — and then delivered .
" I understand how Dr. Kevorkian feels at an AARP convention , " Luntz proclaimed at the top of his presentation to a darkened and quiet ballroom of Republicans , drawing scattered laughs .
The past two cycles , he said , have been the worst for the GOP since the Depression elections of 1930 and 1932 .
And it gets worse from there .
Noting that Obama has an e-mail list of 10 million voters , Luntz said that coalition " makes him and his supporters the most powerful special interest group in all of America . "
" He 's got 10 million names and our candidate does n’t know how to use this , " Luntz continued , holding up his BlackBerry in the air .
" There is a problem there . "
He was n't done .
Alluding to John McCain 's well - chronicled struggles with prepared speeches , Luntz voiced more exasperation with the man who was until last week the GOP 's standard - bearer .
" Stevie Wonder reads a teleprompter better than John McCain , " Luntz cracked , drawing laughs .

The Montana Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that courts there cannot order medical marijuana patients to refrain from using their medicine as a condition of probation or parole .
The ruling came in the case of State v. Nelson , in which Timothy Nelson was convicted of growing marijuana and as a condition of his probation , was barred from using medical marijuana .
Nelson was not certified under Montana 's medical marijuana law when arrested , but obtained that certification before sentencing .
But after local prosecutors told the trial judge the state Department of Corrections would not allow him to use medical marijuana while under its supervision -- only synthetic Marinol -- the judge imposed the following condition ( among others ) on Nelson :
The Defendant will not possess or use illegal drugs or any drugs unless prescribed by a licensed physician .
Although the Defendant states he has a medical use exception which allows him to possess marijuana , the Defendant may not possess marijuana except in pill form and only then by prescription from a licensed physician .
The prescription may not be more than 6 months old .
The Defendant may not have a prescription older than 6 months in his possession .
The Defendant will not be in control of or under the influence of illegal drugs , nor will he have in his possession any drug paraphernalia .
Nelson appealed , and on Wednesday , the state Supreme Court agreed , finding that the trial judge had overstepped her authority .
" The District Court unlawfully denied Nelson the right and privilege to use a lawful medical treatment for relief from a debilitating condition under the Montana Medical Marijuana Act , " Justice Patricia Cotter wrote in the majority opinion .
The court also found that " when a qualifying patient uses medical marijuana in accordance with the ( Medical Marijuana Act ) , he is receiving lawful medical treatment .
In this context , medical marijuana is most properly viewed as a prescription drug . "
The court also rejected the state 's argument that limiting probationers to prescribed medications was appropriate .
" The District Court ignored the clear intent of the voters of Montana , that a qualifying patient with a valid registry identification card be lawfully entitled to grow and consume marijuana in legal amounts , " Cotter wrote .
" This is a very big and important victory , both for patients and Montana voters , " Tom Daubert , founder and director of Patients and Families United , a support group for patients who use medical marijuana , told the Great Falls Tribune after the decision .
" Montana voters clearly decided that Marinol is not the equivalent of medical marijuana , " Daubert said .
" The court recognizes in its decision that the so - called pill form of marijuana is not marijuana .
It 's really a common - sense interpretation of our law . "

The American International Group said on Friday that it had already drawn down $ 61 billion of the $ 85 billion emergency bridge loan it received from the Federal Reserve two weeks ago , an announcement that startled credit ratings agencies .
The emergency loan was supposed to buy the company time to sell its troubled assets in an orderly manner .
But the sell - off has not yet begun , and now the insurer faces the additional pressure of trying to sell the businesses at a time when potential buyers are having trouble borrowing money .
Moody ’s downgraded A.I.G. ’s senior unsecured debt on Friday and said it might downgrade other types of the company ’s debt , which could make it more expensive for A.I.G. to borrow money and do business .
A.I.G.’s chief executive , Edward M. Liddy , told securities analysts on Friday that $ 53 billion to $ 54 billion of the Fed ’s loan had gone to shore up A.I.G. ’s troubled structured - finance unit and its securities lending business .
Another big block of the Fed ’s money has been used to support A.I.G. ’s daily operations , Mr. Liddy said in a conference call , because demand for the company ’s commercial paper has dried up as a result of the worldwide credit crisis .
The Nov. 26 attacks in Mumbai appear likely to lead to a confrontation between India and Pakistan that could draw in the United States as well ....
We talk an awful lot about Wasilla these days .
Americans now know more about the inner-workings of the city council , the library , the police department , and local churches than they ever imagined they would .
We also talk a lot about the North Slope of Alaska with its oil fields , and the larger city centers of Anchorage , Juneau and Fairbanks .
But look at a map of Alaska superimposed on a map of the Lower 48 .
Most of Alaska , which some call the “ real Alaska , ” is much larger , and much less known that the parts that make the headlines .
For every person who has lived in “ the bush , ” there is a different story .
But universal is the opinion that bush Alaska has some very real problems , that have not been adequately addressed .
The remote location of many bush communities makes many aspects of construction and infrastructure difficult .
Communities often do without what the rest of us would consider basic neccessities .
Health care and education face unbelievable challenges .
The rates of domestic violence , rape , and alcohol abuse are alarming .
Alaska State Troopers are too few , underpaid , and often underequipped .
Sadly , our previous Commissioner of Public Saftey , Walt Monegan , was on track with a plan to address some of these issues .
You ’ll recall that he was fired by Sarah Palin , and his termination has become the focus of the “ Troopergate ” investigation .
Mudflats reader Josh shares the following story .
******************************************************************************************************
Sarah Palin has stated in one of her now famous blurbs with Katie Couric that she was excited to debate Joe Biden to talk about energy and ideas .
Interesting .
Maybe if she had been doing that in her own state for the past two years , we would n’t have the Mayor of Anchorage , and the Anchorage School District Superintendent writing her office asking for help with a very real problem .
With growing evidence of an Alaska Native exodus from villages to the city , Mayor Mark Begich and Schools Superintendent Carol Comeau sent a letter to Gov. Sarah Palin on Monday asking her to organize an emergency task force to find ways to stem the migration .
Anchorage and the state “ cannot stand by and tolerate the deterioration of rural Alaska , ” the letter read .
( continue )
My wife and I have been teaching and living year - round in bush Alaska for the last four years , and recently moved to Anchorage .
We left after trying to make changes in an extremely broken system that has been ignored and overlooked by the state and its officials for far too long .
Our jobs were threatened , we had no union to go to , and therefore no recourse .
Our issue was targeted at education , but the poor state of education in the bush can be easily attributed to a broader problem of isolation , poverty and lack of oversight that no one at the state level is willing to get a handle on .
Anchorage and the state “ cannot stand by and tolerate the deterioration of rural Alaska , ” the letter said .
The major problem that my wife and I are running into when we tell people our story is that many believe it is the Alaskan Native ’s problem as a federally recognized tribe and therefore is no different than the many cases and issues that exist on the lower 48 reservations .
This is not the case .
Alaskan Native tribes are not a sovereign nation .
There is no legal difference in the villages that exist off the road system in Alaska , and a small rural town in Kansas .
The only difference is that if a small rural town in Kansas had overwhelmingly high suicide rates , rape cases , domestic violence issues , no infrastructure , no running water , poor electricity , energy bills that exceed thousands each month and no money or jobs to help cover the costs , someone would do something about it !
We became very close with a family in our village that had a child drown in a stell container of raw sewage .
Let me say that again .
They had a child drown in a steel container of raw sewage .
Their child was simply outside playing and since there is no playground equipment for the kids to play on , they play on anything , often things too dangerous for children .
In this case it was something commonly referred to as a “ honey bucket . ”
This is a steel container where house sewage is dumped since there is no indoor plumbing .
Many of the problems that face rural Alaska are not solvable in a day , a month , even years .
But , when you have a Governor bragging about her reforming ways , it does make you wonder .
Why was she so unable to even start real reform in her own state over a two year period ?
So as you watch Sarah Palin talking about energy issues , ask yourself one question :
If Sarah Palin is so knowledgeable about energy and has had executive experience , why is the Anchorage Daily News running a story like the one above ?
Sarah Palin has been in office for almost two years and managed to sell a plane , is under investigation for an abuse of power , and gave people that do not need it ( including people no longer in Alaska ) $ 1,200 rather than funding real energy relief for rural Alaskans .
The Washington Post has stated in a recent article that in 2002 through lobbyist ties related to Ted Stevens and Don Young she secured $ 900,000 in upgrades for Wasilla ’s infrastructure .
There are still many rural villages today without roads , electricity , indoor plumbing , and some even have their sewage leaking into the water supply .
Money is needed , but more importantly , someone that is willing to spend the time to start a conversation .
Chinese blog MacX is showing some very legit looking pics of what they allege is the MacBook Pro casing today .
We will have to wait for the MacBook 2008 event this week to see if it is real or not , but they are crystal clear and in line with both series of previous leaked images .

We are inundated since childhood with the philosophy to create happiness through successful achievement of our goals .
Often this approach continues into adulthood .
If we are offered another strategy for happiness later it is n’t nurtured or supported by the world around us .
We have our model , and so our current paradigm discounts others .
That is until our success and goal achievement strategies leave us unfulfilled and looking for more .
The goal achievement strategy for happiness makes sense because it is how we were trained .
It conforms to our experience about how our emotions were created since childhood .
We ’ve learned through repetition and habit since childhood to experience emotions as a reaction to our successes and failures .
By the time we are adults we ’ve been living by this conditioned pattern for so long it seems to be the reality .
However , it only appears true if we do n’t have the awareness to see the rest of the story .
If you observe children before they become conditioned , you see that they are happy almost all the time , and often for no reason .
Ivan Pavlov ’s dog learned through conditioning and habit to relate the sound of a ringing bell to getting food .
In reality , a ringing bell does n’t mean that the dog will eat , but the dog learned this relationship through repetition .
As humans we also learned to feel emotions through repetition and conditioning .
When we did something that people wanted we were rewarded with praise .
When we failed to meet others expectations we might have been punished , or ignored .
By that conditioning over years achieving goals can produce a wonderful feeling , but it does n’t mean the two are directly related .
They are only related because the mind has learned through repetition to link them together .
Many individuals have driven themselves to accomplishment only to feel empty and wondering , “ Is this all there is ? ”
This is when our conditioning falls apart and we have to look deeper to find a more meaningful happiness and fulfillment .
Emotional Habits from Goal Achievement
I remember being in 1st grade and going up to a chart that had all the kid ’s names on it .
I counted the number of gold stars by my name .
I remember the euphoric feeling I had when I saw I had more stars than anyone else .
This lasted about four seconds .
I noticed a girl ’s name at the bottom below mine .
I counted out the number of her stars .
She had two more stars than me .
My heart sank and I walked back to my seat dejected .
What happened in just a few seconds to cycle my emotions to both ends of the spectrum ?
Certainly no actual achievement of failure occurred .
At the surface it appears that my performance , or the gold stars were having an impact on my emotions .
I did n’t have the awareness to notice that the interpretation my mind made was the critical factor .
My mind was running stories , expectations , self images , and comparisons without my awareness .
Years later , when I reflected on this experience and others like it , I was able to perceive that it was these automated mental programs that was creating my emotions .
Awareness : The Ability to Perceive the Invisible
One aspect of awareness is clarity of perception .
In self awareness it is the ability to clearly observe the dynamics of the mind that were previously unconscious .
If you put into slow motion the dynamics of my mind in front of that chart of gold stars it would look something like the following .
Walking up to the chart of gold stars , I was hoping that I would be number one .
It was a goal I had .
My mind structured the belief that if I had the most gold stars , then I was the best and smartest in the class .
I would be a winner , a success , and therefore lovable .
In reality , gold stars on a chart do n’t have any direct value to a 6 year old .
However , my beliefs translated gold stars into being a good boy .
A “ good boy ” was someone who was rewarded with love and praise .
That meant being happy .
When I perceived that I had the most stars , my mind activated the belief that I was good , and worthy of being loved .
My mind generated a positive self image , or recalled an existing one .
I believed I was that positive image in my mind .
I then expressed love to that image , because it was worthy of being loved .
I could feel the love I was expressing and it was a wonderful feeling .
In reality my spirits were n’t lifted by the number of gold stars .
The joy I felt was my own love being expressed and felt .
The number of stars was just a conditioned trigger like a bell to Pavlov ’s dog .
What I was conscious of at the time was the number of stars , my performance compared to others , and the happy emotions I felt .
I learned to relate my performance and comparison to others as the source of my emotions .
I completely overlooked the aspect of my mind that was doing the comparing .
I had many experiences like this and my mind learned to associate accomplishing goals to feeling good .
I also learned to feel bad when I failed or performed poorly .
I was n’t aware of the role of my mental imagery , beliefs , or my power to express love and appreciation for myself as a separate action .
These were an automated response that I was not aware of .
I only saw the trigger and assumed that the trigger had the power over my emotions .
At six years old I already relied on the bells of gold stars and achieving goals to control my power to express love and create my own happiness .
When I saw the girl ’s name with more stars , it triggered my mind into another automated routine .
If I was not the winner , then I must be the loser .
Quicker than I was aware of it , the mind concluded that I was less than .
My mind displayed a negative self image , and I believed that negative image was me .
I expressed a self judgment and rejection to that image as being unworthy .
Immediately I felt the emotions that accompany expressing judgment , rejection , and unworthiness .
They felt unpleasant .
At the time my mind related my emotions to my performance .
I did n’t know that I had created and expressed them as a reaction to my beliefs about performance .
It was n’t the achievement of success or being a winner that made me happy .
It was my beliefs that controlled my expression of emotions of love and self acceptance that made me happy .
It was n’t the failure , or coming in second that made me unhappy .
It was the beliefs that controlled my expression of rejection and judgment that were the cause of those unpleasant emotions .
Conditional Love and Happiness
At 6 years old I was already conditioned to create love , or self rejection as a reaction to my beliefs .
My emotional shifts were n’t dependent on a bell like Pavlov ’s dog , but by the number of symbols on a paper chart , a grade , or what someone said or thought of me .
The beliefs and images in my mind were regulating which emotions I expressed and felt based on those triggers .
In my dejected state I decided to try harder to prove myself worth .
Some people might approve of this reactive motivation to succeed as a way to make a person grow .
There is a valid case for goal setting as it spurs a person to action .
However , if this is a person ’s primary logic , it is pretty limited .
It ’s based on the idea that the only way to improve is through self rejection .
As if we will become better through verbal beatings .
It does n’t consider other forms of motivation that do n’t involve self judgment .
Secondly , what if the other kids in school let their mind operate with the same criteria for self acceptance and self worth ?
Only one child in the class , or school , could feel good about themselves at any given time .
By that criterion more than 90 % of children would have to conclude that they are unworthy .
The Habit of Chasing Happiness
In spite of the problems with this logic , I continued to unconsciously live by these patterned beliefs generating my emotions .
Through college and career I was continually chasing all the goals and success strategies that I could .
When I achieved a goal , I celebrated and felt good about myself .
At least for a short time anyways .
This perpetuated the assumption that achieving goals would reward me with the emotions of love , acceptance , and happiness .
When I failed to meet the goals others set for me I felt like a failure .
This was true even if their goals were unrealistic .
I was so conditioned to play the game that I did n’t realize the faults of it .
This continued until I became aware of these beliefs and changed them .
This limited paradigm for achieving happiness is reinforced by people selling success formula programs .
They make a strong case for setting goals , motivation , and persistence etc .
Because most all of us have been conditioned in a similar way this philosophy of achieving happiness through success appears true .
However it completely ignores the role our beliefs have in determining our emotions .
Even if we achieve a life long dream , our mind can shift our expectations and requirements for feeling good about our self within the week .
When it does so , any joyful feeling or sense of worth is lost .
Beliefs Determine Your Happiness
What goes on in the internal world of your mind has more to do with determining your happiness than any external factors .
That includes succeeding or failing at your goals .
Self judgments , beliefs in certain thoughts , and false self images are what directly affect your happiness .
Even when external goals are achieved or lost it is what you believe about your self that will determine your emotions .
This is why a person who has accomplished much can feel unworthy , unloved , and believes he has failed .
At the same time a man who has little to show in the way of accomplishments or achievement can be happy beyond measure .
Is your Love for your self conditional , or unconditional ?
Life is rich with diverse experiences , challenges , and surprises .
You will not be able to bend everything in life to meet your hopes and goals .
If you rely on the achievement of goals to determine how much love and acceptance you express , your happiness will be limited .
However , if you develop awareness of what your mind is doing , you can manage expectations , dissolve false images , and change your core beliefs .
Then your mind becomes flexible and it will no longer regulate how much love and self acceptance you are allowed to express .
You can choose your own triggers , and control the gates that allow your love and joy to come out of you .
The result is that your love happiness can flow to your self and others without conditions and without limits .
For practical steps to identify and change your beliefs , consider listening to the Self Mastery Course .
Joe Salerno's SDAE Presidential Address was excellent .
In it he developed his argument about the Mengerian causal realist tradition , and the role that Mises and then Rothbard played in the further development and refinement of that tradition .
Mises used the term " modern subjectivist economics " to capture this tradition .
Joe pointed out that in essays in the 1930s to the late 1960s , Mises actually argued that the label " Austrian " was only useful for an episode of intellectual history .
Similarly , Hayek in his Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences essay on The Austrian School implies that it is a useful historical label that does not have contemporary relevance .
What was most fascinating about Joe 's talk was his discussion of Rothbard .
Relying on Rothbard 's letters and notes concerning the writing of Man , Economy and State , Joe was able to demonstrate that Rothbard shared this assessment with Mises and Hayek , and was thoroughly engaged with the economics profession of his day ( 1950s ) .
In the 1970s , however , Rothbard changed his position and began to advocate a more thorough going commitment to the Austrian School of Economics ?
What changed between the 1950s when Rothbard was starting his career , and the 1970s when Rothbard was engaged in efforts to build a modern Austrian movement ?
The simple answer is that the economics profession was transformed between 1950 and 1970 in a way that had lost sight of the central message of what Mises called " modern subjectivist economics . "
The propositions of the " Austrian School " were ignored so action needed to be taken by Rothbard ( and Kirzner ) to bring back an apreciation for these core propositions of economic science if economic thought was to advance .
I have recently written a survey article on the Austrian school for David Henderson 's Concise Encyclopedia of Economics where I try to stated the 10 propositions that define the Austrian approach .
What do you think sets the Austrian school apart in the discipline of economics and do they warrant viewing the Austrian school as a distinct tradition within economic research and education , with its own schools , journals , conferences , etc. , or should contemporary students and faculty simply follow the lead of Rothbard in the 1950s and remain thoroughly engaged with the economics profession ?
10 . Notting Hill
This one is classic .
Starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts , the story takes place in a charming London neighborhood of the same name that shapes the plot of the movie .
Upon repeat viewings , you realize there is little chemistry between the leads and their love story is incomprehensible , but London – the movie ’s biggest character – makes up for the talent deficit .
They captured the neighborhood well , perhaps too well since now it ’s even more of a tourist destination on the weekends .
It ’s hard to move around it ’s crawling with so many tourists !
There really is a Travel Bookshop in Notting Hill and it ’s worth the visit .

9. Love , Actually
This is very nearly one of those perfect romantic comedies .
Set during Christmastime in London , it concerns the trials and tribulations in love of a loosely connected group of people .
People who all live hip and cool lives that you really wish you were a part of .
Some of the plot threads are sad , not necessarily happy but the subject is love in all it ’s forms , warts and all .
It ’s charming and has become my favorite Christmas movie , if anything because Billy Mack is hilarious .

I ’ve never been a fan of Jane Austen so I only look at this movie as it ’s own creature .
I love it .
I love the scenery , the culture , the plot , music , everything .
The end where the couple meets on the cool English morning as the sun rises is a perfect representation of what it ’s really like to walk through the English countryside in the morning .
When I watch it , I ’m literally in Dorset , walking across the hills and valleys .
A lovely movie , even if it does n’t keep to the book well .

7. About a Boy
This is n’t your typical romantic comedy , in fact there is n’t much romance in it at all .
It ’s mostly about the relationship between a selfish materialistic man and a boy crying out for a father figure .
Despite some serious subject matter , the movie works and has enough funny moments to make up for the serious bits .
Hugh Grant does a great job playing himself , a self absorbed douchebag .

Though Bridget Jones herself can be a rather annoying person , the movie is still great fun .
Colin Firth is a great lead and he mellows out the insane Bridget in many scenes .
The real London locations are marvelous as are her stereotypical British friends .
Avoid the sequel though , it ’s a piece of crap .
My wife and I were very disappointed .

5 . The Queen
The Queen of England has generally been off limits for movies and dramas , so this movie breaks significant ground in portraying the venerable monarch .
We get to see the inner working of the Royal family as well as a portrait of a person whom is generally thought to not have a real personality .
The sets and scenery are amazing .
It ’s a wonderful film that takes place during a time of great change in Modern Britain .
A very moving picture .

4. V for Vendetta
This is also a rather serious movie , dealing with themes such as the moral relativism of terrorism , totalitarian government and sick forms of love .
It paints a pretty bleak picture of what England could become given the right conditions .
But it ’s also an excellent portrait of the resiliency of the British People who wo n’t take oppression lying down .
The whole movie comes to a head at the end when a mob descends upon Parliament Square .
What ’s most amazing is that they actually filmed it there and considering all the logistics that went into it , you ’ve gotta be impressed with the result .

Many people have n’t heard of this movie , it ’s a classic gem from the 80’s .
It ’s about an 80 ’s Yuppie Oilman sent to a sleepy Scottish village to negotiate it ’s purchase because of oil located in the area .
The locals are ecstatic since the area is rather economically depressed but the main character goes local and learns a lot about himself and what truly matters in life .
It has an excellent score as well .

2. The Remains of the Day
This is a wonderful sweeping British Drama from the days of Merchant - Ivory .
Anthony Hopkins stars as a Butler who sees many changes in history and the ownership of the estate he serves .
There are wonderful themes about friendship and loyalty as well as unrequited love and loss .
The vistas are amazing as is the grand house it takes place in .
Emma Thompson plays one of her best roles at the love interest of Hopkins .
This movie is long , quiet and contemplative yet delightful .

In my opinion , this is the perfect British movie for Anglophiles .
Everything about this movie is perfect .
From the authentic ship to the multi- faceted characters , it ’s all perfect .

On Oct. 6 , Mr. Bush pointed with pride to his record at a conference sponsored by the Cincinnati chapter of the Federalist Society , the elite network for the conservative legal movement .
He noted that he had appointed more than a third of the federal judiciary expected to be serving when he leaves office , a lifetime - tenured force that will influence society for decades and that represents one of his most enduring accomplishments .
While a two - term president typically leaves his stamp on the appeals courts — Bill Clinton appointed 65 judges , Mr. Bush 61 — Mr. Bush ’s judges were among the youngest ever nominated and are poised to have an unusually strong impact .
They have arrived at a time when the appeals courts , which decide tens of thousands of cases a year , are increasingly getting the last word .
While the Supreme Court gets far more attention , in recent terms it has reviewed only about 75 cases a year — half what it considered a generation ago .
And Mr. Bush ’s appointees have found allies in like - minded judges named by Mr. Bush ’s father and Reagan .
Republican - appointed judges , most of them conservatives , are projected to make up about 62 percent of the bench next Inauguration Day , up from 50 percent when Mr. Bush took office .
They control 10 of the 13 circuits , while judges appointed by Democrats have a dwindling majority on just one circuit .
David M. McIntosh , a co-founder and vice - chairman of the Federalist Society , said the nation ’s appeals courts were now more in line with a conservative judicial ideology than at any other time in memory .
“ The level of thoughtfulness among sitting judges on constitutional theory and the role of judges is higher than certainly any other time in my life , ” said Mr. McIntosh , a former Reagan legal team member and Indiana congressman .
“ For somebody who has spent a lot of my life promoting those ideas , it ’s very encouraging to see . ”

New research by the Wildlife Conservation Society and Save the Elephants has found that African Elephants are quickly becoming trapped by new road construction cutting through their forest habitats .
The study , which appeared in today ’s issue of Public Library of Science , says the elephants have adopted a “ siege mentality ” and literally cannot bring themselves to cross roadways , even in search of food .[ social_buttons ]
“ Forest elephants are basically living in fear of their lives in prisons created by roads .
They are roaming around the woods like frightened mice rather than tranquil formidable giants of their forest realm , ” said Dr. Stephen Blake , the study ’s lead author .
But it ’s not the roads themselves the elephants fear ; it ’s the poachers who travel on the roads .
So for now , the elephants may be protecting themselves from certain death from poachers , but eventually , as their habitats shrink , they could be separated from food sources and important mineral deposits .
The researchers tracked 28 elephants in six different areas in the Republic of Congo and Gabonwith .
Using GPS systems they followed the elephants , finding that only one was brave enough to cross a road — and even then , the elephant ran at 14 times its normal speed .
Road construction is not slowing down in Central Africa , which could spell bad news for the endangered giants .
But researchers believe some quick planning changes could make a huge difference .
“ A small yet very feasible shift in development planning , one that is actually good for poor local forest people and for wildlife and wilderness , would be a tremendous help to protect forest elephants and their home , ” said Blake .
“ Planning roads to give forest elephants breathing space so that at least those in the deep forest can relax , as well as reduce the death and fear that comes with roads by reducing poaching , would be trivial in terms of cost but massively important for conservation . ”

Scrapping scissors and knitting needles at the ready , sellers on the handcrafting site www.etsy.com are up in arms over what they say are sites stealing their designs and images and then hiring other crafters to produce them .
Discussion on the topic started earlier today , with more than 600 postings at this writing .
In a real - to - life embodiment of John Naisbitt 's " High Tech , High Touch , " first publicized in his book Megatrends , Etsy -- a sort of eBay for the crafty -- has became a runaway success .
The website , which bills itself as " Your place to buy and sell all things handmade , " raised $ 27 million in startup funding two years ago .
While sites such as " Regretsy " have spoofed Etsy and certain items on it , the handcrafters claim that sites such as Trader Lou and A.H. Smith -- reportedly all registered to a Robert Frechette -- are going a step further and actually promoting Etsy pieces as their own .
" Here are the legitimate earrings , and here they are on the AH Smith site , " reported one commenter .
Interestingly , artisans on the site are working together to find examples of duplications , alert the local and national media , contact Frechette , comment on the items and on his sites , do legal research , report the incidents to law enforcement , and so on -- another example of the power of the Internet mob as described by Clay Shirky in his book Here Comes Everybody .
Tyson Injects and Feeds Antibiotics into “ Raised without Antibiotics ” Labeled Chicken
The second largest chicken producer in the United States has been lying to consumers .
Tyson Foods has been claiming chicken as “ Raised without Antibiotics ” that has been injected with drugs before hatching .
Tyson has been tricking Americans and bending USDA rules about truthful labeling regarding antibiotics in poultry .
The company has spent tens of millions of dollars in advertising its chicken as “ raised without antibiotics ” this year .
Tyson has admitted to injecting eggs with antibiotics , and the USDA has responded by asking the company to stop using the antibiotic - free label .
Tyson ’s has filed a lawsuit to keep using the label , claiming the USDA ’s rules do not apply before the second day of life .
Not only does Tyson inject antibiotics into its chickens before they hatch , they also treats the birds ’ feed with bacteria - killing ionophores .
Tyson claims that ionophores are antimicrobials rather than antibiotics , but the USDA disagrees .
Tyson and the USDA did reach a compromise , and now chicken fed ionophores is labeled “ raised without antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans ” .
The antibiotic injection before hatching is a different story though and remains unsettled .
According to Natural News :
Not long after , on June 3 , USDA inspectors discovered that in addition to using ionophores , Tyson was regularly injecting its chicken eggs with gentamicin , an antibiotic that has been used for more than 30 years in the United States to treat urinary tract and blood infections .
The drug is also stockpiled by the federal government as a treatment for biological agents such as plague .
The USDA has told Tyson that its antibiotic - free label is not “ truthful and accurate ” ; however , Tyson sticks by its claim since technically , the chickens have n’t been “ raised ” yet when injected “ in ovo ” .
The truth is the antibiotics remain in the chicken after hatching , and the American public has been lied to by this food giant .

Via Eric Martin , the problem with the GOP 's anti-Obama message :
...once you ’ve made a narrative choice , you do have to stick with it - you ca n’t just keep bouncing around , or people become confused .
If you are telling the story of a scary vampire , you ca n’t decide in chapter 2 that he ’s also 500 feet tall and radioactive and bent on destroying Tokyo , in chapter 3 that he is actually a giant man-eating shark , and in chapter 4 that he is all this and a super - terrorist trying to plant a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles .
All of these things are , indeed , scary , but taken together they add up to a muddle .
This is the problem .
It ’s not just the McCain campaign ’s problem - although their inability to pick a narrative and stick to it is a special kind of inexcusable - it ’s a problem for the entire wingnut noise machine .
Obama is a Marxist Muslim Arab Jesus Black White Terrorist Technocrat Racist Do-Gooder Liberal FDR Stalin Hilter Commie Fascist Gay Womanizing Naive Cynical Insider Noob Boring Radical Unaccomplished Elite Slick Gaffe - Prone Pedophile Pedophile - Seducing Liberation Theology Atheist Etc. & Anti-Etc. with a bunch of scary friends from - wait for it !
- the Nineteen Hundred And Sixties .
It makes no sense .
It ’s a jumble sale of fears and scary associations from 50 years of wingnut witch hunts and smear campaigns , a flea market of pre-owned and antique resentments , and if one does detect a semi- consistent 1960 ’s motif running through it all , that ’s because that ’s when most of these ideas were coined .

High - seas piracy a boon for Blackwater mercs David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

As the world 's governments grapple with the growing threat of seeing valuable seafaring vessels shanghaied by increasingly bold pirates , one for - hire paramilitary force is gearing up to turn major profits off the crisis .
Blackwater Worldwide , a Moyock , North Carolina - based mercenary force , says its maritime forces are ready to throw its weight into the battle for the high seas .
The group has retrofitted an ex-research vessel to carry over 30 " operators " on missions to protect other ships .
Blackwater Worldwide is perhaps best known for its contracting with the United States military in Iraq .
On Friday , federal investigators said they are preparing indictments for Blackwater mercenaries who murdered 17 fleeing Iraqi civilians in Baghdad .
In a Thursday segment on Fox News , reporter Jennifer Griffin talked with Blackwater CEO Erik Prince , who claimed his group has been approached by 66 shipping and insurance companies concerned about the growing threat of piracy .
" In effect , Blackwater wants to try to intercept these pirates before they even get close enough to these ships in order to board the ships , so that you do n't have any shootouts on the high seas , " said Griffin .

Caroline " Caz " Pal : Michael Phelps Girlfriend
' girlfriend , spent Thanksgiving in Baltimore with the Olympic champ and his family .
Caroline Pal is a 26 - year - old cocktail waitress at the Moon Nightclub in the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas .
" She 's there meeting his family for the first time , " a source close to Pal told People magazine .
Phelps has been spending time in Las Vegas working on his poker game and hopes to participate in the 2009 World Series of Poker .
Some people think Caz is the cocktail waitress Phelps was groping in the infamous photos that made the rounds on the net a few months ago .
' Memba those ?
I have n't been able to dig up much on Caz , however , I did note that there was an event at Moon Nightclub on October 16 , titled " Champagne Seduction - A Birthday Celebration for Caz , " which was touted with the promo below .
I also found a Facebook profile for a Caz Pal in Los Angeles .
Not being on her friend 's list , I was only able to see the thumbnail picture , but after enlarging it a bit , I have to say , I still can't tell much .
Could the Caz in the birthday celebration photos be the same as one of the girls in the Facebook pic ?
And if so , then it definitely does n't look like the same girl in the aforementioned groping photos ...
UPDATE : Seems I was right .
Photos of Caz have now hit the net , and she is definitely the girl in the pics above .
( see many more pictures below )
One thing I have learned is that cocktail waitresses at Moon Nightclub apparently have one up on the rest of us in meeting and dating celebs .
George Clooney 's ex-gal pal , Sarah Larson , also worked at the club when the two met .
More photos of Caroline Pal below .
Just Jared has many more photos of Caz , and some are quite naughty !
It is time for the McCain campaign to come clean about what role any of its staffers may have had in hyping or pushing the press to hype the charges stemming from Ashley Todd ’s vicious and reprehensible hoax .
As Greg Sargent reported yesterday , McCain Pennsylvania communications director Peter Feldman pushed reporters on a highly incendiary version of Todd ’s hoax — providing reporters with quotes from the fictitious attacker and telling them the the “ B ” scratched on Todd ’s face stood for “ Barack . ”
As the Washington Post ’s Eugene Robinson aptly put it , Feldman ’s actions showed “ not just a willingness to believe it but an eagerness to incite a … racial backlash against the Obama campaign . ”
Our reporting did not find any direct evidence that the McCain campaign ’s national headquarters played a role pushing the story .
However , the national campaign has now come forward and lied about what happened in Pennsylvania .
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers has now told NBC that alleged quotes from the McCain campaign in early reports of the story were actually the product of “ sloppy reporting ” and that they were actually quotes from the Pittsburgh police .
This is simply not credible .
Initial reports specifically quote the McCain campaign .
And at least two sources involved in the contemporaneous reporting have come forward and said on the record that the quotes came directly from the McCain campaign .
To believe that two separate local news organizations made the identical mistake with the same quotes and are now both covering it up is simply not credible .
But that is what Rogers is now claiming .
The McCain campaign ’s after - the - fact lie about its role in this hoax makes it essential that it provide a complete and honest account of both the local and national campaign ’s role .
As I said above , we did not find direct evidence of the national McCain campaign pushing this story .
But Gov. Palin did call
Todd after the purported attack , as did Sen. McCain .
And news of these calls was provided to the press .
The involvement of the candidates and specifically the release of such information — which was clearly intended to bump up interest in the story — shows some level of involvement by the national campaign .
Perhaps it is simply that the national campaign heard a staffer had been mugged and had the principals call the purported victim .
One might further speculate that it was only the Pennsylvania communications director who heard about the calls and took it upon himself to push these out to the media .
Possible , but certainly a generous interpretation .
And now that we see the national McCain campaign making false statements about what happened , its credibility on the whole story is simply too damaged to allow such a benefit of the doubt .
Reporters who the McCain camp cannot stonewall need to push for a clear accounting of what happened — starting by coming clean on Feldman ’s role .
If this were simply some other minor campaign mystery , the sort that is routinely tossed off late in a hard - fought campaign , it might not matter .
But the awfulness of what was attempted here makes nothing less than a full accounting necessary .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks fell Wednesday for the third session in a row , with the Dow industrials tumbling over 400 points , as investors bet that a long and deep recession is on the horizon .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 411 points , or about 4.7 % , to 8,282.66 .

The world 's most developed economies have slid further into a recession that will continue into 2009 , according to an international forecast released on Thursday .
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has issued a forecast predicting that the world 's most developed economies are going to continue to contract over the next year .
" The OECD area economy appears to have entered recession , " said Jorgen Elmeskov , director of the policy studies branch and economics department .
Gross domestic product is likely to decline by 0.3 per cent in 2009 for its 30 member countries , said the Paris - based organization .
It is the first time the organization has seen an aggregate shrinkage in its members ' economies since it started keeping records in 1970 .
The organization said the U.S. economy is likely to post 0.9 per cent negative growth in 2009 , Japan will contract by 0.1 per cent and European economies by 0.5 per cent .
Uncertain projections leading into 2009 " point to a protracted downturn , " with recovery not likely before the second half of next year , Elmeskov said .
The organization issued its last forecast in June .
At that time , it was predicting a growth of 1.7 per cent in 2009 .
Full impact not yet seen
" Even more worrying , the full impact of the financial crisis still has to unfold , " said Carsten Brzeski , an analyst with ING Financial Markets .
" If you think today 's numbers are already bad , just wait for the next quarter . "
The OECD 's projections assume that the financial stress since the banking crisis exploded in mid-September will prove to be " short - lived " but be followed by an " extended period of financial headwinds " through the end of next year , with conditions then returning to near normal .
But emerging hazards such as further failures of financial institutions , emerging market economies being hit harder by the downturn in global trade and foreign investors turning even more risk shy could make the recovery take even longer , according to the forecast .
Germany enters recession
The German government also released new data on Thursday that showed the country 's economy recorded negative growth for the second consecutive quarter , officially pushing it into a recession .
Germany 's Federal Statistical
Office reported that gross domestic product of the country , which has Europe 's biggest economy , contracted by 0.5 per cent in the July - September period .
The economy had also declined for the first time since 2004 when it recorded a 0.4 per cent contraction in the second quarter .
A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
" We are going to have to face up to a very difficult and long - lasting economic crisis , " Germany 's deputy economy minister , Walther Otremba , told Reuters .
Government measures should be " timely and temporary and designed to so as to ensure maximum effectiveness , " while establishing a framework to ensure budget responsibility in the long term , Elmeskov said .
The International Energy Agency also cut its global oil demand forecasts on Thursday due to the recession causing slowing demand .
The IEA is forecasting the global demand for oil will average 86.2 million barrels a day for 2008 and 86.5 million per day in 2009 .
It 's a cut of 330,000 barrels for 2008 and 670,000 barrels from estimates it had released earlier in the year .
Should Palin Forgive Bill Ayers ?
Editor ’s Note :
One of the ugly aspects of the McCain - Palin exploitation of William Ayers ’s minor connection to Barack Obama is that Ayers has by nearly all accounts done a lot for his community since his days as a Vietnam War-era radical .
As Sherwood Ross notes in this guest essay , the Christian tradition is to show some forgiveness , like what John McCain has extended to Richard Nixon ’s crooked operatives , including one who plotted to bomb the Brookings Institution :
The desperation of the McCain camp over its sagging fortunes is nowhere better revealed than in its ridiculous attacks on Barack Obama for sitting on the same board of a Chicago philanthropy with William Ayers , a onetime bad boy in the Weather Underground .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Apparently , it means nothing to McCain and Palin that over the past 40 years Ayers has rehabilitated himself from a bomb - thrower to valued member of society .
No matter that Ayers has worked with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley to upgrade the city ’s schools .
Or that Ayers in 1995 co-authored a grant proposal that won $ 49 million to boost Chicago ’s schoolchildren .
Or that Ayers today is a Distinguished Professor of education , widely regarded in his field .
McCain ’s Alaskan attack wolf Sarah Palin has dredged up Ayers ’s past in order to smear Obama by association , pure and simple .
Palin does n’t utter a civil word about what Ayers has made of himself .
Once a pariah , always a pariah , right ?
For Palin , supposedly a candidate wedded to Christian virtues , there is no spark of compassion for Ayers .
Is n’t it a centerpiece of Christian theology that when the prodigal son returns to the hearth it is an occasion for celebration ?
Indeed , the story of the prodigal son is one of the most compelling parables attributed to Jesus Christ .
According to the gospel of Luke , the father tells the good son “ thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine ” but we celebrate because “ thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found . ”
There is zero indication Palin has read the passages in the Bible where Jesus broke bread with tax collectors and prostitutes , whose repentance he welcomed .
At least in Biblical times , if you made a mistake , Jesus gave you a second shot .
Not so Palin toward Ayers .
Palin ’s gutter campaign raises the issue of whether John McCain might not be guilty himself of associating with former criminals .
Obama seemingly has too much integrity to travel this low road .
If he wanted to respond in kind , Obama could point to McCain ’s approval of convicted Watergate crook Charles Colson , now the eminent Christian conservative .
According to a Slate article by David Plotz , during the Nixon era “ Colson sought to hire Teamsters thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators , and plotted to raid or firebomb the Brookings Institution , ” for which Colson did seven months in prison .
“ John McCain and George W. Bush , who agree about virtually nothing , agree about Charles Colson , ” Plotz wrote .
In a speech , McCain “ singled out Colson for praise , complimenting the Watergate felon for his prison ministry .
Bush , meanwhile , has given Colson a Texas prison wing to run on Christian principles , ” Plotz wrote .
How ’s that again ?
Bush and McCain endorsed a convicted felon who once advocated bombing Washington buildings and urged using Teamsters like Gestapo thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators ?
How can McCain forgive Charles Colson and praise his later commendable works when he will not do the same for Ayers ?
McCain has also lauded ( “ I ’m proud of you ! ” ) right - wing broadcaster G. Gordon Liddy , a man convicted for his mastermind role in the burglary of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate , and for which he served four years in prison .
According to Huffington Post , Liddy hosted a fund - raiser for McCain and chipped in a few thousand bucks of his own .
If the McCain camp tends to be a little short on forgiveness and long on hatred , we need to ask which religion it is they happen to be practicing .
Christian forgiveness , by their lights , seemingly only pertains to Republicans -- especially those guilty of espionage against Democrats .
Somebody explain it to me .
Is n’t it the zenith of hypocrisy for McCain to boast of his associations with Colson and Liddy while his running mate damns Obama for associating with Ayers ?

It 's true , it 's poo .
A sample from the gelato allegedly served to a family at the Coogee Bay Hotel earlier this month has tested positive for faecal matter , the NSW Food Authority has announced .
The sample , a small residual amount of gelato and faecal matter on a tissue , was provided by Stephen and Jessica
Whyte this week .

It was not immediately clear on what grounds Mr. bin Laden , a self - declared pacifist who is the son of the founder of Al Qaeda and his first wife , Najwa Ghanem , was basing his claim .
Mr. bin Laden caused a media storm in Britain last year when he married Jane Felix - Browne , then 51 , who took the Muslim name Zaina Mohamed al - Sabah .
She met Mr. bin Laden during a trip to Egypt in April last year and married him in September , according to news reports at the time .
Mr. bin Laden was refused a visa by the British Embassy in Cairo because of what the authorities perceived to be his loyalty to his father , which would “ cause considerable public concern ” in Britain , according to The Associated Press .
Enlarge By KCNA / Reuters North Korean leader Kim Jong -il , center , visits a military unit at an undisclosed location in North Korea in this recent picture distributed by North Korea 's official news agency KCNA .
SEOUL ( AP )  North Korea released pictures of its leader , Kim Jong
Il , on Saturday for the first time in nearly two months , showing him looking generally well despite reports he recently underwent brain surgery .
Wearing his trademark khaki jumpsuit and sunglasses , Kim was seen standing with uniformed soldiers with his arms folded or his hands behind his back .
The photos were taken during a visit to a military unit and shown on Pyongyang 's Korean Central Television .
Kim appeared healthy in the images , though it was unclear when they were taken .
The photos of Kim were the first released since Aug. 14 , according to South Korea 's Unification Ministry , in charge of relations with North Korea .
The 66 - year - old leader , believed to have diabetes and heart disease , has missed several key holidays in recent months , most notably North Korea 's 60th birthday last month .
U.S. and South Korean officials have said Kim suffered a stroke and underwent brain surgery .
North Korea has denied he was ill .
In the latest photos , Kim was seen viewing troops from the artillery unit , clapping and looking around barracks dotted with red-and - white slogans calling for loyalty to him .
Portraits of him and his late father and national founder Kim Il Sung were also seen hanging on a barracks wall .
Kim is the object of an intense personality cult in the totalitarian nation that he inherited after his father died in 1994 in communism 's first hereditary transfer of power .
" I think ( Kim ) wanted to show he is up and doing , as his health has improved enough to take pictures , " said Hong Hyun-ik , a North Korea expert at the security think tank Sejong Institute , south of Seoul .
However , the release of photos — instead of video footage — means Kim has n't fully recovered yet , he said .
Concern over Kim's absence was especially pointed since North Korea abandoned an international disarmament - for - aid accord and stopped disabling its Yongbyon nuclear reactor in mid August .
The country raised the stakes again this past week , banning inspectors from the entire nuclear complex .
However , diplomats told The Associated Press the U.S. government planned to remove North Korea from a terrorism blacklist Saturday after getting assurances the communist nation would allow inspections of its nuclear facilities .
U.S. President George W. Bush signed off on the move Friday in a bid to salvage the faltering disarmament accord aimed at getting North Korea to abandon atomic weapons , the diplomats said on condition of anonymity because the State Department had not yet announced the step .
" I think the Bush administration made this decision because otherwise , the considerable progress made so far would have evaporated , proving its policy on North Korea was a total failure " with just several months left in office , Hong said .

SAN FRANCISCO — Steven J. Wallach is completing the soul of his newest machine .
Thirty years ago , Mr. Wallach was one of a small team of computer designers profiled by Tracy Kidder in his Pulitzer Prize winning best seller , “ The Soul of a New Machine . ”
It was Mr. Wallach , then 33 , who served as the architect and baby sitter for his “ microkids , ” the young team that designed the Data General MV 8000 , the underdog minicomputer that kept the company alive in its brutal competition with the Digital Equipment Corporation .
At 63 , he is still at it .
He plans to introduce his new company , Convey Computer , and to describe the technical details of a new supercomputer intended for scientific and engineering applications at a supercomputing conference in Austin , Tex. , this week .
Mr. Wallach thinks he has come upon a new idea in computer design in an era when it has become fashionable to say that there are no new ideas .
So far , he has persuaded some of the leading thinkers in the high performance computing world that he might be right .
Both Intel and a second chip maker , Xilinx , have joined as early investors .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
By a 2 - to - 1 ratio , Americans blame Republicans over Democrats for the financial crisis that has swept across the country the past few weeks , a new national poll suggests .
Sen . Barack Obama greets supporters during a rally in Green Bay , Wisconsin , on Monday .
That may be contributing to better poll numbers for Sen. Barack Obama against Sen. John McCain in the race for the White House .
In a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey out Monday afternoon , 47 percent of registered voters questioned said Republicans are more responsible for the problems currently facing financial institutions and the stock market ; only 24 percent said Democrats are more responsible .
Twenty percent blame both parties equally and 8 percent say neither party is to blame .
The poll also indicates more Americans think Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , would do a better job handling an economic crisis than McCain , the Republican presidential nominee .
Watch Obama blast McCain on the economy »
Forty - nine percent of those questioned said Obama , D - Illinois , would display good judgment in an economic crisis , six points higher than McCain , R - Arizona .
And Obama has a 10 - point lead over McCain when it comes to who respondents think would better handle the economy overall .
These numbers seem to be affecting the battle for the presidency .
Fifty - one percent of registered voters now say they will back Obama , five points ahead of McCain , at 46 percent .
McCain and Obama were tied at 48 percent apiece in the previous CNN / Opinion Research survey conducted September 5 - 7 .
Obama 's advantage , while growing , is still within the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .
Where did Obama make his gains ?
" In two core McCain constituencies : men , who now narrowly favor Obama , and seniors , who have also flipped from McCain to Obama , " said Bill Schneider , a CNN senior political analyst .
When including people most likely to vote , the results are pretty much the same .
Among likely voters , Obama has a four - point lead , 51 percent to 47 percent .
Watch McCain blast Obama for not having a plan »
A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Monday also shows Obama leading McCain -- 49 percent to 44 percent .
" The economy has always been considered John McCain 's Achilles ' heel , and the CNN Poll of Polls started to show an Obama edge in the middle of last week -- just as the financial crisis began to hit home for many Americans , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
The poll also expands to include third - party candidates .
When included in the results , independent Ralph Nader has the support of 4 percent of those polled , with Libertarian candidate Bob Barr and Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney each at 1 percent .
Also , Obama has the backing of 48 percent of likely voters , three points ahead of McCain 's 45 percent .
A couple of other factors in the survey appear to contribute to Obama 's slight rise and McCain 's slight drop in the polls .
Fifty - three percent of those questioned say McCain , if elected , will mostly carry out the policies of President Bush , who remains extremely unpopular with most Americans .
Bush 's disapproval rating is up three points from the previous CNN / Opinion Research poll .
Watch Obama 's ad tying McCain to Bush »
The survey also indicates Obama has recaptured the " change " factor .
Just after the Republican convention , Obama 's lead had shrunk to eight points when voters were asked which candidate would be more likely to bring change .
His lead is up to 14 points in the new poll .
The margin of error on that question is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
Another factor could be McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Thirty - five percent of those questioned have an unfavorable opinion of her , up 8 points from a previous survey .
And two - thirds believe she and her husband should testify in the Alaska investigation into the firing of a state official .
" Change has always been Obama 's strong suit , but McCain and Palin clearly made inroads into that issue during the GOP convention , " Holland said .
" Palin , in particular , was seen as an agent of change when she made her first appearance on the national stage .
That may be changing now . "
The poll also sheds more light on how Americans feel about the financial crisis .
Twenty - two percent said they are " frightened " by the crisis , while two - thirds said they are " concerned . "
Eleven percent said they are " not worried . "
iReport.com :
Is the financial crisis hurting your business ?
Most Americans think the programs to deal with the financial crisis currently being worked on by Congress and the Bush administration will be unfair to U.S. taxpayers , but they think those programs will help the economy .
Six in 10 think the federal government should step in and address the financial crisis , and 37 percent say the government should stay out .
But when it comes to last week 's bailouts , support slips to 55 percent .
Given concerns about how future programs will affect taxpayers , it 's conceivable that public support for the new government plans could be even lower .
The survey comes out just four days before McCain and Obama face off in the first of three presidential debates .
Will the debates make a difference ?
Probably , since the poll finds that 14 percent of Americans say they have n't made up their minds yet .
The first debate , scheduled for Friday in Oxford , Mississippi , will focus on foreign policy , a topic that may play into what some registered voters see as a strength for McCain .
The poll finds 54 percent of them believe McCain would display better judgment in an international crisis ; 42 percent believe Obama would .
The margin of error on that question is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
Conducted Friday through Sunday , the CNN / Opinion Research poll questioned 1020 Americans including 909 registered voters and 697 likely voters .

The US secretly abandoned a nuclear weapon forty years ago after it was lost beneath the ice in northern Greenland , according to a BBC report .
The Beeb 's claims are made citing declassified documents obtained under the US Freedom of Information Act and people involved in the unsuccessful search .
The US military 's Thule Air Base was considered to have particular strategic importance in the Cold War , equipped with radar to scan for a possible Soviet Union missile attack from over the North Pole .
Because the Pentagon believed the base was a likely target for a Soviet strike , the military had nuclear - armed bombers circle over the site ready for an attack on Moscow .
In January 1968 , a B - 52 bomber carrying four nuclear devices crashed several kilometers from the base .
The explosives surrounding the weapons detonated without setting off the nuclear devices , which had n't been armed by the crew , the BBC said .
Military personnel and Danish workers spent months afterward searching the ice for tiny pieces of radioactive debris .
But despite the Pentagon 's claim that all four weapons were " destroyed , " in piecing together the fragments only three nukes were actually accounted for .
The documents also allegedly report a suspicious blackened section of ice with re-frozen shroud lines from a weapon parachute .
Scientists fearing the burning parts had melted through the ice sent a Star III submarine to search the ocean floor .
In order to maintain that all had gone well with cleanup , the true purpose of the mission was hidden from Greenland officials , the broadcaster claims .
But the underwater search was unsuccessful due to a combination of technical problems and the ice freezing over for the winter .
The military eventually abandoned the recovery , believing it unlikely any classified elements could be recovered by another country and that the radioactive material would soon enough dissolve in the ocean .

Court : Lawsuit over missing White House e-mails must continue Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008

This A judge on Monday dismissed the White House 's attempt to scuttle a lawsuit stemming from the Bush administration 's failure to archive at least 5 million internal e-mails , as required by federal law .
District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy 's ruling was the first formal consideration of the arguments in a case brought more than a year ago by two open - government nonprofit groups .
The National Security Archive and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the Executive Office of the President , the Office of Administration , the National Archives and Records Administration and others in an effort to force the White House to recover the missing e-mails and establish an adequate records management system .
A copy of Kennedy 's opinion is available here .
Kennedy ruled that CREW and the Archives raised valid claims about the failure to archive documents that must be maintained in line with the Federal Records
Act and that the plaintiffs have standing to move forward with their lawsuit .
" This is a pretty resounding victory for us , " Melanie Sloan , CREW 's executive director , told RAW STORY .
" It says the White House will be answerable for millions of missing e-mails . "
With Monday 's ruling , CREW and the Archives hope to be able to force more disclosures from the White House regarding the extent of the missing documents .
" Now this is a case that is certainly not going to be dismissed , so now they have to talk to us , " Meredith Fuchs , general counsel to the National Security Archive , said in an interview .
" It means the government has to give us a little more information about what they 're doing . "
A magistrate judge ruled this summer that the White House would have to preserve records on back - up tapes and computer hard - drives .
The plaintiffs are now expected to seek an expanded preservation order and may attempt to secure depositions from government officials who oversaw the archiving process .
At issue in the case are as many as 10 million e-mails that went missing from internal servers on 473 days between March 2003 and October 2005 .
An unknown number of the e-mails may be lost forever because the White House reused computer backup tapes that were meant to allow recovery of files that were deleted from the internal servers .
In 2002 , the Bush administration abandoned use of the Automated Records Management System , which had been instituted under President Clinton .
The system automatically captured and preserved all e-mail sent to and from the White House and archived different pieces of mail to comply with the Federal Records Act and Presidential Records Act .
The White House did not replace that system with any comprehensive method to archive e-mails .
The White House has remained tight - lipped about the extent of the archiving failure .
In this case , as in virtually every other instance where it is questioned , the administration has argued that executive power and a prerogative for secrecy outweigh the public 's right to know and the need for oversight from other branches of government .
There is hope that Monday 's decision will force a change in that outlook .
" What this decision says is that 's not right , " Fuchs told RAW STORY .
" In fact , the public has a role ... and the public can say to the Executive Office of the President , ' You have to follow the law . ' "

Growing over the ages through contributions to the genre from Christophe Chabouté , Angelo Agostini and , of course , Richard Outcault , this then - revolutionary new way for artists to create and deliver a narrative exploded throughout the art world , leaving a lasting mark that would mature over the years , morphing into a mainstream artistic medium .
Today , with a more stylized focus on heroic tales and dark worlds beyond the imagination , this genre continuously churns out amazing artwork from some extremely talented artists .

Cerberus Capital , a highly secretive NYC - based vulture investment fund , wants the U.S. government and taxpayers to bailout its failed investment in Chrysler and its failing investment in GMAC .
Its partner in this raid on the US Treasury is General Motors , a woefully insolvent automobile manufacturer whose CEO is paid $ 40 k each day .
Here ’s why a bailout for GM and / or Chrysler is a bad idea .
Background
Cerberus Capital uses hedge funds as the vehicles in which to invest in various companies .
Apparently , the hedge fund known as Cerberus Series 4 is the owner of an 80 percent interest in Chrysler and a related fund owns or controls a 51 percent interest in GMAC .
Not surprisingly for a company known for its secrecy , Cerberus has not disclosed which entities actually own the interests in Chrysler and GMAC , has not disclosed what fees Cerberus has taken or accrued from its investments , and has not disclosed what severance payments would have to be made if GM actually acquired Chrysler .
For example , would Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli get another big payday if he ’s cut loose in a merger ?
The interrelationships among GMAC , Chrysler Financial , Cerberus and other entities are also a well - kept secret .
Secrecy , Secrecy , Secrecy
Why is everything so secret ?
What happened to the idea of open government ?
A few questions come to mind :
1. Exactly what is the Cerberus / GM proposal to borrow $ 10 b from the US Treasury in order to fund a merger , the terms of which are also secret ?
Is it in writing ?
Where is a copy ?
What were the proposed terms that were rejected by the current US Treasury ?
Is another proposal in the works ?
How is the $ 10 b going to be repaid by two insolvent auto manufacturers ?
2 . Which lobbyists represented GM and Cerberus in getting their loan application before the US Treasury ?
How much were the lobbyists paid ?
With whom did GM / Cerberus meet ?
Where are the notes of any meeting or other communications about the loan proposal ?
3 . What do we know about the financial condition of the proposed borrowers ?
Where is Chrysler ’s current balance sheet and income statement ?
Surely Chrysler is insolvent on an equitable basis , and probably insolvent on a balance sheet basis .
Why is basic financial information not available for public inspection and comment ?
4 . Where are the financial statements for the Cerberus Series Four hedge fund ?
US taxpayers are being asked to bailout the failed auto related investments by Cerberus Series Four , while the profitable investments in the same fund are not being shared with taxpayers .
GM is woefully insolvent and should file Chapter 11
5 . As of June 30 , 2008 , GM had total assets of $ 136 b and total liabilities of $ 191b , a $ 55 b deficiency .
Thus , GM is insolvent .
How can GM ever repay a $ 10 b bailout , or any bailout for that matter ?
As of June 30 , 2008 , its current liabilities were $ 70 b , dwarfing its current assets of $ 55 b .
Moreover , we do not know what deals GM has made to stretch / defer repayment of its account payables .
6 . Is Chrysler in any better shape than GM ?
Probably not , but without a current balance sheet the definitive answer is a secret .
7. Assuming Chrysler is insolvent ( liabilities exceed assets ) , then the equity interest of Cerberus and Daimler ( the 20 percent equity owner ) are worthless and these entities are not even entitled to a seat at the merger negotiating table .
The real economic owners of Chrysler are its creditors and employees , who are also in the dark about the proposed US treasury bailout .
Who really benefits from a GM / Cerberus / Chrysler merger ?
8 . The US taxpayers can’t benefit since there is no repayment plan .
Not surprisingly , Cerberus and its hedge fund are back door beneficiaries , because the 51 percent Cerberus ownership interest in GMAC will increase in value if GM and GMAC survive .
Chrysler is a lost cause , but with the value of the Cerberus investment in GMAC also plummeting , Cerberus is trying to prop - up GMAC by helping GM survive .
Is Cerberus pledging its equity interest in GMAC to the US Treasury as security for a government loan to GM ?
Why not ?
Is GM pledging its 49 percent equity interest in GMAC to secure repayment of any loan by the US Treasury ?
More secrets kept from the public .
9 . The self - dealing by Cerberus extends to wanting to cherry - pick the Chrysler assets and keep the auto financing arm for itself .
What is the value of the Chrysler auto financing business , and why should Cerberus benefit ?
10 . GMAC had negative net income of $ 3b for the first 6 months of 2008 .
GM ’s ownership interest in GMAC was impaired by at least $ 2.7 b during the same six month period , meaning that Cerberus Series Four hedge fund had suffered a similar loss in value in its investment in GMAC .
Why should taxpayers bailout the millionaire investors in the Cerberus hedge funds ?
More secrecy and lack of disclosure
11 . Does GM plan to make any payments to GMAC , payments that directly benefit Cerberus ?
As vehicle residual values decrease , GM is obligated to make payments to GMAC under “ residual support and risk sharing ” agreements .
On August 6 , 2008 , GM paid GMAC / Cerberus $ 646 m , money which could have been used by GM to fund its ongoing operations and its obligations to employees .
12 . Should any taxpayer money be used to fund payments to GMAC / Cerberus , whether that money is used directly or indirectly ?
How much , if anything is Cerberus investing in new money to prop up its investment in GMAC ?
If it is not investing in Chrysler or GMAC we can reasonably conclude that its analysis shows that the investment is a bad one .
What ’s bad for Cerberus is bad for the US Treasury .
Although it appears that the Cerberus Series Four has money available to make follow - on investments , it makes no sense to throw good money after bad if you can lobby the US Treasury to make the bad investment for you .
A related question is whether the Cerberus equity interests in GMAC are going to be used as collateral for the loans that will be used ( albeit indirectly ) to bailout GMAC .
Why should equity bear none of the risk but get all of the benefit ?
More non-disclosure
13 .
What is Cerberus ResCap Financing LLC and who has seen its financial statements or the agreements relating to the $ 3.5 b secured loan facility ?
How is this secured loan impacted by the bailout of Cerberus / GM / Chrysler ?
Deepening insolvency is likely
14 . GM ’s current insolvency and continuing losses will trigger additional liabilities , and make it doubtful that GM will be able to make payments promised to employees and former employees or perform its labor agreements .
GM ’s worsening financial condition also deepens its losses from its derivative contracts .
How would a GM / Cerberus Chrysler merger affect these liabilities ?
Will any government loans be used to reduce the $ 30 b of GM accounts payable , or , in the event of a merger , to pay down Chrysler accounts payable in some still unknown amount ?
Sadly , we do n’t even know what Cerberus proposed as the use of funds and we have no idea how Cerberus will benefit since we have no financial information on Chrysler or Cerberus .
15 . As GM and Chrysler idle plants and facilities , more employees are laid off the employee related liabilities of GM / Chrysler will increase by hundreds of millions .
Since GM and Chrysler are insolvent , who will pay these increased costs ?
Can any of these costs be avoided in a Chapter 11 case of Chrysler or GM ?
16 . Should taxpayer money be used , directly or indirectly , to pay GM and Chrysler obligations that are coming due while these entities are unable to pay from their own assets .
Surely not , but what is being proposed , and who will benefit if GM debt is redeemed at par by vulture investors that bought the debt at pennies on the dollar ?
A related question : will any Cerberus entities benefit from government funded redemptions of auto maker debt ?
Is it possible that Cerberus is trading in credit default swaps and actually benefiting from the difficulties of Chrysler , GM and GMAC ?
Yet more items of non-disclosure on a long list of secret items .
Conclusion
17 . GM , GMAC and Chrysler are not credit worthy and are unable to borrow money on any basis , secured or unsecured .
What ’s Good for GM / Chrysler is a Chapter 11 Filing
18 . GM needs to be restructured , which means it must change the terms of its legal obligations to suppliers , bondholders and employees .
The only vehicle to accomplish the needed changes is Chapter 11 , which lets GM reject unfavorable contracts , renegotiate its debt obligations , defer interest and principal payments and gives it time to fix its business .
Without a chapter 11 filing a government infusion of $ 10 b cash will be gone in six months when GM uses the money in 2009 to pay bondholders and employees billions of dollars , payments which do nothing to help GM survive .
19 .
Chrysler , the stepchild of a distressed debt vulture fund , is also a prime candidate for Chapter 11 .
But Chrysler should be liquidated , not reorganized .
A liquidating Chapter 11 case , expressly permitted by the Bankruptcy Code , can be used to keep Chrysler operating while its divisions are sold .
With adequate Chapter 11 funding line workers can keep their jobs and benefits , and non-essential executives can be fired at minimal cost to the Chapter 11 debtor , known as the debtor - in - possession .
Trade creditors will continue to ship to Chrysler because their post-petition claims will have a priority in payment .
Chapter 11 also lets the Bankruptcy Judge appoint an examiner to conduct an investigation into the financial affairs of Chrysler and its equity owners , and to sue to recover any improper payments .
Chapter 11 will also make it clear to Daimler and Cerberus that their investment is worthless and they will not be able to use their position of control to improperly benefit .
20 . Cerberus should acknowledge the financial reality and either file a Chapter 11 case for Chrysler or have a federal receiver appointed so that the value of the Chrysler assets can be maximized in an orderly sale procedure .
The US government should fund the Chapter 11 case and keep Chrysler operating by giving Chrysler a debtor - in - possession loan having seniority over all other liabilities of Chrysler , thereby assuring taxpayers that the money will be repaid out of the proceeds of asset sales .
The US could also give a senior secured loan to GM to help GM acquire assets from Chrysler , but this would require the cooperation of bondholders , cooperation not likely to be forthcoming .
On the other hand , if GM is in Chapter 11 then the government could refinance the GM operations without fear that taxpayer money would be diverted to pay existing creditors .
Barack Obama and John McCain throw elbows at each other over the economy .
Debate II : McCain struggles to derail Obama
NASHVILLE , Tenn . — John McCain came here Tuesday hoping the second presidential debate would help him jar loose a campaign that for the past three weeks has been about the economy , the economy and the economy .
He did n't get his wish .
Advertisement
Energized in his demeanor , McCain took his case to Barack Obama at Belmont University with waspish intensity , and he came with at least one big new idea on how the country can weather this financial storm .
But the transcendent threat of the nation 's economic crisis utterly dominated the evening — another night when millions of Americans did not hear a crisp counterargument from McCain about why the Democrats can't blame the meltdown on eight years of Republican White House rule .
By night 's end , while McCain knocked Obama back on his heels at times , Democrats felt their nominee had made no misstep and that a playing field utterly focused on economic issues still strongly favors the Illinois senator .
McCain needed to move the conversation beyond the economy , but a 500 - point drop Tuesday of the Dow Jones Industrial Average made it virtually impossible .
Much of the debate was a substantive discussion of the $ 700 billion bailout legislation , the prospect of the economy worsening before it gets better , and the housing crisis .
McCain did come with new ammunition on how to challenge his opponent ’s seeming superiority with voters on economic issues .
“ One of the real catalysts , really the match that lit the fire , was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , ” McCain said , referring to the government - sanctioned mortgage lenders .
“ They ’re the ones that , with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and friends in Washington , that went out and made all these risky loans , gave them to people that could never afford to pay back . ”
The comment prompted Obama to drop his head and smile .
It was one of the first in a series of elbows thrown by both nominees .
“ Now , I ’ve got to correct a little bit of Sen. McCain ’s history , not surprisingly , ” Obama said .
“ I never promoted Fannie Mae .
In fact , Sen. McCain ’s campaign chairman ’s firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae . ”
That was one of the more personal exchanges on a night that some thought might be the culmination of days of increasing nastiness on the campaign trail .
The speculation proved mostly misplaced .
McCain did not mention the 1960s - era radical William Ayers , with whom Obama has been acquainted in Chicago .
Obama did not raise Charles Keating , the McCain supporter whose involvement in the savings and loan crisis tarnished the Arizona Republican .
Neither man called the other a liar .
Still , the tension between them was palpable .
McCain barely contained his disregard for Obama , at one point referring to the Democratic nominee as “ that one ” when describing who voted for a 2005 energy bill .
Obama kept a tight smile that occasionally gave way to laughter .
The debate , held on the charmingly Southern campus of this college in downtown Nashville , came at an absolutely crucial time for McCain , who has seen his burst of momentum after the Republican convention slow into a potentially fatal downward spiral in polls in key battleground states .
Just as telling , the mood within the Republican Party — so buoyant after Sarah Palin ’s selection as McCain ’s running mate and her dramatic national debut in St. Paul — has turned morose .
Party leaders on hand the past few days in Nashville have stayed loyal in public ; but behind the scenes , there was a litany of complaints about the McCain campaign ’s basic competence and its bungling of the economic issue , in particular .
Those stakes — a sense that the election might be at a decisive tipping point — frame the results of this debate .
It was not enough for McCain to appear the victor within the prism of the political media ’s combination of analysis and theatrical criticism .
At this moment , he needed to somehow redefine himself as a candidate and re-emerge as the heroic national leader those close to him have always said he can be , a man who can toss off the baggage his party currently carries and guide a nation that faces what is fast becoming an existential economic threat .
But McCain struggled mightily to meet that goal , and the tide of this particular moment of history is daunting for him .
He was ceaselessly energetic , prowling the stage like a prizefighter , seeming to revel in the town hall meeting format that he so loves .
His aim : to connect with average voters and reclaim his image as an independent operator who cares only about solutions , particularly for the current economic mess .
“ Americans are angry , they ’re upset , and they ’re a little fearful .
It ’s our job to fix the problem , ” he said at the outset .
Later , in the brief section devoted to foreign policy , he went over to pat the shoulder of a questioner , Terry Chary , a naval chief petty officer .
" Everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer , " he said .
But on an evening during which he hoped to turn the page , the severity of the financial meltdown the nation is witnessing dominated virtually every question and answer .
That is not good territory for McCain , who again seemed either unable or unwilling to distance himself from President Bush ’s economic record .
On Tuesday , Obama crystallized the economic policies of the Bush years as a doctrine , insisting “ that we should strip away regulation , consumer protections , let the market run wild and prosperity would rain down on all of us .
It has n’t worked that way .
And now we have to take some decisive action . ”
McCain railed against earmarks and dropped a new proposal suggesting the government should buy up mortgages residents can no longer afford and renegotiate the value of their homes .
He offered precious few details , and how he would pay for such a massive effort and maintain a spending freeze was initially confusing .
The campaign later put out more specific language saying the direct cost of this plan would be roughly $ 300 billion and would be funded in large part by the bailout package passed this week by Congress .
But he never directly answered Obama ’s charge — one that has to be central to the decision of many voters .
McCain ’s dilemma , writ large as the campaign enters its final weeks , and seen in painful microcosm at Belmont , is that this campaign seems increasingly won or lost on the economy .
In fairness , he bloodied Obama at times , on taxes and on his inability or unwillingness to take on his party in the past .
McCain ’s campaign had made clear in recent days he would be tougher , and he was .
The Arizona senator even seemed to take a shot at Sen .
Joe Biden when he railed about overblown insurance mandates that would cover hair transplants .
He scored with a jab at Obama in which he said the nation cannot afford “ on - the - job training ” on national security with a first - term senator .
Obama , however , deftly responded with a clearly pre-cooked refrain in which he acknowledged that there were some things he does n’t understand — such as “ how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 , while Osama bin Laden and Al - Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us .
That was Sen. McCain 's judgment , and it was the wrong judgment . ”
But political tactics or rhetorical devices , even when they draw fair distinctions , just may not work in a time of such deepening crisis .
For a campaign that appears to be behind — even in an election cycle in which appearances have always been deceiving — that ’s bad news .
“ You ’re not interested in hearing politicians point fingers , ” Obama answered Oliver Clark , the evening ’s second questioner , who asked how the bailout package passed by Congress would affect him .
“ What you 're interested in is trying to figure out : How is this going to impact you ? ”
The bottom line of this debate — and the bad news for John McCain — is that he ’s likely right .
No matter how desperately Sarah Palin tried last night to cast herself as the poor little victim , she only succeeded in sounding extremely arrogant and condescending .
Could you just imagine the outcry if Hillary had delivered the hit - piece of a speech Palin did last night ?
The cat calls of “ shrill ! ” would still be reverberating .
Palin started last night by drawing a line in the sand and trying to intimidate the media that has correctly covered her since the surprise announcement of her vice presidential candidacy .
Palin said last night :
“ But here 's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators : I 'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I 'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country . ”
Relax Sarah ; you ’re not going to Washington quite yet .
So here is a little news flash for you .
You will not get a good opinion from the media unless you deserve one .
So far , you do not and attacking the media for your own shortcomings is not going to help your situation .
It is not the media ’s fault for example that you are under an ethics investigation with a special counsel who says he has over 20 emails and voice mails from you and your people trying to coerce someone into firing your brother in law .
It is not the media ’s fault that your lawyer has now tried to move this investigation to a board , which consists of three people you have appointed ; a clear conflict of interest .
It is not the media ’s fault Sarah , when it is discovered that you are the Earmark Queen of Alaska , sucking in 27 million dollars for your little town of 6,500 people , while claiming to be a “ reformer ” .
It is not the fault of the media that there is video of you attributing the war in Iraq to God .
It is not the fault of the media that your pastor is on record as twisting scripture to fit his own political agenda .
It is likewise , not the fault of the media that you claim to be a reformer but have n’t reformed anything .
And while you are at it , try to ease up on the mocking of a United States Senator Ms. Palin .
I know you were just reading what they wrote for you off the teleprompter but this was quite uncalled for :
“ I guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a " community organizer , " except that you have actual responsibilities . ”
What responsibilities did you have Sarah ?
Trying to decide which moose to shoot first on your hunting trips ?
This is not to belittle small - town America but to not allow someone who really has n’t done anything to claim superiority over people who have .
Sarah Palin was Mayor of Wasilla Alaska .
The population of Wasilla Alaska is 6,500 people .
Allow me to provide some perspective .
The island I live on is only 17 miles long and about five miles across .
It is pretty small .
The population however is over 477,000 people .
Wasilla again , has 6,500 residents .
So ease up on the mockery of a man who served a community that dwarfs yours and was then elected to the state legislature before being elected to the United States Senate .
Palin also claimed to oppose the Bridge to Nowhere , but conveniently left out that she initially had supported it .
She also claimed to have balanced her budget but omitted that during her six years as Mayor , she increased general government expenditures by over 33 % .
During those same six years the amount of taxes collected by the City increased by 38 % .
She inherited a city with zero debt , but , despite the increase in taxes , left it with debt of over $ 22 million .
Despite her fiscal mismanagement , Palin also veered into the subject of energy , pretending to be an expert .
When it comes to oil and gas she said :
“ And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska : we 've got lots of both . ”
No thanks Sarah .
I will take it from the experts who have correctly concluded that drilling offshore will have zero effect for 30 years and even then , it will not affect gas prices one iota .
You see maybe if you understood that we deal oil on a global market and that we do not have anywhere near enough of our own to satisfy our consumption , you would have realized how inane your own comments were .
You see , the only people who really stand to benefit from offshore drilling are the oil companies that are already making billions off of our backs .
You know , the same oil companies you pretended to fight against last night .
Then Palin decided to dive off the deep end of GOP deception and smearing of Barack Obama :
But listening to him speak , it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate .

Here was the scene last night at City Hall , where over 2,000 people protested Proposition 8 's passing .
The crowed chanted " Marriage , equality , U.S.A. , " and marched throughout the streets of San Francisco , commiserating the win of California 's new ban on gay marriage .
The march was surprisingly peacefully , with no arrests .

If you use Facebook and care about your privacy , take a moment to read this blog entry .
Facebook has made some major changes that may allow a great deal more people to see your personal photos and videos , date of birth , family relationships , and other sensitive information .
While logged in to Facebook , click the " Settings " link and you should see a box that looks like the one pictured below .
You may see that Facebook has reset your privacy settings , so that the everyone can now see the information on your " About Me " page , as well as your " Family and Relationships " data ; " Work and Education " ; and most importantly " Posts I Create , " which includes status updates , links , photos , videos and notes .
Below is a screen shot of what my privacy settings looked like when I recently logged in .
The new privacy settings instituted across the Facebook network may also expose your birthday , religious and political views , and " photos and videos of me " to your " Friends of friends , " meaning that any one of your friend 's friends can now view this information .
This " Friends of friends " setting may be perhaps the most important , as it has the potential to dramatically expand the number of people who now have access to this data .
If you do not wish to accept these new privacy settings , change all or some of the relevant radio buttons to the " Old Settings " selection , and then click the " Save Settings " button at the bottom of the page .
The changes may have even caught Facebook.com Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg by surprise : Valleywag features a story Friday noting that the new privacy settings exposed a cache of more than 290 photos of Zuckerberg that were uploaded by people who had tagged him in their pictures but that were previously hidden ( the photos do n't appear to be accessible at the moment ) .
Sophos ' Graham Cluley has published a short video explaining in a bit more detail what these privacy changes mean .
For example , Cluley examines Facebook 's privacy policy , and finds a rather interesting explanation of what Facebook means when it says " everyone " .
For example ( my emphasis added in the direct quote from the privacy policy , below :
" Information set to ' everyone ' is publicly available information , may be accessed by everyone on the Internet ( including people not logged into Facebook ) , is subject to indexing by third party search engines , may be associated with you outside of Facebook ( such as when you visit other sites on the internet ) , and may be imported and exported by us and others without privacy limitations . "
" The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to ' everyone . '
You can review and change the default settings in your privacy settings .
If you delete ' everyone ' content that you posted on Facebook , we will remove it from your Facebook profile , but have no control over its use outside of Facebook . "
Judging from the user comments posted to the Facebook Site Governance page , these changes have not been well received by the Facebook community overall .
Update , 1:54 p.m. ET : Added link to Sophos video and additional information about Facebook 's privacy policy .
One of the surest marks of a pseudoscience is that it stays forever the same , never altering its claims , even as the world changes around it and revolutions in our knowledge come and go .
While science evolves over time , with theories becoming refined to more closely track the truth , popular delusions stay the same through the centuries , at most changing their outer robes to match the spirit of the times .
I wrote about this in a past entry in this series , in which the demonic succubi and incubi that were once imagined to haunt sleepers become , in the modern era , gray - skinned alien abductors .
Today ’s post concerns a different topic , and one that has likewise seen its manifestation mutate over the ages : the hysteria of alleged Satanic cults that subject children to horrific sexual abuse and violence .
Some people claim to have been victims of these cults ; some even claim to be ex-members .
As always , Jack Chick provides a handy example of what a large number of Christians and other theists still actually believe .
But , as I said , many popular delusions update their outer trappings to match the times .
This is also true of Satanic cult beliefs , which in modern times have taken on the form of secret conspiracies of pedophiles gathering to prey on children .
The most infamous example is the 1980s McMartin case , in which a California family who owned a preschool were accused of hundreds of counts of sexual abuse of the children under their care .
After a six - year trial and the expenditure of millions of dollars by the prosecution , the case ended without a single conviction .
( This story was dramatized in the movie Indictment . )
The McMartin case in particular began with the allegations of one woman , later revealed to be mentally ill , who alleged that her son had been sexually abused by one of the teachers at the preschool .
Taking her at her word , the police began a dragnet investigation that culminated with hundreds of children being interviewed by a California clinic , the Children ’s Institute International .
The CII therapists took the approach that abuse was certain and the only obstacle was getting the children to admit it .
Under their guidance , children were peppered with leading questions ; the therapists described what they thought had happened ( “ I know that the kids were touched ” ) and pressured the children to agree .
When children denied those claims , they were told , “ You better not play dumb ” , or “ I do n’t want to hear any more ‘ no ’s ” , and informed that many of their classmates had already told the truth .
When they gave in , they were rewarded .
Despite the bizarre nature of the allegations that emerged from this technique ( sex with movie stars , sexual abuse taking place in hot - air balloons , one of the alleged abusers killing a giraffe in front of them ) , these videotaped “ confessions ” were presented as evidence at trial .
It has since been discovered , and is now widely known , that leading questions and high - pressure interviews such as this can readily generate false memories and false confessions , even in adults , and much more so in suggestible children .
Most Satanic panics , including the McMartin case , share the attribute of extremely implausible allegations for which no physical evidence is presented .
The scope of the imagined conspiracies is inevitably vast , with estimates ranging from 50,000 to an astonishing two million murders by Satanic cults in the U.S. each year .
( As that article notes , the higher estimate would mean that the annual death rate from Satanic cults surpasses the number of U.S. deaths in World War II , Korea and Vietnam combined . )
Abuse and crime on such a massive scale should be easy to demonstrate , and yet no undisputed Satanic cult has ever been broken up and prosecuted , no physical evidence of such astonishing allegations ever presented .
As with other conspiracy theories , the absence of evidence is taken by true believers to simply be further confirmation of the conspiracy ’s scope and power , even though the idea of such a massive cover - up being successful does violence to everything we know about human psychology .
What Satanic panics show , more than anything else , is the malleability of memory .
In matters as important as this , we can not rely solely on testimonial evidence : human beings are far too prone to tell untruths , to confabulate , and to unwittingly encourage others to do the same .
The problem of sexual predators that molest children is very real , and all too common .
But the idea of organized , underground cabals of devil - worshippers gathering to practice diabolical rites on innocents is a hysterical fantasy , nothing more .
This kind of irrational overreaction only ensures that innocents will be unjustly swept up in dragnets of overzealous law enforcement , rather than targeting our legal resources where they are most needed to take on genuine predators .

Harris during his hour record ride .
Photo : Matthew Koschara
New York City ’s Ken Harris ( CRCA / Jonathan Adler Racing ) set a new world masters hour record for the age 40 - 44 group at the Valley Preferred Cycling Center velodrome in Trexlertown , Pennsylvania .
On Tuesday evening , Harris added about 400 meters to the old record of 45.189 set by Dr. Neal Stansbury in September 2003 at Manchester , England .
The new record is 45.587 kilometers .
A UCI official was on site to certify the record .
Harris is one of the leaders of a New York - based Adler team , and president of the Century Road Club Association , the largest racing club in the United States .
The record was set on a Cevelo P3C frame with a Zipp 808 front wheel and a 909 disc .
Harris has taken several state championships on the road and track , including the track omnium in 2007 and 2008 , and won a masters national championship ( 40 - 44 ) in the points race in 2007 .

Finally
I begin to understand the cause of the problem .
The cmd shell transscript below ( Windows Vista , 32 bit ) shows that jython .
bat breaks if the environment variable JAVA_HOME is not quoted , and works if JAVA_HOME is quoted : C:\stuff\jython\jython-2.5a3\bin>set

Since we cannot make assumptions how a user will define JAVA_HOME , I have to find a way for empty - test JAVA_HOME both in the quoted and unquoted case .

To illustrate the problem : C:\stuff\temp>set TEST=my test C:\stuff\temp>echo %TEST % my test C:\stuff\temp > if not [ % TEST % ] == [ ] echo [ % TEST % ] is set " test ] == [ ] " is syntactically not valid here C:\stuff\temp > if not " %TEST % " == " " echo [ % TEST % ] is set [ my test ] is set C:\stuff \temp > if not '% TEST % '== '' echo [ % TEST % ] is set " test '== ' ' " is syntactically not valid here C:\stuff\temp > set TEST = " my test " C:\stuff\temp>echo %TEST % " my test " C:\stuff\temp > if not [ % TEST % ]== [ ] echo [ % TEST % ] is set [ " my test " ] is set C:\stuff \temp > if not " %TEST % " == " " echo [ % TEST % ] is set " test " " == " " " is syntactically not valid here C:\stuff\temp > if not '% TEST % '== '' echo [ % TEST % ] is set [ " my test " ] is set
The error message is my translation from the German : kann syntaktisch an dieser Stelle nicht verarbeitet werden Summary :

The attached test_empty .
bat allows quoted and unquoted strings to be tested for emptiness .
The output is as follows : C:\stuff\temp>test_empty .bat [ " my home 1 " ] was set : 1 command : [ " my home 1 \bin\ java " ] [ my home 2 ] was set : 1 command : [ " my home 2 \bin\ java " ] [ " " ] was set : 0 command : [ java ] [ ] was set : 0 command : [ java ] [ ] was set : 0 command : [ java ] [ " myhome6 " ] was set : 1 command : [ " myhome6\bin\java " ] [ myhome7 ] was set : 1 command : [ " myhome7\bin\java " ]

There is still a follow - up issue in the boot classpath calculation .
If JYTHON_HOME is set unquoted to a directory containing a space , such as JYTHON_HOME=C :\stuff \jython\bat test , the java command looks like : " C: \Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin\java " - Xss512k -Xbootclasspath/a:C:\stuff\jython\bat test\jython.jar ;" C:\stuff\jython\bat "

Based on figures from an annual count of bicyclists conducted since 1984 , the New York City Department of Transportation announced on Thursday that commuter cycling rose a remarkable 35 percent between 2007 and 2008 .
The data [ pdf ] are suggestive , not definitive , but officials said they considered the trend to be genuine .
The annual count , known as a screenline count , was first conducted in 1980 and has been done annually since 1984 .
This year ’s count identified 12,583 , up from 9,327 in the previous year .
The counts were were historically taken once a year , during the middle of the week for a 12 - hour period , 7 a.m. to 7 p.m .
Last year , the Department of Transportation expanded the time window to 18 hours and added two additional counting dates to add more robustness to the sample .
( The count was adjusted to allow for a year - to - year comparison . )
The Commuter Cycling Indicator , as the annual tally is known , was conducted at the Brooklyn , Manhattan , Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges ; at the Whitehall Terminal of the Staten Island Ferry ; and along the Hudson River Greenway , at West 50th Street .
According to the department , the 18 - hour count showed that over a quarter of the cyclists counted used city streets earlier in the morning and later in the day than previously believed .
Certain bike routes have become particularly popular :
The number of cyclists crossing the Williamsburg Bridge has quadrupled from 2000 to 2008 , to 4,000 on a typical day .
“ This growth is real , ” said Wiley Norvell , a spokesman for Transportation Alternatives , the leading advocacy group for cyclists and pedestrians in New York City .
“ It ’s born out by what I see on the streets every day , and we ’re reaping the rewards from the city ’s investment in bicycling over the last several years .
More and better - designed bike lanes are producing more cyclists and more first - time cyclists . ”
Since 2007 , 140 miles of new bicycle routes have been added to the on - street bicycle network .
From 5 to 6:30 p.m. Thursday , on the Manhattan side of the entry to the Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bridges , the department distributed more than 1,500 bicycle lights over the next few days , pegged to the end of Daylight Saving Time this weekend .
Cyclists are required under state traffic law to use white headlights and red taillights from dusk until dawn on all New York streets .
“ This unprecedented increase shows we are well on the way toward our goal of doubling the number of bike commuters , ” Janette Sadik - Khan , the transportation commissioner , said in a statement .
“ As these numbers rise , cyclists should take all safety precautions , while drivers must be vigilant when sharing our streets with this growing population . ”
The state three years ago began requiring firms getting tax breaks through a state jobs program to report how much they spent with minority - and women - owned vendors .
But it has turned into little more than a bureaucratic paper shuffle that collects little useful information .
They condemned Russia ( without proposing specific punishment ) .
They proclaimed heartfelt support for President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia , the congressional darling ( without any questioning whether he was culpable in inviting the attacks ) .
And they publicly voiced strong backing for Georgia ’s entry into NATO , a possibility that most of these same foreign policy experts acknowledge privately is as likely as a warm winter in Moscow .
“ At a time when we really needed penetrating , thoughtful foreign policy analysis about what we should be doing towards Russia , all the people who work on this and wanted to be in the next administration were saying nothing but domestic political posturing , ” said George Perkovich , vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , who makes clear that he is not seeking a job in the next White House .
“ They were all protecting themselves and positioning themselves for confirmation hearings . ”
That ’s because everyone here remembers what happened to Strobe Talbott back in 1994 , when Mr. Talbott ’s nomination to be deputy secretary of state was almost derailed after some congressional critics dug up a few of his writings from his tenure at Time magazine that were critical of Israel .
While Democrats will have a majority in the Senate in the coming Obama administration , it will not be difficult for congressional critics to tie up Mr. Obama ’s nominations if they see something they do n’t like .
So , for now , mum will continue to be the word for the aspirants to the national security team ; indeed , a good way to tell that someone is no longer up for a job is that they suddenly start blabbing .
In the meantime , here are lists of possibilities for some of the top national security jobs .
Remember , the quieter they are , the better chance they have .
And do n’t forget this disclaimer  mentioning someone for a top job usually guarantees that they wo n’t get it .

Composting is , in part , a temperature - dependent process .
But that does n't mean that you have to stop composting in winter .
How you keep your compost going depends on what sort of composting you do .
To compost in winter :
Hot composters carry on .
Hot composting is an intensive process .
Hot composters collect their composting materials in piles until they have enough stored to build a compost heap all at once .
They carefully layer their green and brown materials into the heap , ensuring that the right mix of materials is used and that there 's plenty of air built into the heap .
Once the heap is built , microbial activity causes the compost to heat up - and that will still happen in winter .
Adding some insulation to your compost bin will help to keep the heat in and your hot heap composting rapidly .
Cold composters continue .
Cold composting is a much more laid back affair .
You add your materials to the compost bin as and when you have them .
In the average household , the mix of garden waste and kitchen waste , plus some waste paper and cardboard , means that the mix of materials in the heap is right .
Scrunched up paper or cardboard tubes , plus any twiggy bits , make sure there 's enough air in the heap .
It wo n't heat up though , and the compost takes longer to rot down - especially in winter .
For the best results , site your compost bin where it will catch any winter sun .
Even so , a bin that was full at the beginning of winter should have finished composting by spring .
Worm composters take shelter .
Worms , like many of us , slow down in cold weather - so you need to make sure that you 're not adding more kitchen waste to your worm compost bin than they can cope with .
And if they 're left outdoors then they 're at risk from drowning if there 's a lot of rain or freezing when the temperature drops .
If you can bring your worm bin indoors ( a garage or shed is ideal ) then that 's great - otherwise try insulating the bin and giving it a hat to keep the worst of the rain off .
But do n't obstruct all the air holes , or you 'll suffocate your worms !
Trench composters dig deep .
Trench composting prepares very nutritious soil for hungry crops next year .
It 's easy enough to do - dig a trench to about a spade 's depth where you will be planting your peas and beans , or squashes and melons , next year .
Put the soil to one side .
Add kitchen waste to the trench as and when you have it , and cover it with soil .
Once the trench is full , cap it off with the rest of the soil and leave it to settle .
By the spring you 'll have rich planting holes that give your crops a real advantage .
But you 'll have to be quick and dig those trenches before the soil freezes solid !
Bokashi composters stay indoors .
In some parts of the world the winter weather is so severe that outdoor composting really is n't an option - you wo n't be able to get to the bin .
In that case , try investing in a pair of buckets with lids and taps , and a supply of Bokashi ( EM ) bran .
Then you can store your kitchen waste in the buckets all winter , and it wo n't smell bad or go off , and you can add it to the outside compost heap whenever you are able .
Wherever you are , and however you compost , there 's a way you can continue through the winter and avoid wasting all those compostable materials .
Always remember the main points of composting - get the mix of materials right , keep the heap moist , and make sure there 's air in there - and your compost heap will be happy right through the winter .
And do n't forget that fall is the time to collect fallen leaves for making leaf mold compost !
It 's the same case , with the same defendants , but the terror - support retrial of five former officials at the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) offered a substantially different presentation from last year 's original trial .
That case ended in a mistrial when jurors failed to reach unanimous verdicts on most of the counts involved .
The only verdicts acquitted a former HLF chairman of 31 of the 32 counts against him .
Jurors later complained the case was too complicated , with too many charges and a mountain of evidence to navigate .
Prosecutors listened , dramatically streamlining their presentation .
But they still found a way to present four new witnesses while trimming two weeks off their case .
They offered a host of new summary and demonstrative exhibits , including a highlight reel of a secret 1993 meeting of Hamas supporters seeking to derail American efforts to negotiate a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians ( see story here ) .
Defendant Shukri Abu Baker , HLF 's former executive director , is among several participants who discuss the need to mislead Americans about their true agenda , saying " War is deception . "
The Dallas Morning News and Wall Street Journal have taken notice of the adjustments .
The streamlined presentation brings a sharper focus on the basic facts and key exhibits in evidence .
The new witnesses added valuable context to the laws the men are accused of violating and an insider 's account of what HLF did with the money it collected in the name of needy Palestinians .
Taken as a whole , the changes offered a strong rebuttal to defense arguments that the men sought merely to provide charity and not help Hamas , and claims the case is built upon the word of biased American and Israeli sources .
Whether it leads to a different outcome obviously remains unknown .
An overview of the case follows :
The Adjustments
The first change in the prosecution case came in August , before jury selection even began .
Prosecutors dropped 29 charges each against defendants Mufid Abdulqader and Abdelrahman Odeh .
The men still face four conspiracy counts alleging their support for Hamas .
Combined with last year 's acquittals of former HLF chairman Mohammed El - Mezain on 31 counts means jurors have nearly 90 fewer charges to consider .
Jurors also should have an easier time getting their hands on exhibits during deliberations , thanks to a revised identification system .
Exhibits were batched numerically in the first trial .
For example , evidence seized from the home of Muslim Brotherhood activist Ismael Elbarasse started with the number 3 .
Tapes might start with a 15 , a 16 , or other numbers .
Jurors later complained that their discussions often stopped for extended periods while someone looked for an exhibit they thought would buttress their argument .
Now exhibits have descriptive names , usually reflecting their source .
Items seized from Holy Land offices are called " HLF Search " followed by a number .
Wiretaps are segregated by the person targeted for surveillance .
Prosecutors and FBI agents also made more summary exhibits explaining the family ties between some defendants and Hamas leaders , or showing which exhibits connect to the individual defendants .
An Israeli Security Agency ( Shin Bet ) lawyer testifying anonymously even made his own demonstrative exhibits showing pictures of Hamas members who were on the boards of the various zakat committees such as Tulkarem and Nablus .
In the original trial , defense attorneys cast both the Israeli lawyer , called " Avi , " and an Israeli military witness , called " Major Lior , " as both biased against Palestinians and as toadies for their government .
Israel is at war with the Palestinians , they said , and should n't be believed when its personnel connect HLF to Hamas .
However , this time , jurors see that the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) shared the Israeli assessment .
Three exhibits from PA security offices show that the Palestinian government considered HLF to be a Hamas funding source and that zakat committees receiving HLF donations were controlled by Hamas .
Israeli soldiers seized the documents during raids on PA offices in 2004 .
Prosecutors tried to get them entered into evidence in 2007 , but could not overcome hearsay objections by the defense .
Since then , the PA shut down the committees due to their Hamas ties , a move that may have convinced U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis – who was not the presiding judge in the first trial – to admit the documents into evidence .
Meanwhile , four new witnesses were called to reinforce previous arguments or to provide additional insights into the case .
These included two former senior U.S. government officials .
Steve Simon , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a deputy at the National Security Council ( NSC ) during the Clinton Administration , explained why the U.S. outlawed support for terrorist groups like Hamas .
American efforts to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians triggered " a lot of terrorist violence by Palestinian groups that were looking to bring the peace process to a halt if they could . "
Hamas was among the most significant contributors to the bloodshed , Simon testified .
Then , Robert McBrien , an associate director of the Treasury Department who oversaw the designation of terrorist organizations , explained the government process of targeting terrorist groups .
As Morning News reporter Jason Trahan emphasized , McBrien 's testimony was a direct response to what had been an effective defense argument in the first trial :
" He testified that not every Hamas front group is individually outlawed and does n't have to be for it to be illegal to send it money .
This counters the defense argument that the defendants broke no laws because the Palestinian charity groups , known as zakat committees , to which Holy Land gave more than $ 12 million from 1995 to 2001 , are not individually labeled as terrorist affiliates . "
Rebutting the defense may be the reason Bruce Hoffman was brought in by prosecutors , too .
Hoffman , a professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University 's School of Foreign Service and a former Scholar - in - Residence at the CIA , told jurors that virtually all successful terrorist movements won popular support by providing the kinds of social support Hamas offers .
The Hamas charter spells out the need to engage in charity .
Doing so , Hoffman said , helps a terrorist group " exercise control over the population . "
HLF supported everything from kindergartens to high schools and hospitals , providing what " Avi " termed support throughout the life cycle for Palestinians .
That methodical procedure of early engagement wins support and future recruits .
Avi also testified that Hamas puts a premium on providing direct financial support to widows and orphans of men jailed by Israel or killed while waging terrorist attacks .
Even when money is tight , Hamas takes care of what he called " special segments . "
The final new witness was a former HLF fundraiser , who testified that he collected money for the group knowing it would ultimately benefit Hamas .
Mohamed Shorbagi said he knew this through Hamas literature , a London - based Hamas website and word - of mouth .
In 2006 , Shorbagi pleaded guilty to providing material support to Hamas from 1997 - 2001 through his work with HLF .
HLF altered its behavior after U.S. law made support for Hamas illegal , Shorbagi said .
Where officials used to be fairly open about their support , the Hamas presence was toned down after the changes in law .
And the foundation set up an office in Gaza to distribute money to people tied to Hamas .
Shorbagi did not testify last year .
In his recent testimony , he said he remained a Hamas supporter and an advocate of Shariah law .
But he also said he supported a peaceful , two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict even though the Hamas charter states its unshaken opposition to any negotiated settlement .
Defense attorneys noted that Shorbagi received a much lighter sentence by agreeing to cooperate and that it could be further reduced by testifying .
The Nuts and Bolts
Other than the new PA evidence , the basic facts of the case remain unchanged .
A more detailed account can be seen here , from the 2007 trial .
All the charges involve the sending of support that , in some way , benefits Hamas .
In short , HLF fundraisers often featured Hamas leaders , who also spoke on fundraising conference calls .
Songs and skits performed at the fundraisers from the late 1980s and early 1990s lauded the terrorist group and depicted scenes of Hamas activists killing Israelis .
HLF is repeatedly shown to be a part of the Palestine Committee , created by the Muslim Brotherhood to help Hamas financially and politically .
When an associate started doing his own fundraising , Hamas political leader Mousa Abu Marzook dispatched two subordinates to Oxford , Miss. to tell Abelhaleem al - Ashqar to back off .
HLF was the Hamas fundraising arm in America .
Defendants Baker , El - Mezain and Ghassan Elashi also are listed as Palestine Committee members on a phone list seized from Ashqar .
The list also includes Nihad Awad and Omar Ahmad ( listed as Omar Yahya ) , the founders of the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) .
Wiretaps caught the defendants celebrating Hamas attacks .
Records indicate the group was tracking Hamas membership on zakat committees as far back as 1991 and the issue was revisited during the Philadelphia meeting .
Baker 's deception is emphasized by the government .
In April 2002 , Baker signed a sworn declaration as part of a civil suit in which he claimed to " abhor Hamas , " never mentioned the Palestine Committee and claimed the Philadelphia meeting had nothing to do with Hamas , but was " a meeting of Islamic intellectuals , academicians , community leaders and representatives of American Islamic organizations , such as ours .
It was not a meeting of any organization . "
Also emphasized was the ability to provide charity to Palestinians without routing money through Hamas - tied social committees .
Hoffman mentioned the Palestinian Red Crescent and the United Nations .
" Avi , " the anonymous Israeli security lawyer , said sending money directly to the family of a suicide bomber is better because it helps the family , and not the Hamas social infrastructure .
Jurors began deliberating Wednesday .
In the first trial , it took 19 days before the mistrial was declared .
Mama is n’t kidding when she says “ fresh ” peach cobbler …
This is one of my mother ’s recipes and she took all of these photographs .
I was n’t even there for a bite of it !
Mama has always had a way with peaches .
In the future , I hope to show you her peach freezer jam and the historical peach crisp we make .
She used to make this homemade sour dough bread and we ’d eat it hot out of the oven with slices completely smothered in fresh peach freezer jam .
Oh my lord , I miss living at home .
In the meantime , while I ’m preparing my tutorial on peanut butter balls and finishing up my writing on my grandmother ’s sweet potato pie , lets give you another of my mother ’s summer classics : Fresh Peach Cobbler .
You ’ll need : Lemon juice , self rising flour , sugar , cinnamon , milk , butter
( notice Mama uses the real stuff , unlike me ! ) , and fresh peeled peaches .
There is a note on how to substitute canned at the bottom .
Preheat oven to 350 .
Place your stick of butter in the dish you are going to bake the cobbler in and stick that in the oven while it preheats so your butter can melt .
Pour lemon juice over the peaches .
Stir to coat .
Pour sugar over peaches , stir .
Microwave for one minute .
This helps the sugar to dissolve faster .
Mix together flour , cinnamon , and one cup of sugar .
Pour in milk and stir until blended .
Remove dish from oven and pour batter over melted butter .
Pour peaches on top of batter .
DO NOT STIR .
DO NOT STIR .
I know you really want to …
KIDDING !
DO NOT STIR !
Bake at 350 for 55 minutes , or until golden on the top .
Sprinkle a tablespoon or so of sugar over top .
You can stir now –DO NOT STIR !
Bake at 350 for 55 minutes , or until golden on the top .
Oh dear lord , I can smell it .
My mother – who lives over half an hour away – made this cobbler and emailed me detailed photographs of every step .
If I did n’t have a food blog , that alone would be grounds for some sort of criminal charges .
Mamas are evil .

The Economist is one of my top five favorite magazines , I read it regularly .
I also live in the Philadelphia area and eat pizza quite often .
So I ’m excited about The Economist ’s new advertising plan : they connected with over 20 pizzerias in the Greater Philadelphia area , most of them near college campuses or dorms , and supplied them with Economist - branded pizza boxes .
Each box has a pie chart that connects pizza consumption with global economics and politics .
They encourage people to “ Get A World View ” .
This kind of ambient advertising is always interesting .
Publipizz , a maker of advertising pizza boxes , estimates that a box of pizza is looked at by 3 people for at least 8 minutes and results in an 80 % memory retention rate .
Plus , boxes with advertising on them are less expensive for pizzerias , which makes them more likely to join in .
I really love this idea .
Pizza eaters will get to learn what it took to get that pizza to their stomachs .
But the idea is more than just informing consumers about pizza production ; it ’s about getting youth interested in the news , economy , politics .
Plus it reinforces how big a part capitalism plays in all our lives .
Too often people , usually young people , forget how the free market brings people together , and they dismiss capitalism as a bad thing .
Hopefully a small thing like these pizza boxes will help students realize how markets bring us all together .
It reminds me of Milton Friedman ’s Pencil :
Italian scooter - maker Piaggio has unveiled a plug - in hybrid three - wheeler it says will get up to 141 mpg and could be on the road as early as next year .
The gas -electric version of Piaggio 's funky but fun MP3 scooter uses a parallel hybrid system much like that in the Toyota Prius but advances the technology by adding an electrical cord .
Although Toyota , General Motors and several other automakers are developing cars that can be charged from a wall socket , Piaggio 's timeline , if met , would make it the first in the world to mass - produce a plug - in hybrid .
The MP3 Hybrid that Piaggio rolled out at the big international motorcycle expo in Milan , Italy , combines a 125 - cc gasoline engine with an electric motor in an easy - to - ride three - wheeler that reportedly could do zero to 60 in around 5 seconds .
We 're still trying to get ahold of the folks at Piaggio , but the electric motor powers the MP3 Hybrid at low speeds and provides the gasoline engine with additional oomph when you open 'er up – boosting acceleration by as much as 85 percent , the company says .
The scooter can run in full electric or in one of three hybrid modes designed to maximize performance , maximize fuel economy or recharge the batteries quickly .
Piaggio says the MP3 hybrid goes 60 kilometers on a liter of gas , which works out to about 141 mpg .
Regenerative braking helps charge the batteries , and Piaggio says the MP3 Hybrid will charge in as little as three hours when plugged into a standard wall socket .
While Piaggio has n't said how much the MP3 Hybrid will cost or offered much in the way of specs , Wes Siler at Hell for Leather says the gas- electric combo should provide the MP3 Hybrid with the power of a 250 cc gas scooter , giving it zero to 60 acceleration in the 5 - second range .
Piaggio's been working on its HyS hybrid drivetrain for more than a year .
It uses a four - stroke gasoline engine that runs at a near constant speed so it can be tuned for excellent fuel economy and low emissions .
( Piaggio says the MP3 Hybrid emits 40 grams of carbon per kilometer ; for comparison , the Prius emits 104 . )
The motor also charges the battery , which is located under the seat .
A " fly by wire " system determines the optimal mix of gasoline and electric power depending upon rider demands .
Motorcycle Consumer News says the HyS hybrid system can go about 12.5 miles on full electric power .
As for those two front wheels , they lean up to 40 degrees in turns just like a motorcycle .
Piaggio , which introduced the MP3 two years ago , says the design improve traction , stability and braking to provide unparalleled ( for a scooter ) grip and excellent cornering capability .
Having flogged a 250 - cc MP3 in the Santa Cruz mountains , we can tell you it 's a hoot .
A plug - in version will only make it better .

Dr. Schofield D. Moody has worked over the years on Creationism , Creation Science , and Intelligent Design .
He is now President and Chief Researcher of the Center for Unintelligent Design .
He declined to be interviewed at Starbucks , so we met at a donut shop near his home .
DM : Why Unintelligent Design ?
SM : The roots of that go back a long way , for me personally , and in terms of the history of research in the field , as well .
For a long time , centuries in fact , simple creationism was the only game in town .
The only real alternatives were polytheistic , and those had been vanquished for centuries — until very recently .
Then Darwin came along and spoiled everything .
DM : Spoiled everything ?
SM : Well , not immediately , of course .
But evolution theory became a growing problem .
It explained so much , so reasonably .
For a while we could just ignore the progress it was making in scientific circles — our base had an anti-intellectual bent anyway .
It was enough to just go around from one church to another with a bunch of anecdotal stuff about hoaxes , and inaccuracies , and such .
DM : Your base ?
That sounds more political than scientific .
SM : Well , we live in a post - Kuhnian world .
Science is , after all , mostly a matter of positioning .
DM : Are you talking about Thomas Kuhn ?
SM : Yeah .
The guy who proved that science is just another religion .
DM : I 'm not sure that 's what he actually ...
SM : Anyway , the whole evolutionary enterprise eventually became a serious threat to Christians .
DM : All Christians ?
SM : Well , to those in our ...
DM : Base ?
SM : Exactly .
We had to take the fight to the schools — get them to stop teaching evolution .
So we came up with Creation Science .
We tried to position creationism as an alternative scientific theory .
But the courts rejected that .
They demanded that only science could be taught in a science classroom .
That really tied our hands .
DM : And that led to Intelligent Design .
SM : The idea was to construct a non-religious theory , which would , just incidentally , reinforce our theology .
DM : How 's that working for you ?
SM : It has it 's problems .
The basic approach was to find things in the natural world that scientists could n't explain .
Things like how could an eye evolve ?
It 's a complex set of different parts , that all have to work together in just the right way or it 's useless .
So how do these parts evolve ?
They have no survival value until they 're part of a fully developed eye .
DM : Except ...
SM : You 've heard about that one , then .
It turned out they could evolve , and it was possible to show how .
Bad example , but it shows you what we were up against .
It 's so hard anymore to find something that science can't probably explain .
One of our people is focused on the flagellum in a bacteria , for example , but he 's spent years on it , and all it takes is for some bright graduate student to come up with an explanation ...
DM : Kind of unfair , really ...
SM : I was sitting in on a lecture one day , listening to one of my colleagues , and I remember thinking that the problem was a lack of evidence .
I mean , the eye thing , and the flagellum thing , they look like evidence , but they 're really based on the idea that scientists can't explain something .
Well that leaves you pretty vulnerable .
DM : I can see how it would .
SM : I remember thinking that what we needed was real evidence — something even scientists would agree with , if possible .
And then , I noticed another problem — one I had n't seen before .
DM : With Intelligent Design
Theory ?
SM : This colleague was advancing the kind of basic idea that the whole theory spins off of .
You know — you come across a Model T , or a watch , and you assume that there 's a designer , that someone made it .
DM : Paley 's watch .
SM : Only I was sitting there , listening , and I realized that I did n't assume that just because the thing was so complex .
I assumed it because it obviously could n't reproduce itself , and obviously could n't maintain itself .
So there had to be someone to produce it and to maintain it .
But that does n't apply to a tree , or a frog .
DM : Another small hole in ID theory .
SM : You could drive a Buick through it .
If you think about it , all the stuff we 're sure was created by a designer — the automobile , the video recorder , the plumbing — all that stuff breaks down all the time , has no ability to heal itself , and can't reproduce .
It 's obviously inferior to trees and cats and moss and fish and everything that is n't obviously designed .
Design just does n't seem to be all that indicative of intelligence .
DM : And that was when the idea for UD hit you .
SM : Actually it was a camel .
DM : A camel ?
SM : The following summer I was leading a tour of the Holy Land .
One day I found myself standing there , in the heat and the dust , surrounded by all these strange sights and smells , staring at this camel .
And this thought just surfaced in my brain — completely out of the blue .
What kind of God would create a camel ?
And the answer came to me , unbidden , in a flash .
A stupid God .
DM : That seems a little ...
SM : Heretical ?
That was my first response as well , but God 's values are n't necessarily ours .
I resisted the idea at first , but it would n't go away , and I began to wonder if I was being led .
DM : Inspired ?
SM : I did some research .
Do you know that in the entire Bible there 's not one mention of God's IQ ?
DM : I 'm not really surprised by that .
SM : It was a revelation .
I combed the tradition , as well .
It 's just not heretical .
Shocking , maybe , but ...
DM : Is n't God supposed to be omniscient ?
SM : Well , there 's a distinction to be made between knowledge and intelligence .
Anyway , I now believe that the idea was inspired , because it has been so amazingly fruitful .
It solves virtually all of our problems , and gives us a whole new approach .
DM : A whole new approach ?
SM : The universe is crammed with evidence of Unintelligent Design .
It 's not just camels by a long shot .
There 's this fellow named Jerry Coyne , a professor — of ecology and evolution , no less — at the University of Chicago .
He 's published a paper that lists all kinds of things .
Kiwi birds have these tiny wings that do n't do a thing .
Cave animals have eyes that do n't work .
Humans have an appendix — which is actually injurious .
The list goes on and on .
DM : And you argue that this is evidence for ...
SM : For an Unintelligent Designer .
The beauty of it is that we not only have evidence , but evidence that the scientists agree with .
So it really is just a matter of two competing theories , based on the same evidence .
That should get us past the courts , and into the schools .
DM : Do you think scientists will accept this an an alternative theory ?
SM : We have high hopes .
It 's not just a matter of having real evidence , UD also provides a real research program .
There are all kinds of questions to investigate , fine tuning to be done , evidence to be collected and sifted .
DM : Such as ...
SM : To begin with we need a really good approximation of the universal constant .
DM : Is n't that something to do with relativity ?
SM : Same term , different field .
I 'm talking about the IQ of the Designer .
Right now , we think we 've managed to narrow it to the 80 - 93 range , but there are mavericks out there , looking into the literature on idiot savants , etc .
Who knows ?
They may have something .
DM : You said " all kinds of questions " ...
SM : Well , we also have a group looking into Forged Design .
It 's a very exciting subfield .
DM : Forged design ?
SM : It 's quite possible that some of what we see in nature is actually an attempt by some other designer to pass off poor copies .
Marsupials , for example .
DM : How are you going to sell this to ... to your ...
SM : Base ?
DM : Yes .
SM : Oh , it comes as a shock at first , but you'd be surprised how quickly that turns into relief .
Remember , they 're actually fairly anti-intellectual to begin with .
DM : So an Intelligent Designer ...
SM : Makes a rather off - putting God .
On the other hand , a stupid God ...
DM : It 's kind of like George Bush .
SM : Exactly .
She 's the kind of God you 'd like to have a beer with .
DM : Did you say she ?
SM : That 's the other appealing thing about UD theory .
It 's very feminist .
Most of us tend to think that God must be feminine .
DM : Most of you ?
SM : Well , some of the women in the field actually prefer to think of God as male .
It 's puzzling really .
DM : You just can't please them ...
SM : Chicks .
Go figure .
When Barack Obama takes the oath of office on January 20 , Americans wo n't just get a new president ; they might finally learn the full extent of George W. Bush 's warrantless domestic wiretapping .
Since
The New York Times first revealed in 2005 that the NSA was eavesdropping on citizens ' overseas phone calls and e-mail , few additional details about the massive " Terrorist Surveillance Program " have emerged .
That 's because the Bush administration has stonewalled , misled and denied documents to Congress , and subpoenaed the phone records of the investigative reporters .
Now privacy advocates are hopeful that President Obama will be more forthcoming with information .
But for the quickest and most honest account of Bush 's illegal policies , they say do n't look to the incoming president .
Watch instead for the hidden army of would - be whistle - blowers who 've been waiting for Inauguration Day to open the spigot on the truth .
" I 'd bet there are a lot of career employees in the intelligence agencies who 'll be glad to see Obama take the oath so they can finally speak out against all this illegal spying and get back to their real mission , " says Caroline Fredrickson , the ACLU 's Washington D.C. legislative director .
New Yorker investigative reporter Seymour Hersh already has a slew of sources waiting to spill the Bush administration 's darkest secrets , he said in an interview last month .
" You can not believe how many people have told me to call them on January 20 .
[ They say , ] ' You wanna know about abuses and violations ?
Call me then . ' "
So far , virtually everything we know about the NSA 's warrantless surveillance has come from whistle - blowers .
Telecom executives told USA Today that they had turned over billions of phone records to the government .
Former AT&T employee Mark Klein provided wiring diagrams detailing an internet - spying room in a San Francisco switching facility .
And one Justice Department attorney had his house raided and his children 's computers seized as part of the FBI 's probe into who leaked the warrantless spying to The New York Times .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales even suggested the reporters could be prosecuted under antiquated treason statutes .
If new whistle - blowers do emerge , Fredrickson hopes the additional information will spur Congress to form a new Church Committee – the 1970s bipartisan committee that investigated and condemned the government 's secret spying on peace activists , Martin Luther King , Jr. , and other political figures .
But even if the anticipated flood of leaks does n't materialize , advocates hope that Obama and the Democratic Congress will get around to airing out the White House closet anyway .
" Obama has pledged a lot more openness , " says Kurt Opsahl of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which was the first to file a federal lawsuit over the illegal eavesdropping .
One encouraging sign for civil liberties groups is that John Podesta , president of the Center for American Progress , is a key figure in Obama 's transition team , which will staff and set priorities for the new administration .
The center was a tough and influential critic of the Bush administration 's warrantless spying .
Among the unanswered questions :
__Were there quid pro quo promises made to the phone companies and internet carriers who cooperated with the secret spying ?
__For example , were co-conspirators promised lucrative government contracts ?
Did the program appropriate the CALEA wiretapping infrastructure ?
Under CALEA , Congress forced telecoms to build surveillance capabilities into the phone and internet network , but promised it would only be used with court orders .
Under CALEA , Congress forced telecoms to build surveillance capabilities into the phone and internet network , but promised it would only be used with court orders .
What did the first version of the surveillance program sweep into its net ?
In March 2004 , a squadron of top officials at the Justice Department , including then - Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI head Robert Mueller , threatened to resign over the illegality of the program .
The program was subsequently scaled back , but nobody knows what the NSA was doing that was bad enough to horrify Ashcroft .

The program was subsequently scaled back , but nobody knows what the NSA was doing that was bad enough to horrify Ashcroft .
__What was the legal rationale for the surveillance ?
__FISA explicitly made warrantless domestic eavesdropping illegal , but the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel issued a series of memos justifying the spying anyway .
The ACLU is fighting the Bush administration for access to the documents , as well as secret memos justifying torture .
" It 's difficult to see how Sen .
Obama could call his administration transparent if his administration continues to suppress non-sensitive information that should have been released a long time ago , " says the ACLU 's Jameel Jaffer .
The other looming question is whether , as president , Obama will continue the warrantless spying himself .
Obama voted with the majority in Congress to legalize the Bush spying program in July , but the constitutionality of the measure is yet untested .
An Obama administration is less likely than Bush to devise convoluted legal end -runs around the Constitution , according to Marc Rotenberg , the head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
" Keep in mind that Obama is a constitutional scholar and has a deep understanding of checks and balance , " says Rotenberg .
" It 's hard to imagine that an Obama administration would support ... warrantless wiretapping . "
With the financial markets and the economy in deep trouble , it 's unlikely that Obama will quickly turn to the issue of warrantless wiretapping .
But the EFF 's lawsuit against AT&T over the surveillance could force the new administration to pick a side quickly .
In December , a federal judge in San Francisco will hold a hearing on whether the retroactive immunity granted to AT&T and other telecoms as part of the FISA Amendments Act is Constitutional .
Obama voted for the act in order to legalize the spying program , but tried unsuccessfully to strip out the immunity provision .
EFF 's Opsahl hopes that if EFF prevails in December , an Obama administration might let the decision stand , clearing the way for EFF 's lawsuit to proceed .
" If we are victorious in our constitutional challenge , I would hope the Obama administration would accept that loss and move on without an appeal , " says Opsahl .
" But we will have to see . "
Soria Moria konferansesenter , 10 . september 2008 : Universitetet i Bergen har invitert til seminar om romforskning og media .
En paneldebatt skeier ut og begynner å omhandle Norges astronomi-nerd nummer én , Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard .
Han blir beskyldt for å stjele rampelyset fra andre forskere .
Han ødelegger for kolleger og stiller dem i skyggen , blir det sagt .
Han anklages for å ta seg til rette når pressen ringer .
Blant kritikerne er Pål Brekke ved Norsk romsenter .
–⁠ Knut Jørgen gjør ekstremt mye bra for formidlingen av feltet vårt , men når
det gjelder det faglige går han ofte et stykke for langt .
Forskere i Norge er ledende på for eksempel solforskning , kosmologi og asteroideforskning , og da blir det feil når Ødegaard ikke klarer å henvise media til de rette personene .
Det er ganske mange fagfolk som er litt forbanna over det her , sier Brekke .
Han retter samtidig en skarp pekefinger mot media .
–⁠ Det som hendte på seminaret er ganske betegnende .
Journalistene hadde 10 - 12 av Norges fremste romforskere til disposisjon , men flokker seg i stedet rundt Knut Jørgen og skal ha ham til å uttale seg om åpningen av partikkelakseleratoren på CERN - instituttet i Sveits .
Jeg vet ikke om media er klar over det , men Ødegaard er først og fremst en kommersiell formidler .
Det er lenge siden han hadde noen stipendiatstilling og har etter det jeg forstår ikke lenger noen rolle i det vitenskapelige miljøet på Astrofysisk institutt , sier Brekke .
Sløve medier
Samme kveld stiller Eirik Newth , astrofysiker , forfatter og Skal vi danse - deltaker , opp i Redaksjon 1 på NRK .
Temaet er nettopp det nevnte CERN - eksperimentet , noe Newth egentlig ikke har ekspertkompetanse på .
–⁠ Min rolle var å snakke om generelle aspekter rundt forholdet teknologi og samfunn , og jeg mener jeg gjorde en god jobb i den forbindelse .
Jeg satte også som krav at det måtte være en fysiker som hadde vært med på prosjektet til stede , sånn at jeg opptrådte mer som en bi-person , sier Newth .
Bjørn Hallvard Samset var eksperten ved Newths side .
Han mener popularisatorer som Newth og Ødegaard ikke utgjør noen trussel mot fagformidlingen .
– Ødegaard er en person som kan stå og hoppe av entusiasme , og det liker media .
Jeg tror bare vi må akseptere at det er sånn , og det aller viktigste mener jeg er at media får svar når de spør , sier Samset .
Newth mener imidlertid at media er for dårlige til å få tak i de virkelige ekspertene .
–⁠ Det hender ikke så rent sjeldent at media ringer meg om ting jeg ikke har peiling på .
Det irriterer meg at man ikke gidder å bruke to minutter ekstra på Google for å finne fram til de rette folkene .
Det er dårlig håndverk , sier Newth .
Samtidig mener han dette setter visse krav til de som faktisk blir spurt .
–⁠ Omtrent samtidig som jeg var på Redaksjon 1 , kjører TV2 - nyhetene et innslag om CERN der Ødegaard er hovedkilde .
Det er dumt , og jeg stusset over at han opptrer alene der .
–⁠ Hvorfor det ?
–⁠ Det går litt over stokk og stein noen ganger når Ødegaard skal uttale seg , og jeg synes man bør sørge for å ha med seg eksperter , sier Newth .
Ønsker blest om faget
Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard har lite til overs for kritikken mot ham , og mener det ligger et element av misunnelse i klagingen over at han er for mye i media .
–⁠ Min feil er alts å at jeg tar telefonen når media ringer .
Jeg kan ikke skjønne at det skal være kritikkverdig , og det blir å snu ting fullstendig på hodet at jeg skal utgjøre et problem for fagene våre fordi jeg er mye i media , sier Ødegaard .
Selv har han har ingen formening om media burde være flinkere til å ringe andre enn ham .
–⁠ Det må pressen selv vurdere .
Min agenda er å få mest mulig blest rundt realfagene og astronomi spesielt , og da stiller jeg opp på mest mulig av det jeg blir spurt om , sier Ødegaard .
–⁠ Har du uttalt deg om temaer som du kanskje burde ha sendt videre til eksperter ?
–⁠ Hvis jeg føler at jeg nærmer meg grensen for hva jeg kan , henviser jeg til andre .
Det skjer ganske ofte , og jeg har sørget for å få andre fagfolk i media mange ganger .
Men jeg synes ikke man kan forvente at jeg skal bruke min fritid på å sende ut pressemeldinger for andre , sier Ødegaard , som mener at kritikerne er ganske få .
–⁠ De aller fleste er veldig positive til jobben vi har gjort .
Jeg sier vi , for det har vært et team som har jobbet for disse offensivene mot media i form av store arrangementer og pressemeldinger , og jeg tror de fleste ser hvordan vi har klart å løfte fokuset på astronomi i media , sier Ødegaard .
Brekke mener på sin side at det er en myte at Ødegaard sørger for at forskningen oftere havner i media enn før .
–⁠ Jeg jobbet som forskningsformidler på Astrofysisk institutt på 90 - tallet , og i løpet av en femårsperiode hadde vi mer enn 100 nyhetsoppslag bare om solforskning i Aftenposten , i tillegg til en lang rekke TV - og radioinnslag .
Det viser at vi også den gangen klarte å fenge mediene , sier Brekke .
–⁠ Må forstå premisset
Anders Lyche jobber i TV2 - nyhetene og var en av journalistene som « flokket seg rundt » Ødegaard på Soria Moria .
Han er helt uforstående til kritikken fra Newth og Brekke .
– Ødegaard blir brukt fordi han udiskultabelt er en glimrende formidler av romforskning , og han vet mer enn nok om disse tingene til å være en adekvat kilde i sammenheng med CERN - eksperimentet .
Dessuten intervjuet jeg jo også en forsker ( Samset , journ . anm . ) som jobber med prosjektet , sier Lyche , som ikke deler oppfatningen av at media er for slappe i kildebruken :
–⁠ Akademia må akseptere at nyheter handler om å formidle en liten del av et felt til veldig mange mennesker .
I den forbindelse har Ødegaard mer enn nok troverdighet , sier Lyche .
Samset tror mye av kritikken bunner i et ønske om anerkjennelse for den jobben man gjør .
–⁠ I media derimot , får man umiddelbar respons fra det brede lag .
Det er klart mange ønsker seg den posisjonen , særlig når du føler at du har mer oversikt over et fagfelt og kunne gjort en bedre jobb enn den personen som blir spurt , sier Samset .
Eirik Newth mener problemet delvis skyldes en manglende mediestrategi fra universitetets side .
–⁠ Jeg ser stadig formidlingstalenter som sliter i dagens system .
Det er mange veldig flinke og villige formidlere , men uten et skikkelig støtteapparat med rådgivning står de fullstendig på egen hånd overfor media , sier Newth .
Også Ødegaard mener det er vanskelig for formidlere å oppnå status i forskningsmiljøene .
–⁠ De som formidler mye , blir aldri helter internt .
The fact that Paul Westerberg released his new album 49:00 … of Your Time / Life as a 49 - cent digital download is n’t particularly groundbreaking , but it was a great way to get the music press to care about a new Paul Westerberg album in the first place .
And it worked for the music - buying public , as well ; since its debut on July 19 , 49:00 has continuously been Amazon ’s number - one mp3 album download , above Coldplay and the Mamma Mia ! soundtrack — a pretty unprecedented achievement for a nearly 50 - year - old musician with no label whose last album peaked at # 178 on the Billboard album charts .
Westerberg ’s hardly an unknown , however , particularly to fans of his legendary 80s band The Replacements .
Over the course of a decade , the ‘ Mats moved from a drunken thrash - punk Minneapolis quartet to a ( slightly ) less drunken polished studio pop band , eventually bowing out with the Westerberg solo - album - in - disguise All Shook Down in 1991 .
He then put out a couple pleasant and professional - sounding major label albums before heading relatively underground , recording for smaller labels like Vagrant Records and putting albums together in his basement studio .
A few records came out earlier this decade under his Grandpaboy moniker , as well as a movie celebrating his new DIY aesthetic , Come Feel Me Tremble .
Since 2005 , greatest hits albums have come out for both The Replacements and Westerberg ’s solo career ( the latter bore the immortal title Besterberg ) , and the old band ’s full catalog has been reissued by Rhino , so it ’s not as if Westerberg ’s coming out of hiding with 49:00 .
But in hitching his wagon to the digital trend , he ’s suddenly become relevant as more than just an icon .
It helps that 49:00 is an incredible record in addition to a personal business change - up for Westerberg .
Despite its title , the album only last 44 minutes , but it ’s a dense listen even at that length .
Westerberg achieved his 49 - cent pricing goal by formatting the album as one long mp3 ; even if you wanted to break the thing up into individual tracks ( a Westerberg fan site has given it a go in their July 26 News entry ) , many of the songs last less than a minute and they all overlap as if you were listening on the radio .
At one point , there are two different songs playing in the left and right speakers .
Musically , 49:00 is of a piece with Westerberg ’s trademark brand of endearingly sloppy folk - rock , only now he plays all the instruments himself ; it ’s melodic , impassioned , and comfortable , enough so that he includes a minute - long classic rock medley of songs by the Stones , Beatles , Elton John , Steppenwolf , The Kinks , and more .
So 49:00 has a couple new tricks for Westerberg , but nothing that has n’t been done before .
The lo-fi-jukebox album sequencing recalls Guided by Voices or Olivia Tremor Control in their mid-90s heydays , and the one - man - band idea looks back to similarly iconoclastic solo masterpieces like Todd Rundgren ’s Something / Anything ?
or Paul McCartney ’s whimsical experiments like Ram .
( A less immediate influence in this regard is Stevie Wonder , although “ Music of My Mind ” could easily stand in for 49:00 ’s title ; manager Darren Hill told Billboard , “ You 're getting a glimpse inside of Paul 's head here . ” )
But of course , the most media - worthy information about 49:00 concerns its digital release , a neat little innovation for the supposedly computer - less Westerberg , but a pretty familiar format for nearly any other working musician alive .
The gee - shucks tone with which 49:00 arrives seems a little quaint these days ; in the same Billboard interview , Hill said , “ It 's just wonderful that you can actually do this .
The freedom an artist can enjoy these days is fantastic .
Can you imagine me pitching this idea to a label ? ”
No , and that ’s why many independent musicians do n’t bother .
Westerberg ’s 49 - cent download idea is notable because he figured out a way to make a little money from the Internet ’s media free - for - all — who would n’t pay half a dollar to a living legend , if only out of curiosity ? — but this platform is n’t exactly news for young entertainers .
One of the year ’s other best releases so far , Walé ’s The Mixtape About Nothing , has been available for free download since May , and it offers an equally insightful view into an artist ’s head and an even greater assessment of artistic possibility in the digital age .
Like Westerberg , Walé offers a nice bit of journalist bait with The Mixtape About Nothing ’s encompassing theme : the 72 - minute album recontextualizes audio samples , graphics , and even the theme music from Seinfeld .
A conversation between George and Jerry about growing up and treating women correctly appears in the middle of a song about same ( “ The Grown Up ” ) .
A clip from Michael Richards ’ notorious “ nigger ” outburst last year frames a song ( “ The Kramer ” ) about the use of that word in popular culture .
There ’s even a cameo appearance by Julia Louis - Dreyfus .
Hip - hop originated with this kind of cultural appropriation , but it takes an artist as talented , funny , and self - aware as Walé to make an actual cultural point with it ; by showing an obvious reverence for Seinfeld and placing dialogue snippets inside his go - go and soul music landscape , he finds the common ground between mainstream NBC entertainment and the far - reaching tastes of a young , globally aware ( Walé ’s parents are Nigerian immigrants ) , and culturally literate young black artist .
Seinfeld is merely the unifying element of an album that contains lyrical and musical references to Sly & the Family Stone , J Dilla , the Baltimore club scene , YouTube , and the death of the record industry — in other words , as many cultural references as a typical contemporary hip - hop album , and Walé sends up these conventions with titles like “ The Skit , ” “ The Bmore Club Slam , ” and “ The Cliché Lil Wayne Feature ( It ’s the Remix Baby ! ” ) .
Like 49:00 , the music on The Mixtape About Nothing switches styles constantly and without any notice ( “ I hate rap like Kramer hates blacks , ” he says at one point ) , but this is typical for hip - hop in a way that it is n’t for Westerberg ’s more musically consistent folk and rock genres .
Westerberg ’s pacing and mixing is defiantly contemporary by his own standards , as is his release model .
But the different commercial approaches to 49:00 and The Mixtape About Nothing also epitomize the different opportunities that the Internet provides for both established and rising artists .
For an existing talent like Paul Westerberg ( or Radiohead , or Nine Inch Nails ) , the Internet provides a sudden opportunity to make music without corporate influence ; it ’s a way to connect with fans more immediately after a time of presumably greater commercial pressure .
For a relatively unknown talent like Walé — and we have to go back a few years for this example , as The Mixtape About Nothing is his fourth free release overall — the Internet provides a springboard with which to get your name out .
Daniel Weisman of Elitaste , who handles Walé ’s music , told me that there have been “ definitely over 50,000 ” total downloads of The Mixtape About Nothing since May , and while none of them have gotten Walé any money , his profile has been considerably raised by this and the previous free downloads he offered .
“ Jerry Seinfeld 's assistant actually reached out to me asking for a copy [ because ]
Jerry had heard about it and wanted to hear it , ” Weisman also said ; additionally , Walé has appeared on The Roots ’ most recent album and is currently touring with the Rock the Bells festival alongside legends like A Tribe Called Quest , Raekwon and Ghostface , Nas , Afrika Bambaataa , De La Soul , MF Doom , and others .
Together , Walé and Westerberg have created some of 2008 ’s most urgent and creative pop music , and they also happen to represent the extent and scope of the record industry shift that ’s occurring .
As the CD format lurches closer to obsolescence , digital releases have become more inevitable as an industry norm , often supplemented by vinyl - only physical releases .
But cultural and economical sea changes like this do n’t happen overnight .
Instead , the change in formats is happening gradually , and Westerberg represents an established musician ’s best response while Walé represents an aspiring one ’s greatest hope .
By the time Walé is Westerberg ’s age ( another 25 years ) , it wo n’t be novel anymore for a musician that old to release a new album digitally ; that novelty will likely expire with Westerberg ’s generation of musicians , perhaps along with the record industry as we know it .
Nov. 21 , 2008 --
Another day , another 400 - point market sell - off or dismal jobs report or tax - payer - funded corporate bailout .
It goes without saying that we are living in uncertain times , and how you react to this uncertainty may say a lot about your mental health .
In a newly published study , uncertainty was found to be far more stressful for highly neurotic people than dealing with a clearly negative outcome .
The opposite was true for people with low scores for neuroticism .
These people exhibited more stress when faced with negative feedback than uncertainty .
" Objectively speaking , uncertainty is better than clearly negative information , but this is not true for people who are highly neurotic , " University of Toronto doctoral candidate and study researcher Jacob Hirsh tells WebMD .
" These people do not deal with uncertainty very well . "
Uncertainty and the Brain
The study , published in the journal Psychological Science , showed what is going on in the brain when we experience uncertainty .
Hirsh and colleague Michael Inzlicht , PhD , conducted personality testing on 41 undergraduate students using a standardized test measuring five major personality traits , including neuroticism .
They then used electroencephalography ( EEG ) to monitor brain activity .
While the EEG was being conducted , the students were asked to perform a fairly simple task on a computer .
The participants were then shown signs indicating positive feedback ( a plus sign ) , negative feedback ( a minus sign ) , or uncertain feedback ( a question mark ) .
All the students exhibited higher neural responses when they got negative feedback than when the feedback was positive .
But neural activity was highest following uncertain feedback in the students with the highest scores for neuroticism .
For students in the middle of the neuroticism spectrum , negative feedback and uncertain feedback elicited similar neural activity .
" The idiom ' the devil you know is better than the devil you do n't know ' perfectly characterizes the attitudes of highly neurotic people , " Hirsh says .

A convicted pedophile who turned up in MySpace 's 2007 purge of sex offenders faces new charges of bank fraud for allegedly running counterfeit checks through a bank account he established for his online church , TruthOfGodMinistries.org .
Carl Courtright III , 37 , came to law enforcement 's attention when MySpace began automatically matching its members against a database of convicted sex offenders .
MySpace launched its crackdown in May of last year , following a similar search by Wired.com that found more than 700 registered sex offenders using its service .
MySpace 's more sophisticated effort turned up some 29,000 offenders within two months .
Eager to learn what those ex-offenders were up to , if anything , the attorneys general of several states subpoenaed MySpace for IP addresses and other data on the deleted accounts .
But aside from a handful of parole violations – mostly offenders who were n't supposed to be using the internet – there 's been only one new criminal charge announced in connection with the data .
That 's Courtright , who'd been convicted in 1998 of sexually abusing a 16 - year - old .
Investigators with the Illinois Attorney General 's Office matched Courtright 's IP address with a list of addresses that had been spotted trading kid porn over file sharing services .
When they searched and seized his computer , they found numerous child pornography files , and evidence – they say – that he was producing some of it himself .
The feds stepped in and charged Courtright with production , possession and receipt of child pornography .
Now he 's been hit with a new indictment ( . pdf ) that adds bank fraud to the list .
Calling himself " Pastor Carl A. Courtright , " the defendant allegedly opened a bank account for his online church , TruthOfGodMinistries.org .
" We reach out to those in need following the example of our Risen Saviour [ sic ] Jesus Christ visiting those who are sick in Hospitals , Lost in Prisons , Homeless on the streets , even those lost living ' normal ' lives at home , and praying with and for those who are just in need of the touch of Gods Loving Grace and Mercy that He give FREELY to all who ask , " reads the website .
" In addition to soliciting prayer requests on the website , Courtright solicited financial contributions to the ' Truth of God Ministries ' which could be made at any Regions Bank , " the indictment notes .
It 's not clear whether Courtright got any donations from his ersatz missionary work , but the indictment , filed in September in federal court in St. Louis , charges that he used the same computers on which he made child porn to produce $ 3,100 in counterfeit donation checks payable to his church .
In February of last year , he allegedly deposited the checks and cashed them out through ATM and Visa Checkcard transactions before they were rejected .
When Regions Bank asked him about the apparent fraud , he wrote a letter as Pastor Carl assuring the bank that he'd cooperate in the investigation , and was looking forward to a continued business relationship .
" Last year alone , our operating budget was $ 987,436.00 , " he boasted .
Courtright 's trial had been scheduled to start this Monday , but last week a federal judge ordered a continuance to give Courtright 's lawyer time to process the new charge .
If convicted of producing child pornography , he faces a life sentence .
Big bucks were also allegedly on the mind of Eric Andrew Hamberg , a former computer technician with the South Carolina Employment Security Commission .
When Hamberg left his job in October , 2005 , after five years of service , he hacked back into the state agency 's computers and stole its massive database of South Carolina citizens , according to an indictment ( . pdf ) handed down last week in federal court in Columbia .
The stolen data included names , addresses , and driver 's license and Social Security numbers on every single man and woman with a job in the Palmetto State , according to court records .
Prosecutors say Hamberg planned on selling the information .
Called
" full infos " in the parlance of the underground , identity thieves pay a pretty penny for such stolen data .
It 's not clear from the indictment whether the data was ever sold or exploited .
Clark Newsom , a spokesman for the agency , declined to comment on the case , claiming the investigation is still ongoing over two years after the fact .
He also refused to say whether the state had warned any of the victims that their personal information had been stolen .
Threat Level could not turn up any public disclosure of the breach .
Hamberg is charged with computer intrusion , identity theft , making false statements to the FBI denying the hack attack , and being a felon in possession of firearms , specifically a Marin model 60 , 22 .
caliber rifle ; a J.C. Penny 20 gauge shotgun ; an AK - 47 assault rifle ; a
Ruger .22 caliber rifle ; and a 9 mm handgun .
Update :
There 's no evidence that the stolen database got any further than Hamberg before the FBI moved in on him , says Hamberg 's prosecutor , assistant U.S. attorney Dean Eichelberger .
" To our knowledge , there has not been any widespread compromise of information . "

( CNN ) --
A small tribe of Indians in Paraguay who have had virtually no contact with the outside world won a legal battle this week when rights groups stopped a Brazilian company from continuing to bulldoze the forest to clear land for cattle ranches .
About 2,000 members of the Ayoreo ethnic group live in 13 settlements in Bolivia and Paraguay .
The Totobiegosode tribe , said to number no more than 300 , is the last group of uncontacted Indians in South America outside the Amazon River basin , indigenous rights groups say .
The Totobiegosode , who are part of the larger Ayoreo ethnic group , are nomadic Indians who hunt and fish , as well as gather fruit and honey and cultivate small temporary plots during the rainy season .
They live communally , four to six families to a dwelling , in the dense forests of northwestern Paraguay .
Two Brazilian companies have been rapidly clearing land the Totobiegosode live on , and the tribe has lost nearly 15,000 acres ( about 6,000 hectares ) this year , according to British - based Survival International , an advocacy organization for the rights of tribal people .
A ruling Thursday by Paraguay 's secretary of the environment canceled a special permit for one of the companies , Yaguarete Pora S.A. , to clear the land .
The legal battle is being waged by local groups such as GAT , an acronym in Spanish for People , Environment and Territory .
The activist groups have undertaken the fight without the knowledge of the Totobiegosode .
Indian rights proponents see Thursday 's ruling as an important victory .
" This sends a very significant signal , " said Jonathan Mazower , campaign coordinator for Survival International .
" Until now , the ranchers and the landowners have really had it all their own way .
They are very politically powerful and well - funded .
...
This may be a sign that the government is starting to get a grip on the situation . "
As their territory has been gobbled up , some Totobiegosode have been spotted by other Indians retreating deeper into the vanishing jungle : a group of eight or nine men on one occasion , a smaller group several days earlier , Survival International reported in a release Friday .
The problems for the larger Ayoreo ethnic group , who share a common language and culture and can be found in Bolivia and Paraguay , started about 50 years ago .
Between 1959 and 1987 , most Ayoreos were forced off their ancestral land , according to the World Rainforest Movement , which describes itself as international network of citizens ' groups involved in efforts to defend the world 's rainforests .
About 2,000 Ayoreos live in 13 settlements : 10 in Bolivia and three in Paraguay , the rainforest group says .
Only the Totobiegosode tribe still lives in the forest , without contact with other Ayoreos or foreigners , in an area known as Amotocodie .
Although no one has any direct contact with the Totobiegosode still in the jungle , their presence can be seen by such signs as footprints and holes in trees that indicate they have been gathering honey , the rainforest group says .
There also have been occasional sightings in the distance .
Mazower said he interviewed a small group of Totobiegosode who made contact with the outside world in 2004 and who described what their life is like .
" We were always running , " Mazower said one Indian told him .
" We would suddenly hear these bulldozers .
We thought that it was a kind of monster that could smell us .
We could see fire .
We were very afraid , and we ran . "
The bulldozers , Mazower said , are much larger than the commercial bulldozers seen at construction sites .
Often , crews will string a chain between two bulldozers , which will move in tandem to cut down an increased number of trees .
As a result , many groups of Totobiegosode are fragmented into isolated patches as they scatter , divided by areas with no forest and increasingly busy roads .
Families can be separated , and their lives become increasingly difficult , Mazower said .
By Survival International 's reckoning , the forest where the Totobiegosode live is being destroyed at a faster rate than the Amazon jungle as a whole .
Despite Thursday 's ruling , some observers say the future of tribes still living in the jungle in Paraguay and elsewhere , particularly Brazil , does not bode well .
" It 's almost impossible in some sense to protect these tribes , " said Peter Hakim , president of the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington - based policy center .
The reason , he said , is the same as it has been since the Western world started being colonized more than 500 years ago : " There 's a lot of money to be made . "

It might seem an odd time to be leaving the Labour party ; after a decade of courting the City , Gordon Brown is nationalising banks , and promising to get tough with global capitalism ( not to mention Iceland ) .
Our first chance in a decade to alter the ideological landscape of British politics .
If I tolerated Iraq , cash for honours , and Alan Milburn , then why quit now ?
The thing is , while the fundamentals of the world economy transform around us , the fundamentals of the Labour party remain unchanged .
I 'm leaving the Labour party because its internal culture has decayed to such an extent that – to borrow a term adored by New Labour – it no longer has the social capital necessary to function in its core marketplace .
There is a revolt going on in Labour 's backyard , demonstrated in recent byelections , and it does n't even realise it .
The party 's inner life is , at best , introverted , and at worst , boring .
Beyond the perks of being in power , membership of the Labour party today has very little value .
The simple truth is that the Labour party is rotting .
Some members have stayed purely out of habit .
They are n't really that interested in politics , at least not any more , but they have no place else to go .
Most , however , are interested primarily in their career prospects .
Everybody seems to have a position , some rung on the ladder .
And they talk to each other like workers talk to managers and like managers talk to executives in any large organisation .
Yet given that so few will end up in positions of genuine influence , I could n't logically explain why anyone joins the party any more .
Neither camp can be entrusted with the vital task of providing links between the Labour party and its traditional supporters , or society in general .
They do n't even have the inclination .
Working out what society wants is what focus groups are for .
It goes almost without saying that most members of the Labour party today would n't know what to say to the poor even if they knew how to find them .
By accident or design , Labour has virtually ceased to function outside the formal processes of representative democracy .
Local parties work tirelessly on local election campaigns .
They work , a little less tirelessly perhaps , on general election campaigns .
But they no longer have the capacity to make their presence felt in the day - to - day life of Labour 's heartlands .
I am not talking about the party 's policy - making procedures .
After 18 years in opposition a little discipline was necessary .
But Labour members are now self - disciplining .
Despite what the media thinks , most members are too busy arranging the deckchairs to care whether it 's Gordon Brown or David Miliband or Jon Cruddas at the helm .
I remember bumping into fellow members around the time of the leadership election , and asking who they were supporting for deputy .
I was surprised by almost all of their answers – only then did I realise that despite , in some cases , many years of friendship , I had little idea of what my comrades thought about politics .
People seldom express opinions in the Labour party .
We can't be bothered to argue with each other any more .
Nationalising the banks , anyone ?
We are in the middle of the most momentous , and fascinating , transformations in the history of capitalism .
The boundaries between state and market are being redefined as we speak .
But the problem is that the Labour party is n't speaking .
Some party members still like to think of themselves as leftwing , but they 've spent so long defining themselves against the rest of the left they do n't know what they actually believe .
Do we like this banks thing or not ?
What do we say to our friends and colleagues outside the party about it ?
The crucial and largely informal mechanisms by which a party deliberates with its constituencies have entirely dried up for Labour .
I 'm not simply deserting a sinking ship .
As implausible as it seemed a month ago , Gordon Brown might even win the next election .
But with a party in decay the government 's long - term development is rudderless .
So nationalise , baby , nationalise : the damage is already done .

There is compelling new proof of a silver ( and gold ) price manipulation .
The evidence connects the investment bank JP Morgan Chase , the dominant force in world commodity trading , the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , the primary commodity regulator , and the U.S. Treasury Department , the arranger of every conceivable bailout .
This week , I received a copy of a letter , dated October 8 , sent from the CFTC to a California Congressman , Gary G. Miller .
It discussed allegations of a silver market manipulation because of the data in the monthly Bank Participation Report .
The data in that report for August showed that one or two U.S. banks held a massive short position in COMEX silver futures of 33,805 contracts , or more than 169 million ounces .
This is equal to 25 % of annual world mine production , and was up more than five - fold from the prior month�s report .
After this position was established , silver prices fell more than 50 % , in spite of a widespread shortage in retail forms of investment silver .
Never before had there been a such a large concentrated position in any market , including every manipulation case in the CFTC�s history .
Concentration and manipulation go hand in hand .
You can�t have one without the other .
The letter was sent to me by a reader who had the foresight to write to his Congressman .
Of course , the CFTC denied that a silver manipulation existed , as they always have .
This proves that the Commission responds much quicker to a member of Congress than it does to hundreds of ordinary citizens and investors .
In the future , should you decide to write to the CFTC , be sure to do so through your elected representatives .
What was remarkable ( and disturbing ) about the letter was that it strongly confirms an analysis I presented in an article dated September 2 , titled , " Fact Versus Speculation " http://www.investmentrarities.com/09-02-08.html.
In that article , I speculated that the shocking increase in the silver short position by one or two U.S. banks was related to the takeover of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan in March .
Here�s a quote from my article , dated September 2 .
" I am going to speculate based upon the known facts .
Maybe I will be proven correct , maybe not .
However , the nature of this speculation is so disturbing , that I hope I am wrong .
But I need to state it because if I am close to the mark , the implications for the silver market are profound .
I think the data in the COT and the Bank Participation Reports indicate that the U.S. Government may have bailed out the biggest COMEX silver short by arranging for a U.S. bank to take over their position .
This coincides with JP Morgan�s takeover of Bear Stearns .
In fact , it would not surprise me if the bailout was JP Morgan taking over Bear Stearns � short silver position , at the government�s request .
While this silver bailout ( if it happened ) was no doubt undertaken with financial system stability in mind , it has disturbing implications of legality and equity "
This is the relevant quote from the CFTC�s Oct 8 letter .
" In effect the increase [ in the short position ] reflected a one time acquisition of positions that were acquired through a merger in the industry , and not new trading by a bank .
Thus , the assertion that there was new activity undertaken by the banks that led to a fall in silver prices is not correct since the " new " activity reflected in the CFTC�s report was in essence positions that had already existed in the market prior to July 1st . "
The CFTC clearly confirms , in effect , that the big silver short position was related to JP Morgan�s takeover of Bear Stearns , since no other merger provides a plausible explanation .
However , the Commission is not speaking truthfully about an increase in the concentrated short position .
The CFTC�s own data , in weekly Commitment of Traders Reports ( COT ) , show a sizable increase in concentrated short positions of some 12,000 contracts ( 60 million ounces ) from levels before July 1st to the August Bank Participation Report .
More importantly , the real issue is not about when the one or two U.S. banks increased their short position , but how large that short position grew in the August Bank Participation Report .
The CFTC is deceiving a U.S. Congressman by attempting to reduce the argument to when the short position was increased , not the obscene and manipulative size of the position .
This is deception through omission and misrepresentation .
What difference does it make when the manipulative position was established ?
The issue is how can a short position of 25 % of the world production of any commodity , held by one or two U.S. banks , not be manipulative ?
Bear Stearns held the largest concentrated short position in COMEX silver ( and gold ) futures at the time of its forced merger with JP Morgan in March .
That position was not discovered until the publishing of the August Bank Participation Report followed by the October 8 letter from the CFTC to Congressman Miller .
Furthermore , Bear Stearns had no legitimate backing to the short silver position , either in actual metal or cash .
Otherwise it could have been delivered against or bought back , just as would have happened were it a long position .
The price of silver at the time of Bear Stearns implosion was $ 20 to $ 21 an ounce .
A free market covering of a concentrated short position of this size would have driven silver prices to the $ 50 or $ 100 level and would have exposed the long - term manipulation .
Rather than let the free market deal with the required short covering of such an uneconomic and unbacked short position , government authorities arranged to have the short position transferred to JP Morgan .
This was undertaken by the U.S. Treasury Department , along with taxpayer guarantees against loss to Morgan worth billions of dollars .
This was done , no doubt , to save the financial system from imploding .
This was also patently illegal , as it aided and abetted the silver manipulation .
I�m sure the motive behind the illegal transfer of the silver short position was the mistaken assumption by Treasury that an explosion in the price of silver ( and gold ) would threaten overall financial stability .
Well guess what - they succeeded in crushing the price of gold and silver , but to no avail , as financial stability has been shattered .
JP Morgan was not just an accommodative good corporate citizen in the illegal transfer of the manipulative silver ( and gold ) COMEX short position .
In addition to undisclosed government guarantees against loss , JP Morgan was given free reign to liquidate the COMEX short position at their discretion , knowing full - well the regulators would look the other way , no matter what dirty tricks were necessary to cause the price to collapse .
Nor was JP Morgan a neutral agent in the silver price collapse .
Data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) http://www.occ.gov/deriv/deriv.htm indicates that JP Morgan held a much larger Over The Counter ( OTC ) derivatives position in silver and gold than was transferred to them from Bear Stearns .
My analysis shows that Morgan has made many billions of dollars , perhaps tens of billions , from their downward engineering of silver and gold prices from their combined COMEX and OTC short positions .
They have used that engineered price decline to buy back as many short positions as possible .
If investors are wondering what caused the destruction of billions of dollars in gold and silver values , metal and share price alike , look no further than JP Morgan , and the government officials who enabled them .
There can be no question that the CFTC is complicit in all these illegal activities .
Same with the CME Group , owner of the NYMEX / COMEX .
It is not possible that they are not privy and an active party to this successful downward manipulation .
To think that officials at the CFTC , from the top of the agency , to staffers and even the Inspector General , have taken oaths of office to uphold commodity law and then have allowed that law to be repeatedly violated is beyond repugnant .
That they have knowingly participated in an organized cover -up of this manipulation and have taken to lying to a Congressman calls for criminal prosecution .
As bad as this is , it gets worse .
The downward manipulation of the price of silver , initiated by the U.S. Treasury , undertaken by JP Morgan Chase and sanctioned and aided by the CFTC and the CME Group has proven so successful in destroying investment values that the low price of silver is now threatening to destroy tens of thousands of jobs of those who mine silver for a living , here in the US and throughout the world .
Who do these people think they are that they can allow the artificial paper price to alter real supply / demand fundamentals ?
Those in charge of enforcing the law have enriched a few sleazy bankers who trade toxic paper derivatives at the expense of tens of thousands of innocent investors and now ordinary workers .
This should make your blood boil .
While investors in silver will soon see a strong snap - back in silver prices , it is too late for those workers who have already lost their jobs due to the artificially depressed price of silver .
At risk remain those jobs that will be lost if silver doesn�t rebound quickly .
Silver mining is tough and dangerous for rank and file workers , much tougher than pushing paper derivatives .
The fact that those who regulate our markets don�t see that distinction needs to be rectified .
One thing that I have never understood is why silver mine management has not taken a more active roll in pressing the regulators to more fully address the increasing evidence of a silver price manipulation .
I suppose it has to do with fears of offending those Wall Street firms which may provide future financing and the false pride that goes with having denied in the past that a manipulation could exist .
But surely those managers have now seen what a depressed price of silver has done to their stock prices and the fate of their companies .
To still do and say nothing leaves their companies in grave danger .
I think it is time for the employees themselves , and the unions that represent them , to take some initiative to help themselves .
Losing jobs due to crooked behavior by big banks and their regulators should be a lightening - rod issue for employees , unions and Congressional leadership in the districts affected .
I�m certain that legal action against the parties responsible for the price manipulation would result in substantial financial damages awarded to rank and file workers hurt by the manipulation .
To that end , I offer , as much as is reasonably possible time - wise and free of charge , any consultative advice to any union or Congressional representative interested in bringing action against those responsible for the manipulation .
For investors , conditions never looked better for the long - term merits of silver , precisely because of the recent crooked take down of the price .
You should do two things .
Buy as much silver as you can and write your elected officials to end the silver manipulation scam .

In the waning days of the second Bush / Cheney presidency , I can barely contain the seething anger that rises in me .
This is not a liberal rant ; this is not a left - wing diatribe nor is it a politically motivated article .
This statement is what I want on the record before political amnesia settles in .
To President Bush and Vice President Cheney ,
In the name of all French Expatriates across America , temporary migrants or permanent residents , in the name of Americans of French extraction , be they recent or distant , may they be Cajuns , may they be from Maine , Vermont or Michigan , I want to tell you how much you hurt and damaged the fabric of Franco - American relations , how much you made our lives difficult and painful .
May your Anti-French political side - show go down in history as a vicious , petty and as a spiteful act of backstabbing cowardice .
May all Americans remember what you did , not so much in respect to our citizenship or culture , but how it speaks volumes about how you treated dissent , opinion and opposition
When you and your administration pushed the truth aside to embark upon the folly that was the Iraq war , opposition from the French Government became your excuse to operate a systematic , top down Anti-French policy from within your own office ; aimed not only at French interests , but against all things Gallic be they our culture , our language and our people .
Five years of Anti-French slander and vilification was thrust upon us by you direct from the White House , from your administration † , your members of Congress ‡ , from your governors * and from your lackeys in the media ¶ .
May all Americans and Franco - Americans alike , remember what you did .
Not so much in respect to our citizenship or culture , but how it speaks volumes about how you trampled on dissent , opinion and opposition : true constitutional freedoms you swore to uphold one cold morning of January 2000 .
We shall neither forgive nor forget …

The story of what failed goes beyond this ( but is no less fascinating in a mathematical , yet morbid sense ) .
The key cause is derivatives and their pricing combined with how financial markets misused them .
The first fatal flaw was treating derivatives as an externality - creating form of insurance , without thinking deeply enough about what that really means .
At one level there is no difference between internally pooled insurance ( like traditional insurance policies ) and derivative " insurance " .
The thought process that differentiated the latter was part of the central flaw in understanding the risks however .
Both types of " insurance " are the same in that you are relying on aggregating a market to assure that expected costs of payouts are lower than incoming premium cash flows .
The difference is that with derivative forms , by externalizing the risk you no longer have the visibility to know whether the pool 's statistical distribution still assures the required expected cost margin below the incoming revenue !.
Of course , you 've externalize the revenue also but now it 's the entire system at risk when that distribution is upside - down instead .
Ergo what we are seeing now .
When you internally manage the pool , it may be difficult to assure the distribution but you can control things like who enters to pool and what it costs to be part of the pool so you have some levers .
Instead though you throw all direct control out the window instead .
Like outsourcing , when you externalize that risk , you lose control and visibility of the process and work .
To put it slightly differently , it 's like choosing to outsource your product sales to a distributor rather than use your own direct sales force or stores .
In doing so you necessarily disconnect yourself from knowledge about what is happening .
When insurance is involved that 's a bit more risky as the very product ( or value ) itself depends on factors that can vary of over time and which you need as " process variables " to your product production .
You 've basic chosen to run your business open - loop without any control in the name of externalizing things .
By " trading risk to someone who can better afford it " as the standard justification goes , there is an implicit assumption that someone will 1 ) have a better portfolio mix to make the risk you could n't stomach seem trivial , 2 ) that you are not in a closed system where you are buying back your own " excremental " risk .
Neither of these held true in part because the market space was too small , too interconnected and too consolidated .
Such uses of " derivatives as insurance " are only valid in an " open system " model of financial markets where there is tremendous diversity to assure " any possible " better portfolio mix to neutralize a sold risk .
In a globalized and / or highly consolidated industry there is absolutely no way that can be true .
All factors that businesses choose to make " externalities " are intrinsically playing off an assumption of the external world being an open system with infinite sources and sinks for what you are externalizing .
This is certainly not a universally true model .
If you are very big or make too much presumption of sampled independence of the externalized , you are taking a risk .
Possibly a very big risk .
Strictly there is almost certainly an upper bound on how much or for how long you can ever do this " passing off risk " - at some point it becomes a game of musical chairs .
This is just like there being an upper bound to how much you can pollute the environment before it stops being an infinite sink .
Which leads to the second issue .
The second fatal flaw involves ignoring the underlying statistical requirements for the pricing models used for derivatives .
Every model every conceived is " wrong " at some level : the trick to proper use of any model is knowing when and where it fails because the only certainty is that it will fail if you push it far enough .
You can make the argument for this based on entropy and Godel 's theorem lines but not here .
You will always get bitten when you do n't do pay attention to the assumptions / axioms on which the model is based .
And on what are derivative pricing models based ?
Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , of course .
Let 's note the presences of the work " statistical " here .
Black - Scholes , for example , is a direct lift from statistical mechanics .
You can even map the correspondence of variables : Value -> Energy , Price -> Temperature , Transactions -> Atoms ...
If you go to the Wikipedia page for Black - Scholes , you 'll see a list of " assumptions " or " axioms " - you know , that boring boilerplate stuff they drone on about in math class before they get on with the proof at hand .
If you read them and are familiar with just a little bit of the origins of this model , you 'll recognize these are pretty much the same statistical assumptions that you have to presume to use Boltzmann 's equation ( or Fermi - Dirac or Bose - Einstein ) in physics .
Where these models stop working is on the low end of things where you can not presume " equilibrium " and where quantum mechanics tends to take over : small numbers of particles and mixes of non-identical , interacting particles .
So if we have a small ( in market participants - titanic (! ) in currency value ) , contrived " value - creation " market like a CDO or CSO market , are we keeping these assumptions ?
If 80 % of the market volume in such a market is comprised of a group of firms numbering fewer than 8 - 10 firms which are reselling risk incestuously to each other , are we keeping these assumptions ?
If the " safe " investments reference interest rate used for derivative pricing is their own " outer market " ( e.g. bonds rated as AAA are deemed " safe " and our own market 's instruments are AAA so the price we use is our own market rates ) , are we keeping these assumptions ?
If we are " extra careful " and choose a safe interest rate based on some market " completely outside our own " , given that all markets are intimately tied together by globalization such that nothing is independent any longer , are we keeping these assumptions ?
The answer to all of this is : NO .
The assumptions are multilevel - these models presume Gaussian distributions where events are independent ; the Central Limit Theorem only kicks in when enough samples are present .
We have neither , etc. etc .
So we are certainly not keeping our model assumptions valid and thus whatever price the pops out is certainly wrong .
And where is the price - value intuition to know this ?
For a small , eclectic market there is no intuition or external reference .
Few if anyone even in the business of derivatives has an intuition about their value .
These situations are why iterated price setting systems like auctions and negotiation exist ; they are emergent price - value setting tools for sparse - knowledge transactions .
But when both sides of the transaction are running from the same play - book and neither has an intuition about price - value , even iterated pricing is useless .
So it should not be surprising when small ( or large ) errors in price - value mapping get multiplied to the point of potential system collapse .
The fact that CDO markets are small and highly interconnected means that there are positive feedback cycles that multiple up small pricing errors and biases is trivially possible and perhaps inevitably so .
I should point out that my background is engineering involved in semiconductor device physics , analog circuit design and systems reliability .
So at a mere glance , all of these issues jump out at me as being frighteningly self - evident and inevitably problematic .
I also have an MBA which is where I became intimately introduced to these matters .
It 's not that math is to blame ; this makes as much sense as blaming the tool or ascribing a technology with moral failure - it's a cop-out to blame the tools when it 's people who misused the tools .
Morality and its responsibility must always sit squarely on the shoulders of the sentient - the sentient are too slippery to not have this as a strong principal .
The only , next best , excuse should group or organizational factors but only the fate the members tracks with the fate of the organization to avoid moral hazard .
People make decisions , not inanimate objects or knowledge .
Even objects that appear to " decide " ( or act " immorally " ) are ultimately only playing out the design decisions of their creators .
Every object or form of knowledge can be used for good or evil and it must always be the people making those decisions who are blamed for wielding them destructively as society defines the concept .
Clearly , the people responsible can be dealt with either by holding them guilty of sins of commission or omission ( they are adults and either do know or should have known better ) or you can say " they were children " and are incapable of adult responsibility thus they and us must be protected from making the same mistake again and then proceed with putting " parental " controls in place to prevent recurrence of the mistake .
There 's a lot of talk these days about comparative effectiveness -- trying to figure out how existing drugs stack up against one another , in an effort to both save money and improve patients ' health .
But , as this morning 's New York Times notes , a big comparative study of blood pressure medicines published a few years back shows just how tough it can be to persuade docs and patients to change their ways -- particularly if a study shows that an old , cheap drug is better than newer , more expensive options .

Buy Viagra Internationally from Canadian Pharmacies
Viagra is hardly a phenomenon that needs an elaborate presentation ; however , there is enough exciting material worthwhile knowing to go around .
Without further ado , Verichip Canadian pharmacy give you the all - time legend of male sexual health , Viagra and its generics .
Sildenafil Price Difference by Country
Traditionally , Viagra pills you will see on the shelves of the U.S. pharmacies , both physical and virtual , will feature the highest price .
It is not unusual for generics of Viagra in the U.S. up to $ 35,00 per item , which is half the cost of the original drug but still feels too steep and unreasonable .
There are no Viagra generics imported from the low - cost tier manufacturers from India , New Zealand or Israel .
In Canada , the prices for pharmaceutical products are regulated by the government , which gives multiple opportunities for consumers to choose from a variety of low to medium prices for the popular pills , including Viagra and its generics .
You can find Generic Viagra at prices starting from $ 0.47 per pill , which makes the difference between Canadian and American pharmacies huge .
In Australia , the price of Viagra and other meds is regulated by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and is fixed at around $ 60,00 , which is still very high compared to other options available on the international market .
But here , too , Viagra generics ordered over the Internet cost less .
Technically , there is always a possibility to mail - order Viagra from Canadian pharmacies , wherever you live .
But you need to observe the import rules in your country .
Thus , Americans are required to be able to prove their intention to use the medications they order for personal purposes .
Choosing your e-pharmacy smart will translate in assistance with the order and delivery , so do some legwork before committing to any particular e-store .
Signs of political radicalisation in Japan , despite its confused direction
By John Chan
24 November 2008
There are signs of a growing radicalisation among young people in Japan provoked by their own worsening prospects and the deepening gulf between rich and poor , amid the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s .
The resurgence of the Japanese Communist Party ( JCP ) and the growing interest in the “ proletarian ” novel Kanikosen ( or Crab - Canning Ship ) are two indications of a deeply felt , if still confused , hostility to capitalism and the current state of Japanese society .
The British - based Telegraph last month pointed to a significant rise in the JCP ’s membership from a low point of just 375,000 in 2000 to 415,000 .
Since September 2007 , the party has been swelling at a rate of 1,000 new members a month , particularly youth in their 20s and 30s .
Although the JCP has just nine seats in the 480 - seat House of Representatives and seven in the 242 - seat upper house , it is the largest opposition party at the local level with 3,089 members in various local governments .
It is also the second largest party in terms of fundraising — bringing in 57.7 billion yen in 2007 behind 68.2 billion yen raised by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) .
The JCP attributed its increased membership to a renewed interest among young people in the novel Kanikosen , first published in 1929 , about the brutal exploitation of workers on a crab processing ship .
The turning point of the story comes when some crew members are lost at sea and rescued by a Soviet vessel .
They meet a Chinese communist who teaches them to stand up for the proletariat in Japan .
Initially suspicious of “ communism ” , the workers return to their ship , form a union and revolt against their bosses .
The novel highlights the class tensions in Imperial Japan , when the militarist regime stamped out any industrial action or protests .
In the story , the strike on board the ship is brutally put down .
The book was banned in the 1930s and 1940s as part of the ruthless suppression of the socialist movement .
The author Takiji Kobayashi joined the Communist Party in 1931 , which was then illegal , and was tortured to death by Japanese police two years later at the age of just 29 .
The novel was published after the end of World War II , but its annual sales never exceeded 5,000 .
So far this year , more than half a million have been sold .
A manga comic version has sold another 200,000 copies .
Kyudo Takahashi , a 31 - year - old writer , told the Telegraph that young people see their social conditions mirrored in the novel .
“ They can not become happy and they cannot find the solution to their poverty , however hard they work .
Young people who are forced to work for very low wages today may have a feeling that they are in a similar position to the crew of Kanikosen , ” he said .
Media commentators , academics and officials have expressed some nervousness at the growing interest in the novel and its obvious relation to the plight of many young people .
An editorial by the Asahi Shimbun in July commented : “ Non-regular workers who ca n’t afford to rent an apartment now sleep nights in Internet cafes .
The ranks of ‘ freeters ’ — temporary workers forced to move from job to job — in their 30s and 40s are growing …
Many Japanese workers today do n’t feel their jobs are rewarding and are unhappy about their low income and insecure employment status . ”
Japan was once known for its system of life - long employment which provided secure jobs to a large portion of the workforce .
Over the past two decades , however , casual and part - time work has mushroomed .
The number of the non-permanent workers hit 17.3 million by March 2007 — more than 50 percent higher than a decade ago .
Former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi passed legislation in 2002 and 2004 expanding the use of temporary and casual labour .
The deepening social polarisation and associated social ills provoked a public debate over the “ winners ” and “ losers ” of the free market .
Several popular best sellers were published which dealt with the plight of the “ under - classes ” .
The discussion was unprecedented in Japan where social issues have been rarely discussed in the past .
An article in the Japan Times in July found that young people having trouble finding jobs were being attracted to the JCP .
In February , the JCP chief Kazuo Shii challenged then Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda to help casual workers , who were “ being discarded like disposable articles ” by the bosses .
The exchange recorded 150,000 hits , when posted on the Internet .
The JCP leaders have appeared more frequently on TV and radio programs , dealing with questions such as “ Is there a limit to capitalism ? ”
A misplaced hope
The latest interest in the novel Kanikosen indicates that the radicalisation has not subsided .
However , the decision of a layer of young people to place their hopes in the JCP is completely misplaced .
While the party was initially founded in 1922 on the basis of socialist internationalism that heritage was rapidly destroyed under the impact of the rise of the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union .
While the JCP opposed the militarist regime and Japanese imperialism in the 1920s and 1930s , its program was based on the reactionary Stalinist perspective of “ socialism in one country ” and its corollary — the two - stage theory .
Under the so - called first stage , the JCP limited itself to demands of a democratic and national character , subordinating the working class to the “ progressive ” sections of the capitalist class .
The second stage — socialism — was relegated to the distant future .
The full consequences of these conceptions became apparent at the end of World War II .
The Japanese ruling elites and their parties were deeply despised by working people who faced extremely difficult conditions in post - war Japan .
Trade unions and working class political parties that had been small , illegal outfits suddenly swelled in the space of months to become mass organisations .
The JCP because of its stand against Japanese militarism attracted the most radical elements .
Confronted with mass movements , not just in Japan but internationally , the US and its allies relied heavily on the Stalinists parties to suppress the aspirations of the working class to abolish capitalism .
The key turning point came in 1947 when the head of the US occupation General Douglas MacArthur banned a planned general strike that threatened to destabilise the government .
Rather than challenge the US general , the JCP complied , claiming , in line with its two - stage perspective , that the American occupation represented the fulfilment of the democratic first stage of the Japanese revolution .
Having stabilised capitalist rule in Japan , the US , as part of its international Cold War counteroffensive against “ communism ” , banned the JCP in 1949 and launched a “ Red Purge ” of suspected socialists from the state bureaucracy and other posts .
The JCP was legalised again in the 1950s after the signing of the US - Japan Security Treaty in 1952 and the end of the occupation .
Its political trajectory , however , continued to the right .
Like a number of European Stalinist parties , the JCP loosened its international ties in order to integrate itself more closely into the national political establishment .
For decades , it has functioned as a loyal opposition party in the parliamentary arena , playing second fiddle to the Socialist Party before the latter ’s implosion in the 1990s .
The JCP retained a base in sections of the union bureaucracy , particularly in the public sector unions .
To even describe the JCP today as a socialist party is a misnomer .
Its program adopted at a party congress in 2004 reeks of nationalism and economic protectionism .
It defends the interests of small and medium businesses and farmers against big business and global capital .
Its antiwar posturing is of the liberal , pacifist variety .
Its anti-US stance meets up with demands of sections of the Japanese ruling class for a more independent foreign policy .
While denouncing “ the historical and colossal evil of Soviet hegemonies ” , the JCP program praises the efforts of those countries that “ broke away from capitalism ” to being “ a new quest of socialism , including the effort to ‘ achieve socialism through a market economy ’…
This constitutes a historically significant current in the 21st century as an effort that covers vast regions with a total population of more than 1.3 billion . ”
While not named , this can only refer to China where the massive expansion of capitalism , not socialism , has led to a huge and deepening divide between rich and poor .
It is somewhat paradoxical that the JCP , which is no less compromised and treacherous , than its collapsed or collapsing Stalinist counterparts around the world , appears to have a temporary new lease of life .
In part , it is explained by the fact that the JCP is receiving a certain promotion by the mainstream media , conscious that it may be needed as a political safety value .
Even
Time magazine had an article last year comparing the JCP favourably to the LDP as the “ most modern political party in Japan ” .
However , a more fundamental reason for the JCP ’s expanding membership is the understandable political confusion among young people that has been compounded by the isolation and insularity of Japan .
That confusion will only be overcome through an assimilation of the lessons of the strategic experiences of the international working class throughout the twentieth century , in particular the struggle waged by the Trotskyist movement against Stalinism and all forms of national opportunism .

Have you noticed prices going down ?
Gas is down .
Homes are down .
Rents are coming down .
Gold is down .
Stocks are down .
Everything is getting cheaper .
Yet my income is staying the same .
This sounds great !
All around the world economies are cooling off as people buy less , waste less and speculate less .
Along with that comes unemployment , increased government payouts to the needy and a financial climate that inhibits great new business plans from getting off the ground .
Deflation is not going to last .
It cannot .
What happens during a deflation is that our GDP declines .
Today the GDP calculations are rather meaningless for the most part but the one thing that remains valid about it is that inflation is gobbling up more and more of it even as most people are enjoying this temporary deflation .
The GDP calculations include a compensation for inflation , currently around 4.2 % .
Using these calculations our GDP growth has been screeching to a halt .
I 've been told that John Williams at shadowstats.com measures inflation the same way it was measured back in the 70's and 80's .
He figures it has been running close to 10 % , not 4.2 % .
If the GDP calculations today used his traditional measure of inflation our “ growth ” would have turned into “ contraction ” a couple years ago .
Why can't deflation last ?
Because deflation means that every month we have to divert a larger percentage of our GDP towards servicing our debt .
The Fed and the US Treasury and the corrupt congress ( except for Ron Paul ) have been acting for most of this year to cause massive inflation .
Where is it ?
How long can they lean on the inflation button before we begin to see the results ?
Their goal is to inflate the GDP numbers more than the calculated value of inflation .
That way , after the calculations are done , it looks like GDP is going up because the raw ( fudged ) numbers are getting bigger .
The hope is that our creditors will still think the USA is growing and they will be willing to “ buy our debt ” for a few more months .
They are n't fools , they know this is all smoke and mirrors … but they have no choice , the US is setting the stage and they all just have to take their marks and wait for the call to “ action ” .
If the GDP can be inflated faster than the “ official ” inflation rate , then each month we can divert less and less of our GDP towards servicing that debt .
Eventually , our creditors will refuse to take our worthless paper as payment for the real wealth they loaned us .
During the interim , the magnitude of the eventual consequences increase at an accelerating rate .
At this time when real productivity is declining , regardless of the “ official ” calculations , when tax revenues are decreasing and Government welfare obligations are increasing rapidly , there is no way in hell the Fed , US Treasury or the corrupt Congress ( except Ron Paul ) or the new president will allow deflation to continue .
In fact , they could n't if they did want to .
The consequences are inevitable …inflation is coming and inflation eats the future .
This current deflation that is looking so nice to those of us who are still working and buying things is akin to the water receding from the beach prior to a tsunami .
Startling and unexpected , with no visible signs of the impending doom to follow , the receding tide will lure the unsuspecting out on to the coastal flats to gape and gawk at all the really cool stuff that has been made assessable .
When that tidal wave of inflation comes roaring back to the beach , anyone caught unawares will be crushed , pounded into the dirt , smashed and broken as if they were dolls instead of real people .
Once that tide goes out , there is no magic trick of congress or high finance that can cause it to come back to the beach peacefully and serenely .
The tsunami is inevitable and due to the actions of the Fed , US Treasury and the corrupt congress ( except Ron Paul ) it will be the worst the world has ever seen .
The inflation tsunami phenomena is not new .
It has helped destroy over 3 dozen empires in the past .
Their folly is our folly as we proceed with the same wrong - headed policies and behavior as our predecessors .
Now is not the time to wander the exposed coastal flats in wonder .
It is the time to RUN for high ground with supplies and loved ones .
There will probably be a rebound in the stock markets , perhaps even a rebound in housing and a decline in unemployment between now and Spring .
But maybe not .
If there is a rebound , it will mark the last chance for folks who know what is coming to recover a little of their cash and get out .
We 've never seen a situation so extraordinary so applying folk wisdom to predict the possibility of a rebound is a bit like describing an undiscovered country .
I know the possibility exists that I 'm all wrong and I 'll eventually look like chicken little .
However , I 'm not predicting that the sky will fall … the sky will remain untouched by all this human suffering .
All I 'm trying to do is point to an unstoppable situation that is coming and urge people to take it seriously .
When the tsunami hits , there will be no more social welfare programs to tide people over .
( no pun intended ) Each of our futures will depend on how well we prepared as individuals .
I 've been watching this build for at least 15 years and preparing for my own future for the past 10 on a regular basis .
Nothing yet has happened to cause me to doubt our country will follow the path of the other great empires .
Instead , the actions our nation takes have only caused me to realize that what is coming could be so much worse than I had ever expected … and I 'm expecting it to be horrible .

' I did n't want to have any more operations ' : Girl , 13 , says why she would prefer to die with dignity than have transplant
A 13 - year - old schoolgirl who successfully battled a hospital decision to forcefully give her a heart transplant said today she had had enough of being treated by medics .
Hannah Jones said she understood her decision may lead to her death , but explained : ' I did n't want to go through any more operations . '
' There is a chance I will be okay and a chance I might not be , but I 'm willing to take the chance . '
Doctors had warned the brave schoolgirl , with a hole in her heart , that the transplant itself might lead to her dying on the operating table - but insisted she have the operation .
Health chiefs eventually abandoned the High Court proceedings after Hannah told them she would not let surgeons operate .
She has chosen instead to spend her remaining time at home .
Hannah Jones :
The terminally ill teenager has won the right to refuse treatment
She said : ' They explained everything to me but I did n't want to go through any more operations .
I 'd had enough of hospitals and wanted to come home .
' I put my point across , I told them I do n't want this and I do n't want to have it .
' I just decided that their were too many risks and even if I went ahead there might be a chance that there was a bad outcome .
' I have not had a month or a year go by when I 've not had hospital treatment .
My doctors all are looking after me , they are supporting me 100 per cent and so are my parents , my mum sitting here with and my dad , who is at work .
" They never thought I would make such a recovery .
Hannah Jones , pictured with her parents Kirsty and Andrew .
Her parents were disgusted by the initial decision by a hospital to force Hannah to have a heart transplant
" I think I have made the right decision at the moment and I am not going to change it .
" Hospital holds some bad memories for me and I do n't want anymore treatment . "
In a letter to the Jones family , Herefordshire Primary Care Trust chief executive Chris Bull said the Trust had concluded that it was ' not appropriate ' to seek a court order requiring Hannah to be admitted to hospital .
He added that Hannah appeared to ' understand the serious nature of her condition ' and that she ' demonstrated awareness that she could die ' .
Hannah , from Marden near Hereford , has a hole in her heart meaning it can only pump a fraction of its normal capacity .
Her heart was further weakened by treatment for a rare form of leukaemia diagnosed when she was just five .
She had been previously warned that she had only six months to live and that the only potential long term solution was a heart transplant .
At present the law states that a child under 16 may be judged able to give their consent for an operation , but there is nothing written down about them refusing the treatment .
Yesterday , her parents Andrew and Kirsty , an intensive care nurse , said they were disgusted by the initial decision to pursue the case .
Mr Jones , a 43 - year - old auditor , said : ' Hannah had been through enough already and to have the added stress of a possible court hearing or being forcibly taken into hospital is disgraceful .
' We obviously want Hannah to be with us for as long as possible , but we 're not going to force her into something she definitely does not want at this time .
' She has been in and out of hospital all of her life and she has decided that she has had enough of it . '
Hannah was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia at five .
The high - strength drug she was given to treat the illness caused a hole to develop in her heart .
She is now taking a range of medication and has been fitted with a special pacemaker .
That operation meant a seven - month hospital stay between May and November last year .
In that time she was told the only potential long - term solution was a heart transplant .
Hannah talked through the pros and cons with her consultants at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and Birmingham Children 's Hospital .
She decided against it because there was a high risk she would not survive the surgery .
Even if she did , the leukaemia could return because of her weakened immune system .
Hannah judged it would be better to return home to Marden near Hereford and enjoy time with her brother Oliver , 11 , and sisters Lucy , ten , and Phoebe , four , under the expert care of her 42 - year - old mother .
But the family then received a telephone call from Hereford Hospital , where Hannah had regular check - ups , warning it could apply for a High Court order to admit her to hospital .

The teenager has been told her trip to Disnelyland America is under threat as no insurance company will insure her
The next day a female child protection officer interviewed Hannah at home .
The hospital then decided not to go ahead with any case .
Mr Jones said yesterday : ' I do n't know exactly what Hannah said in that room but it must have been powerful enough to convince some very high up people that she was right .
We 're very proud of our little girl . '
Yesterday , a spokesman for Herefordshire Primary Care Trust refused to explain why it had considered legal action to force Hannah to go to hospital .
However , Chris Bull , the trust 's chief executive , wrote to the family after they complained to the General Medical Council .
He said the doctors involved had taken ' appropriate ' action but the PCT had decided against the need for court action .
He said Hannah was a ' brave and courageous young woman ' .
With the anniversary of the September 11 attacks once again upon us , Bush 's Law of Bin Laden is also again on display .
That is , in the Bush playbook , the threat posed by Osama Bin Laden is directly proportional to the threat to the President 's own political standing .
At the White House on Wednesday , press secretary Dana Perino played down the Bin Laden danger to her lame - duck boss ' flatline political standing , if not to the American people :
Q : But Osama bin Laden is the one that - you keep talking about his lieutenants , and , yes , they are very important , but Osama bin Laden was the mastermind of 9/11 - PERINO : No , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind of 9/11 , and he 's sitting in jail right now .
But back in January 2006 , President Bush was singing a much different tune .
Trying to fight back against the growing public outcry over his illegal domestic wiretapping program , President Bush used the Bin Laden bogeyman during remarks at the National Security Agency .
Bush lashed out at his critics :
All I would ask them to do is listen to the words of Osama bin Laden and take him seriously .
When he says he 's going to hurt the American people again , or try to , he means it .
I take it seriously , and the people of NSA take it seriously .
By May 2007 , Bush turned to the specter of Bin Laden to justify both his regime of surveillance at home and his war without end in Iraq .
During a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy , the President outlined a plot that connected Osama bin Laden and the head of al Qaeda in Iraq to terror plans intended to hit U.S. interests and the United States itself .
A serious Bush intoned :
In January of last year , Osama bin Laden warned the American people : " Operations are under preparation and you will see them on your own ground once they are finished . "
Of course , George W. Bush did not take Bin Laden seriously five years earlier .
Questioned about his silence regarding Bin Laden in the months following the American failure to capture the Al Qaeda chieftain in Tora Bora , Afghanistan , a nonchalant Bush on March 13 , 2002 downplayed his significance :
So I do n't know where he is .
You know , I just do n't spend that much time on him , Kelly , to be honest with you ... I 'll repeat what I said .
I truly am not that concerned about him .
Bush may have been embarrassed by his failure to capture Bin Laden in 2002 , but by the fall of 2004 , he faced the prospect of American voters who seemed to recall the murder of 3,000 of their countrymen .
In the third presidential debate with John Kerry , a childlike Bush on October 13 , 2004 tried for a " do over " of his statement two and a half years earlier :
Gosh , I just do n't think I ever said I 'm not worried about Osama bin Laden .
It 's kind of one of those exaggerations .
Of course we 're worried about Osama bin Laden .
Which brings us full circle .
In the aftermath of 9/11 , President Bush used the specter of Osama Bin Laden to rally what had been a faltering presidency .
In a show of frontier bravado , Bush talked tough about Bin Laden just days after the 9/11 attacks :
There 's an old poster out west , as I recall , that said , " Wanted : Dead or Alive . "
Seven years later , it is the Bush presidency itself which is dead .
Bin Laden remains at large even as Bush 's calamitous tenure winds down .
In his waning days in office , George W. Bush is simply immune to further declines in popularity .
Which , according to Bush 's Law , must mean Osama Bin Laden does n't matter much anymore .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A suspected missile strike from a U.S. Predator drone killed at least four people in a house in Pakistan 's North Waziristan region early Saturday .
Marchers protest recent U.S. missile strikes on the Pakistani tribal areas .
The attack , which occurred in the Mir Ali subdivision in the village of Ali Khel , was one of several to hit the country Saturday .
Six people were injured in Saturday 's attack , the fourth suspected U.S. strike on Pakistani soil in November .
The names of the victims have not been released .
It is also not known why the house was targeted .
Elsewhere , three people were killed and 11 were injured in an explosion inside a mosque in northwest Pakistan 's tribal region , a government official said .
The explosion happened just after 4 p.m. ( 6 a.m. ET ) , leaving the Hangu district mosque inside Pakistan 's North - West Frontier Province in ruins , said Omer Faraz Khan , deputy superintendent of Hangu .
He said rescuers were trying to save people trapped under the debris .
It was not immediately clear how many people were inside the mosque at the time of the blast .
Police were investigating the explosion , which was detonated using a homemade timer , Khan said .
Hours later , three bombs exploded about 10 p.m. ( noon ET ) outside a stadium in Lahore where a music festival was being held , police Inspector Muntzir Kazmi said .
A 13 - year - old was injured , but it was unknown whether the victim was a boy or girl .
This week , Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson to lodge a formal protest against another suspected U.S. missile strike on its territory , an act Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani called a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
Watch Gilani say his country has had enough of U.S. attacks »
Wednesday 's strike in the Bannu region of Pakistan 's North - West Frontier Province left five dead and seven wounded .
That attack was farther inside Pakistani territory than previous attacks .
The attack targeted a home outside the tribal areas that U.S. intelligence says have become a haven for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters battling U.S. and NATO troops in neighboring Afghanistan .
The U.S. government has not acknowledged hitting targets within Pakistan , an ally in the war on al Qaeda launched after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington .
However , Pakistan 's government has repeatedly complained about the strikes .
Gilani took to the floor of the parliament and renewed his condemnation of the attacks Thursday but added that he thinks they will be controlled when President - elect Barack Obama takes office .
In October , the foreign ministry summoned Patterson to lodge a " strong " protest on continuing missile attacks and said they should be stopped immediately .
At the time , a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people .
Pakistan 's government said the attacks cost lives and undermine public support for its counterterrorism efforts .
The U.S. - led coalition and NATO , based in Afghanistan , have been seeking a way to effectively battle militants who are launching attacks from Pakistan 's swath of tribal areas along the border .
They have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years , saying it is not being active enough against militants , a claim Pakistan denies .
The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones , which are controlled remotely .

Obama advisers : Harsh interrogators will walk Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday November 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Even as President - elect Obama vowed " to regain America 's moral stature in the world " during Sunday 's 60 Minutes appearance , two of his senior advisers confessed there is no intent to pursue those in the Bush administration who engaged in torture .
Speaking on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press , the advisers said that the plan is to put a stop to current interrogation methods and to " look forward " as opposed to focusing on prior transgressions .
The Obama transition team did not offer a response before the report was published .
Human Rights
Watch , a non-profit watchdog group , is lobbying the President - elect for fast action on the abuses of the Bush era .
" For far too long , the United States has undermined its ability to fight terror by adopting short - sighted policies that allowed torture and indefinite detention without charge , " said Kenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch , in a Sunday release .
" The United States urgently needs President - elect Obama to live up to his commitment to right the wrongs of the last seven years , and to regain the moral high ground in the fight against terrorism . "
The group is pushing for Obama to bring Guantanamo detainees into the United States court system , and admit released prisoners into the country if it is feared they may be subject to torture upon returning home .
They are also calling for an executive order to require the CIA to follow the US military 's interrogation rules , and the establishment of an investigatory " truth commission " with subpoena power to enforce standing laws against officials charged with war crimes .
However , if the top candidate for Obama 's Central Intelligence Agency is any indication , the activists may soon be disappointed .
The Atlantic 's Andrew Sullivan , citing a report by Mark Ambinder that Obama is close to appointing John Brennon , who served under former CIA Director George Tenet , decried the impending and crucial decision as , " change we can not believe in . "
" Appointing Brennan to the CIA does not mean change from Bush , " he wrote .
" That was absolutely a critical part of Obama 's message .
With Brennan , we get the taint of a Bush and two - facedness of a Clinton .
We need to say goodbye to all that , not perpetuate its double - speak . "
Tenet was director of the agency when it was admitted that several prisoners were subjected to waterboarding : a form of torture that simulates the experience of drowning .
" [ Obama believes ] torture not be allowed in any form or fashion in any part of the federal government , and he would make sure that was the case , " said Brennan to CQ Politics .
" Whether the Army field manual is comprehensive enough to cover all those tactics and techniques , that s something I think hed look to his national security advisers for . "
Blogger Glenn Greenwald is skeptical too .
" Brennan has been and continues to be an extremely important adviser for Obama on intelligence issues , " he wrote .
" His views on past administration conduct are , in many important instances , clearly disturbing and bear watching . "
Alleged 9/11 ' mastermind ' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is one such prisoner that was admittedly tortured .
The American Civil Liberties Union warned Monday that Bush may try to " sabotage " Obama by " ramming through " the Mohammed tribunal .
On Saturday it was also revealed that senior intelligence officials are lobbying President Bush to preemptively pardon intelligence agents who committed war crimes : an unprecedented act .
Nevertheless , one campaign meme -- " hope " -- has yet to flicker out for human rights activists .
" We are confident that consistent with his message of change , his actions and his criticism , he is going to repudiate the abusive counterterrorism policies of the Bush administration , " Joanne Mariner with Human Rights Watch told IPS News .
Correction : Glenn Greenwald was misidentified in the first version of this article .

The Atlanta Journal - Constitution just reported that incumbent Senator , Saxby Chambliss , was below the 50 % mark , which would mean a run-off under Georgia law .
There are still votes to be counted , but no one seems to know how many :
There was still no resolution in Georgia ’s U.S. Senate race as the sun came up Wednesday and the candidates , election officials and reporters tried to figure out how many votes remained to be counted .
At 7:30 a.m. Wednesday , incumbent U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R - Ga. ) held a 49.8 percent to 46.8 percent advantage over Democrat Jim Martin with 96 percent of the state precincts counted , according to the Georgia Secretary of State ’s Office .
Libertarian Allen Buckley had 3.4 percent of the vote .
If that scenario held , Chambliss would face a costly and unpredictable four - week runoff with Martin .
However , there still were an undetermined number of votes to be counted — possibly tens of thousands of early and absentee ballots from Fulton , Cobb and Gwinnett counties .
Chambliss spokeswoman Michelle Grasso said her campaign believes most of the uncounted votes are in Fulton County .
But at 6:45 a.m. she admitted that there were no clear answers in the race .
“ At this point we are just letting the process work , ” she said .
For a couple of months there , it was sort of exciting to witness how dramatically higher oil prices were affecting human behavior .
Ridership of public transit was up , homeowners were swapping exurban houses for urban condos , S.U.V. sales were down , people were walking .
T. Boone Pickens threw cash at a wind farm .
But in more recent weeks , as oil prices dropped , I started hearing indications of backpedaling on all of the above .
With gas back down in the $ 2 to $ 2.50 a gallon range , there was talk of this all being less urgent , something that could be addressed later .
Pickens even scrapped plans for the wind farm ( for now ) .
This is such a strange notion : that an interim price drop somehow solves the larger issue of our dependence on oil .
And it ’s something we see with another precious resource : water .
A range of alternative energy technologies are available to us today ; there is , however , no substitute for water .
But there are new ways of thinking about water that can help us make better use of the available supply .
( Pickens , by the way , is now actively buying up water rights in Texas . )
Although 70 percent of the earth is covered with water , just 3 percent of that water is fit for human consumption .
This is n’t going to improve anytime soon .
Failures in water - related infrastructure result in lost biodiversity , higher temperatures , increased flooding , massive impact on energy and unsafe , unsanitary water .
But important advances have been made in water resource management — and they are far more compelling than the term “ water resource management ” would suggest .
( Earlier this year , a panel at the sustainability conference West Coast Green was titled “ The Sexiest Large Scale Design Applications We Have Ever Seen . ” )
Because water is cheap ( at least for now ) and seemingly in infinite supply , efforts to improve its use — or deter its overuse — have been inadequate .
And it ’s not just water itself that ’s being wasted : there ’s the energy required to transport and deliver it ( particularly in such cases as Atlanta ’s bizarre arrangement to get its water from Alabama and Florida , or any of us buying bottled water from Fiji ) .
But there are innovations , large and small , now available that would provide for systematic management and optimization of our nation ’s water .
As individuals we receive messaging about water that is dramatically similar to the messaging we receive about energy consumption — and constitutes an equivalent drop in the bucket towards solving the problem .
Public service announcements urge us to , alternately , swap out conventional light bulbs for compact fluorescents , or turn off the water while brushing our teeth .
Both are important small steps ; neither can begin to mitigate the larger challenges of resource depletion .
“ We use huge infrastructure to move and deliver water , ” says landscape architect Josiah Cain of Design Ecology , who worked on the design for the California Academy of Sciences ’ distinctive living roof ( below ) .
“ We wash our face with or take a shower with it , then we use that water , treat it with chemicals and dump it into our waterways .
It does n’t make any sense .
There ’s no such thing as waste water .
We need to take advantage of water multiple times . ”
Living Roofs
Living ( or “ green ” ) roofs are one of several integrated water management systems .
Vegetation is ideal for managing water , and provides benefits that are otherwise hard to capture .
Green roofs have overcome their once - ingrained association with ‘ 70s - style earth architecture , thanks to improved technology , better aesthetics and increased building incentive programs like tax abatements ( New York approved such a program back in August ; 55,000 new square feet of green roofs were installed last year alone in cities including Chicago , San Francisco and Washington , D.C. ) .
Ford Motor Company installed a 10 - acre green roof on its Dearborn Truck Assembly Plant back in 2003 ( one wonders why the same early adopter stance did n’t carry over to their fleet of cars ) .
Individuals are seeking out green roofs for single family homes like this one designed by Fred Ballerini in Carmel , Calif .
The most high - profile recent example is the living roof atop Renzo Piano ’s new Academy of Sciences building in San Francisco ’s Golden Gate Park .
At 197,000 square feet and containing 1.7 million native plants , it is the largest green roof in the United States .
It ’s notable not only for its size but for its undulating form — designed to mimic the site ’s original terrain — and the complete absence of grasses .
Living Walls
Living walls are far less common at present , but can be similarly effective at reducing building cooling demand and restoring bird and butterfly habitats .
Patrick Blanc has helped make living walls into design icons with such projects as the most beautiful overpass you ’ve ever seen : Pont Max Juvénal , Aix - en - Provence .
But despite their fantastic appearance , living walls are highly practical : they absorb and filter storm water , which reduces local water body pollution and helps prevent the overwhelming of municipal storm water infrastructure .
( An urban example by architect Cesar Pelli , which is slated to receive LEED Platinum certification , is shown below ) .
They also filter air particulates , improving air quality and help to reduce the urban heat island effect ( UHI ) .
Living walls can also be installed in building interiors , where they not only improve air quality but add humidity to the air when central heating is used in the winter .
Greywater
Much less exotic but far easier to implement are greywater systems .
Grey water describes water post - shower , - dishwasher or - laundry .
Its use will reduce demand as well as sewer - system loads and the amount we pay for our water bills .
A simple system of tubing allows one to repurpose this water for landscape watering ( which , not incidentally , accounts for 50 percent of home water use in most districts . )
So complex is the bureaucracy to install such systems that an organization called Greywater Guerrillas exists to offer DIY advice and workshops on sustainable water infrastructure to the public .
Rainwater Harvesting
Rainwater harvesting requires little more than a few barrels .
For every 1,000 - square - foot catchment area , one inch of rainfall can result in 600 gallons of rainwater , which can be used primarily for irrigation , toilet flushing and fire safety .
A recent product launch may help transform rainwater collection into high design : minimalist , olive - toned Rainwater HOG collection tanks are now sold at modern furniture emporium Design Within Reach .
“ The issue is that development and population continue , while water rights are static , ” says Josiah Cain .
“ All available water has been accounted for , so the only way to get new water supply involves conservation and reuse strategies . ”

Was it a boat ?
Was it a plane ?
A bit of both in fact .
The Ekranoplan was one of the more obscure products of the fight for technological supremacy in the Cold War.
Nigel Paterson , who joined Top Gear presenter James May for a test " flight " , recounts its secret history .
In September 1966 an American spy satellite flew over a Soviet naval base on the Caspian Sea and took a series of photographs .
This being the height of the Cold War , the results created quite a stir among the American intelligence community , because they showed an object , more than 100 m long with inexplicably stubby , square wings , quite unlike anything they had seen before .
Their first guess was that this was a conventional aeroplane , possibly a seaplane , but one that was incomplete and much bigger than any aircraft the US had .

But when the pictures were examined more closely , intelligence analysts calculated that , even if completed , it would actually fly really badly .
This , coupled with the position of the engines , located well forward of the wing , made them realise what they were looking at was something entirely different .
They had stumbled on one of the most top secret military projects of the Soviet era .
The object was soon dubbed the Caspian Sea Monster .
What they were looking at was , in fact , an Ekranoplan ; a wing in ground effect or WIG craft designed to fly at very high speed a few metres over the top of the sea .
It sounds not unlike a hovercraft .
But where a hovercraft floats on a skirt of air , the Ekranoplan sits clean above the surface and relies on a well known , if little understood aerodynamic phenomenon called " ground - effect " .
In very simple terms the wing produces a dynamic cushion of air when it's close to the ground and the Ekranoplan effectively rides upon this .
It 's the same effect that pelicans use when flying low over the sea and it's a remarkably efficient way of flying , actually increasing lift by as much as 40 % .
All of which means the Ekranoplan was far more efficient than conventional aeroplanes .
Forbidden word
But even more crucially , its ability to fly just a few feet above sea level lent it one huge military advantage - the fast and efficient Ekranoplan was stealthy , capable of carrying troops and armoured vehicles rapidly under the gaze of enemy radar .
But all this was still a mystery to the West in the 1960s .
It would be a quarter of a century later , in 1991 , before the first photographs of these " sea monsters " were finally published and their existence confirmed .

Advertisement Back in the 60s , the Ekranoplan project was so secret even to use the " E " word was forbidden in public .
Not that nosey foreigners were likely to stumble on one during their travels .
Developed on the Volga River near Nizhny Novgorod - formerly Gorky - this was a city closed to foreigners during the Soviet era .
The project owes much to the development of hydrofoils - fast boats that lift out of the water as they pick up speed .
Today , hydrofoils are a staple of many ferry operators around the world , but it was the Soviet designer and inventor Rostilav Alekseev who is considered the father of the modern hydrofoil .
The Ekranoplan was handled by the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau , with Alekseev at the helm .
With the personal support of Soviet premier Kruschev , the project was given what amounted to an open chequebook .
The original Caspian Sea Monster spied by the Americans was a colossal 540 - tonne research craft .
At 100 m long , it was bigger than a Jumbo Jet and twice as heavy as any contemporary aircraft , but much more efficient and capable of flying at up to 400 km / h .
Project abandoned
But such a craft was clearly considered unwieldy and after years of research the Soviet military scaled down their ambitions , developing and producing a smaller 125 - tonne Ekranoplan , which entered service with the Soviet navy as rapid transports .
Even then , the Ekranoplan was a machine with mighty potential .

A CIA report from the end of 1988 - just a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall - considered that initial deployment of the Ekranoplans to the Soviet Baltic , and Black Sea Fleets was due to begin in the early 1990s .
But geopolitical events intervened .
Of the 120 craft planned less than a handful were ever built or saw service and after the end of the Cold War the entire Soviet Ekranoplan project was abandoned - the surviving monsters were mothballed at the same Caspian naval base where they were first discovered by the American spy satellites .
Yet the technology behind the Ekranoplan continued to grip military minds in the West .
In 1993 the US even sent its own team of analysts to assess the technology of the advanced Soviet Ekranoplan project with a view to developing their own for heavy sealift transports .
Today , a private company , ATTK , ( Arctic Trade and Transport Company ) , is once again producing Ekranoplans in the very same shipyards where the first prototypes were designed , built and tested .
But these civilian heirs to the Caspian Sea Monsters are altogether smaller and more pocket - sized affairs , designed to be used as personal craft or water taxis .
The Aquaglide is a compact 5 seat , 10 m craft with a cruising speed of 170 km / h .
Unlike its jet - powered forebears , it 's powered by a Mercedes car engine , but the engines still sit in front of its short stubby wings .
Two variable pitch propellers can push air under the wings and help develop the cushion that allows the craft to become airborne .
And like their heftier siblings they are capable of flying over water , ice , or land .
Part of the problem with the development of Ekranoplans , has been their classification for matters of legislation and licensing .
Were these aircraft or ships ?
The matter was only resolved as late as 2005 by the International Maritime Organisation who deemed that Ekranoplans were , in fact , " high flying ships " .

Ken Paves Injured After Paparazzi Incident
Country singerand her best friend , and hair stylist to the stars , were out last night at Madeo enjoying their evening until they were bombarded by the paparazzi .
The scene turned ugly when Ken was bashed in the head by a frenzied photographer 's camera and he ended up with a bad cut and blood running down his face .
Check out the photo here .
Jessica and Ken quickly got to their waiting car and sped off to the hospital where Simpson escorted her friend inside for treatment .
So far no police reports have been filed .
This is likely not the end of this story and we will keep you updated as new developments arise .

Eleven year old Brenden Foster died this day of Friday , 21 November 2008 , but throughout this world he will be remembered always .
His darkest hour was his brightest light .
This is a story as much of his words as it is of his deeds .
His dying wish was to help the homeless .
" They 're probably starving , so give 'em a chance , food and water . "
It has become a national movement .
He was n't afraid to die .
He had said that he just wanted to make a difference , before his time came .
And he did !
He was a regular kid , who wanted to become marine photographer .
Some time ago had been diagnosed with leukemia .
As death was staring him in his face , it ’s others that he was thinking about .
The homeless caught Brenden 's heartfelt attention .
He had said , " Well , I was getting back from one of my appointments and I saw this big thing full of homeless people and then I thought .
I should just get them something . "
That the country , even the world responded , he said , " I think that is great .
You think that 's great ? "
He had one more wish , and that was to sprinkle wildflower seeds to save the bees .
He had heard that the bees were dying off .
His wish was answered by a retired pilot who asked his flying friends to sprinkle wild flower seeds around the world on Brenden 's behalf .
He spoke with the wisdom of ages .
Of that which made him feel sad , he had said was , " When someone gives up . "
His advice was , " Follow your dreams .
Do n't let anything stop you . "
Asked what he thought the best things in life are , he said , " Just having one . "
If we can learn anything in this life , we can be inspired to do so by this young man .
Three years ago , doctors diagnosed Brenden with leukemia .
His body may have been held back but his spirit excelled far beyond the dreams of most of us .
On death , " It happens .
It 's natural , " He said .
Sleeping pills may cause patients to eat in the middle of the night  –with no memory of it in the morning .
Of all the strange nocturnal behaviors that have been reported with the use of Ambien and other prescription sleep drugs — acting out , sleep walking and talking , and even driving while asleep — the most prevalent by far is sleep eating .
Though the side effect is rare overall , most sleep doctors have heard a few stories of refrigerators being raided , ovens left on through the night , or strange food appearing in the bedroom .
Many of these sleep - eating patients take Ambien , although it 's not clear whether this particular drug really is more likely to cause sleep eating , or if it 's just that more cases are reported because so many more people take Ambien than any other sleep medications .
For some , the strange side effect is unacceptable :
They may gain a significant amount of weight , or worry about operating kitchen appliances while sleeping .
For others , like Rebecca Wiseman , 26 , of Sumter , S.C. , sleep eating happens only occasionally — and it's a small price to pay for the relief that medication can bring .
Relief from hospital - induced insomnia
Wiseman starting taking Ambien while she was in the hospital on bed rest during her second pregnancy .
She was grateful for the full eight hours of sleep it got her , and took a pill just about every night for six weeks .
She 's not sure exactly when the strange nighttime behaviors started , but she first realized that something was unusual when her doctor asked her about something that had occurred the night before — she'd had some troublesome symptoms and her mother had gone to get a nurse .
She had no recollection of this .
" I was scared ; what if something had really gone wrong and I had no memory of it ? " says Wiseman .
" The doctor told me it was a common occurrence though , so I was a little relieved .
And I knew I was constantly being monitored by nurses , so they would know if something happened . "
This changed , however , when she left the hospital and returned home with newborn twins .
Wiseman 's military husband worked long shifts and needed sleep , so she did n't take medication on nights when she had to be up with the babies .
But she struggled with so little sleep and looked forward to the two or three nights a week when her husband did n't work the next morning so she could get good rest with Ambien .
Morning surprises
Then she started raiding the fridge .
" I have no idea when it started happening , but one morning I woke up with milk and cereal all over me , " she says .
" Somehow during the night I 'd gone downstairs and fixed a bowl of cereal — then climbed back into bed and dumped it all over the front of me .
Another time I found a plate of half - eaten dinner at the foot of the bed : I had fixed a plate , heated it up in the microwave , and then gone back to bed to eat . "
Wiseman , who had gastric bypass surgery about four years ago and cannot handle large quantities of food , says she 's never a binge eater during the day .
" Sometimes I have flashbacks of getting sick the night before , after eating too much of the wrong food , like leftover barbecue roast beef sandwiches .
And my husband , when he 's tried to stop me , says I yell at him — – which is very unlike me . "

Even so , it 's still worth it
But still , Wiseman relies on medication to keep her functioning .
When her prescription ran out and the family moved to a new military base , her new doctor refused to prescribe more pills .
She spent a few miserable months barely getting by with over - the - counter and herbal sleep aids , until she found another physician who renewed her Ambien prescription .
A third of men are believed to suffer from premature ejaculation Men who suffer from premature ejaculation may be able to blame their genes , work suggests .
A study of nearly 200 Dutch men found those who climaxed too soon during intercourse had a version of a gene that controls the hormone serotonin .
Men with this version ejaculated twice as quickly as other men in the study .
Serotonin levels are what control the rapidity of ejaculation , say the Utrecht University researchers told the Journal of Sexual Medicine .
Not in the mind
The volunteers in Dr Marcel Waldinger 's study were 89 men who had so - called primary premature ejaculation , meaning they had always suffered from it from their first sexual contact onwards .
For a month , their female partners were asked to use a stopwatch at home to measure the time until ejaculation each time they had intercourse .
Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological
Paula Hall , a sexual psychotherapist for Relate
The results were compared with 92 men with no history of such problems .
In the men with premature ejaculation , serotonin appeared to be less active between the nerves in the section of the brain that controls ejaculation .
Dr Waldinger says this low activity of the hormone means nerve signals do not transfer in the normal way in these men .
" This contradicts the idea , which has been common for years , that the primary form of premature ejaculation is a psychological disorder , " he said .
Fast reactors
The findings also mean it might be possible to treat the condition with gene therapy , he said .
Paula Hall , a sexual psychotherapist for Relate , said : " Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological .
" But there can be a psychological element .
The acid test is how much control they have on their own .
If the problem only occurs with their partner then it is more likely to be psychological . "
She said men with primary premature ejaculation tended to be fast reactors generally .
" These men have very quick reflexes .
They may be excellent at playing tennis or computer games , for example . "
She said there was good evidence that serotonin was linked ejaculation and that researchers were developing drugs for the condition that prolong this hormone 's action .
Currently there is no medication for the condition on the market .
Treatments involve counselling and the use of anti-depressants - not for depression but for their unexpected yet wanted side effect of delaying ejaculation .

What are these ?
The news is rife with stories about how bad things are in the US economy , and the fact that many Americans have been living beyond their means .
Usually , the articles take a stance that the latter is largely responsible for the former .
Americans are frequently talked about as if they are the worst consumers , or maybe it ’s just that , as the world ’s official scapegoat , it often seems this way .
When statistics about the US economy are then presented in comparison with those of other developed ( or wealthy ) nations , many would be surprised by the outcome .
Data from The International Monetary Fund is widely referenced for its market research and financial analyses by leading popular and scholarly texts due to its accuracy .
According to its 2007 Financial Report , the 10 wealthiest nations in the world ( in terms of GDP ) were the United States , followed by Japan , Germany , China , United Kingdom , France , Italy , Spain , Canada and Brazil .
Nation Rank Not Surprising
The actual nations that make up the highest GDP list are probably not surprising , and their combined GDP is equal to roughly half of the world ’s total economy .
Generally speaking , the countries that produce the most are going to be ones that spend the most .
This is more or less the case for individuals as well .
A nation ’s external debt can include any number of factors , including loans , trade deficits , budget deficits , and the sum of its citizens ’ outstanding consumer debt and other factors .
This is similar to how an individual ’s debt can include business loans , mortgages , credit card debt or student loans .
Surprisingly , there is not a wealth of literature written about the size of these large economies after their debts have been considered .
Effectively , this could be referred to as an ad hoc net worth of the above nations ’ economies .
This is very interesting , as the nation is in essence the sum of its parts , meaning its citizens .
Someone ’s debt - to - income ratio is one of the main factors in someone ’s credit , and their ability to buy a house or finance a car .
Why does it not play a major role in a nation ’s ability to conduct business and borrow money in such a way ?
According to the CIA World Factbook , the top 10 debtor nations ( meaning the countries with the most external debt ) are the United States , United Kingdom , Germany , France , Italy , Netherlands , Spain , Ireland , Japan and Switzerland .
Seven of the top ten debtor nations are included in the world ’s top ten economies .
Not surprising .
This is largely a result of widespread availability of affordable credit , and relatively large middle classes in these countries , and consequently a large ratio of home / property owners .
Most popular rhetoric on the topic would claim that wealthy countries have grown accustomed to being wealthy and they are enthralled by consumerism – it could be argued that this high level of debt could be a result of a culture that is used to and willing to buy now , and pay later with interest .
According to data , Japan has the highest positive income ( in gross terms ) at US $ 2,892 billion .
Similarly , the US economy is $ 1,594 billion .
At the other side of the spectrum , Great Britain ’s income to debt ratio is a US - $ 7,677 billion , and that of France is - $ 1,890 Billion .
On a per-citizen level , Japan is number one , followed by the United States .
Reasons Debt Is High
So what are some of the reasons why these nations have such high outstanding debts , even to the point where it may dwarf its GDP in comparison ?
Typically , in what are considered to be established capitalist economies , interest rates are kept low on purpose in order to encourage entrepreneurship and to promote the growth of businesses and spending .
The idea is that those who contribute to the growth of the economy would make up for those who do not , and those who do not contribute positively to the economy would at least spend money in it .
What are some causes of the high debt - to - income ratios in Europe ?
Expensive labor , expensive exports , expensive currency and a small population all play a part .
High levels of taxation and large social welfare systems are to blame as well .
On the international front , European nations are having a difficult time competing with an increasingly devalued dollar ( and consequently the Chinese Yuan and The Japanese Yen ) .
Conversely , in Japan , it is often pointed out that the nation has had a history of being a leader in technology and manufacturing – it is also a nation that is a net exporter , or a nation that exports more than it produces .
The country ’s social welfare system is modestly sized , and the Yen has purposely been kept at a rate that has traditionally made Japanese exports more desirable compared to its US and European counterparts .
There are also arguments that pertain to the differences in culture , and those that relate back to the fact that Japan ’s position in the global economy is a relatively new phenomenon .
Looks like the United States is still the best place to be , even though debt is high .
" What about it ? "
" Nothing . "
I waited .
" I mean , " he went on , " how are you supposed to go from seeing that to wanting to be with ? "
He stopped , but his eyes kept asking the question .
" Right , " I said .
" It gets easier with time , for just about everyone . "
Although no one seems to talk publicly about the problem , Josh is only one of dozens of men who have confided to me that witnessing the births of their children has made it difficult for them to be attracted to their wives , at least in the short run .
They seem to have trouble seeing them as sexual beings after seeing them make babies , trouble reverting to a mind - set in which their wives ' sexual anatomy is just that -- not associated with images of new life emerging through the birth canal .
In the age of the " new man , " very little consideration is given to the potentially negative side effects of togetherness in the delivery room .
Every man I have spoken with over the past few years knows he is expected to be with his wife when his child comes into the world .
How can anyone explain sitting out such a life - changing moment in the waiting room ?
The trouble is that the moment turns out to be both intensely beautiful and potentially traumatic .
It is miraculous to see a baby 's head emerge , and it can also be shocking .
It is riveting to see an umbilical cord connecting mother and baby , but it can also be very disturbing .
It is exciting to be asked by a doctor to cut that umbilical cord , but also potentially very frightening , even for otherwise rather fearless men .
And not every man gets over it .
Several men have confessed to me that they never regained the same romantic view of their wives that they had before seeing them deliver children .
What are you thankful for this year ?
I ’m thankful for my family , my little granddaughter and grandchild - in - waiting , and that Obama is going to be our next Pres .
There are many other things I ’m grateful about but you probably do n’t want to read any more about that .
So without further ado , I ’m posting a link to a very inventive , vegetarian menu for a scrumtious Thanksgiving dinner , with nary a cube of tofu or meat substitute to be seen .
Thanks to Om Paramapoona for the article and for her culinary excellence .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- World War II did n't just divide the world .
It also divided four brothers .
Ken ( left ) and Harry Akune served in the U.S. military during World War II .
Not long after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Harry and Ken Akune were sent to live in an internment camp in Amache , Colorado .
When the U.S. Army 's Military Intelligence Service came to their camp to recruit Japanese - speaking volunteers as interpreters , they joined so they could prove their loyalty to their country .
Across the world in Japan , their father Ichiro was raising the rest of his large family -- which had returned to his home country after the death of his wife -- in a fishing village , Kagoshima , on the island of Kyushu .
The youngest brothers , Saburo and Shiro , were just teenagers when they were drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy .
The brothers , four of the Akunes ' nine children , had all been born or raised in the United States ; Ichiro Akune owned a grocery business before moving back to Japan .
Harry and Ken had been sent back to America to work and earn money for the family .
Watch how brother fought brother during the war »
Harry and Ken graduated from language school in 1942 and were dispatched to the Pacific Theater .
Ken served in Burma at the Office of War Information .
His job was trying to create propaganda to persuade the Japanese to surrender rather than sacrifice their lives on the battlefield .
Harry served in New Guinea and the Philippines .
His ethnicity did n't endear him to some of his colleagues .
" I had an intelligence officer who disliked me , " Harry recalled .
Before a parachute jump onto the island of Corregidor with the 503rd Paratroopers late in the war , the officer stripped Harry of all of his gear , including his weapon .
" I got onto the airplane with only my parachute .
A soldier took pity on me and helped find a rifle and one clip , " he said .
He survived , but many of his fellow soldiers did not .
Twenty percent of them lost their lives just on the jump because of the jagged terrain and enemy fire .
iReport.com :
What did you do in the war ?
His work was heroic .
Harry 's interrogation of prisoners and translation of captured documents revealed a Japanese occupation force of over 5,000 , which vastly outnumbered the American forces .
" My information helped reduce casualties , " he said .
Most of the Japanese soldiers chose death over what they perceived as dishonor .
Harry says only 22 were captured , with the rest dying in combat or suicide attacks -- and they often were n't satisfied with dying alone .
At one point , with Harry 's back turned , a prisoner jumped him and tried to kill him .
Harry recalls the incident vividly .
" My guard beat him with his gun .
It seemed like this prisoner was clinging to me for dear life , " he said .
" That feeling I have never lost .
Even though he was the enemy , to see him die the way he did , affected me . "
The Japan - based Akune brothers saw death from the other perspective , as part of the war effort .
Saburo became a spotter for kamikazes , known for their suicide dive - bomb missions on Allied ships .
Shiro , just 15 , served at Sasebo , a naval base , helping to orient new recruits .
He remembers American Grumman torpedo planes flying into the harbor .
" Bap , bap , bap ... ships going down ... we just watching !
We can not do anything ! " he remembered .
After the war , the Akune brothers discovered they served against each other , leading to ill feelings on both sides .
Harry and Ken , now in Japan as members of the Allied Prisoner of War Recovery Team , joined Saburo and Shiro at a family reunion in Kagoshima .
" When we first met , the topic of the war came up .
Both sides were saying their side was right , " Ken said .
" Saburo and Shiro got really hot and stood up , they wanted to fight us . "
" The propaganda situation in Japan was very extreme , " Shiro said .
" The elders told you what you should do is revere the emperor like a god , and if you did n't abide by it , you were physically harmed . "
It took the intercession of their father to stop the familial battle .
" Shut up , " the elder Akune said .
" The war is over . "
All four brothers ended up in the United States , with Shiro -- ironically -- serving as an American GI in Korea .
Saburo died several years ago , but Shiro , Harry and Ken continue to live in Southern California .
Ken still volunteers full time with the " Go For Broke " National Education Center , which preserves the memory of Japanese - American soldiers who served the United States in World War II .
Harry says his military service helped him identify as an American .
" The benefit of going to war for the United States helped me manage myself not as a Japanese - American , but more like an American .
I feel very happy I was able to do that , " he said .
But he holds nothing against the two brothers who fought for the other side .
" They were in Japan , educated there .
It 's only right to be loyal to the Japanese force , " he said .
" I feel like they were like any other Japanese and we were like any other American .
Two sides had their ideas , and there was a clash , " he said .
" Everything worked out .
All four of us were able to survive without having to be casualties of the war . "

Software development , like any other industry , has trends .
Over the past couple of years it 's been fun to watch the ascendance of the Domain Specific Language meme .
I ’ve loved language design since I first started programming and I like to see people work in that design space .
Language design is challenging and immensely satisfying work .
It 's been said that one of the oddities of software design is that we suffer from a lack of constraints .
At times , we have severe memory or time constraints , but for the most part , there is nothing that forces us to choose , say , one object structure over another other than our understanding of how it might impact future change .
When you design an embedded DSL -- a DSL built of constructs in a surrounding programming language , the structure of your classes has an immediate impact on the expressivity of your language .
It 's API development writ large .
But , embedded DSLs are just one part of the DSL space .
The rest of the space is occupied by external DSLs -- standalone languages that compile down to some other language or a run-time .
In general , they give you a freer hand .
You can create a complete syntax and tune it directly to a particular domain .
Most of your constraints evaporate .
It ’s a very tempting approach but it does have some pitfalls .
When you are a consultant , you end up seeing many proprietary technologies that you ca n’t talk about .
There are more external DSLs out there than most people realize and more often than not , I see companies trying to get rid of them .
Why ?
Well , there are a couple of reasons .
One is the cost of maintenance .
Someone in the organization needs to know enough about the DSL to make the inevitable changes .
In a way , this is n’t much different from the cost of maintaining a framework , but many organizations see it as a difference in kind because the tools that you use in an DSL implementation are often not the same as the tools that you use in conventional business applications .
It ’s one thing to hire developers who know C# or Java or Ruby and yet another to hire or make sure that you have some who know ANTLR or YACC .
In some companies this is absolutely no problem .
They hire very knowledgable developers as a matter of course and they are sufficiently polyglot to make the cost of maintaining a language implementation negligible , but on the other hand , there are many companies that look at the cost side .
They write software , but their business is n’t software , so they are constantly trading off the cost of maintaining their DSL with the cost of dedicating those people to work that is closer to the business line .
One other reason why companies move away from external DSLs is that they can complicate hiring .
Years ago , I designed an external DSL for an organization that felt that they could save money by developing a high level language that their domain experts could use directly .
I spent a good amount of time on the implementation and it was used successfully for long time .
After a while , however , they dropped it .
The domain experts were technical enough to use a mainstream programming language , but beyond that , moving away from the DSL made it easier to hire them .
Let ’s face it , if you are looking for a job what do you want to have on your resume ?
A language used by precisely one company or one that is known or used throughout the industry ?
Like the cost of maintenance , hiring cost is just one piece of the total cost of ownership for a DSL but it can be the one which tips a decision .
One very public example is Erlang .
People are paying a lot of attention to Erlang today , but we should n’t forget that it was dropped by Ericsson in part because they were concerned with their ability to hire and train developers .
Many people know the story of Erlang , but what they do n’t realize is just how common this scenario has been in the industry .
I get to see a lot of legacy code in my work , and a good amount of it is in homegrown languages that companies have trouble supporting .
The thing to remember about DSLs is that they are a commitment and the commitment does n’t end when the initial implementation is done .
This is definitely true for external DSLs , but it ’s also true for embedded DSLs , albeit at much smaller scale .
When you make a commitment , you have to make sure that you have the will to follow through and you also have to make a sober assessment about whether you will keep the commitment even under adverse business conditions .
If you can , it ’s worth doing .
DSLs are powerful technology .
Enough about failure .
How can you succeed with DSLs ?
Here are a couple of ideas :
If you are creating an external DSL , consider open sourcing it or , at least , consider forming some sort of an industry group around it .
This partially externalizes the cost of maintenance and avoids hiring trouble .
If you ca n’t or wo n’t open your DSL (s ) to the outside world , make sure that your developers are not expected to use them exclusively .
If you do n’t , you can expect to pay higher wages for developers of equivalent skill than you would otherwise .
In negotiations , they will factor in the cost of working with little known technologies .
Consider embedded DSLs as an alternative .
Often they are easy to construct and they can give you many of the same advantages .
Dynamic languages like Ruby are ideal for embedded DSL construction , but embedded DSLs have been written in just about every mainstream programming language .
I like external DSLs and I think we 'll see more of them .
But remember , success is a function of far more than the technology .
OTTAWA  Prime Minister Stephen Harper , putting aside the date he had set by law , formally propelled Canada into a federal election campaign on Sunday .
The vote on Oct. 14 will come about a year earlier than the date Mr. Harper had specified in legislation after his Conservative Party assumed power in January 2006 .
It will be the third national election for Canada in just over four years .
Mr. Harper asserted that opposition parties had forced his hand by rendering Parliament “ dysfunctional . ”
But his opponents retorted that the early vote was exactly the sort of political manipulation the prime minister had promised to eliminate .
“ We have come to the moment that requires the people of Canada to choose the way forward , ” Mr. Harper said outside Rideau Hall , the residence of Governor General Michaëlle Jean , who as official head of state formally dissolved Parliament and set the election in motion .
“ They will choose between direction or uncertainty , between common sense or risky experiments , between steadiness or recklessness . ”
Note :
For those that are not familiar with nuclear ship history , the N. S. Savannah was the world 's first nuclear powered commercial ship .
She operated for less than ten years before being laid up .
Here are some facts about the ship :
What is the bottom line ?
Why was she laid up as " not economical " ?
Savannah 's average subsidy was approximately $ 2 million more than other ships her size .
The Comptroller of the US calculated that $ 1.9 million of that could be attributed to Savannah 's status as a one of a kind ship .
She was laid up in 1971 .
In 1973 , the increase in the cost of oil raised the fuel cost for a Savannah sized steamship by $ 1.8 million per year .
In 1979 , the cost of operating a Savannah sized oil burner increased by another $ 2.0 million .
What are the political ramifications of nuclear powered shipping ?
This will be a problem that needs to be addressed .
Right now , there are few treaties that address the issue .
There is a bilateral agreement between the US and Great Britain that can be used as a model .
There are , however , many important ports in the world that have readily accepted nuclear powered naval ships from five different nations .
American shipbuilding has been struggling .
Will atomic engines help ?
Yes .
There is no other nation in the world that has our experience in building nuclear propulsion plants .
There is no other nation that has the store of trained operators that can help train other operators .
By putting our expertise to work , we can build ships with such a technological advantage that they will be able to overcome some of our cost disadvantages .
Nuclear ships will be much faster , more responsive , have greater cargo capacity per ton displacement , and greater reliability .
However , we must work in new ways ; if we try to build nuclear powered commercial ships like we do extremely expensive carriers and submarines we will not succeed .
What happens if an atomic powered ship is in a collision or sinks ?
Any collision or grounding is bad , but we can use the accidental experiments of the nuclear navies to show that they are no worse for nuclear powered ships .
The cores of an atomic engine are carefully designed and constructed to prevent the release of radioactive material under all conditions and there are at least three barriers between the material and the environment .
So far , there have been no measured radioactive material releases from the cores that are currently on the bottom of the ocean .
Can cruise ships be powered with atomic engines ?
Absolutely .
Smooth running turbines and lack of stack gases make them ideal for passenger ships .
No longer will passengers on deck have to worry about cinders on their clothes .
There will be a big reduction in engine noise and vibration .
The deck and interior space freed up by eliminating the stacks can be put to good use for casinos , dance floors and observation towers .
What other ships can particularly benefit from atomic power ?
Large , fast container ships , tankers , liquified natural gas carriers , long range ore ships and liners can all gain from current technology engines .
Fast ferries may be particularly interested in powerful engines that burn a tiny mass of fuel each trip .
The fuel savings that can be realized make it economical to consider replacing the power plants in existing ships .
As technology is advanced to reduce the minimum engine size , any ship that spends most of its time in operation is a potential candidate .
Pleasure boats that are infrequently used will probably never realize much benefit from the large capital investment that would be required to modify them with an atomic engine .

And the poor man was slain ;
No one said it , but all thought Camilla .
Researchers from the University of Hawaii , the Wildlife Conservation Society , Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute , National Marine Fisheries Service and Projecto Meros do Brazil discovered a new species of fish — a grouper that reaches more than six feet in length and can weigh nearly 1,000 pounds .
This newly discovered species can be found roaming the tropical reefs of the Eastern Pacific Ocean .
Was the massive fish hiding among the corals and sea grass to evade marine biologists ?
No , it was just a case of mistaken identity , as explained in a recent genetic study in the journal Endangered Species Research .
It turns out that goliath in the Atlantic — which inhabit the tropical waters of the Americas and western Africa — are not the same groupers that swim in Pacific waters , even though they look identical .
" For more than a century , ichthyologists have thought that Pacific and Atlantic goliath grouper were the same species , and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques .
The genetic data were the key to our finding : two species , one on each side of the isthmus . , " said Dr. Matthew Craig of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology , lead author of the study .
Because the two populations of grouper are identical in body form and markings , they were both considered part of the same species : Epinephelus itajara .
About three - and - a - half million years ago — before the Caribbean and the Pacific became separated by present - day Panama — they were the same species .
Since that time , the two populations have evolved into genetically distinct populations .
While testing the hypothesis that Pacific and West Atlantic grouper were the same species , the research team found significant differences in the DNA from both populations .
The differences indicate that the two populations have effectively evolved into two separate species after being separated from one another by Central America .
The new Pacific species is now classified as Epinephelus quinquefasciatus .
E. itajara is currently listed as critically endangered to extinction in the World Conservation Union 's Red List of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora .
Due to its scarcity , E. quinquefasciatus may also be considered critically endangered .
" In light of our new findings , the Pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies , " said WCS researcher Dr. Rachel Graham , a co-author on the study and convener of the first International Symposium on Goliath grouper which provided the impetus for this highly collaborative study .
Cunnilingus
Performing cunnilingus can be one of the most wonderful things you can do for a woman .
It makes her feel loved , admired , sexy , and has the potential to give her an exceptional Orgasm .
Many women prefer it to intercourse , and for those who require a large amount of clitoral stimulation , it is the easiest way to orgasm .
Besides , lots of women expect it these days and men who perform great cunnilingus are always appreciated and considered fabulous lovers .
Remember , there is almost nothing you can do that will feel bad ( so long as you are gentle ) , so relax !
Any licking and sucking of the labia , vaginal entrance , clitoris , or anal area should feel great to your partner .
Also , once you find something that works , do n’t stray too far away from it unless you are moving to something that works better , or if you are teasing .
Techniques
The Lick
Leaving your tongue soft and jaw relaxed , try licking her from vaginal entrance up to her clit and following the outer edges of her vagina along both sides .
Repeating this technique going up and down and vice versa can be a great opener .
Labial Hold
While holding the two parts together with your lips , run your tongue between the inner and outer labia one side at a time .
Tongue Intercourse
The majority of a woman ’s nerve endings in her vagina are around the opening and within the first couple of inches inside .
Target them with your tongue by inserting it into her vaginal opening .
Techniques are pretty limited due to the length of your tongue , but try moving your tongue in and out , as well as in circles around the inside of her opening .
The Flick
Spread her outer vaginal lips with your fingers .
With your tongue pointed , gently flick your tongue around her clitoris .
Feel free to roam , but keep coming back to her clitoris , as it is the most sensitive .
This drives some women wild , and others find it to too intense .
When stimulating her clit make sure to start out gently if you are n’t sure how she likes it .
When you try this , pay attention to whether those moans are ecstasy or pain .
The following techniques should not be introduced until your partner is really hot ( i.e. , very wet ) .
These are more intense techniques , and may be too intense for some women , even when nearing orgasm .
The Clitoris Suck
Expose her clitoris by spreading her lips and lightly pull back her hood .
With her clitoris exposed , give it a quick little suck ; pulling it into your mouth briefly and letting it go .
This is a lot like licking a bit of cake batter off of your pinky .
This feels incredible , and is a fine thing to do if you feel like tormenting her – but do n’t overdo it !
We recommend not using your teeth nor using heavy suction when starting out .
The Clitoris Hold
Take her exposed clit into your mouth and gently suck on it , simultaneously flicking your tongue over and around it .
This can be done very lightly or very aggressively , and combined with fingering , will usually rapidly produce an intense orgasm .
The Tongue Tube
Roll your tongue into a tube ( if you cannot do this , forget about it because it is genetic and you can't learn it ) .
This technique works best in an inverted or 69 position .
Roll your tongue into a tube around her clitoris .
Slide it back - and - forth ; in effect , your tongue is doing something similar to a woman 's vagina around a man 's penis .
This is likely to bring any woman over the edge to an explosive orgasm .
ABC’s
Try using your tongue to spell the alphabet on her genitals .
This works surprisingly well as your tongue is always moving in different directions .
Learn her favorite letters and the orders that work the best !
Other Tips
A good lover ’s hands never stop moving , so keep exploring , insert a finger , or massage her thighs while you perform .
You can also try using a wide variety of flavored gels , oils , and lubricants .
Some of these products heat up when rubbed or blown to add extra stimulation .
Having a mint in your mouth while you are performing cunnilingus can also improve your results .
The mint , as long as it is not too weak or strong , can create a very intense tingling sensation to enhance your performance .
Exercises
When you 're first starting out with cunnilingus , you might find it difficult to perform it for very long without suffering from tongue fatigue ...
To be able to perform for extended periods of time , there are a number of exercises that can be used to strengthen the muscles in your mouth .
Here are a few tongue exercises and positions for performing cunnilingus :
Exercise 1 :
Stick your tongue as far out of your mouth as possible , and then try to touch your nose .
Once you are in this position , hold the same muscle groups still and begin moving your tongue around .
Practice in sets , moving the tongue clockwise , counterclockwise , and up and down .
Exercise 2 :
With a loose jaw , point your tongue while simultaneously trying to keep your tongue in constant contact with the top and bottom your mouth .
Once you are in this position , practice moving your tongue in and out of your mouth .
For the more advanced student , try keeping your mouth closed and circling your tongue around inside of it , while of course , maintaining position .
An extension to the advanced exercise is trying to dissolve a lifesaver held in your teeth from the inside out .
Exercise 3 :
Stick your tongue straight out of your mouth , trying to keep your tongue flat and relaxed .
Slowly , while holding the position , practice curling the wide tip of the tongue upward , downward and side - to - side .
Practice in five sets of ten , holding each move for 2 seconds .
Exercise 4 :
Keep your tongue relaxed and open your mouth .
Move your tongue in and out of your mouth forwards and in both directions .
Practice in five sets of twenty .
Cunnilingus Positions
Once you 're confident that you 're in the groove of things , you 're ready to learn how to apply these skills .
If you do n't already know , cunnilingus can be a real pain in the neck ... so mixing a few positions into a ' meal ' can really help in getting your partner off before you need to tap out .
We have a nice selection of Cunnilingus and 69 sex position sections to help you learn some of the options !
If there is anything more dangerous to the space tourism industry than
this
, it's
this .
In his ever - provocative way , Taylor Dinerman voices a worry shared by many in human spaceflight business about the
Congressman from Minnesota's
push to amend the CSLAA :
Will James Oberstar kill the space tourism industry ?
( The Space Review ) Read it this Thanksgiving ( at halftime ) .
In spite of some weasel wording , the hard legal requirements of Oberstar 's proposed regulation would effectively kill the whole entrepreneurial suborbital industry .
The cost not only of developing a manned rocket that complies with the kind of safety burden that Oberstar wants , not to mention the astronomical cost of proving that a vehicle actually does comply with the regulations , will make it all but impossible even for the deepest pockets to build anything .
Even worse , Oberstar might open the door for the tort lawyers to come in and strip mine all the investment capital out of the industry .
They almost killed off the US general aviation industry before Congress stepped in and put a stop to the lawsuit avalanche .
In that case , tens of thousands of US jobs were at stake , but with the space tourism industry so far only hundreds of jobs are now at risk .
The greatest danger is that all the thousands of high - paying jobs that the space tourism industry will create if the industry is left to develop under current rules will simply never exist .
Yes , overregulation can indeed stifle the development of new American space business , and litigation seriously chill the flow of venture dollars , all to the benefit of foreign competition .
We 'll see if the 110th Congress gets this .
And what of jobs for poor tort lawyers ?
Sometimes it does seem litigation is as American as football at Thanksgiving .
Many folks note good tort law has saved countless innocent Americans from injury and wrongful death .
But to set off what Taylor calls a " lawsuit avalanche " against space tourism interests could be deadly for an industry designed by and for knowledgeable and willing risk takers .
Lawyers -- and lawmakers -- should not create a threat of economic disaster .
Congress called for reasonable steps to protect public safety without causing undue economic harm to the newborn human spaceflight industry .
That is the proper balance of interests here .
And that 's no turkey .
However , as always , to do business in America is to assume the risk of getting sued .
( For the record , Oberstar is not a tort lawyer .
Or a lawyer at all . )

Barack Obama and Google CEO Eric Schmidt shake hands .
Obama - Google connection scares competitors
Google CEO Eric Schmidt did n’t say anything as he flanked President - elect Barack Obama during his first post-election press conference .
He did n’t have to .
The image alone of Schmidt standing elbow - to - elbow with Obama ’s top economic thinkers was enough to send shivers up the spine of Google ’s competitors .
Advertisement
“ This terrifies Microsoft , ” said a Democratic lobbyist familiar with the industry .
“ There ’s a reason why people are scared to death of Google . ”
Friday 's press conference Friday came just two days after Google threw in the towel on an attempted Internet advertising partnership with Yahoo , the older , but struggling Web company .
Google said that the prospect of an antitrust lawsuit from the Justice Department was the key deal breaker .
Yahoo , which needed the deal more than Google , had said it was willing to fight the government , but Google did n’t have the stomach for a protracted legal battle .
So an open question for Google is whether the search - engine giant ’s newfound closeness with the Democratic president - elect will give the company the muscle it needs to win disputes with the government over deals such as the Yahoo partnership .
Google says that Schmidt was acting on his own , and his politics do n’t reflect the company ’s official stance .
“ Eric ’s endorsement of Sen. Obama was a personal matter , and as a company Google was neutral in the campaign , ” said Adam Kovacevich , Google ’s senior manager of global communications and public affairs .
“ We look forward to working with the new administration and congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to keep the Internet open and to promote economic growth . ”
Obama ’s transition team declined comment .
Some insiders , though , say Schmidt is inevitably identified with the company he leads .
And they say that could benefit Google , not on the big decisions in Washington , but on the accumulation of smaller , less - visible matters .
“ A lot of decisions are made in the gray areas and at the low levels , ’ explained the Democratic lobbyist .
“ From the staff attorney all the way up the line , everybody now knows that Google is close to Obama , ” the lobbyist said .
And that could subtly affect the policy playing field in Google ’s favor .
Beyond the perennial antitrust battles , Google has a host of other issues pending in Washington , from broadband access and net neutrality to privacy rights to patent reform and copyright policy .
And it has n’t gone unnoticed in the lobbying community that Google has been quietly upping its participation in the Washington scene for nearly a year .
Not only was Google ’s Schmidt on the campaign trail and on Obama ’s economic advisory committee , but he also assumed the role of chairman of the influential New America Foundation early this year .
Google did n’t donate money as a company , but Schmidt wrote a personal check of $ 1 million , single handedly financing a healthy portion of the foundation ’s $ 12.9 million annual budget .
The New America Foundation , a nonprofit , nonpartisan public policy think tank , will clearly be at the center of the new administration ’s thinking on economic issues : Schmidt and two other of its board members were among the 17 influential economic thinkers who stood behind Obama Friday .
“ We ’re looking forward to having more friends in the next administration , ” said New America Foundation Vice President Rachel White .
“ But as an independent foundation , the chances are good that we ’ll swim against the stream of some of the policies that the Obama administration puts forward . ”
Anticipating the problems that can come from having prominent people with multiple agendas serving on the foundation ’s board of directors , New America drew up a conflict of interest policy in June , saying , in part : “ New America ’s conflict of interest policy is not designed to eliminate or exclude relationships and activities that might create a duality of interest , but rather to encourage transparency and careful deliberation in those cases where conflicts or perceived conflicts may arise . ”
Jay Leno of the “ Tonight Show ” loves to tell jokes about stupid criminals .
Well , Jay , here is one for the books .
Michael A. McGorman , 22 , of Brooklyn , New York , got the bright idea that lottery winner Gary Owens , who lives near Albany New York , kept his $ 10 million in his house , thus being an inviting robbery target .
McGorman soon learned that just because a lottery winner wins a big prize does n’t mean he has a house full of cash .
About a week ago , according to the Albany Times Union , McGorman , brandishing a gun , broke into Owens ’ home .
Owens told police that a man came to his door .
Said his name was Tony and he was there to repay money that had been borrowed .
Well , someone named Tony did owe Owens money , but the lottery winner had a clue that the man at the door was not the Tony he knew since he was wearing a hood .
“ He broke down the door , put a gun to my head and told me ‘ Give me all your money , ' ” Owens told the cops .
He was then told to lie down on the floor , and tied up .
Luckily for Owens his downstairs neighbor came to the rescue , and while he wrestled with the robber , Owens got free , ran to the kitchen , grabbed a wooden chair and smacked the suspect twice .
At this point , McGorman ran for his life .
Meanwhile , Owens said he was “ a little shook up by the incident . ”
And based on their description of the robber , the NY State police nabbed McGorman on the New York State Thruway .
He was charged with first - degree burglary , first - degree assault , second - degree attempted robbery , unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon .
The gun , police said , turned out to be a pellet pistol .
Owens , a retired engineer with General Electric , won his $ 10 million playing a scratch - off ticket .
“ Sometimes I wonder if it ’s even worth it , ” he said to police .
“ People think I have all this money in my house .
Well , I do n’t . ”
This is a good lesson to all of you lottery winners out there .
If you win a big jackpot , bank and invest the winnings .
Do n’t keep a lot of cash in your house .
And buy a good alarm system .
In the Money :
There were no winners in Tuesday night ’s Mega Million ’s draw , so the jackpot rises to $ 16 million on Friday .
Winning numbers for Tuesday ’s game were 2,25,35,38 , 42 .
The Mega ball was 34 .
Two people matched five balls ( but missed the Mega ball ) .
Each of those winning tickets is worth $ 250,000 .
The tickets were bought in New York and New Jersey .
Tonight ’s Powerball game has a $ 15 million jackpot .
Good luck .
An application for a permit is in process to demolish the house at 8 Mayflower Parkway in the Compo Road South area .
Built in 1926 , the two - story custom colonial shingle - style home has 6,584 square feet and is situated on a one - acre property .
Because the house was built more than 60 years ago , the application must be reviewed by the Historic District Commission .
The current house is listed for sale at nearly $ 2.4 million , but a 5,200 - square - feet replacement house , scheduled to be built in 2009 , is also listed for sale at nearly $ 3.7 million .

This is totally pathetic ….
I am giving up on Westport !!!!
I know this house and how grand it is .
Why in the world would you want to knock down this beautiful stately home ?
Another magnificent piece of Westport history being destroyed .
Will there be no end to the destruction of this New England town ?
Sad….sad….sad .

And it just continues .
I hope the HDC uses its 180 day stay of demolition power so that there is time to find a buyer for this gem of a house .
Really a neat house inside .
Family friends with 2 past owners .
Helped the first move into this house 30 + years ago .
Could someone who understands economics of home building explain why someone would EITHER sell an existing house for $ 2.4 million OR build an new one to sell for $ 3.7 million .
Should one assume that the builder thinks they can build the new 5,200 square foot house for $ 1.3 million ?
Or is that too simplistic a way to look at this ?

My math has gotten me to the same conclusion .
So , between materials , labor , permits , landscaping , carrying charges on a building loan and taxes , and more , you can still make a profit with a margin of 1.3 million ??
I can only assume that the quality of the materials of the new , will not compare favorably with the existing house .
Why not an addition of a couple of thousand feet , IF you want a house that large ?

Just exactly what is the purpose of the Historic District Commission if the teardowns here in Westport seem to be eventually approved ???
This seems to be a formality , and the REALITY is these beautiful homes , whether large or small , will be demolished .
Why bother with the applications ?
If there are homes that were saved by the HDC reviews , I would love to see a list .
Perhaps the HDC would like to address what the surrounding neighbors have to contend with regarding tresspassing , the noise ordinance , placement of construction equipment , and personal property damage .
Or perhaps Planning and Zoning would like to put a sub-committee together to hear residents concerns .
Wishfull thinking on my part ?
I have had to contend with the above mentioned for 10 years , due to demolition and construction surrounding my home .
I am sure all who read this commentary will see I am not too impressed and not too pleased .
I have been a resident for 40 years .
Westport , and all it has to offer , continues to be a wonderful place to live .
However , the teardown / build big situation also breaks my heart .

Maybe it ’s time to go through the processes to give the HDC more tools to work with !
Anyone ( John , who ’s on the RTM ? ) know how other towns have put in regulations that help P&Z ; to stop these teardowns ?
I think what we would hear are residents saying that “ I can do with my house what I want ” and I ’m not sure how one answers that .
But in the meantime the overall good of the town ( retaining gorgeous homes like this ) is trashed .
I ’m not savvy enough to know how one would start the process , but I believe that there are Westport - lovers out there who would support it .

One of the tools would be a further percentage and / or height limitation on new homes .
Perhaps others would be higher permit costs for tearing down and tax incentives for houses deemed historic .
Builders are having a field day in our town to the detriment of those who still live here .

In addition to the 180 Day stay of demolition which is the most allowed by state law which the RTM approved this year ( increased from 90 days ) the Local Historic District Designation is the other major tool the town and its citizens have for protecting historic properties .
If any neighborhood is really serious about this matter , the Historic District Commission can help neighbors get started with the process of being designated a Local Historic District .
In the past 4 years 3 downtown area neighborhoods ( Violet Lane , Gorham Avenue , Evergreen Avenue ) and the Greens Farms Cemetery and at least one single residence have gone through the process .
I live in the Gorham Avenue Historic District .
A teardown of a house that is in one of the town ’s Local Historic District would be difficult .
So the HDC has historically done a good job of promoting Local Historic Districts .
Better than in most towns in the State .
So , if one is really interested in preventing teardowns in Westport and Historic Preservation and live in a house that is over 50 years old , ask yourself “ Why have n’t I made my house part of a Local Historic District ? ”
Until then any criticism of someone else knocking down an historic house or of the HDC rings hollow .
I know the RTM is very interested in seeing other applicants for Local Historic District designation .
Why not your house and neighborhood ?

Great suggestions , John .
And if someone gets a single historic house designation , the only restriction on someone buying it would be that the “ streetscape ” must remain the same ( so we can all look at lovely homes as we drive around town ) but ( as suggested for this Mayflower Pwy home ) someone can still add on more room and additions on the back .
A win-win situation .

Well , I certainly am for preserving the character of the town .
However , I am NOT in faovr of excessively dictating what a homeowner can do with his property beyond legitimate zoning regulations and building codes , especially if this moves into the area of subjective taste .
There are many subdvisions with highly restrictive deed covenants for those who wish to live in a homogenized community setting .
We already have dwelling coverage and total coverage limitations in the zoning regs , and these vary by zone to accomadate higher density zones .
We also have building height limitations in the zoning regs .
Many of the older homes in town that are so cherished do not even comply with the maximum height and number of stories requirements found i the current regs .
Even if you tighten up the coverage limitations ( house and total ) and the height and number of stories limitations , that will NOT address the phenomena of people finding it MUCH cheaper to scrape the historic home off the property and build a brand new one , rather than renovate and restore .
In my opinion , the most successful way to address this problem is to offer tax incentives and relaxed building and zoning regs to those who are restoring historic dwellings , so that it become at least financially less burdensome to renovate and restore vs demolish and build new .
Ask anyone who has restored an old home about the costs to do so ( and the building code issues that drove the cost even higher ) vs. how much it would have cost to simply scrape it off and build brand new .
Further tightening up the coverage and height limitations in the zoning regs is not the answer , and will not address the issue you are concerned about .

thanks ,
Jack , for some thoughtful feedback .
So where does one start to get “ tax incentives and relaxed bldg & zoing regs for restoring historic dwellings ” ?
I know that Michael Ronemus has urged the same things from their perspective of restoring the house and outbuildings on Cross Highway .

I find that very sad too .
I totally agree with Rhoda Berke .
Soon there will be no traces of the past left .
This house is so more beautiful than most “ modern ” ones .

I do n’t see the problem in Westport being so much about what ’s being torn down , as what is being built .
It is true that Westport has many charming antiques , but most are made of wood and , without a couple centuries of excellent upkeep , are destined to not be here forever .
And much of their charm has to do with the beautiful trees that grace the property .
That said , the vast majority of houses in this town are 50’s and 60 ’s style contractor houses of no particular architectural distinction or worth .
Whether in a historic district or not , when these modest homes are torn down — the lot clear cut of old growth trees — and replaced with an out - sized structure with minimal landscaping , the resulting assault on the senses is what is truly destroying this community ’s charming appeal .
A perfect example of this is a foursome of new homes on the Cross Highway between North and Bayberry .
What Westport needs is not more preservation , but a bona fide architectural review board that makes sure what replaces old homes ( of any vintage or value ) does not distract from the neighborhood charm .
How hard could that be ?
I will gladly host the first meeting at my own house .

Why would someone not want to renovate this in lieu of demolition .
Crazy , unimaginative , wasteful as well as financially irresponsible .
This is a magnificent home with tremendous architectural scale and proportion for it ’s size .
John McCarthy ’s posting says it all .
Let ’s face it …local Historic Districts help tp preserve streetscapes and neighborhoods .
The Gorham Avenue Historic District , which both the McCarthy ’s and my wife Grayson and I live in , are examples of just how effective such designations can be , and still accommodate the needs of modern day society without being excessively and unreasonably restrictive .
This owner and / or builder developer would be well served to reassess this demolition application .

Jamie - you asked “ Why would someone not want to renovate this in lieu of demolition ? ”
There is a very simple answer - it is a case of simple dollars and cents .
Renovating an old home and updating the systems , while being sensistive to the architectural details of the home , and also complying with modern building codes , simply costs a great deal more than demolishing the home and building new .
The profit opportunity is a very simple driver of this phenomena of tear - downs by builders in Westport - a builder can buy a neglected , smaller older home on a 1 acre lot for $ 850,000 ( for example ) , demolish it and replace it with a 6,000 sf “ McMansion ” ( at a cost to him of $ 750,000 , for example ) and sell that new home for $ 2,250,000 - he then clears $ 650,000 ( ignoring many details in this simple math . )
If , on the other hand , Mr. Builder plowed every bit of that $ 750,000 into renovating that older , smaller home he bought for $ 850,000 , he ’d still be hard - pressed to sell it for $ 1.75 million ( clearing just $ 150,000 in that example ) .
I ca n’t really fault the builders for taking the profitable path , but the result is a depletion of the historic home inventory .
Alternatively , consider the plight of the family that occupies an old home , or has just purchased an old home to “ fix it up ” .
It is damn hard to spend the kind of money that is required to renovate an old home knowing full well that you cannot even hope to get that investment back out of the home should you decide ( or your heirs decide ) to sell it .
It can only be described as a labor of love .
Chip Stephens has posted his experience with this on this forum .
Such is why I tend to post with suggestions of tax incentives ( property tax credits , etc. ) and relaxation of building codes for historic restorations ( to further minimize the cost ) as a way to address this problem .

I do agree with you , Jack , that depending on the structures condition it can cost more , but my experience suggests that this is on a case by case basis and this home is in pretty good shape .
I am a contractor and have worked extensively over the past 23 years , primarily , on commercial construction and have a few landmark structures under my belt already .
I do understand the economics , however it is not always cost prohibitive .
Also , building codes tend to relax for historic structures .
This is already in effect for home with Historic Designations and homes within Historic Districts ,
This however , does not mean that one compromises safety for the benefit of architectural integrity .
Your math , works if we were talking about this 1 or 2 years ago .
Less is more now and we have an abundance of housing stock in the 3000 - 6000 sq foot arena that just is not moving .
Spec builders purchasing 1 acre lots to erect 6000 ft square homes is just a bad model that is destine to put them out of business .
Renovating smaller structures is now a more profitable model .
Remember , “ pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered ” .
Better to be alive then on some banks “ dinner table ” .
I agree with you that tax incentives can be an additional “ arrow in the quiver ” for owners and builder developers alike .

If we ’re all agreed that tax incentives and relaxed building codes is a good avenue to explore , how are we going to get in touch with Eric Wright who said that we could have a discussion at his home ( after the holidays , I presume ) ?
If he ’s the one who lives at 17 Hockanum Road , we can all call him to say that we ’re interested in an exploratory meeting .
Perhaps a couple of the wonderful people from the HDC and our First Selectman , Gordon Joseloff , would come to give us the history and what our possibilities would be to effect change .
Any thoughts from Rhoda , John , Mary , Janet , Lauren , Jack , Marie and Jamie ?
And of course any other interested people would be welcome .
I did n’t want to ignore Eric ’s generous offer to get the ball rolling !

HDC is meeting on Tuesday December 9 , @ 7:00 pm and this is item # 7 .
“ To take such action as the meeting may determine to waive the balance of delay for a demolition permit application at 8 Mayflower Parkway , c 1926 , identified on the 2008 Historic Resources Inventory ” .
I would encourage everyone above who is concerned about this property to attend and encourage HDC to enforce the current 180 day demolition delay .
This send a clear message to those interested in tearing down our historic resources that Westport is no longer a pushover place to build more “ characterless ” structures .
Jamie Walsh on December 04 , 2008 at 01:13 AM |

I ’ll be there on Dec. 9th .
Question : where is the HDC meeting for those of us who do n’t know ?
Also , I never followed through with Eric Wright ’s nice invitation above , and yes , I ’d be glad to be the organizer to get us all together at his house .
I ’ll call the people who left their phone numbers , but anyone else can call Eric ’s cell phone ( 203-858-3351 ) and leave their contact info ( phone , address ) and I ’ll be glad to call them back to find a night we can all meet in early January .
OK ?
( Sounds like Eric was thinking of sooner , in December , but if we can plan ahead and hold a date in January , I think people wo n’t be so over - scheduled . )
Please ask friends if they ’d like to come to an information - gathering get - together , too .
And , Marie Rivet , you AND your American friends are welcome , of course .
You have a lot to add to the discussion .

Unfortunately , I no longer live in Westport after living there for almost 30 years .
My heart is still very much there .
The very first thing I do in the morning is to check on what ’s happening in town on westportnow.com .
I live in Florida but if anyone would like to fly me up and put me up , I would be delighted to do anything to save the town !!!!!
When I lived in Westport , I was extremely involved in the Partrick Road ARS fight along with other causes that were dear to my heart .
Good luck in the preservation of the most beautiful town in the world .

Farm turkeys generally roast more quickly than the water - filled agribusiness turkeys .
Before cooking , rinse the turkey and the giblets under cold running water .
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F . A hotter oven can dry out your turkey ; a lower temperature risks prolonged time in the " danger zone , " which is the temperature range in which bacteria multiply fastest .
If you stuff the turkey , put the stuffing into the bird immediately before putting the turkey into the oven .
Preparing Your Turkey :
Truss the legs together and tuck the wing tips back under shoulders of the bird .
Be sure the turkey is completely thawed .
Times are based on fresh or completely thawed frozen birds at a refrigerator temperature of about 40 degrees F or below .
Add 1/2 cup water to the bottom of the pan .
Once your bird has reached the desired golden brown , a tent of foil may be placed over the turkey .
This prevents overbrowning and drying .
For turkeys up to 20 pounds , roast for 15 minutes a pound — an 18 - pound bird should roast for about 4 1/2 hours .
Roast larger birds for 12 minutes a pound .
A stuffed turkey may require an extra buffer of 30 minutes .
Take the temperature of the bird as well as the stuffing .
Oven temperatures vary , as do farm - fresh turkeys , so begin checking for doneness about 30 minutes before the turkey is expected to be done .
Testing for Doneness :
Temperature : Deep breast should be 160 to 165 degrees F. Concurrently , thigh temperature should register at 180 to 185 degrees F .
Knife test : Insert a paring knife into the breast and thigh .
When the juices run clear — not at all pink — the turkey is cooked .
Leg separation :
When the turkey is adequately cooked , with a light tug , the leg will easily separate from the bird .
When the turkey is done , cool it at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before carving .
This lets the meat solidify a bit more and makes for easier and more attractive carving .
Refrigerate leftovers no more than 2 hours after removing the turkey from the oven .
Wrapped tightly in aluminum foil or freezer - grade plastic , the roasted meat can be frozen .
Storing : A farm - fresh turkey can be stored in a very cold environment — 28 to 34 degrees F — up to 8 days in advance .
Have thermometers on hand for refrigeration and for testing the final doneness of the Thanksgiving centerpiece .
How Many People Your Turkey Will Feed :
6 pounds : 4 - 6 people
8 pounds : 6 - 8 people
12 pounds : 8 - 10 people
15 pounds : 10 - 12 people
18 pounds : 12-15 people
22 pounds : 15 + people

Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama made history by becoming the first ever African American to be nominated for the role by a major political party .
Barack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4 , 1961 in Hawaii .
His mother , Ann Dunham , a white American from Kansas , met his Kenyan father , Barack Obama I , while they were studying together at the University of Hawaii at Manoa .
His parents separated when Obama was two , and he barely knew his father , who died in an automobile accident in 1982 .
In 1967 , Obama ’s mother married Indonesian Lolo Soetoro , and the family moved to Jakarta , where Obama lived until he was 10 .
He has a half - sister Maya Soetoro - Ng .
Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 and lived with his maternal grandparents until he graduated from high school in 1979 .
A graduate of Columbia University , he entered Harvard Law School in 1988 , where he served as the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review .
First elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996 Barack Obama served as an Illinois state senator for seven years before he was elected to the US State Senate in November 2 , 2004 .
Read
He met his wife , Michelle Robinson , in June 1989 .
Obama has often recalled how she initially rejected his offers to date before finally giving in .
They married on October 3 , 1992 .
The couple have two daughters , Malia Ann and Natasha ( Sasha ) , who have become household figures through the campaign .
Michelle has actively campaigned for her husband , often joining him on the campaign trail gathering support .
Obama ’s 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention vaulted him to rock - star status .
In it , he introduced himself to America as someone who hoped to bridge divisions , political and racial .
In 2005 , Obama featured on Times magazine ’s 100 most influential people in the world list .
On June 3 , 2008 , sixteen months after announcing his candidacy , Barack Obama officially became the Democratic nominee for the US presidency .
His charismatic appearance and public speaking skills have transcended boundaries and widened his appeal .
Known for his stirring eloquence , Obama now draws tens of thousands to his political rallies .
Obama worked as a community organiser for many of his formative years and has banked on that experience throughout his campaign .
His first autobiography , “ Dreams From My Father , ” details his search for identity and his efforts to connect with his father ’s roots in Africa .
The1995 memoir showcased the lyrical writing style that would later mark some of his best - known speeches .
It also helped to shape Obama ’s political identity .
Obama ’s campaign has been dogged by controversy , including this satirical cover on New Yorker magazine .
The illustration attempts to demonstrate the many rumours and smears against him , but was strongly criticised by his camp .
Obama has resounding celebrity support , with figures ranging from Ben Affleck to the Black Eyed Peas .
Obama ’s presidential campaign raised a staggering $ 58 million , setting the record for fundraising by a presidential campaign in the first six months of the calendar year before the run up to the election .
Early on August 23 , 2008 , Obama ’s camp announced via email and text message that Senator Joe Biden has been picked as his running mate .
Biden brings with him 35 - years of foreign policy and national security experience .
Obama created further history October 29 , 2008 with a 30 minute ad that aired across major national television networks .
The glitzy production cost $ 3 million and was the most expensive ad in political history .
NEW YORK ( FORTUNE ) --
In the darkened cocktail lounge of a midtown Manhattan hotel early one recent evening , the gloomy atmosphere matched the mood of the Detroit executive who was nursing a beer .
Auto sales are being ravaged by the toxic combination of plummeting housing prices , expensive consumer credit , and cratering used car values .
And the economic forecast offers little hope of a recovery over the next 15 months
The conversation with the executive was off the record , but the array of negative indicators facing the industry is there for anyone to see :
Potential new car and truck buyers are being kept out of the market because falling resale values mean they do n't have any equity in their current vehicles .
Dealers call these customers " upside down . "
The upside down effect is likely to become most apparent later this fall when Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler launch the latest versions of their most profitable vehicles - the Ford F - 150 and Dodge Ram full - size pickup trucks - because truck trade - in values have been especially hard hit .
At the same time , leasing is disappearing as a sales stimulant because 1 ) manufacturers like Chrysler can no longer afford to finance it , and 2 ) falling resale values - especially on larger vehicles - make it unattractively expensive .
Lots of new car buyers are dependent on an affordable monthly payment and leases can't provide that any longer .
Home equity loans , once a popular way to pick up the slack , are n't helping either .
According to Oregon - based CNW Marketing Research , the reduction in the number of purchases made with home equity loans has been especially steep in California and Florida , where a huge number of new cars and trucks are sold .
Analysts at CSM Worldwide in Detroit are now saying that all these factors , combined with sagging consumer confidence , could delay the industry 's recovery for years .
One scenario has sales remaining below their 2007 sales level of 16.1 million until as late as 2013 .
Even when the market does start to recover , the hottest segments - like compact - sized cars and crossover vehicles - will be far less profitable than shrinking segments like pickups and SUVs .
For the past several months , industry executives had expected to see an improvement in their business prospects in 2010 , when new models arrive , the economy brightened and a lower - wage union contract kicked in .
But doubts are creeping into the forecast that could push recovery further into the future .
For instance , Ford 's highly touted new small cars from Europe , the Fiesta and the Focus , may encounter resistance from consumers who are not used to paying premium prices for subcompact and compact cars .
At Chrysler , analysts are questioning whether the introduction of " seven major new models " in 2010 will be sufficient to reverse negative perceptions about the company , whose sales fell 34.5 % last month .
And observers are baffled by General Motors ' ( GM , Fortune 500 ) decision to unveil the production version of the 2010 Chevrolet Volt two full years before its introduction .
They are equally skeptical about the business prospects of the plug - in hybrid car .
To ensure the Volt has a long - enough range , GM has adopted an architecture for the car used by no one else in the industry and may have to sell it for more than $ 40,000 .
That would erase any economic advantage that comes from saving gas with the new technology .
Even the prospect of Congress appropriating $ 25 billion in low - cost loans to accelerate the changeover to more fuel - efficient vehicles is n't enough to cut the gloom .
As Efraim Levy , an analyst at Standard & Poor 's writes : " In our view , the loans would be net near - term positives to car and parts makers , but would increase borrowing costs and obligations in the future . "
It is hard to imagine a bleaker picture .
As another longtime Detroit executive said last week : " Six months ago , car buyers were upside down on their car loans .
Today , they are upside down on their lives . "
Shakir Stewart : Def Jam Exec VP Died of Self Inflicted Gunshot
, 34 , executive vice president of Island Def. Jam Music Group , died in Atlanta on November 1st of a self inflicted gun shot wound .
He had been in charge of the acquisition and development of new talent at the time of his death .
According to Cobb Country Police spokeswoman Cassie Reece , Stewart 's body was found in a bathroom of his home at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday .
He was taken to Kenne Hospital where he was pronounced dead .
Michelle Rivers , Shakir 's fiancee , released a statement indicating that Stewart had been in deep pain in the weeks leading up to his death , largely suffering in silence .
A graduate of Morehouse College , he got his start at Hitco Music Publishing , where he signed Beyonce to the label .
From 2000 - 2004 he was an A&R consultant at LaFace Records , signing Ciara .
Stewart considered his most recent gig a ' dream job ' according to Vh1 .
' Shake ' was hired to his current post as a replacement for Jay - Z , who moved on in December 2007 .
He had recently signed on artists Rocko and Karina Pasian to Def .
Late last night Def Jam issued the following statement :
" LA Reid and all of us at Island Def Jam Music Group are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and colleague Shakir Stewart .
Shakir was an amazing man , in every sense of the word .
A truly incredible friend and father who was an inspiration to not only our artists and employees , but to his family and the many people who had the privilege of counting him as a friend .
Our hearts and prayers go out to his family at this very difficult time . "

In a separate assessment of Mr. Kim ’s health on Tuesday , the intelligence chief for South Korea ’s conservative government said in a closed parliamentary session in Seoul that the leader appeared to be recovering quickly .
According to Yonhap News , Kim Sung - ho , the director of the National Intelligence Service , told lawmakers that the North Korean leader had recovered enough to start performing his daily duties .
Previous reports said he might have suffered a stroke .

That report came the same day that North Korea threatened to reduce South Korea to “ debris ” if it did not stop its “ smear ” campaign .
The government was apparently enraged that Seoul had done nothing to stop human rights advocates from dropping anti-Kim leaflets from balloons flying over North Korean territory .
Although Mr. Aso did not provide further details about the North Korean leader ’s condition , his comments were a rare instance of a national leader speculating publicly about Mr. Kim ’s health .
They did not seem to relate to any domestic political considerations , but Japanese leaders were upset this month when the Bush administration removed North Korea from the State Department ’s list of state sponsors of terrorism .
Tokyo has long wanted to use the promise of removal from the terrorism list as leverage to force North Korea to be more forthcoming about the fate of Japanese citizens who were abducted many years ago .
The prospect that the six -nation talks , in which Japan is participating , on dismantling the North ’s nuclear program could be completed without resolving the abduction issue is anathema to the Japanese .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Dear America :
Happy 300th Birthday !
It 's 2076 and we 've just invented the time - fax machine .
( Actually , " we " did n't invent the time - fax machine , the State did -- they pretty much control everything now . )
I 'm faxing this back to you in 2008 because that seems to be the year we had the best chance to reverse our course and get back to the vision laid out by our founding fathers -- a vision that did n't include the government being in the insurance business .
I do n't have a lot of time ( the State only gives us one 30 - minute break per day ) so let me give you some advice :
Stop worrying so much about who runs the country and start worrying about who runs your towns , your states , and your Congress .
I know you 're all distracted by the presidential election , but for all the money and time poured into it , the truth is that you 're choosing between two roads that will lead you to the same destination .
Sure , one may be the Autobahn and the other a two - lane highway , but you 'll end up at the same place either way .
Decades of Republicans and Democrats alike have all chipped in to lead you to where you are today .
Believing that one person , from either party , can change that by themselves is a big mistake .
Presidents are like captains of a large ship :
They can map out a course and shout out orders , but without the trust and hard work of the people who actually move the rudders , their commands mean nothing .
In retrospect , the lack of trust and confidence you now have in your leaders was really the root cause of everything that 's happened since .
While our founding fathers designed a brilliant system of checks and balances , separation of powers and democratic elections , trust was the one thing they could n't mandate in the Constitution .
Unfortunately , it 's also the foundation upon which everything else is built and once it began to erode , our whole house inevitably began to crumble .
Looking back now , it 's pretty obvious that our trust in government declined at about the same rate as our partisanship increased .
People became so concerned about getting their party into power at any cost that the truth did n't even seem to matter anymore .
That 's probably one of the reasons why George Washington hated the idea of political parties so much .
Here 's what he said about them in his 1796 farewell speech :
" The alternate domination of one faction over another , sharpened by the spirit of revenge , natural to party dissension , which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities , is itself a frightful despotism .
But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism .
The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual ; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction , more able or more fortunate than his competitors , turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation , on the ruins of public liberty . "
I know that George had a habit for using big words , so allow me to translate into 2008 English : Political parties that put their own success over that of the country 's will be the death of America .
If you do n't believe him yet , just wait a few more years ... you 're about to see firsthand how right he was .
After all , if power corrupts , then the kind of absolute power gained by political parties ( and feared by Washington ) corrupts absolutely .
The best advice I can give you is to stop thinking in terms of left and right and start thinking in terms of right and wrong .
Demand the best leaders possible , and then demand the best out of them .
Believe me , when you see what 's coming your way , you 'll realize how little the donkey and the elephant really ever mattered .
Oh and while we 're on politics , one quick thing that I 'm sure you 're curious about :
Yes , Robert Byrd is still in the Senate .
He 's 159 , but does n't look a day over 91 .
Now , let 's talk about the economy .
Let me see if I have this right : Money and power made people greedy , so you decided to hand over a bunch of money and power to greedy politicians instead .
Smart !
After using that money to nationalize a bunch of banks , mortgage companies and insurance companies , they moved on to bigger things .
The airlines came first -- we just could n't live without them .
Then it was the automakers ( Detroit would 've died ) , health care ( they said they could manage it better ) , and eventually , the oil companies ( I 'm not sure where all of those " windfall profits " have gone ) .
The idea behind it all ( an idea that was eventually turned into law with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 2011 ) was to " socialize losses " by spreading them out among all taxpayers .
The pain , our leaders argued , would be minimal that way .
They were right .
At least until the bills came due .
See , we did n't actually have any of the money we were promising everyone ; we were borrowing it .
It did n't take long before so many of our tax dollars were going toward interest payments that we could n't fund even the most basic of government programs without massive tax increases on everyone .
People now work most of the year just to pay Uncle Sam ( or , as we now call him , " Comrade Sam " ) .
I hear the State censors coming , so let me leave you with a few other quick things :
• Good call on not worrying about protecting our borders .
That works out really well for you in 2019 .
• You might want to spend a little less time worrying about carbon and a little more time worrying about Iran .
We 're now in a new mini-Ice Age but , believe me , Iran is n't using their nukes to warm any homes .
( PS The International Atomic Energy Agency just revealed to you that Iran appears to be refitting their long - range missiles to carry nuclear payloads .
Did you think they were joking or were you just too busy with lipsticks and pigs to notice ? )
• The currency of the future is energy .
Those who have it are thriving and those who do n't -- well , let 's just leave it at that .
Drill for all the oil you can , but you also better start seriously looking for some other options .
In closing , remember this golden rule and you should be fine : Your Constitution will never fail you , but your leaders will .
Be wary of anyone who tries to convince you that it 's the other way around .
Best wishes ( you 're going to need them ) ,
Worker 2744A

LOWERING THE BAR LOWERING THE BAR
Seven states are considering lowering the legal drinking age , including : • Kentucky • Missouri • Minnesota • South Carolina • South Dakota • Wisconsin • Vermont Debate over lowering the drinking age is heating up in several states , fueled in part by legislators who contend that men and women who are old enough to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan are responsible enough to buy alcohol legally .
Legislation introduced in Kentucky , Wisconsin and South Carolina would lower the drinking age for military personnel only .
A planned ballot initiative in Missouri would apply to everyone 18 and older .
An initiative in the works in South Dakota would allow all 19 - and 20 - year - olds to buy low - alcohol beer .
Vermont 's legislature is considering a task force to study the issue .
A Minnesota bill would allow anyone 18 and older to buy alcohol in bars or restaurants , but not in liquor stores until they 're 21 .
MORE : Vermont mulls lower drinking age " There 's a public interest in reopening this debate … and the idea is picking up steam " says John McCardell , a former president of Vermont 's Middlebury College who founded Choose Responsibility .
The non-profit group supports allowing 18 - to 20 - year - olds to drink legally after they complete an alcohol education program .
Proponents face opposition from Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) and a potentially costly obstacle : Congress voted in 1984 to penalize states that set the drinking age below 21 with forfeiture of 10 % of their federal highway funds .
That threat " may prove to be a deal - breaker " for his bill , says Minnesota state Rep. Chris DeLaForest .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says laws setting the drinking age at 21 have cut traffic fatalities involving drivers ages 18 - 20 by 13 % .
" We welcome the attention to the drinking age , " says MADD CEO Chuck Hurley .
" The data is in fact overwhelming . "
Those laws have n't ended underage drinking , says state Sen.
Hinda Miller , who wants a task force to study the issue and report to Vermont 's legislature next year .
" I want to start talking about it , " she says .
A 2007 Gallup Poll found that 77 % of Americans oppose lowering the drinking age to 18 , but state Rep. Fletcher Smith , sponsor of a bill that would allow military personnel 18 and older to buy alcohol in South Carolina , disagrees .
" If you can take a shot on the battlefield , " he says , " you ought to be able to take a shot of beer legally . "
State Rep. David Floyd , whose bill would apply to Kentucky troops 18 and older , says it 's " common sense to recognize as full adults the young men and women who serve in the military . "
At a U.S. Senate hearing last fall on the issue , deputy transportation secretary Thomas Barrett , a retired Coast Guard vice admiral , said , " I hear this bandied about that if you are old enough to fight for your country , you are old enough to have a beer . …
I do n't think it 's the same type of maturity . "
Missouri 18 To Drink has concluded it can't collect the 100,000 signatures needed by May to put its initiative on November 's ballot and is now aiming for the 2010 election , says organizer Michael Mikkelsen .
South Dakota 's legislature " is understandably apprehensive about the topic , " says lawyer N. Bob Pesall , who drafted that state 's petition .
" We 're going to need a groundswell , " says state Rep. Terry Musser , sponsor of the Wisconsin bill that would allow troops 19 and older to drink legally .
" We 're going to have to have real people out there say ' enough is enough . ' " Alexander Wagenaar , an epidemiology professor at the University of Florida who studies alcohol issues , doubts that will happen .
Interest in lowering the drinking age is " a surprising trend , " he says , because studies consistently show that raising it " has substantially reduced the amount of drinking and the amount of damage due to drinking . "
Enlarge By Lucas Jackson , AP 77 % of Americans oppose lowering the drinking age to 18 , according to a 2007 Gallup Poll .
Still , many are seeking to lower the drinking age on account of underage military members .

One of the police marksmen who shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes told an inquest today that knowing he had killed an innocent man was something he would have to " live with for the rest of my life " .
Giving evidence for the first time , the officer from Scotland Yard 's elite CO19 specialist firearms unit , identified as C12 , broke down as he recalled the moment he shot De Menezes , saying he was convinced at the time the Brazilian was a suicide bomber about to detonate his device .
Had De Menezes remained seated on the tube train when challenged by police rather than standing up and advancing he would not have been shot , the officer added .
De Menezes ' mother , Maria Otone was in court as C12 – who offered his " sincere regret " to the family – described his feelings when he learned the next day that the man he had shot was not Hussain Osman , one of four suicide bombers who carried out a failed attack on London 's transport network the previous day .
C12 told the inquest into the 27 - year - old Brazilian 's death that he felt " a sense of disbelief and of shock , sadness , confusion " .
" Everything I have ever trained for - for threat assessment , seeing threats , perceiving threats and acting on threats - proved wrong , " he said .
" And I am responsible for the death of an innocent man .
That is something I have got to live with for the rest of my life . "
The marksman told how he came face to face with De Menezes inside a cramped tube train at Stockwell station in south London on July 22 2005 .
He recalled that the electrician got up and walked towards him , and kept moving even after he shouted " armed police " and pointed his gun at him .
" He continued on his forward momentum towards me .
It was at that stage that I just formed the opinion that he 's going to detonate , he 's going to kill us and I have to act now in order to stop this from happening . "
De Menezes was shot seven times in the head at point - blank range .
Asked why he shot De Menezes three times , C12 replied : " I had to be certain that life was extinct , that there was n't any more threat , that this person could n't detonate a bomb .
" Our training is , or has been , that a critical shot is a single shot , probably to the base of the skull , which will cause instant paralysis .
I was not in a position to get there to do that .
I fired the number of shots because I detected movements , albeit might have been movement caused by the bullets . "
The inquest was halted briefly after C12 became distressed and could not continue .
When it resumed , he recalled being " covered in blood " after the shooting .
As he began recounting the moment the Brazilian was killed , C12 apologised further for any distress his account caused .
" I will try and be as delicate as I can for the benefit of the family , but there are some things that have to be said .
" I can't begin to put myself in the position that they are faced with .
I am a family man myself and to lose a son or any member of your family in this situation - I just could n't believe it .
And I offer my sincere condolences , I really , really respectfully do that . "
C12 spoke of his frustration at the lack of contact with his superiors as he prepared to intercept De Menezes .
He said he could not understand a " radio silence " order from the Scotland Yard command centre as the Brazilian got off his bus at the station .
" We were very , very close to the tube station as the subject went in and I remember there being a radio silence and I was frustrated by this .
" If I could add that my sense of frustration was great to say the least .
" My thoughts then were ' He 's entered the tube already ' and I was just frustrated . "
The inquest was adjourned until Monday , when C12 will be cross-examined by the Menezes family 's barrister , Michael Mansfield QC .

Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd ( WDCpix )
More than 50 years ago , when the head of General Motors said that what ’s good for General Motors is good for America , few would have disagreed .
But Tuesday , the company ’s CEO could n’t convince a panel of 21 senators that the idea still rings true .
Along with the heads of Ford and Chrysler , Rick Wagoner urged senators to lend $ 25 billion in emergency aid to the three teetering auto makers .
Without that help , the executives warned , one or more of the companies could fail .
GM says that it ’s burning through cash at a rate that could drive it under before Christmas .
The economic effect of the car manufacturer ’s collapse , the executives claimed , would reverberate far beyond Detroit .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
“ The costs would be catastrophic in jobs lost , income lost , government tax revenue lost and a huge blow to consumer and business confidence , ” Wagoner testified before the Senate Banking Committee .
“ This is all about a lot more than just Detroit .
It ’s about saving the U.S. economy from a catastrophic collapse . ”
While the debate focuses on Detroit ’s auto makers , the issue , some experts say , is nothing less than the future of U.S. manufacturing — and the nature of the country ’s workforce as a whole .
Thomas Geoghegan , a Chicago labor lawyer , said the failure of any of the Big Three would signal a cultural shift , signifiying the fall of the United States as the world ’s premier industrial powerhouse .
“ It would be a dramatic marker in what has been a very slow collapse of the U.S. as a manufacturer , ” he said .
Geoghegan , who has represented labor unions , said he supports a bailout of Ford , GM and Chrysler — with reservations .
If the proposal is part of a renewed government commitment to get the country manufacturing again , he said , it would be worth it .
“ Otherwise , ” Geoghegan said , “ it ’s probably just a waste of money . ”
Many leading economists say an injection of capital is worth the risk .
Appearing Sunday on ABC ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopoulos , ” Paul Krugman , the Nobel Prize - winning Princeton economist and New York Times columnist , warned that allowing the automakers to fail would jeopardize every other stimulus package and bailout bill Congress has passed this year .

Motors CEO Rick Wagoner ( gm-volt.com )
“ Letting GM go under is an enormous anti-stimulus policy , ” Krugman said .
“ It would be working toward a major negative blow to the economy . ”
Many Democrats tend to agree .
Party leaders have introduced bills in both the House and Senate to use $ 25 billion from the $ 700 - billion Wall Street rescue plan to prop up the sinking automakers .
The money would cover the companies ’ operating expenses , including wages , auto parts , health care and pensions .
More important , supporters say , it would keep them making cars and trucks .
“ We need this industry as a basic part of the fabric of our economy , ” insisted Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) , an ardent industry defender .
“ Somebody has to make something in America .
Credit default swaps alone , moving paper , are n’t going to do it . ”
Standing in the Democrats ’ way are the White House and many Senate Republicans , who oppose tapping the Wall Street rescue fund to help Detroit .
“ That money is specifically for the financial industry , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Tuesday , “ to help prevent collapse in our financial system . ”
Republicans want Detroit to tap a $ 25 billion fund , passed in December , to help the automakers retool their factories to improve their fleets ’ fuel efficiency .
Republicans appear to have the numbers to kill the Democratic bill this week .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , chairman of the Banking Committee , gave a stormy forecast Tuesday for the bailout ’s chances in the Senate .
“ I would like to tell you that , in the next couple of days , this is going to happen , ” Dodd told the industry heads .
“ I do n’t think it is . ”

Much of the debate centers on ideology .
Republicans , already stinging from government interventions to keep the financial system working , want market forces to determine the fate of the Big Three .
“ Do the American people want to borrow from their children to prop up companies that are dinosaurs , that have failed models , that have no innovation to speak of , just to hold jobs ? ” Alabama Sen . Richard Shelby , the highest - ranking Republican on the Banking Committee , told CNN Monday .
“ The government is choosing winners and losers in the marketplace .
It wo n’t work . ”
Many critics of a bailout have suggested that bankruptcy is the answer for the struggling automakers .
That , they contend , would allow the industry to continue producing vehicles — and keep employees in jobs .
As an example , they point to the case of United Airlines , which operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for much of this decade .
But others see a series of pitfalls with the bankruptcy strategy .
One is that consumers might be leery of buying cars from a bankrupt automaker .
“ What ’s a five - year warranty worth if the company that produced the car might not be around next year ? ” asked John Schmitt , senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
A bankruptcy in the airline business is different , Schmitt claims , because travelers tend not to care much about the long - term financial health of their carrier .
“ They may not be around two years from now , ” Schmitt said , “ but they ’ll certainly be flying to Cincinnati this afternoon . ”
There are other concerns with the bankruptcy option .
Generally speaking , a company files Chapter 11 when reorganizing the business is thought to be more profitable than closing shop altogether .
In the case of the auto makers , however , the revamping could have little effect if credit markets do n’t finance the reorganization or the purchase of new cars .
Even if GM were producing 1,000 Chevy Volts ( the company ’s plug - in hybrid ) every minute , Americans could n’t scoop them up if they could n’t obtain credit .
“ Chapter 11 quickly becomes Chapter 7 , ” Krugman said on “ This Week , “ which is liquidation .
So we actually see the thing disappear . ”
Such a failure could result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide , experts predict .
Susan R. Helper , economics professor at Case Western Reserve University , estimates that 500,000 jobs would be lost if just GM — as well as the companies that supply it exclusively — were to shut down .
Faced with numbers like those , she said , a $ 25 - billion investment would be well worth the risk .
“ The advantage of keeping jobs in a recession is pretty clear , ” Helper said .
On one facet of the debate , all sides agree :
It ’s been a tough ride recently for Detroit ’s automakers .
Faced with slumping sales because of the credit crisis , the Big Three are burning through their cash at a breakneck pace .
In the third quarter of this year , GM rifled through $ 6.9 billion , while Ford spent $ 7.7 billion and Chrysler $ 3 billion .
On Tuesday , as the corporate heads were testifying before Congress , Ford ’s stock price fell 4 percent , and GM ’s nearly 3 percent , to lows not seen in decades .
The performance of the companies has led many bailout critics to wonder aloud why anyone would want to save them .
“ People who say General Motors is too big to fail have not noticed that it has failed , ” conservative commentator George Will said Sunday on “ This Week . ”
The industry has n’t done much to help its cause .
After years fighting fuel - efficiency standards that might have made the Big Three more competitive in these lean times , the companies were quick Tuesday to attribute their troubles largely to the bad economy , not misguided internal decision - making .
Meanwhile , foreign companies like Honda and Toyota are years ahead of Detroit in developing smaller , more efficient engines .
Many in Congress — even supporters of the auto bailout — doubt $ 25 billion will be enough to get the companies through the recession .
“ You ’re asking an awful lot , ” Dodd told the company heads at the end of Tuesday ’s hearing .
“ And I suspect … that this $ 25 billion is not going to be the end of it . ”
Presidential transitions can be problematic .
The candidate is utterly exhausted .
Supporters have unattainable expectations and unrealistic personal hopes .
The ease of making campaign pledges has given way to the obstinate process of legislating them .
And Barack Obama is the first president - elect since Richard Nixon without executive experience .
What are some of his transition challenges so far ?
One of Mr. Obama 's first decisions was to make Rahm Emanuel his chief of staff .
This smart , aggressive Chicago pol may turn out to be a wise pick .
But first he must decide what his role is .
Will he be the opinionated enforcer who ran the Clinton White House political office ?
Or will Mr. Emanuel fashion himself into a more traditional chief of staff ?
The phrase former chiefs , Republican and Democrat , seem to prize is " honest broker . "
President Ronald Reagan 's chief , James A. Baker III , once cautioned , " Do n't use the process to impose your policy views . "
Effective chiefs of staff do n't short circuit the decision - making process .
Instead , they strive to impartially present the views of others and become a trusted channel of communication to the president for leaders on both sides of the aisle .
Being an impartial manager who constructively encourages individuals to marshal data , strengthen arguments and shape options is hard for anyone .
It will be particularly hard for a combative advocate like Mr. Emanuel .
His success may depend on his ability to submerge lifetime habits and offer his opinion sparingly .
Another early decision was to leak that Sen. Hillary Clinton was being vetted for secretary of state .
The examination better find her acceptable .
Any other selection now would embitter her supporters , even if she publicly declines the appointment .
DIGG THIS
Earlier this month I finished reading two books : Bill Kauffman ’s Ai n’t My America and a compilation of anti-war essays edited by Thomas Woods and Murray Polner titled We Who Dared to Say No to War .
As someone who was not familiar with most of the writings and references featured on those works , I was reminded of just how eerily similar arguments for war ( and other related interventions ) can be .
It is quite possible that , without fail , all wars that the United States has fought since the late 18th century have been wars of aggression .
Because the state unfortunately almost always moves towards expansion , the leaders in government must also support policies that aggrandize their image and the role of the state .
Thus , there is a tendency ( and , indeed , extreme pressure ) to act without trepidation and enact progressive policies that serve political goals .
War , which is another government program , is not an exception of the rule of politics .
The pro-war establishment consists of hawkish politicians and their sideline supporters , and of blood - thirsty lobbyists , both foreign and domestic .
The books mentioned above offer plenty of historical anecdotes and accounts not just against whatever war was popular at the time but also against the lies and manipulation used to trick the American people into them .
The U.S. , always one to meddle in the affairs of others , is " shocked " when , after placing troops or ships beyond its border , said troops or ships are attacked .
A " victim , " it must retaliate by taking over entire nations and installing whatever form of government that the creatures from the swamp desire to impose .
The reasons that have been given ( again , see the works cited above ) through the centuries will sound familiar to modern ears : the intruder wants to destroy us ; they threaten our way of life ; they attacked us first ( hah ! ) ; we must lead the world ; we must make the world safe for democracy ; our role in the world is to guide it , and so on and so forth .
Putting aside the carnage and the fact that national wars are really wars between states and not the citizens of the states , one must not forget that war comes at a cost .
Because wars are carried out by governments , and governments obtain all of their resources through the plundering of producers , the cost of war is aggressively imposed on society — each individual bears the cost .
There is the right , of course , to individually pay for security but there is no right to make others pay .
Today , states provide " security " monolithically and collectively : one size fits all — take it or go to jail .
So when a politician says war is necessary , one must pause , sniff the air , and smell the BS .
Necessary for me ?
You ?
Everyone ?
And to what degree ?
Intervention requires domestic intervention as well .
Finally , war can never be isolated as an issue , for it requires major intrusion in the economy such as increased taxation , inflation , price and wage controls and a myriad other extremely socialist and fascist measures .
Once we add conscription / slavery , the crushing of domestic liberties and the police state , the recipe for totalitarianism is complete .
People are fond of saying " history repeats itself . "
Well , I am not a historian but do have an alternate maxim to share : " Stupidity , ignorance and apathy tend to repeat themselves . "
The way I see it , politics have always been the same .
Circumstances change .
People change .
So long as there is a state , however , politics will remain unsurprisingly similar .
My advice is to never trust or support presidential ( or gubernatorial or mayoral ) endeavors , to disregard of the idea of congressional representation and to realize that the robed ones work for the state and can hardly be impartial .
My advice , in other words is to wake the eff up !

" It seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological : ' Jack must be imagining these things because he 's crazy . '
This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing ... It 's not until Grady , the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family , slides open the bolt of the larder door , allowing Jack to escape , that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural . "
" The theme of the ‘ double ’ has been very thoroughly treated by Otto Rank ( 1914 ) .
He has gone into the connections which the ‘ double ’ has with reflections in mirrors , with shadows , with guardian spirits , with the belief in the soul and with the fear of death ; but he also lets in a flood of light on the surprising evolution of the idea .
For the ‘ double ’ was originally an insurance against the destruction of the ego , an ‘ energetic denial of the power of death ’ , as Rank says ; and probably the ‘ immortal ’ soul was the first ‘ double ’ of the body .
This invention of doubling as a preservation against extinction has its counterpart in the language of dreams , which is found of representing castration by a doubling or multiplication of a genital symbol .
The same desire led the Ancient Egyptians to develop the art of making images of the dead in lasting materials .
Such ideas , however , have sprung from the soil of unbounded self - love , from the primary narcissism which dominates the mind of the child and of primitive man .
But when this stage has been surmounted , the ‘ double ’ reverses its aspect .
From having been an assurance of immortality , it becomes the uncanny harbinger of death . "
There 's something inherently wrong with the human personality .
There 's an evil side to it .
One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious : we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly . "
" A father threatening his child is compelling .
It 's an archetypal enactment of unconscious rages ... the material of this novel is the rage and fear within families . "
" Some places are like people : some shine and some do n't . "
Democracy Now !:
As the media focuses on President - elect Obama and the transition of power here in Washington , the Bush administration is quietly trying to push through a wide array of federal regulations before President Bush leaves office in January .
Up to ninety proposed regulations could be finalized by the outgoing administration , many of which would weaken government rules aimed at protecting consumers and the environment .
According to the Washington Post , the new rules would be among the most controversial deregulatory steps of the Bush era .
They include rules that could weaken workplace safety protections , allow local police to spy in the so - called “ war on terror ” and make it easier for federal agencies to ignore the Endangered Species Act .
While it ’s nothing new for outgoing administrations to try and enact these so - called “ midnight regulations , ” the Bush administration has accelerated the process to ensure the changes it wants will be finalized by November 22nd .
That ’s sixty days before the next administration takes control .
Most federal rules go into effect sixty days after they ’ve been finalized , and it would be a major bureaucratic undertaking for the Obama administration to reverse federal rules already in effect .
" We join this effort because we strongly believe that US science policy has been disastrous during the past several years , and that we need new and visionary leadership to ensure America ’s dominant position in the sciences , and to maintain our nation ’s competitiveness in the world . " said Bob Horvitz ( middle picture , ) a MIT biologist who won a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2002 .

A list of 61 Nobel Laureates issued an open letter to their fellow Americans Thursday urging them to vote for Barack Obama .
Asked about the basis of their support , a small sub - group of those scientists ' answered : Because he 's a safe bet , and because he would make science education and research funding a priority .
A trio of Nobel Laureates reached out to the media together with the Obama campaign Thursday to explain their support .
They sounded haunted by the past eight years of the Bush Administration 's unflagging record of fudging scientific evidence to suit political aims , and by its powerfully symbolic exile of its science advisers from the White House .
" We join this effort because we strongly believe that US science policy has been disastrous during the past several years , and that we need new and visionary leadership to ensure America ’s dominant position in the sciences , and to maintain our nation ’s competitiveness in the world . " said Bob Horvitz , a MIT biologist who won a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2002 .
The Nobel Laureates noted that federal funding has been important in helping them with their own achievements and discoveries .
The three scientists who held a conference call with reporters Thursday said that they could n't trust John McCain 's positions regarding science policy because of political pressure from religious conservatives .
They were particularly concerned about McCain 's position on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research .
McCain says he supports it , but his support is n't spelled out clearly enough to the scientists ' liking .
McCain has a mixed record on the subject .
He 's previously opposed the funding of embryonic stem cell research , but changed his position in 2001 when he said he was " educated " about the subject .
He 's also joined with Kansas senator Sam Brownback to sponsor related legislation that scientists charge is based on a deliberate misinterpretation of scientific reality .
" While I think that Senator McCain has in the past ... had some reasonably progressive views , he 's now in the difficult position of reconciling his views with that of the Republican platform , " said Peter Agre , who won a Nobel Prize for his work in chemistry in 2003 .
Harold Varmus , who is an Obama campaign science advisor , and who won a Nobel prize in 1989 for his work in medicine , said that there 's general confusion in the scientific community over McCain 's position .

PHOENIX , Arizona ( CNN ) --
Two years ago , Karen Daniel was wider around than she was tall .
" It 's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit , " says Karen Daniel who has lost 175 pounds .

Weighing 375 pounds , the 45 - year - old wife and mother had high blood pressure ; her knees hurt and she was always hot .
She felt fatigued and could barely breathe at the slightest exertion .
Even the simplest things became a chore -- tying her shoes , crossing her legs , getting in and out of the car or trying to fit into a chair with arms .
" I was n't living ... I was just existing , " recalled Daniel .
She had n't always struggled with her weight .
Daniel said she started gaining weight at age 18 after moving out of her parents ' home to live on her own .
By the time she married her husband , Paul , at age 22 , she weighed 225 pounds .
" Whenever something happened , I used food , " said Daniel .
" It was like my drug of choice was food .
I never did drugs or alcohol .
I was addicted to food . "
Seven months after her wedding and another 50 pounds later , Daniel became pregnant with her first child .
Instead of gaining weight during the pregnancy , she lost 75 pounds after a doctor warned her not to use it as an excuse to eat .
But after her daughter Sarah was born , Daniel gained back all the weight she 'd lost and then some .

Ten years later , she weighed 300 pounds and became pregnant with their second child , Mckenna .
Again , she lost weight during the pregnancy , but with the stress of having another child and running her own business , she turned to food .
By the time her youngest daughter was 10 years old , Daniel weighed 375 pounds .
" I ate all the time .
... I was stuffing my emotions , I was eating my emotions , " said Daniel .
" When I would finally get [ Mckenna ] to bed at night , I would stay up late and that was my time alone .
I tried to de-stress and wind down and I 'd watch TV and eat .
It was mindless eating . "
Mentally , something started to click and Daniel began to wonder how and why she had allowed her weight to spiral out of control .
She said there was no " lightbulb " moment or wake - up call that made her realize she 'd had enough .
For her , there was a series of events that helped her finally realize she was tired of being morbidly obese .
Watch Karen Daniel take flight to achieve a lifelong dream »
" I could n't bend over to tie my shoes , get down on the ground or fit into chairs .
Everything was hard , " said Daniel .
" You 're constantly worried about fitting on the toilet or in the shower or visiting someone 's house and [ worrying ] about breaking a chair .
It affects every minute of your life and you do n't realize it . "
As fate would have it , she saw a TV commercial for exercise equipment that was being sold at a local gym .
It was geared toward senior citizens , but Daniel saw it as a start .
When she showed up to buy it , she met the gym 's owner , Bill Crawford .
" He gave me some of his literature and told me if I needed anything or a jump - start to give him a call , " said Daniel .

When Daniel got home , she told her sister , Jan , she was thinking about hiring Crawford as her personal trainer , but she was hesitant .
Her sister asked if she would have to think twice about hiring a trainer if it were for her husband or daughters .
" She made me realize I was worth it as much as they were , " said Daniel , whose fear of failure kept her from telling people outside her family about her plans to work out .
On September 15 , 2006 , Daniel showed up for her first training session .
She was wearing a dress over her workout clothes because she refused to be seen in size 40 W pants .
" When Karen first walked in the door , she weighed 375 pounds and she could barely make it from the car to the front door , " recalled Crawford , founder of Basic Training in Phoenix , Arizona .
" I knew that just making it to the front door of a fitness center was a big deal . "
Before her first workout , Crawford took her measurements , but the tape measure was n't long enough to fit around her hips .
He needed seven more inches .
" I was 67 inches around on my butt and 65 inches tall .
So I was two inches bigger around than I was tall , " said Daniel , who had a body fat percentage of 54.60 percent .
" I also could n't fit on his scale or in some of his machines when I started . "
Crawford and Daniel improvised and she made it through her first hourlong workout .
She continued to train for one hour , three times a week and said even though she " hated every minute of it " she pushed herself .

" It was extremely hard , I 'm not gonna lie , " said Daniel .
" I could n't count down the minutes fast enough .
It was something I did not enjoy -- I was so out of breath .
I was sweaty , hot .
But as soon as I stepped out that door , it was so worth it to me because I felt so much better about what I had accomplished .
I knew I made it through one more workout .
I knew it was getting me closer to where I wanted to be . "
In addition to the one - on - one training sessions , Daniel modified her diet , eating more proteins and complex carbohydrates .
She also eliminated bread and pasta and reduced her intake of sugar , salt and processed foods .
If she craved something sweet , she ate a piece of fruit .
She cooked with olive oil instead of butter .
Just short of her one - year anniversary , she had lost 102 pounds .
Her daughters gave her a Tiffany bracelet and her sister , Jan , treated her to her first pedicure .
Crawford , her trainer , celebrated her success with a reminder .
" I had her take two 50 - pound dumbbells and walk out to the street and walk back , " recalled Crawford .
" When she got back she was exhausted and that 's the kind of weight people have to carry when they 're overweight like that . "
On her one - year anniversary , Daniel had lost 114 pounds .
By her two - year anniversary on September 15 , 2008 , she had lost 170 pounds .
Now weighing around 200 pounds , she has gone from wearing a women 's size 30 dress to a size 14 and she 's gone from wearing a double - wide shoe to a medium width .
Since losing the weight , Daniel has celebrated many milestones she never would have achieved weighing nearly 400 pounds , such as attending sporting events with her family , white - water rafting , kayaking , flying on an airplane without buying two tickets or using a seatbelt extender or simply being able to look down and see her feet .
She recently achieved one of her lifelong dreams : riding in a hot air balloon over the Arizona desert .
Today , she works out nine times a week -- doing cardio and weight training twice a day with Crawford on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
Then she does a mix of cardio and weight - resistance classes on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday .
Even though she now enjoys working out , staying on track is a constant struggle .
Daniel said losing weight has been the hardest thing she 's ever done .
" Every minute of my life was about my weight .
What I could n't do .
Things I could n't accomplish , " said Daniel , who admitted it was hard to get started .
" It 's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit .
Fit feels so good . "
What 's next for Daniel ?
She wants to lose 35 to 40 more pounds before her 48th birthday and keep adding to the list of things she wants to do to make sure she savors every moment .
Most of all , Daniel hopes to inspire others by sharing her weight - loss story on her Web site , www.ihavebones.com.
" I just wish they would take the first step , because it 's so worth it .
Your life is so much better than worrying about where you 're going to sit and how you 're going to sit .
You can actually ... enjoy life ! "

It 's not just the Transportation Security Administration , of course .
All sorts of government - mandated delays waste our time .
But since the TSA is charged with preventing another 9 - 11 situation , we Americans seem to tolerate it .
The lives supposedly saved make it all worthwhile .
Note that , before 9 - 11 , the first 75 years of US commercial air travel had no such incidents , and there was no TSA .
The fact that we have not had any more such incidents since the TSA usurped the security function from the airports and airlines needs to be weighed against history , to see if there is any subjective value to their expensive antics .
Countless articles have chronicled how bad commercial air travel has become .
Recently , The New York Times highlighted some of the TSA - inspired troubles .
Jeff Bailey 's May 21 story cites instances of crowding , bumping , and the airlines ' re-utilization of aircraft , and points out that , even with fewer people being willing to fly shorter distances ( and thus drive rather than fly ) , the airlines are approaching capacity load factors , and air travel has not only recovered from 9 - 11 , but it has grown , and is expected to continue growing .
Growth is a good thing .
Robert Browning to the contrary , more — not less — is more .
On the other hand , and quite aside from the angst caused by the TSA 's regulations and delays , there are the costs .
We know , or can calculate , many of the direct costs of the agency , from $ 400,000 office makeovers for the former director , to the costs of replacing the airport parking spaces the agency declared off - limits , to the costs of largely ineffective screening of the TSA hires .
We add the costs of the bureaucracy itself : paperwork , salaries , office space , telephones , training .
We can even estimate some of the costs of missed flights and additional parking fees incurred due to additional screening delays .
We could throw in the costs of the additional highway deaths caused by travelers who elect to drive rather than fly , and the concomitant fuel costs , pollution , tolls , and the direct costs of automobile travel .
Do n't stop there .
If we want to add a few economic costs , we can then examine the demographics of air travelers , and we will find that they are not " average " people , in terms of their economic potential .
The business travelers , especially , can safely be classified as " above - average contributors " to the economy .
Thus , their delays ( in concert with the general demographic of 9 - 11 victims ) will be disproportionately felt in the economy .
Billions of dollars of costs incurred , little realized .
It 's a lot worse than that , though .
We 're being murdered , slowly .
The TSA has increased travel time , due to its delays .
Some estimates are as high as two hours per flight .
We hear the holiday - travel warnings : " Be at the airport at least two hours before your flight ! "
The TSA did n't cause all the extra waste , but we can assign a lot of that waste to the new system .
To be kind to our ruling class , let 's call it just one extra hour of wasted time per flight .
What 's an hour , compared to 9 - 11 ?
Let 's do a little math .
There were 738 million enplanements ( 670 million domestic and 68 million international flights by US carriers ) in the United States last year , and nearly 70 % of those being leisure ( voluntary , as opposed to business or bereavement ) travel .
If the TSA wastes just 1 hour per person per flight , that 's 738 million hours .
There are 8,766 hours in an average year ( 365 times 24 , plus 6 for leap - year accrual ) .
If a newborn is expected to live another 75 years , we may assume that an " average " airline passenger is 37.5 years old , and has 37.5 years left to live .
We can also assume that a typical business traveler , being older than the average traveler , has 25 years left to live .
Turn the crank , and you can calculate the silent carnage .
Those 738 million hours lost are equivalent to the remaining lives of some 2,582 people !
Each year , the TSA 's one - hour delay , all by itself , kills the equivalent of over 80 % of the 9 - 11 victims .
Put another way , roughly every year and a half , the TSA " kills " more travelers than the four flights and all the ground victims of September 11 , 2001 .
Of course , you may disagree with my numbers .
That 's allowed ; use your own .
The argument is robust enough to withstand a lot of fiddling .
Whichever realistic numbers you use , you will see that the death toll of the TSA is anything but negligible .
We can only hope that it 's somehow worth it .
If we go another 70 years without another " 9 - 11 - type " event , we may be able to make the argument that the TSA was as useful as … nothing .
Except for the costs , of course .
