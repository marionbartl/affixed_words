Schwarzenegger : I 'll take Obama 's call ' when he 's president ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Sunday July 13 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama has great ideas on energy and the environment , and his proposals seem in line for a country hungry for change .
Meanwhile , John McCain 's campaign - trail pronouncements are at odds with his previous positions , leading voters to take what he says now with a grain of salt .
Oh yeah , and he 's OK with keeping troops in Iraq for 100 years .
This standard set of Democratic talking points received another airing Sunday in a prominent politician 's interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos .
Except this time a Democrat was n't the messenger .
It was California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , one of the most prominent members of the Republican Party and an endorser of John McCain 's presidential candidacy .
Schwarzenegger agrees with Democratic candidate Obama on energy , environmental and education issues as well as on the need for a timeline to withdraw from Iraq , but he also is friends with McCain , who gained a reputation as a maverick in the Senate although he 's been reaching out more to the right - wing base of his party .
Perhaps demonstrating a lack of confidence in his own November pick , the movie star - turned - politician said he would be willing to entertain serving in Obama 's White House " when he 's president . "
On This Week Schwarzenegger was asked about reports that Obama would consider naming him " energy czar . "
Stephanopoulos tried to pin Schwarzenegger down on the question , asking if the governor " would at least take that call " from Obama offering such a position .
" I would take his call now , I will take his call when he 's president .
Any time " Schwarzenegger said .
Perhaps realizing the pronouncement he just made , he backtracked a bit .
" Remember , no matter who is president , I do n't see this as a political thing , I see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is . "
The popular Republican governor of a solidly blue state also tried to sell McCain as more of a maverick than the candidate has been presenting himself as .
Stephanopoulos reminded Schwarzenegger of McCain 's recent endorsements of offshore drilling , and President Bush 's economic and health policies .
" What is being said on those presidential campaigns is one thing .
But what people have done in the past is something else , " Schwarzenegger said , promoting McCain as a maverick who is " interested in molding his ideas together with Democratic ideas " to find compromise .
" Sounds like you 're saying do n't listen to what he says on the campaign trail , " Stephanopoulos charged , to which Schwarzenegger insisted he just wanted to remind voters to judge McCain on his record .
Schwarzenegger seemed also to struggle in his defense of McCain when the host reminded him of his endorsement for a timeline to withdraw troops from Iraq .
He reminded viewers that McCain would n't mind not pulling out of Iraq for a century , a declaration that liberal groups and anti-war activists have hammered him over .
" I made clear that I believe in the timeline , but I said we should never leave , and just walk out the door , " Schwarzenegger said , contrasting his position with an argument that no candidate is making on the campaign trail .
" it could take years ... but I think that Sen. McCain is absolutely correct to be honest with the people and to look at them in the eye and to say , ' I can not promise you we will not have some troops in there in Iraq in many more years from now .
It could be 100 years , he said that . "
Schwarzenegger continued McCain 's argument with the caveat that the US has had troops in Germany and Japan since World War II ended in 1945 .

Partial transcript STEPHANOPOULOS : " Newsweek " reported he might want you to be his energy czar .
Would you be interested ?
SCHWARZENEGGER : I do n't think about taking on a national role .
There 's so many challenges we have in California .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
If he were president and he called ?
SCHWARZENEGGER : It 's hypothetical .
I 'm always ready to help in any way I can the United States .
I 've committed myself to be a public servant .
I said to myself , this country has given me everything .
It 's my time now , I 'm through with the acting and all of those things that I 've done , body building , even though I love all of those things still .
For me , it 's important to give something back , do my work without getting paid , and give something back .
No matter what i do .
If i have this position or not , I will be traveling around the world and I will be promoting to be energy dependent , renewables , solar , windmills , all of those things , protecting the environment , protecting the oceans .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
If he were president and he called , you would at least take that call ?
SCHWARZENEGGER : I would take his call now , I will take his call when he 's president .
Any time .
Remember , no matter who is president , I do n't see this as a political thing , I see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is .
It may not create drinking water from anything like Dean Kamen 's wonder machine , but this new so - called Klimatic Base 1 AirWater Machine does its share of inventive ( but not entirely unique ) water purifying nonetheless , with it promising to pull drinkable water out of the air .
That 's done , as you might have guessed , with the aid of an apparently standard dehumidifier , which gets paired with several filters and a UV light chamber that the company says will eliminate any bacterial content that might be in the water .
You 'll apparently even be able to get both hot and cold water from the dispenser .
There 's no word on price or availability just yet , unfortunately , and we would n't recommend trying to rig up your own with a Brita filter and the dehumidifier in your basement in the meantime either .

We have landed !
For the last two months I have been working with Mozilla on a just - in - time compiler for the JavaScript engine in Firefox , and a few hours ago this project ( codenamed TraceMonkey ) has landed in the main Firefox development tree .
TraceMonkey is a trace - based JIT compiler and it pushes the envelope on JavaScript performance .
On average , we speed up Apple ’s popular SunSpider benchmarks by factor 4.6 over the last release of Firefox .
The overall runtime of SunSpider improved by about 1.83 x ( parts of SunSpider excercise things like the regular expression engine which is outside of the scope of JIT compilation , hence the lesser overall speedup ) .
For the SunSpider ubench suite , which focuses on core JavaScript language features , we achieve a speedup of 22 x .
Whichever metric you chose to apply , Firefox now has the fastest JavaScript engine in the world .
Mike Schroepfer put together a demo showing the real - world performance impact of TraceMonkey .
You should also check out Brendan Eich ’s and Mike Shaver ’s blog post about TraceMonkey , as well as David Anderson ’s updates on our 64 - bit x86 port ( yes , we do 64 - bit ! ) .
Dynamic Compilation with Traces
Traditional just - in - time compilers ( like Sun ’s Hotspot VM ) are in their design and structure very similar to static compilers ( like GCC ) .
They observe which methods get executed frequently , and translate the method into native machine code once a certaint threshold has been reached .
While such methods often contain performance - critical parts ( such as loops ) , they often also contain slow paths and non-loopy code , which barely if at all contributes to the runtime of the method .
A whole - method compiler , however , has to always analyze and translate the entire method , even if parts of it are not particularly “ compilation - worthy ” .
Trace - based compilation takes a very different approach .
We monitor the interpretation of bytecode instruction by the virtual machine and scan for frequently taken backwards branches , which are an indicator for loops in the underlying program .
Once we identify such a loop start point , we follow the interpreter as it executes the program and record the sequence of bytecode instructions that get executed along the way .
Since we start at a loop header , the interpreter will eventually return to this entry point once it completed an iteration through the loop .
The resulting linear sequence of instructions is what we call a trace .
Traces represent a single iteration through a loop , and can span multiple methods and program modules .
If a function is invoked from inside a loop , we follow the function call and inline the instructions executed inside the called method .
Function calls themselves are never actually recorded .
We merely verify at runtime that the same conditions that caused that function to be activated still hold .
Trace Trees and Nested Trace Trees
TraceMonkey uses a particular flavor of trace - based compilation which I described in my dissertation : Trace Trees .
Loops often consist of more than a single performance - relevant path , and Trace Trees allow to capture all of these and organize them in a tree - shaped data structure which can be compiled trace - by - trace yet produces a globally optimized result for the entire loop .
To deal with nested loop , these trees can also be nested inside of each other , with outer loop trees calling the inner loop tree .
A particular advantage of Trace Trees is the fact that they always represent a loop and thus enter function frame and leave function frame operations are always balanced as long we stay on trace .
Thus , we can actually completely optimize away the overhead of function calls .
As long we stay on trace ( which in case of a loop we usually do for many iterations ) , we do n’t construct and destroy function frames .
Instead , we simply execute the inlined trace we recorded .
Function frames for inlined calls are only constructed should we detect that we have to leave the trace ( for example because we reached the end of the loop ) .
Type Specialization
Trace
Trees by their very nature are the result of a control - flow speculation .
We speculate that loops tend to execute the same sequence of instructions over and over , which is usually true for many applications .
In TraceMonkey we go a step further and also speculate on types .
JavaScript in contrast to Java or C/ C++ is a dynamically typed language .
Variables are declared by name only , and their type will be determined automatically once a value is assigned to them .
Assigning values with different types to a variable changes the type of the variable on the fly to match the new value ’s type .
Executing such dynamically typed code has been traditionally fairly expensive .
Type specialization eliminates much of this overhead .
Mike Shaver ran some benchmarks , comparing the performance of simple loops written in JavaScript and C .
Our JIT generates code that is roughly equivalent to the performance of unoptimized C code ( gcc - O0 ) .
We achieve this through aggressive type speculation .
Whenever we see a program assign only integers to a variable , for example , we specialize the generated machine code to hold that variable in an integer machine register .
Guards in the traces ensure that the type does n’t unexpectedly change , in which case we leave the trace and let the interpreter handle this ( unexpected and often infrequent ) case .
Type specialization removes much of the principal overhead associated with dynamically typed languages , and as we further improve our JIT we expect to get fairly close to the performance of statically typed languages such as Java or C .
Traces Everywhere
Our work on TraceMonkey was done in close collaboration with Adobe ’s Tamarin Tracing project .
In fact , TraceMonkey and Tamarin Tracing share the same core tracing backend ( nanojit ) , which was contributed by Adobe .
Adobe has been criticized in the last few month for the slow performance of Tamarin Tracing on untyped JavaScript code .
However , Tamarin Tracing is first and foremost a JIT compiler for ActionScript , a typed JavaScript dialect .
While Tamarin Tracing does run untyped code , its not particularly optimized ( yet ) for this task .
TraceMonkey shows the full potential of Adobe ’s nanojit backend when combined with a VM that was specifically designed and optimized for untyped JavaScript code ( SpiderMonkey ) , and we expect much of our work to make its way into nanojit and Tamarin Tracing .
People
TraceMonkey was a tremendous group effort of a large group of extremely talented people .
Much of the recent advances in the area of nested trees , aggressive type speculation and runtime type inference are based on work done by graduate students at our research group at UC Irvine ( Michael Bebenita , Mason Chang , Marcelo Contra , Gregor Wagner and others ) .
Our research was generously funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation ( Principal Investigator Professor Michael Franz , Program Director Dr. Helen Gill ) as well as grants and donations from Microsoft , Sun Microsystems , Intel , and last but not least Mozilla .
For me , it has been an amazing opportunity to spend the last two month here at Mozilla , turning our research ideas into actual product code .
Its hard to describe what it feels like to work alongside people like Brendan Eich , the inventor of JavaScript , or Mike Shaver , Mozilla ’s new VP Engineering and life - long JavaScript VM veteran .
And even interns around here are rocket scientists .
David Anderson , one of Mozilla ’s interns , wrote a complete 64 - bit backend for us over the summer , making TraceMonkey the first JavaScript JIT capable of targeting x86 - 64 .
TraceMonkey was developed in close collaboration with Edwin Smith and his Tamarin Tracing team at Adobe , and the web at large owes Adobe a great deal of gratitude for open - sourcing the Tamarin and Tamarin Tracing VMs , allowing Mozilla to build TraceMonkey on top of Tamarin Tracing ’s nanojit backend .
nanojit is a small and highly efficient trace - based just - in - time compiler backend that is language agnostic and highly portable , and I think it has a bright future .
It has just landed in Firefox , and hopefully we will see it pop up in a future release of Adobe ’s Flash Player soon .
The Road Ahead
Landing in the central Firefox repository was a big step for us , but there is also definitively a lot of work ahead of us .
We are now at the point where we trace a lot of code in benchmarks and on the web , but there is a lot more coverage we will add over time .
Also , we are far away from having exhausted all the potential of trace compilation and we plan to add many features and optimizations over the next few month .
Our current speedups are just the beginning of whats possible :
Improve register allocation and code generation in nanojit .
Runtime analysis of builtins ( machine code ) to reduce spill overhead of builtin calls ( Gregor Wagner from UCI did some work on this recently . )
Bring performance of the ARM backend up to par with x86 and x86 - 64 backends and add a PowerPC backend ( joint work with Adobe ) .
Add tree - recompilation and parallel compilation ( based on our prior work on Parallel Dynamic Compilation , Mohammad Haghighat from Intel has been looking into this for nanojit ) .
Add more advanced trace optimization techniques like Tree Folding , Load Propagation and Escape Analysis .
Our goal is to eventually close the performance gap between JavaScript and traditional desktop languages , and we believe that for many applications this will be possible .
In parallel to our work with Mozilla on JavaScript performance , we also have a number of exciting tracing - related projects going on at UC Irvine .
Mason Chang , one of our graduate students , is currently working with Adobe on the Tamarin Tracing VM , adding context threading and trace visualisation .
Michael Bebenita from UCI is currently interning with Sun Microssystems and has been making great progress integrating our Java trace compiler into Maxine , and we plan on switching to Maxine as our main research platform for Java compilation .
Alexander Yermolovich ( also UC Irvine ) is working with Adobe this summer on an exciting project involving fast execution of rich dynamic content that Adobe will hopefully announce to the public soon .
If you are interested in their work , check out their blogs ( linked from my website ) .
For further reading material on traces and trace compilation you can also take a log at my earlier blog posts on this topic .
Update : Mason Chang did some benchmarks comparing TraceMonkey to Apple ’s WebKit / Squirrel Fish VM .
Looks like we are on average 2.5 x faster than Squirrel Fish ( about 15 % faster on total runtime ) .
I am looking for a tenure - track faculty position for Fall 2009 to continue my research on virtual machines , dynamic compilation and type - safe languages .
Moisturisers used by millions every day may be increasing the risk of common skin cancers , scientists have warned .
Most such creams have never been tested for their cancer - causing effect on the skin .
Now scientists have found that they increase the carcinogenic effect of sunlight in mice .
The skin cancers involved are common in humans .
Although mostly non-fatal and easily removed , deaths do occur , especially from squamous cell cancers .
These are distinct from melanoma , the less common form of skin cancer , which causes over 1,000 deaths a year in the UK but was not the subject of the research .

Experiments on mice had shown that when caffeine was given orally or applied direct to the skin , it appeared to inhibit cancer .
Scientists at Rutgers University , New Jersey , planned to test caffeine as a cancer preventive in humans by adding it to a common moisturiser , Dermabase .
Before starting the study they decided to test Dermabase 's carcinogenic activity .
To their surprise , they found that it increased the production of tumours in mice that had previously been exposed to ultraviolet light .
They then tested three other common moisturisers , all of which increased the production of tumours by an average of 69 per cent .
The significance of the findings for humans has still to be established , the team reports in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology .

By the time Bush and Cheney were making their ludicrous statements , the FBI knew the anthrax mailed to media outlets was a military strain .
Osama and crew “ could n’t go from box cutters one week to weapons - grade anthrax the next , ” an ex-FBI official told the Daily News .
It was another example of sloppy work on the part of the neocons to blame Muslims and add fodder to their total war campaign .
As the Daily News reported over the weekend , neocons in the Bush White House repeatedly put pressure on FBI Director Robert Mueller to “ prove ” the 2001 anthrax attacks was the work of Osama bin Laden and his cave dwelling terrorists , an impossible task at best due to the fact the anthrax used in the attacks was a weaponized strain produced by the U.S. military .
“ After the Oct. 5 , 2001 , death from anthrax exposure of Sun photo editor Robert Stevens , Mueller was ‘ beaten up ’ during President Bush ’s morning intelligence briefings for not producing proof the killer spores were the handiwork of terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden , according to a former aide , ” James Gordon Meek writes for the New York Daily News .
“ They really wanted to blame somebody in the Middle East , ” a retired senior FBI official told the newspaper .
Bush and Cheney lamely attempted to pin the attack on al - Qaeda and its lap dance loving jihadists .
“ There may be some possible link ” to Bin Laden , Bush declared on October 15 , 2001 .
Cheney said Osama ’s cave dwellers were trained “ how to deploy and use these kinds of substances , so you start to piece it all together . ”
Bush and Cheney did not bother to explain how distant terrorists , supposedly living in remote caves in one of the most backward regions on the planet , managed to get their hands on a bioweapon substance manufactured at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
By the time Bush and Cheney were making their ludicrous statements , the FBI knew the anthrax mailed to media outlets was a military strain .
Osama and crew “ could n’t go from box cutters one week to weapons - grade anthrax the next , ” an ex-FBI official told the Daily News .
As international law expert and former Bush Senior bioweapons advisor Francis A. Boyle told Alex Jones last year , the New York Times revealed that the anthrax used in the letters sent to Democrat senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy was highly sophisticated , produced by “ special electro - static treatment …
This is superweapons - grade anthrax that even the United States government , in its openly proclaimed programs , had never developed before .
So it was obvious to me that this was from a U.S. government lab . ”
And yet Cheney and Bush expected the American people to believe it was cooked up by goat herders in Afghanistan .
As should expected , the Daily News — owned by neocon Mortimer Zucker , connected to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy — and the rest of the corporate media refuse to put two and two together .
“ After the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the Bush Administration tried to ram the USA PATRIOT Act through Congress , ” Boyle told Jones .
“ Senators Tom Daschle ( D - South Dakota ) and Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) were holding it up because they realized what this would lead to .
The first draft of the PATRIOT
Act would have suspended the writ of habeas corpus [ which protects citizens from unlawful imprisonment and guarantees due process of law ] .
Then all of a sudden , out of nowhere , come these anthrax attacks . ”
Now we are expected to believe the secrets of the anthrax attacks died with Dr. Bruce E. Ivins , the Army scientist who allegedly committed suicide after it was reported that he was likely to be charged in the attacks .
FBI “ investigators had an array of indirect evidence that they argue strongly implicates Dr. Ivins in the attacks , ” reports the New York Times .
“ That evidence includes tracing the prestamped envelopes used in the attacks to stock sold in three Maryland post offices , including one in Frederick , frequented by Dr. Ivins , who had long rented a post office box there under an assumed name , the source said .
The evidence also includes records of the scientist ’s extensive after - hours use of his lab at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases around the time the letters were mailed , the source said . ”
Now that Mr. Ivins is dead and cannot defend himself , “ evidence ” against him “ might be made public as early as Wednesday , if the bureau could persuade a federal judge to unseal the evidence and if agents could brief survivors of the anthrax attacks and family members of those who died . ”
Implication of Ivins follows a settlement in June with Dr. Steven J. Hatfill , who was falsely accused of launching the attacks .
Even if the government successfully blames Ivins , this will not change the fact the attacks came at precisely the time the neocons were ramming their police state legislation through Congress and letter recipients Daschle and Leahy were acting as bulwarks against it .
The FBI may facilitate the government ’s attempt to pin the blame on a dead scientist and the corporate media may declare the case closed , but this will not put to rest troubling questions the corporate media will not touch with a ten foot pole .

Some enterprising finance workers are finding their own solution to the growing banking crisis , judging by a spate of recent federal indictments : using their access to bank computers to plunder accounts .
Missouri Citibank employee Brandon
Wyatt was charged last week with identity theft for a scheme that allegedly began in January 2006 , and continued until late last month .
Wyatt is accused of tapping Citibank 's computers for customer information , then using it to set up checking accounts online with competing banks , including Bank of America , Washington Mutual and AmTrust .
Wyatt allegedly wire transferred customer funds from Citibank to the new accounts , then cashed them out with additional transfers , checks , debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals .
His take , according to federal prosecutors in St. Louis , was at least $ 380,000 .
Two employees of an investment company in Indianapolis allegedly took a more indirect route to riches .
Nyteria Redding and Raquel Vaughn are accused of grabbing customer information like names , addresses , Social Security numbers and dates - of - birth from their employer 's computers , and passing it to Redding 's boyfriend , one Nathan Green .
Green then allegedly paid lackeys to fill out credit card applications using the information – changing the addresses to abandoned houses with accessible mailboxes .
Green wound up with a cumulative credit line of over $ 1.4 million from 129 credit cards in the scam , according to federal prosecutors in South Bend .
In all , 581 customers of the unnamed investment firm had their information stolen from August 2005 through March 2006 .
Seven people were indicted last week for identity theft and conspiracy .
Similarly , two Chicago temp workers at the investment management firm Computershare apparently decided the company 's customers owned too much Comcast stock .
Alleged mastermind Lester Swims and coworker Mark Kramer supposedly used their inside access to dump over $ 700,000 from 67 trading accounts , routing at least some of the cash - out checks to themselves .
Court records do n't indicate what Swims had against Comcast – one suspects he was short selling the cable giant on the side .
The scheme ran from July through September of last year .
After complaints started coming into Computershare , agents with the U.S. Postal Inspector found incriminating evidence in Kramer 's trash , and both men were indicted Tuesday in federal court in Chicago .
If you 're staring to despair that only insiders can make it big in fraud , never fear .
Miami man Adolphus Emercheta was indicted last week for allegedly setting up online bank accounts for Washington Mutual customers and transferring a few thousand dollars from their home equity credit accounts ; there 's no indication that Emercheta worked for the bank .
And Paven Voleti , a Tennessee man , was charged with reprogramming blank credit cards with stolen Discover card data .
He did n't work at a bank , though the Secret Service did find an ATM in his house .

What will you do if you win Wednesday night ’s Powerball draw for $ 176 million ( $ 89 million lump sum , minus taxes ) ?
Over the 10 years I ’ve been interviewing big lottery winners , I ’ve talked to quite a few very YOUNG winners .
And I ’ve always wondered ( since I play too ) …. if I had won a million dollar lottery while I was at college , would I have finished my degree or started living it up ?
A reporter in England for the Guardian newspaper asked that question to some UK National Lottery winners and I thought their responses were interesting .
Not surprising , but interesting .
If money were no object , how would you choose to spend your time ?
It ’s the question student Sarah Cockings had to answer after she scooped $ 5.5 million ( more than 3 million pounds ) winning the National Lottery .
At the time she was studying at Northumbria University to become a social worker .
Two days after winning the lottery , Cockings , began work experience at a children ’s home .
But when she told a manager at the home about her big win , he told her to “ grab your bag and get yourself home . ”
And that ’s exactly what she did .
Cockings began doing modeling and media work after her windfall , but it took up so much time that she decided to quit her degree .
“ I ’m going to start a dog grooming course at a college at the end of September , ” said Cockings , who has two dogs of her own .
Her long - term goal is to open her own grooming parlour .
With her winnings , Cockings also bought herself a five bedroom home , her parents a four - bedroom house and splashed out on luxury holidays to exotic destinations including Fiji .
Karam Ezzideen , 23 , won $ 100,000 in the lottery while studying for a master ’s in film and video at the University of Glamorgan .
Before winning on the lottery in February , Ezzideen , had a film idea he was itching to make and so shortly after his win he quit the course to focus on making it .
“ It has the potential to be a feature - length film , ” Ezzideen said .
Both winners stated the obvious : that winning the lottery took away their financial stresses .
Hopefully , they are also wise enough to have a financial plan that will serve them well and make their money work for them .
Despite her big win , Cockings still plays the lottery .
So what advice does she have for other students who play the lottery ?
“ To win you ’ve got to be positive and expect to win .
I was always hopeful of winning and then I did . ”
“ You ’ve got to say to yourself , Yeah these numbers are the big ones . ”
It ’s called the power of positive thinking .
IN THE MONEY :
Tuesday night ’s Mega Millions jackpot is $ 15 million .
Wednesday night ’s Powerball draw offers the biggest jackpot currently being offered in the world , $ 176 million .
If you choose the lump sum , you ’ll take home $ 89 million , minus taxes .
Good luck .
TIJUANA , Mexico ( Reuters ) - A decade ago , economists hailed Tijuana as a place where cheap Mexican labor and U.S. financing could meet , attracting Asian firms eager to set up manufacturing plants to export to the United States .

Now , that vision is slipping away , a victim of drug violence that has been exploding this side of the U.S. - Mexico border for the past three years .
Once a freewheeling city that has served Americans cheap tequila since the U.S. prohibition era , Tijuana is at the center of a three - way drug war between rival gangs and Mexico ’s military .
Drug -related murders are a daily occurrence .
The violence is scaring away tourists who came for everything from prostitutes and dental work to medicine .
A lively artistic community is also dwindling .
While most assembly - for - export businesses , or maquiladoras , continue to operate normally , drug violence is such that they risk losing new investment to competitors like China .
Other businesses are seeing their livelihoods disappear .
Just a few years ago , downtown Tijuana was bustling and the main drag , Revolution Avenue , was a busy thoroughfare .
But today , it is deserted , lined with “ For Sale ” and “ For Rent ” signs .
“ Many big companies are pulling out and many small companies are going bankrupt .
Business is n’t enough to even pay the rent for the shops and factory space , ” said Manuel Cesena , 57 , who owns a shoe shop on Revolution Avenue .
Cesena , who has seen his sales fall fivefold since 2005 , said it is crucial for him to end his day before nightfall or face being robbed or kidnapped .
After 30 years in the shoe business and exporting to the United States , Cesena is considering closing for good .
DEATH TOLL RISES
More than 1,000 people have died so far this year across Mexico in battles between drug gangs and security forces , the highest murder rate since bloodshed escalated in 2006 .
Tijuana is one of the most violent cities in Mexico .
A group of gangs from the Pacific state of Sinaloa have set out to destroy the Tijuana ’s Arellano Felix cartel and to take over lucrative smuggling routes into California .

The feud between the Sinaloans and the Arellano Felix gang has not only scared away tourist dollars .
Business people face daily telephone threats of extortion .
Kidnappings to finance narco gangs have jumped this year , creating a climate of fear and scaring away new investment .
“ Those of us who remain only stay because we have properties we do n’t want to leave .
We are very afraid and have to be careful not to get kidnapped , ” said Andres Mendez , 46 , who runs an arts and crafts business in downtown Tijuana .
In Tijuana this year , drug gangs have killed more than 200 people , with cartel hitmen and soldiers spraying bullets on busy city avenues , outside shops , schools and kindergartens .
Seventeen drug hitmen were killed in a shooting in April .
Even children have been murdered .
“ Overcoming this insecurity is the single biggest issue for Tijuana right now , ” said Jorge Cruz , a business leader in the city ’s maquiladora industry .
In March , a plant in Tijuana assembling Panasonic electrical goods for export closed with the loss of 3,000 jobs .
Plant managers declined to comment on the closure , but a city official said insecurity was a big factor .
Days before the Panasonic closure , soldiers in Tijuana made one of the biggest arms seizures in Mexico after raiding a house , uncovering grenade launchers , machine guns and other weapons encrusted with golden images of skulls .
LOST OPPORTUNITY
The exodus of businesses is painful for Tijuana , as many people had high hopes that it could move beyond its seedy roots and become a key trade , manufacturing and service center , given its proximity to the United States .
But a dozen local building companies closed over the past year , putting infrastructure development on hold .
“ Many were sick of the threats of kidnapping and extortion , ” said Sebastian Lanz , who heads a group representing local construction companies .
Tijuana hoped to position itself as a car and truck manufacturing center by attracting Chinese - owned automakers and setting up a rail link from plants to the border .
But the project collapsed , largely because of insecurity .
Some business owners who have chosen to keep operating in Tijuana have moved to live over the border in San Diego and only cross back into Mexico with bodyguards .
One prominent restaurant chain owner said he had swapped his flashy sports utility vehicle for a beaten - up sedan .
“ I call it my antikidnap vehicle .
It is the way not to attract attention , ” said the businessman , who asked for anonymity for the sake of his safety .
Mexico ’s federal government says it is doing everything it can to restore security to Tijuana and other cities in Baja California , one of Mexico ’s most violent states .
Since January last year , thousands of troops patrol Tijuana ’s streets and highways , and are engaged in a daily battle to destroy the Arellano Felix and Sinaloa drug cartels and clean up the corrupt police forces that ally with them .
But winning the fight will not be easy .
As the Arellano Felix cartel weakens , the gang is increasingly relying on kidnapping and extortion .
A bid to introduce closed - circuit televisions in the city has meanwhile failed , as gangs sabotaged cameras and corrupt police switched them off to allow crimes to be committed .
Domestic demand for imports fell in March by the most since 2001 , the latest indication that the economic slowdown has forced Americans to rein in their spending habits , the government reported Friday .
Americans shied away from buying imported automobiles , with sales down 9.3 percent in March , and oil , which dropped 8.9 percent .
With oil prices rising , the March dip in oil imports was expected to be temporary .
Declines were reported in a variety of other goods , ranging from clothing to toys and furniture .
At the same time , exports decreased for the first time in 12 months , a troubling sign for American businesses struggling with a pullback among domestic consumers .
Foreign purchases have helped prop up the American economy amid the current slowdown .
MEDICAL examinations of former terrorism suspects held at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay found evidence of torture and other abuse that resulted in serious injuries and mental disorders , a human rights group says .
For the most extensive medical study of former US detainees yet published , Physicians for Human Rights had doctors and mental health professionals examine 11 former prisoners .
The group alleges it found evidence of torture and war crimes and accuses US military health professionals of allowing the abuse of detainees , denying them medical care and providing confidential medical information to interrogators that they then exploited .
" Some of these men really are , several years later , very severely scarred , " said Barry Rosenfeld , a psychology professor at Fordham University who conducted psychological tests on six of the 11 detainees .
One Iraqi prisoner , identified only as Yasser , reported being subjected to electric shocks three times and being sodomised with a stick .
His thumbs bore round scars consistent with shocking , according to the report obtained by the Associated Press .
International forces have been involved in a series of controversies
At least 13 Afghan police and civilians have died in two incidents involving international forces , officials say .
Four Afghan police and five civilians died in an apparently mistaken air strike by international coalition forces in Farah province .
Separately , the Nato - led Isaf said it had " accidentally " killed at least four civilians in Paktika province .
The incidents are the latest in a series of controversial clashes involving foreign troops .
They come as US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is in Afghanistan as part of an overseas tour .
Mr Obama , who wants to increase US troop levels in Afghanistan , was due to meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday .
Mr Karzai has said no civilian casualty is acceptable .
' Mistaken identity '
The BBC's Martin Patience , in Kabul , says there was darkness and much confusion when the Farah province fighting took place in the early hours of Sunday morning .
The police had opened fire on a joint convoy of Afghan national army and foreign troops believing - incorrectly - that they were Taleban fighters .
The deputy governor of Farah province , Younus Rasuli , said the foreign troops had not informed police they were coming .
On hearing the gunfire , a number of locals had rushed to support the police , our correspondent says .
Nato and US coalition officials are investigating the reports .
In Paktika province , Isaf said at least four and possibly as many as seven civilians had been killed when one of its units fired two mortar rounds which landed about 1 km from their intended target .
" ISAF deeply regrets this accident , and an investigation as to the exact circumstances of this tragic event is now underway , " it said in a statement .
Series of incidents
The issue of civilian casualties at the hands of foreign forces is a hugely sensitive issue in Afghanistan .
In the past , the Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that no civilian casualty is acceptable .
Last week , local tribal elders claimed dozens of people , including civilians , died in a Nato - led attack in Herat province , though Nato strongly denied this .
Earlier US forces admitted killing eight civilians in Farah province after they were attacked in Bakwa district .
And on 6 July , more than 50 people from an Afghan wedding party were said to have been killed after being bombed by US aircraft in the eastern province of Nangarhar .

Ruby 1.9
Fibers are touted as lightweight concurrency elements that are much lighter than threads .
I have noticed a sizbale impact when I was benchmarking an application that made heavy use of fibers .
So I wondered what If I switched to threads instead ?
After some time fighting with threads I decided I needed to write something specific for this comparison .
I have written a small application that would spawn a number of fibers ( or threads ) and then would return the time went into this operation .
I also recorded the VM size after the operation ( all created fibers and threads are still reachable , hence , no garbage collection ) .
I did not measure the cost of context switching for both approaches , may be in another time .
Here are the results for creation time :
And the results for memory usage : ConclusionFibers are much faster to create than threads , they eat much less memory too .
There is also a limit on the number of threads for 1.9 as I maxed on 3070 threads while fibers were not complaining when I created 100,000 of them ( but they took 203 seconds and occuppied a whoping 500 MB of RAM ) .
Depth of evidence presented in brand new 9/11 truth film buries official story for good
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Friday , August 29 , 2008
Fabled Enemies is a departure from every other 9/11 truth film released so far .
It comes off as more of a spy thriller than a mere conspiracy romp .
With tight editing , slick presentation , and sublimely complimentary backing music , the documentary draws the viewer in for an eminently watchable experience .
The film begins by revealing how in the very hours after 9/11 , Osama bin Laden ’s conviction of guilt in the court of public opinion was assured simply by constant repetition in the news media , and how the fairytale of 19 hijackers with box cutters began to unravel .
The film does not try to invent an alternative scenario behind what really happened on 9/11 , it expertly demolishes the official version by concentrating on how Bin Laden ’s network was protected every step of the way by higher - ups and the hijackers issued visas while good FBI agents like Robert Wright attempted to penetrate the wider plot but were blocked from doing so .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The treatment of Anthony Shaffer , who attempted to inform the 9/11 Commission about Able Danger , an intelligence program that identified the hijackers before 9/11 , highlights precisely why the Commission was a set - up from the very beginning .
Shaffer and his team were gagged and slandered and the vital information they had passed on was ignored and buried .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The murky and mysterious connections of Israeli citizens , who were later connected to gargantuan spy rings , detained on 9/11 and their links to the attacks are then explored in detail , including the strange reports of truck bombs and bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge , aspects of 9/11 that are key yet have been largely sidelined by previous 9/11 truth films .
The evidence presented in the movie painfully underscores the damage that the United States ’ alliance with Israel is proliferating , highlighted nowhere more starkly than Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu ’s bold admission that the 9/11 attacks were good for Israel and continue to benefit the Zionist state .
“ 9/11 was an international intelligence operation , ” avers producer Jason Bermas , “ that included role players within our own government as well as the governments of Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and Israel .
Each played a compartmentalized role in order to create a climate of fear and confusion . ”
Fabled Enemies painstakingly delves into known and little known minutiae of this international intelligence operation to provide an overview of what is certainly the largest and most audacious false flag attack in American history .
Other aspects of events on that day which even seasoned 9/11 truthers might be unaware of are also explored , including the strange case of Flight 23 , a transcontinental flight that raised red flags because of Middle Eastern passengers who were behaving oddly and were asked to leave the plane before take - off .
When they refused and armed police were sent to deal with the situation , the men simply vanished , strongly suggesting they had the support of people with access to secure areas of the airport and runway , a pattern observed in the other hijackings .
The film also tackles in depth the numerous wargames that took place which coincided with the 9/11 attacks , along with the threat to Air Force One and questions how the terrorists could have obtained secure codes and security procedures for a raft of sensitive U.S. government agencies without help from the inside .
Finally , the film explores the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 and the possible motives for why this building had to be destroyed on 9/11 , as well as the suspicious anthrax attacks and their connections to the U.S. government and military institutions .
In summary , Jason Bermas has produced a 9/11 film to rank up there with the very best .
The strength of the evidence presented stands alone and conclusively debunks the official version of 9/11 as nothing more than a paper - thin work of fiction .
The depth of information presented in Fabled Enemies is enough to sway even a hardened skeptic , and the movie should be held up as a shining beacon and the very best that the 9/11 truth movement has to offer .

Comment on this article
Pro-Obama bias and soft - focus hagiographies of the candidate are such common tropes that they ’ve been lampooned by Saturday Night Live and the Onion .
During the Democratic primaries , it was clear that the press was more enamored of Barack Obama than of Hillary Clinton .
But similar assumptions about media coverage of the general election — that its bears traces of Nixon vs. Kennedy , with the press giving the mediagenic Obama a pass and training its guns on the stodgy , less PR - savvy John McCain — may be off the mark .
George Mason University 's Center for Media and Public Affairs , which has previously released studies touted by conservative commentators to bolster their accusations of a liberal media bias , has just published new evidence of a mainstream media bias against Barack Obama .
( Liberal bloggers gripe that these same conservative commentators might “ accidentally not notice ” the new report . )
The study ’s author is Robert Lichter , a Fox News contributor who authored the aforementioned reports alleging a liberal media bias .
But now he finds that when anchors and reporters on the big three networks ventured opinions about Obama , “ 28 percent of the statements were positive for Obama and 72 percent negative , ” with a much narrower margin for McCain .
And that ’s not even taking into account Fox News ’ more brazenly biased Obama coverage .
Meanwhile , the Tyndall Report states that Obama has received more than twice as much network airtime as McCain , but James Rainey of the L.A .
Times points out that while such airtime may be ample , it ’s not always favorable — just cast your mind back to the Jeremiah Wright “ scandal . ”
Rainey also echoes an old but probably accurate explanation for Lichter ’s findings :
News organs are concerned about being accused of liberal bias by the Hannitys and O’Reillys of the world , so they swing too far to the other extreme .

Rogue Government
August 7 , 2008
The Department of Homeland Security is moving towards implementing a provision of the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2007 otherwise known as the thought crimes bill .
This is despite the fact that the legislation has not been signed into law .
The House version of the bill HR 1955 was passed by a margin of 404 - 6 where as the Senate version of the bill S 1959 is still awaiting action .
One of the bill ’s provisions gives the Department of Homeland Security the authority to fund a University based Center of Excellence to study ways to thwart what the government believes are extremist belief systems and radical ideologies of individual Americans .
Another words , if the government does n’t like the way you think , they are going to have teams of social scientists and behavioral experts trying to figure out the best way to deal with you .
As it turns out , the Department of Homeland Security is already funding a Center of Excellence to study thought criminals in the United States at the University of Maryland .
This shows that it does n’t matter if S 1959 is defeated or not , as they are moving forward with this agenda with or without Congressional approval .
In reality , Congress is nothing more than a staged circus to make people falsely believe that they actually have a say in what the government does .
The Department of Homeland Security is funding research to setup an Orwellian system to deal with political dissenters under the guise of fighting terrorism and they care not if it is in accordance with what the people want .
Another words , be prepared for the possibility of a future with re-education camps as a real life Ministry of Love system is implemented .
The following is taken from Security Products Online detailing the Department of Homeland Security ’s funding of this Center of Excellence that will study thought crimes or as they like to call it the threat of homegrown terrorism and violent radicalization .
A team of more than 50 social scientists , armed with new federal funding , will extend its research into radicalization and the formation of terrorist groups in the United States and abroad .
The researchers will also study the effectiveness of counter - terror strategies , as well as efforts to build community resilience to attacks .
Now , let ’s take a look at section 899D of HR 1955 and we ’ll see that what ’s proposed in the bill has for all intents and purposes already become a reality .
`SEC .
899D . CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE STUDY OF VIOLENT RADICALIZATION AND HOMEGROWN TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES .
` (a ) Establishment -
The Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish or designate a university - based Center of Excellence for the Study of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism in the United States ( hereinafter referred to as ` Center ’ ) following the merit - review processes and procedures and other limitations that have been previously established for selecting and supporting University Programs Centers of Excellence .
The Center shall assist Federal , State , local and tribal homeland security officials through training , education , and research in preventing violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism in the United States .
In carrying out this section , the Secretary may choose to either create a new Center designed exclusively for the purpose stated herein or identify and expand an existing Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence so that a working group is exclusively designated within the existing Center of Excellence to achieve the purpose set forth in subsection ( b ) .
`(b ) Purpose -
It shall be the purpose of the Center to study the social , criminal , political , psychological , and economic roots of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism in the United States and methods that can be utilized by Federal , State , local , and tribal homeland security officials to mitigate violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism .
`(c ) Activities -
In carrying out this section , the Center shall –
` ( 1 ) contribute to the establishment of training , written materials , information , analytical assistance and professional resources to aid in combating violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism ;
` ( 2 ) utilize theories , methods and data from the social and behavioral sciences to better understand the origins , dynamics , and social and psychological aspects of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism ;
` (3 ) conduct research on the motivational factors that lead to violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism ; and
` ( 4 ) coordinate with other academic institutions studying the effects of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism where appropriate .
The Department of Homeland Security is providing roughly $ 12 Million over 3 years to fund this research .
Among the planned research includes building a database of U.S. extremist crime , studying how social networks spread thought crime , tracking sympathy and support for terrorism in the United States among various communities , studying the phony European white Al - Qaeda threat and much more .
The government has no business funding research studying the political beliefs of people and determining who may or may not be a potential terrorist based upon a vague definition of homegrown terrorism and violent radicalization .
In fact , the definitions of these terms as defined in HR 1955 and S 1959 are up to the interpretation of the government .
This means that a homegrown terrorist could potentially be anybody the government does n’t like .
Not only is it unconstitutional , but it opens up the flood gates for a tyranny only theorized in novels like George Orwell ’s 1984 .
The social scientists that are being funded in this program could potentially suggest the implementation of programs that could include the round up of people for re-education based upon any sort of criteria even if no real crime has been committed .
Literally , the Department of Homeland Security is funding research to go after people who have political beliefs and ideologies that are contrary to the agenda of the establishment .
Unfortunately for the American people , they are employing the services of some very smart people to do this .
Who knows what these people will come up with but considering what they ’ve already done , it wo n’t be in the best interest of freedom .
In the Soviet Union , political dissidents and intellectuals were labeled crazy and put in mental institutions or slave labor camps .
Could the same thing happen in the United States ?
After these scientists finish their research , it very well could considering what we see with the militarization of police and growing technological spy grid here in the United States .
How can we assume that their recommendations will defend liberty when everything else the government has done in order to fight this phony terror threat has been contrary to the principles of freedom ?
Particularly interesting is how they are concerned about activity on the Internet .
Many freedom oriented radio networks and web sites have been formed over the past decade to protest what is becoming an increasingly corrupt and criminal government .
The free flow of information is a real threat to the establishment and they are scrambling for ways to determine how to put the lid on it .
In closing , it is disturbing that the Department of Homeland Security would fund a program before a bill authorizing the action is signed into law .
The provisions in the thought crimes bill represent the potential for total despotism and tyranny and even if a few of the provisions are implemented like this Center for Excellence funding , it marks a severe threat for liberty .
These government terrorists must be defeated and there needs to be an investigation into the funding of this research which is unconstitutional on its face .

Ten Ireland Tips [ Jul. 23rd , 2008 | 12:14 pm ] jofish22
My friend Caitlin is currently travelling around Ireland .
Because of this , I felt I should give her some advice on how to behave , and I thought that other readers might find this useful .
Ireland is becoming an increasingly common location for Americans to visit on holidays .
Ireland is a land seeped in culture , and as such it 's important to be aware of social norms as so not to offend .
The following advice should improve the experience of any American visiting Ireland .
1 . It is seen as very rude not to greet people you meet in the street before noon with " Top o ' the morning to you ! "
It 's also polite to tip your hat to people at the same time , or , if not wearing one , to gently pat your forehead as a substitute .
2 . It is also very rude to leave a social gathering , such as being in a pub , without explaining why you 're going .
It is also appropriate to invite others to leave for the same reason at the same time .
Of course , it 's also important to use the right terms .
The following are all acceptable reasons :
- Going for a nap , or " wank "
- Going out for a snack , or " a shag "
- Going for some fresh air , or " a snog "
So for example , you might say " Well , I 'm going to pop around the corner for a shag .
Back in five minutes .
Anyone want to join me ? "
3 . The term " leprechaun " has come to mean " a real , true Irishman " .
As in " So you were born and bred in Dublin ?
You 're a real leprechaun , eh ? "
4. Ireland 's nickname , " The Emerald Isle " , is because of the large number of emeralds that are found in mountains and in streams across the land .
It 's perfectly acceptable and shows respect for Ireland 's heritage to stop by any body of water and " look for emeralds " , even briefly .
5 . Ireland 's growing economy became known as " The Celtic Tiger " .
To show your enthusiasm for Ireland 's economy , you should respond " Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ! " whenever anyone says that phrase .
6 . Dubliners like to think of their city as being small and intimate , despite its size .
They will appreciate you pointing out its village - like nature , and the way that , unlike other capital cities , it has a rustic charm without being contaminated by a sense of being international and cosmopolitan .
7 . If travelling around the country , you will encounter several different local stouts , including Beamish in Galway and Murphy 's in Cork .
Needless to say , these are imitations of the Dublin - based Guinness , and the highest compliment you can give , upon tasting one of these beers , is to exclaim that it " Tastes just like Guinness ! "
8 . When being served a pint of Guinness ( or any of the aforementioned local stouts ) , it will often be covered with a white cap of foam .
That foam is taking the place of beer that you 've paid for !
To show that you 're no ignorant tourist , just blow said foam off onto the bar counter , and then ask the bartender to top up your pint .
They 'll be happy to do so now that you 've shown you know what 's what .
9 . The " Irish Car Bomb " , a shot of Jamesons in a pint of Guinness , is the national drink of Ireland , and should be ordered frequently to show your appreciation for your host country .
10 .
It 's always good form to use local phrases to show that you 've being paying attention to people around you .
For example , you might say that something is " Good like Bono ! " , who is a national hero , or , if surprised , exclaim " Fuck the pope ! "
The Price of Free Speech
A grotesque case of legal bullying using a 13th - Century law shows that in some respects we still have n’t shaken off feudalism .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 16th September 2008
So we saw him off .
Last week , in a victory for both medicine and free speech , Matthias Rath dropped his libel suit against the Guardian .
But it seems amazing that the courts of this country allowed him to pursue this case .
Rath , a German doctor , appears to have encouraged South Africans suffering from HIV to stop using anti-retroviral drugs and take his vitamin pills instead .
Several of them died .
It ’s an important story , which shows that journalists are of some use after all .
But the Guardian stood to lose hundreds of thousands of pounds for having the impudence to publish it .
This newspaper is big enough to look after itself , and on Monday it was also able to settle its legal dispute with Tesco .
But the net that Rath used is now being cast to catch ever smaller fry .
In the past few days , Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has dropped its cases against some of its fans ( 1,2 ) .
I am now allowed to write about the worst example of legal bullying I have ever seen .
The club has had serious problems , on and off the pitch , and many of its fans use an internet forum – owlstalk .
co.uk – to discuss them .
They make the kind of comments you would expect to find on any talk board , and which would normally be forgotten within 15 minutes .
Two and half years ago the club launched its first suit .
Only now have the people who posted these comments emerged blinking from the labyrinthine nightmare of English law .
As Geoffrey Robertson and Andrew Nicol explain in their excellent book Media Law , England ’s defamation laws date back to a statute created in 1275 .
The criminal offence of scandalum magnatum was devised to protect “ the great men of the realm ” from stories which could stir the people against them .
Three centuries later , the Star Chamber allowed noblemen to launch civil actions for libel , to provide them with an alternative to duelling ( 3 ) .
They made prolific use of this privilege until Fox ’s Libel Act of 1792 determined that the claimant ( the person bringing the case ) had to prove that the words used against him were false , malicious and damaging .
This means that libel law 216 years ago was more liberal and more in tune with the principle of free speech than it is today .
During the 19th and 20th centuries , Robertson and Nicol show , “ the common law was re-fashioned to serve the British class system from the perspective of … the Victorian club . ”
To protect wealthy people from criticism , the courts reversed Fox ’s burden of proof .
They created a presumption that any derogatory remark made about a gentleman must be false .
This remains the case today .
Defamation differs from all other civil or criminal laws in Britain : the burden of proof is on the defendant .
The law remains the privilege of gentlemen , by which I mean people who are able to afford costs that often exceed a million pounds on each side .
Cases tend to be resolved by sheer financial might , as the plaintiffs bankrupt the defendants , or force them to give in before their money runs out .
This ensures that the law retains its 13th Century function .
It guarantees that most attempts to hold the wealthy to account founder before they are launched , as people bite their tongues for fear of losing their homes .
Since 1879 , corporations have also been able to sue for libel ( 4 ) .
The inequality of arms this causes is compounded by the fact that there is no legal aid for defamation cases .
Lawyers are now allowed to fight these suits on a no - win , no - fee basis , but this freedom is double - edged : if a defendant loses , he could end up paying double the claimant ’s legal costs .
This is the context in which Sheffield Wednesday went to court to demand the names and email addresses of 14 people who had posted comments on owlstalk .
Here are some of the comments over which the club sued .
“ What an embarrassing , pathetic , laughing stock of a football club we ’ve become ” .
“ Another day , another blunder .
I doubt even Leeds were in such a mess this time last summer , and look what happened to them ” .
“ I am waiting with baited breath to hear who the Chuckle Brothers have signed after their trip to watch players abroad .
With the amount of money they have to spend and the wages they can offer the best we can hope for is that little known Transvestitavian International I.Sukblodov , who last scored in a brothel . ” ( 5 )
Such comments were deemed by the Sheffield Wednesday ’s lawyers to be “ false and seriously defamatory messages ” ( 6 ) which had caused grievous injury to the delicate flowers who ran the club .
( They should try posting an article on the Guardian ’s Comment is Free site ) .
The lawyers threatened “ proceedings to include claims for injunctions , damages , interest and legal costs ( which could be substantial ) . ” ( 7 ) The judge threw most of the application out , but instructed the forum ’s host to reveal the email addresses of four of the posters , whose remarks seem to me to be almost as trivial as those he dismissed ( 8 ) .
This took place a year ago , and the long shadow of the law hung over the posters until the club ’s lawyers dropped the case last week .
Another case dates back to February 2006 , when the club sent a warning letter to a fan called Nigel Short .
When he received the letter he offered to apologise and to change his comments , but the club rejected this .
He was able to fight it only because he found a lawyer – Mark Lewis of George Davies Solicitors in Manchester – who was incensed by this case and was prepared to represent him .
“ I ’ve had two and a half years of worrying I was going to lose my house ” , Short tells me .
“ It ’s been hell .
If Mark had n’t done this no win , no fee , I would have been bankrupt by now . ” ( 9 )
In November 2007 , Short was diagnosed with throat cancer .
The case continued .
But on Wednesday 3rd September he announced that his treatment had been successful ( 10 ) .
On Friday 5th , the club dropped the case and agreed to pay his costs .
It issued a press release which suggested it had done so because of “ Mr Short ’s medical condition . ” ( 11 ) I asked the club whether it had abandoned the case because it knew that Nigel would now live to fight the action .
It has refused to answer my questions . ( 12 )
The point of this story is not that the directors of Sheffield Wednesday have behaved like a bunch of petulant bullies .
It ’s that the law equips them to do so .
Most people see this as an issue only for journalists .
But the internet ensures that the law of defamation now threatens anyone who stands up for what he believes to be right .
This autumn the English branch of PEN , which defends the freedom to write , will launch a campaign against our libel law .
But where are the rest of you ?
Where are the petitions , the public protests , the lobbies of parliament ?
Why is this 13th - Century law still permitted to stifle legitimate dissent ?
Wake up Britain : your freedoms are disappearing into the pockets of barristers and billionaires .

Here you go - answers to your questions for Guido van Rossum about Python , its future , licensing hassles with the Free Software Foundation , and other neat stuff .
Thanks , Guido !
Ruby
by Luke
Thoughts on Ruby ?
Guido :
I just looked it up -- I 've never used it .
Like Parrot , it looks like a mixture of Python and Perl to me .
That was fun as an April Fool 's joke , but does n't tickle my language sensibilities the right way .
That said , I 'm sure it 's cool .
I hear it 's very popular in Japan .
I 'm not worried .
Data Structures Library
by GrEp
I love python for making quick hacks , but the one thing that I have n't seen is a comprehensive data structures library .
Is their one in development that you would like to comment about or point us to ?
Guido :
One of Python 's qualities is that you do n't need a large data structures library .
Rather than providing the equivalent of a 256 - part wrench set , with a data type highly tuned for each different use , Python has a few super - tools that can be used efficiently almost everywhere , and without much training in tool selection .
Sure , for the trained professional it may be a pain not to have singly - and doubly - linked lists , binary trees , and so on , but for most folks , dicts and lists just about cover it , and even inexperienced programmers rarely make the wrong choice between those two .
Since this is of course a simplification , I expect that we will gradually migrate towards a richer set of data types .
For example , there 's a proposal for a set type ( initially to be added as a module , later as a built - in type ) floating .
See http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/python-sets and http://python.sourceforge.net/peps/pep-0218.html.

Python
by seanw
How do you see the relationship between jPython ( the java implementation ) and standard cPython ( the original C language version ) evolving ?
And do you see the advantages of either one ( i.e. portability vs. speed ) becoming especially pronounced in light of the recent trend toward distributed software ( ala the MS . NET initiative ) ?
Guido :
Note that the new name is Jython , by the way .
Check out www.jython.org -- they 're already working on a 2.1 compatible release .
We used to work really close -- originally , when JPytnon was developed at CNRI by Jim Hugunin , Jim & I would have long discussions about how to implement the correct language semantics in Java .
When Barry Warsaw took over , it was pretty much the same .
Now that it 's Finn Bock and Samuele Pedroni in Europe , we do n't have the convenience of a shared whiteboard any more , but they are on the Python developers mailing list and we both aim to make it possible for Jython to be as close to Python in language semantics as possible .
For example , one of my reasons against adding Scheme - style continuations to the language ( this has seriously been proposed by the Stackless folks ) is that it can't be implemented in a JVM .
I find the existence of Jython very useful because it reminds me to think in terms of more abstract language semantics , not just implementation details .
IMO the portability of C Python is better than that of Jython , by the way .
True , you have to compile C Python for each architecture , but there are fewer platforms without a C compiler than platforms without a decent JVM .
Jython is mostly useful for people who have already chosen the Java platform ( or who have no choice because of company policy or simply what the competition does ) .
In that world , it is the scripting and extension language of choice .
does Python need a CPAN ?

One of the reasons I still write some things in PERL is because I know that I can find and install about a zillion modules quickly and easily through the CPAN repository and CPAN module .
I 'm pretty sure that if Python had something similar , like the Vaults of Parnassus but more evolved that I would abandon PERL almost entirely .
Do you see things in a similar way ?
If so , why has Python not evolved something similar or better , and what can I do to help it along in this realm ?
Guido :
It 's coming !
Check out the action in the catalog - sig http://python.org/sigs/catalog-sig/.
You can help by joining .
One reason why it has n't happened already is that first we needed to have a good package installation story .
With the widespread adoption of distutils , this is taken care of , and I foresee a bright future for the catalog activities .
Favourite Python sketch ?
by abischof
Considering that you named the language after the comedy troupe , what 's your favourite Monty Python sketch ?
Personally , my favourite is the lecture on sheep aircraft , but I suppose that 's a discussion for another time ; ) .
Guido :
I 'm a bit tired of them actually .
I guess I 've been overexposed . :-)
Conflict with GPL
by MAXOMENOS
The Free Software foundation mentions the license that comes with Python versions 1.6b1 and later as being incompatible with the GPL .
In particular they have this to say about it :
This is a free software license but is incompatible with the GNU GPL .
The primary incompatibility is that this Python license is governed by the laws of the " State " of Virginia in the USA , and the GPL does not permit this .
So , my question is a two parter :
1. What was your motivation for saying that Python 's license is governed by the laws of Virginia ?
2.Is it possible that a future Python license could be GPL - compatible again ?
Guido :
Let me answer the second part first .
I asked the FSF to make a clear statement about the GPL compatibility of the Python 2.1 , and their lawyer gave me a very longwinded hairsplitting answer that said neither yes nor no .
You can read for yourself at http://www.python.org/2.1/fsf.html.
I find this is very disappointing ; I had thought that with the 1.6.1 release we had most of this behind us , but apparently they change their position at each step in the negotiations .
I do n't personally care any more whether Python will ever be GPL - compatible -- I 'm just trying to do the FSF a favor because they like to use Python .
With all the grief they 're giving me , I wonder why I should be bothered any more .
As for the second part : most of you should probably skip right to the next question -- this answer is full of legal technicalities .
I 've spent waaaaaaaaay to much time talking and listening to lawyers in the past year ! :-(
Anyway .
The Python 1.6 license was written by CNRI , my employer until May 2000 , where I did a lot of work on Python .
( Before that , of course , I worked at CWI in Amsterdam , whom I have to thank for making my early work on Python possible . )
CNRI own the rights to Python versions 1.3 through 1.6 , so they have every right to pick the license .
CNRI 's lawyers designed the license with two goals in mind : ( 1 ) maximal protection of CNRI , ( 2 ) open source .
( If ( 2 ) had n't been a prerequisite for my employment at CNRI , they would have preferred not to release Python at all . :-)
Almost every feature of the license works towards protecting CNRI against possible lawsuits from disappointed Python users ( as if there would be any :-) , and the state of Virginia clause is no exception .
CNRI 's lawyers believe that sections 4 and 5 of the license ( the all caps warnings disclaiming all warranties ) only provide adequate protection against lawsuits when a specific state is mentioned whose laws and courts honor general disclaimers .
There are some states where consumer protection laws make general disclaimers illegal , so without the state of Virginia clause , they fear that CNRI could still be sued in such a state .
( Being a consumer myself , I 'm generally in favor of such consumer protection laws , but for open source software that is downloadable for free , I agree with CNRI that without a general disclaimer the author of the software is at risk .
I 'm happy that Maryland , for example , is considering to pass a law that makes a special exception for open source software here . )
Python 1.6.1 , the second " contractual obligation release " ( 1.6 was the first ) , was released especially to change CNRI 's license in a way that resolved all but one of the GPL incompatibilities in the 1.6 license .
I 'm not going to explain what those incompatibilities were , or how they were resolved .
Just look for yourself by following the " accept license " link at http://www.python.org/1.6.1/.
The relevant changes are all in section 7 of the license , which now contains several excruciating sentences crafted to disable certain other clauses of the license under certain conditions involving the GPL .
Read it and weep .
The remaining incompatibility , according to the FSF , is the " click - to - accept " feature of the license .
This is another feature to protect CNRI -- their lawyers believe that this is necessary to make the license a binding agreement between the user and CNRI .
The FSF is dead against this , and their current position is that because the GPL does not require such an " acceptance ceremony " ( their words ) , any license that does is incompatible with the GPL .
It 's like the old story of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object : CNRI 's lawyers have carefully read the GPL and claim that CNRI 's license is fully compatible with the GPL , so you can take your pick as to which lawyer you believe .
Anyway , I removed the acceptance ceremony from the 2.1 license , in the hope that this would satisfy the FSF .
Unfortunately , the FSF 's response to the 2.1 license ( see above ) seems to suggest that they have changed their position once again , and are now requesting other changes in the license .
I 'm very , very tired of this , so on to the next question !
Structured Design .
by Xerithane
First off , as a disclaimer I have never actually written anything in Python .
But , I have read up on virtually all the introduction articles and tutorials so I have a grasp on syntax and structure .
I have been doing C development for 9 years now , and I know a plethora of other languages including shell scripting , perl , PHP ( for scripts ) .
Now , each language uses ' normal ' grouping for control structures ( if , for , etc ) .
What was the logic behind creating a whitespace - based syntax rule ?
And why do you feel it is good , please refrain from the readability answer because that is all I get from those people I know who know Python .
I find , because of my background , it is much easier to read code that uses braces ( {} ) than whitespace because my mind automatically looks for them .
After maintaining legacy code that extends a life span of 20 years from it 's first line of code , I have some concerns about the longevity of any Python code .
So , my second question is , how well do you see Python holding up for 20 years and why do you think it will hold up that long ?
Guido :
What 's wrong with the legibility answer ?
I think that 's an * excellent * reason !
Do n't care if your code is legible ?
Do n't you hate code that 's not properly indented ?
Making it part of the syntax guarantees that all code is properly indented !
When you use braces , there are several different styles of brace placement ( e.g. whether the open brace sits on the same line as the " if " or on the next , and if on the next , whether it is indented or not ; ditto for the close brace ) .
If you 're used to code written in one style , it can be difficult to read code written in another .
Most people , when skimming code , look for the indentation anyway .
This leads to sometimes easily overlooked bugs like this one :
if ( x 10 ) x = 10 ; y = 0 ;
Still not convinced ?
In 1974 , Don Knuth predicted that indentation would eventually become a viable means of structuring code , once program units were small enough .
( Full quotation : http://www.amk.ca/quotations/python-quotes/page-1.html
Still not convinced ?
You admit that you have n't tried it yet .
Almost everybody who tries it gets used to it very quickly and end up loving the indentation feature , even those who hated it at first .
There 's still hope for you !
So , no , I 'm not worried about Python holding out 20 more years .
What is * your* idea of Python and its future ?
by Scarblac
There are a lot of " golden Python rules " or whatever you would call them , like " explicit is better than implicit " , " there should be only one way to do it " , that sort of thing .
As far as I know , those are from old posts to the mailing list , often by Tim Peters , and they 've become The Law afterwards .
In the great tradition of Usenet advocacy , people who suggest things that go against these rules are criticized .
But looking at Python , I see a lot more pragmatism , not rigid rules .
What do you think of those " golden rules " as they 're written down ?
What 's your idea of the future of Python ?
Since the PEP process , a lot of new feature ideas have been put forward , and a lot of people feel uncomfortable with quick change to a good language ( Python 2.1 is again excellent though , congrats ) .
Do you think or hope Python will be finished one day ?
If not , is n't the alternative an endless string of added features ?
" Python 3000 " was an idea of a sort of ideal Python that would be worked on , but as I understand Python will now evolve more gradually .
Guido :
You 're referring to the " Zen of Python " , by Tim Peters : http://www.python.org/doc/Humor.html#zen
It 's no coincidence that these rules are posted on the Python Humor page !
Those rules are useful when they work , but several of the rules warn against zealous application ( e.g. " practicality beats purity " and and " now is better than never " ) .
While we put " There 's only one way to do it " on a T - shirt , mostly to poke fun at Larry Wall 's TMTOWTDI , the actual Python Zen rule reads : " There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it . "
That has several nuances !
Regarding the future , I doubt that any piece of software ever stops evolving until it dies .
It 's like your brain : you never stop learning .
Good software has the ability to evolve built in from the start , and evolves in a way that keeps the complexity manageable .
Python started out pretty well equipped for evolution : it was extensible at two levels ( C extension modules and Python modules ) that did n't require changing the language itself .
We 've occasionally added features to support evolution better , e.g. package namespaces make it possible to have a much large number of modules in the library , and distutils makes it easier to add third party packages .
I hear the complaints from the community about the rate of change in Python , and I 'm going to be careful not to change the language too fast .
The next batch of changes may well be aimed at * reducing * complexity .
For example , there are PEPs proposing a simplification of Python 's numeric system ( like eradicating the distinction between 32/64 - bit ints and bignums ) , and I 've started to think seriously about removing the distinction between types and classes -- another simplification of the language 's semantics .
Strangest use of Python
by Salamander
What use of Python have you found that surprised you the most , that gave you the strongest " I can't believe they did that " reaction ?
Guido :
I find few things strange .
For the most obfuscated code I 've ever come across , see the Mandelbrot set as a lambda , http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html#4.15.
Digital Creations has written a high - performance fully transactional replicated object database in Python .
That 's definitely * way * beyond what I thought Python would be good for when I started .
Some people at national physics labs like LANL and LLNL have a version of Python running on parallel supercomputers with many hundreds of processors .
That 's pretty awesome .
But my * favorite * use of Python is at a teaching language , to teach the principles of programming , without fuss .
Think about it -- it 's the next generation !
-- Guido van Rossum ( home page : www.python.org/~guido)
She added : " It was the strangest gift I have ever received .
I just keep thinking how funny it is .
It makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels .
It was a wonderful surprise . "
The final version of Firebug 1.2 has been released .
The release should be up on the Mozilla Add - ons site today , but it ’s also up on GetFirebug.com right now .
John J Barton and Jan Odvarko put a ton of work into this release ( you may have noticed the rapid - fire series of beta releases last week – just trying to smooth out the rough edges ) .
There have been a number of improvements made ( not to mention countless bug fixes ) .
Some of the major points of this release include :
Firefox 3 support .
If you ’ve been using the Firebug 1.2 betas you ’re already on top of this .
Now is a good time to verify the version of Firebug that you ’re using .
Go to Tools > Add-ons in Firefox and see what version of Firebug you ’re running .
If it ’s anything other than 1.2.0 bX ( where X is a number 1 - 15 ) you ’ll need to forcefully go to the above Firebug URLs and install the new version ( the auto - update is n’t working for older versions ) .
The most common report of Firebug problems has been related to running Firebug 1.1 in Firefox 3 – which is a mess ( hence Firebug 1.2 ) .
Quality Improvements .
The Script panel ( the JavaScript debugger ) , the Net panel ( network monitoring ) , and Console panel have all seen considerable updates .
They ’re all much more performant and have a huge number of bug fixes .
Specifically the Console panel has seen a number of security improvements .
We ’ll be discussing the specific nature of these changes once everyone has had enough time to upgrade to Firebug 1.2 .
A list of all the bug fixes can be found in the full release notes .
Selective Panel Enablement .
This is the most drastic UI change of the release .
It ’s also a , seemingly , bizarre addition to the extension .
When you now click Firebug for a site you ’ll encounter an interface that looks something like this :
Some back story is needed in order to explain why the extension is now set up in this manner .
These three panels ( Console , Script , Net ) have the potential to incur a great deal of overhead into any web sites that utilizes them .
There are two pain points , in particular : The Mozilla JavaScript debugger and network monitoring .
The Mozilla JavaScript debugger is used in two ways in Firebug : First it is used in the Script panel ( to debug JavaScript code , naturally ) , second it is used to figure out where JavaScript errors are coming from in the console .
Network monitoring is , naturally , used for the Net panel .
Here ’s the important point :
The Mozilla JavaScript debugger and network monitoring are both global to Firefox not localized to a single window or tab .
This means that when you enable a panel , such as the script panel , it will turn on the JavaScript debugger for all JavaScript code in Firefox .
Rob Campbell has run some initial numbers and has found that , simply , enabling the script panel anywhere in the browser immediately slows down all JavaScript execution by 25 % – for all JavaScript on all tabs in the browser .
We do n’t have solid numbers on the networking monitoring overhead yet but we imagine it to be much less , although still occurring on a global all - tabs scale which is n’t desirable .
The important question here is :
What is being done to stop this ?
First , it must become necessary to not incur any overhead when using the console panel .
This is a ubiquitous part of Firebug and any global overhead presented by it must be removed .
This can be done but not without some internal API changes to how Firefox handles and reports error messages .
We hope to have something introduced in an upcoming version of Firefox so that we can compensate appropriately in Firebug .
Second , the JavaScript debugger must be improved .
A number of bugs have been filed on this subject and we hope that some of them will make their way into upcoming versions of Firefox ( Firebug will be able to immediately improve when that happens ) .
Specializing the debugger to only work against a single tab at a time may not be possible ( based upon how Firefox works , internally ) but if it is that will be an immediate benefit .
Of course , any performance improvements to the debugger will always be helpful .
Finally , the overhead of network monitoring ( if there really is that much – we have n’t run performance analysis her yet ) needs to be diminished in any way possible .
All of these things are points that the new Mozilla Firebug team is trying to tackle for the upcoming Firebug 1.3 release .
Who enabled me ?
Taking in to consideration the above performance points ( namely the fact that enabling the Console , Script , or Net panels have the potential to incur a global overhead on all browser tabs ) a feature was added to help you minimize your use of the panels in errant tabs .
If you position your mouse over the Firebug icon , in the Firefox tray , a tooltip will pop up telling you two things :
The version of Firebug that you ’re using and which tabs have some Firebug panels enabled in them .
It should be noted that the Firebug will be a gray color if no tabs currently have a Firebug panel enabled at all .
Using the above tooltip you can now go in and selectively disable any panel usage that you are no longer utilizing .
Suspend / Resume Firebug .
Of course , when using the above tooltip ( or seeing that the Firebug icon is lit up ) , you ’ll just want to suspend all use of Firebug panels straight out without having to poke - around each individual tab .
A new Suspend / Resume menu option has been added that will suspend / resume all active panels .
This is a one - click way to keep Firebug in check .
So what ’s next for Firebug ?
I discussed some of the performance auditing that we were doing recently and that will be continuing .
Specifically , however , we plan on releasing some minor updates to Firebug 1.2 to quell bugs and improve performance ( there will likely be a 1.2.1 release coming soon ) .
As I mentioned before , Firebug 1.3 is going to be all about performance , quality , and testing .
Firebug is the de facto tool for web developers and we need to make sure that its quality does not wane and that we tackle performance head - on ( with the eventual goal of having a seamless web development experience ) .

The latest news concerning our oceans is not what you would label “ good news . ”
Immediate and sweeping changes are necessary to slow or reverse the impact that human activity is having on our oceans .
If we do not , then catastrophic problems will be unavoidable .
Issues such as overfishing , pollution and climate change are just a few that are of concern .
This is the view of one Jeremy Jackson , a professor of oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego , in a new study published in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
A major part of Jackson ’s study , is the view that humans are laying the groundwork for mass extinctions within our oceans not seen since the ecological upheavals of our murky past .
Jackson has labeled this human - impacted transformation as “ the rise of slime , ” and he points to combined impact of habitat destruction , overfishing , ocean warming , increased acidification and massive nutrient runoff as the culprits for his rise of slime .
Areas of our oceans that were once a thriving metropolis of oceanic biodiversity , with big and small animals ’ alike living in a sort of “ end times ” environment , are now being turned in to areas only habitable by jellyfish , microbes , disease and toxic algal blooms .
A presentation last December at a biodiversity and extinction colloquium convened by the National Academy of Sciences goes hand in hand with Jackson ’s new paper , “ Ecological extinction and evolution in the brave new ocean . ”
“ The purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse , ” said Jackson .
“ It ’s a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long .
If anything , the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways . ”
The continued overfishing is just one issue that strikes at the heart of the biodiversity of our oceans .
The loss of fish and sharks near our continental shelves , runoff into our estuaries and coastal seas , and more , build upon each other to paint a dire picture for our oceans .
“ The challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries , agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do , ” he writes .
“ So it ’s not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments ; the only way to keep one ’s sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible . ”
I ’m not deliberately obscurantist or opposed to innovation , but there are a few trends in web design that I do n’t appreciate .
For example , I do n’t like lightboxes .
( Yeah , I know we use it at Reevoo for our reviews service , but Befehl ist Befehl . )
If you ’re lucky enough not to be familiar with this abomination , I should explain .
The lightbox user interface trope layers a dark , semi- transparent layer over the web page , and displays the new content over that .
It looks cool and shiny .
Even the best lightbox implementations tend to be a bit temperamental , but that ’s not what pains me : I do n’t like them because they subvert pre-existing browser functionality — better functionality .
If it ’s a real link , I can control - click to open it in a new tab .
Or I can shift - click for a new window .
Or plain click and replace the current page .
Whatever I choose , that ’s my choice .
When I click and get a lightbox , it ’s guaranteed not to be what I was expecting , and that ’s not a good user experience .
I ’ve been doing a lot of browsing on the small screen of my EeePC 701 lately .
That ’s 800×480 pixels .
It ’s made me start to notice how unusable is so much of the AJAX onanism that constitutes modern web design .
Sure , it looks great on the dual zillion - pixel monitors of my quad - Xeon workstation at the office , but to blame me for browsing on a small screen would be to miss the point of ( X ) HTML and semantic mark - up .
Similarly , I do n’t like the trend of hijacking the onclick events of links to force them to replace the current page .
If I control - click to open in a new tab , the chances are high that I do n’t want this tab to load the same content as well .
On the other hand , if I ’d just clicked it , I ’d expect it to load right here , which is exactly what it would have done anyway .
So do n’t try to second - guess me , please .
But now I ’ve discovered something even more objectionable .
Have a look at this Amazon / IMDB press release .
Try clicking on a link .
It opens a little iframe in the middle of the window , with the linked - to page inside it .
WHY ?!
What did I do to make you think that I would want that ?!
Stop it , all of you .
You can make nice - looking , functional websites without any of these gewgaws , and we ’d all be the better for it — not to mention that it would take much less debugging work for you as a developer to make it functional in Internet Explorer .
And the government would n’t have to release documents telling its departments which browsers to test their ill - considered baubles in .

Cloud hosting with Mosso
Posted by Aaron D. Campbell | Friday , February 6th , 2009 | Comments ( 4 )
Best Web Hosting , Cloud Based Computing , Cloud Hosting , Web Hosting , Web Hosting Reviews
You may have seen the announcement on twitter ( if not then shame on you , you should be following us ) .
WebDevNews has moved to new hosting .
As Xavisys Web Development ( the company that owns / operates this site ) has been growing , we ’ve been trying to find just the right company to partner with in order to offer high quality hosting to our clients .
Mosso Cloud Hosting is that company .
We tried quite a few ranging from Bluehost to Host Gator to Rackspace .
We were not looking for cheap hosting , we were looking for the best hosting we could find for our specific needs .
While some were better than others , Mosso was the best .
In order to test out the hosting , we moved a couple sites to Mosso .
We did n’t want to move any really big complex sites , but did n’t exactly want to test with my wife ’s blog either .
Instead , we moved both WebDevNews and Attackr .
Both are WordPress ( database driven ) sites , and combined they average about 650 pageviews a day .
While it ’s not a lot of traffic , we thought it would give us a good idea of how Mosso would perform .
We hit a few snags along the way .
The architecture of the Mosso cloud caused WP - Super - Cache ( a popular WordPress plugin ) to fail .
Believe it or not , I was pretty happy about that .
See , sometimes you go months without any problems on a host and by the time you have a problem you ’re already pretty committed to using them ( all your sites are there , etc ) .
The truth is , you will eventually have problems , and I wanted to see how they handled it .
I contacted them via the live support chat link in my admin section and got a person within seconds ( this seems to be pretty average there ) .
A ticket was filed and they went to work on it .
I worked with them , testing , allowing them to modify my .htaccess , etc .
As it turned out , there were actually a couple problems .
The first was a problem with the rewrite rules and the second was a problem with cleaning up the files .
Both are now fixed , and the technicians really went above and beyond in order to fix the problem .
I even got calls from them with updates !
While the two sites are n’t huge , they are n’t small either .
According to the statistics I could host roughly 18 similar sites for the base rate of $ 100 / month before I would need to start paying overages .
Considering the network they offer and the quality of their service , that ’s an amazing price !
Sounds like it ’s all roses right ?
Well , there are some drawbacks .
For one , they do n’t offer Java / Tomcat or ColdFusion .
I do n’t use those , so that did n’t bother me at all ( and they do offer Windows or Linux , PHP , ASP , . Net , Perl , Python , etc ) .
However , I use SSH constantly , and they do n’t offer that .
I ’m adjusting .
The best things about SSH is that I could use wget to pull files directly to the server and then uncompress them quickly .
For now I ’m settling for uploading the file via FTP and uncompressing with their admin panel .
Now if they could just find a way to let me use wget !
So in the end , why did we choose them ?
First and foremost is their service .
Of all the companies we tried , Rackspace and Mosso ( a wholly owned Rackspace subsidiary ) had the best service by far .
With Rackspace a human answers the phone and immediately puts you through to a knowledgeable technician .
With Mosso , you get a recording and have to press 1 to get a technician .
While I ’d rather have a human answer the phone , at least you can get through to a knowledgeable person in seconds .
Second , they have great reliability .
I ’ve worked with Rackspace for a while now , and I know their data - centers are extremely reliable .
Since Mosso uses those same data - centers , they get the same great reliability and connectivity .
Additionally , they scale very easily .
With Rackspace , you need to scale in chunks , adding a new server each time .
With Mosso we can scale smoothly , which is more cost - effective .
Lastly , they offer some nice little extras .
For a little extra per customer per month , they will extend their 24×7 support to my clients .
We do n’t want to be a hosting company , we just want to be able offer reliable hosting to our clients that need it .
Additionally , if you are n’t set up to take recurring payments ( or maybe you do n’t even accept credit card ? !? ) , they will bill your clients and deposit the money into your account .
If you ’re looking for high - quality hosting , either for your sites or to offer to your clients , take a look at Mosso Cloud Hosting .
If you enter the code REF - XAVISYS when you sign up , you ’ll get $ 100 off your second month !

Israeli Prime Minister Olmert resigns
By Ann Talbot
2 August 2008
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has announced that he will resign as leader of the ruling Kadima party in September .
His announcement follows mounting allegations of corruption .
Olmert has been dogged by corruption scandals since he came to power in 2006 .
The Israeli police are currently investigating six separate cases involving him .
He has previously said that he would not stand down until charged .
His decision to resign reflects new and more damaging allegations that emerged when New York businessman Moshe , or Morris , Talansky was questioned in an Israeli court .
According to the Jerusalem Post , a source close to Olmert told State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss about Olmert ’s financial dealings with Talansky and provided documentary evidence of the transactions some months ago .
The state comptroller ’s office , which was already investigating other allegations against Olmert , began its own investigation and alerted the police .
The most serious allegation is that Olmert received hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and loans from Talansky .
Talansky alleged that he gave $ 150,000 to Olmert to finance political campaigns .
He claimed not to know what the money was used for , but hinted that some of it was used to fund Olmert ’s extravagant lifestyle .
Talansky claims to have lent Olmert money on three occasions to pay for personal trips .
There was a loan of $ 25,000 , which was never repaid , to pay for a family holiday in Italy and Greece ; $ 4,717.49 to pay for a stay at the Washington Ritz Carlton ; and $ 15,000 expenses for another trip to the United States .
Following information from Talansky , the police then widened their investigation to include allegations that Olmert committed fraud while he was mayor of Jerusalem .
“ According to the suspicions , ” a police spokesman said , “ during his tenure as Jerusalem mayor and trade and industry minister , Olmert would seek duplicate funding for his trips abroad from public bodies , including from the state , with each of them requested to fund the same trip . ”
The police are said to be investigating the allegation that “ considerable sums ” from this double billing remained in a special account , which was then used to fund private travel abroad for Olmert and his family .
This case has become known as “ Olmert Tours . ”
Records kept by Shula Zaken , Olmert ’s personal secretary and aide for the last 30 years , are said to refer to Talansky ’s financial dealings with Olmert under the name , “ The Laundry Man . ” Zaken is also under investigation for allegedly abusing her position to influence tax officials .
Talansky was questioned when he visited Israel earlier this year for Passover .
The Israeli authorities initially tried to prevent the press reporting Talansky ’s name or nationality .
But when the New York Times published his name in May it became impossible to keep the lid on the story .
Talansky ’s testimony has allowed the Israeli authorities to put pressure on Olmert ’s lawyer Uri Messer and Zaken .
Olmert has claimed that Messer and Zaken were responsible for handling Talansky ’s donations .
Messer claims that Zaken alone handled the money , which was kept in envelopes in her office .
Zaken has so far not cooperated with the investigations , but it is expected that both Messer and Zaken will be offered the opportunity to turn state ’s evidence against Olmert .
The police have now questioned Olmert four times .
In a separate case , the police are investigating appointments Olmert made while he was the minister for trade and industry .
It is alleged that he appointed political associates to government bodies , including the Medium and Small Enterprises Authority .
It is also alleged that Olmert arranged investment opportunities for friends while he was industry minister and may have granted special funding for a factory with which a former business partner was associated .
Still ongoing is the “ Cremieux Street affair . ”
Olmert is alleged to have paid $ 325,000 below the market value for a property in Cremieux Street .
The National Fraud Unit questioned Zaken for four hours about the purchase of this $ 1.2 million apartment .
It has been suggested that Olmert speeded up the bureaucratic procedure for the developers while he was acting prime minister and received a discount in return .
One investigation has come to an end without charges .
It was alleged that when he was finance minister , Olmert had tried to influence the sale of the state ’s controlling share in Bank Leumi to the advantage of a friend .
The police dropped this case last November , saying that they did not have sufficient evidence to bring charges .
Olmert ’s political career goes back to the 1970s .
In 1993 he became mayor of Jerusalem .
Some of the corruption allegations date back to his decade in this office .
He appears to have met Talansky during his campaign to become mayor .
He worked closely with Ariel Sharon in the Likud party , and left Likud with Sharon in 2005 to form Kadima .
When Sharon suffered a stroke in 2006 , Olmert took over as leader .
Olmert has been a lame duck since Israel ’s defeat at the hands of Hezbollah in 2006 after the Israeli army invaded Lebanon .
An official inquiry criticised him for launching the invasion of Lebanon and his conduct of the war .
The recent exchange of prisoners for the bodies of Israeli soldiers was an added humiliation .
Recent polls showed Olmert with an approval rating of only 14 percent and three out of five Israelis thought he should resign .
Half of those polled considered him corrupt .
But Olmert is not alone .
Israeli political life is notoriously corrupt and few leading politicians could withstand a close scrutiny of their financial affairs .
Olmert ’s dealings have become a public embarrassment , but they are symptomatic of the practices of the entire ruling elite .
The way in which his case has blown up reveals the very sharp tensions that exist among this tiny layer , which is completely isolated from the mass of the population who have long since become alienated from official public life .
Olmert has been able to survive the debacle in Lebanon as long as he has because he had a certain political value both to the Israeli political elite and in Washington .
Like Sharon , he has always had a hawkish attitude toward the Palestinians .
It was he who , as Sharon ’s spokesman , declared that Israel was prepared to assassinate former PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat .
But as prime minister he was associated with the call for a settlement with the Palestinians and Israel ’s neighbours , especially Syria .
This suited the interests of Washington very well .
It enabled the Bush administration to give the impression that a peace process was under way .
This was important for the US ’s allies in Europe and in winning support for the US amongst the Arab regimes — especially in the aftermath of the Iraq invasion .
While negotiations proceeded , it was possible to continue the process of creating a greater Israel by extending Jewish settlements , building a wall to isolate the Palestinians and launching military attacks on Palestinian civilians .
Olmert has stressed that he will continue negotiations with Syria as long as he remains prime minister .
This has been seen by some in the media as a prospect of peace .
Writing in the Guardian , Rachel Shabi suggested that Olmert could now go “ hell for leather ” for an agreement with the Syrians and the Palestinians .
She quoted Haaretz columnist Akiva Eldar stating , “ But now he does n’t have to worry about consolidating his power as prime minister , he has a clear interest to do it , the mandate to do it and nothing to lose . ”
“ For Olmert , ” Shabi concludes , “ success would still depend on the willingness of Labour and Kadima allies to stand by him and effectively enable him to leave a legacy that might make Israelis — and Palestinians — forgive the rest .
But by this analysis , Palestinian and Syrian partners on these parallel peace tracks should race with Olmert to get final status agreements on paper in the few remaining weeks of his premiership .
It ’s a small , rickety and bullet - ridden window , but in a few months it might well be replaced by an impenetrable concrete wall . ”
Olmert does indeed seem to be racing toward an agreement with the Syrians .
According to a Maariv report on Friday , the two sides are close to a deal .
Syria and Israel would end the state of war between them , establishing normal diplomatic relations .
On its part Israel would demilitarize the Golan Heights , while Syria would reduce the number of its troops stationed between the Golan Heights and Damascus .
However , far from a peace move , implicit in the deal would be a Syrian agreement to end its close relationship with Iran , which Jerusalem and Washington have in their sights .
Olmert made it clear to the Syrians that they had to chose between the “ Iranian grip ” and their partnership in the “ axis of evil , ” and , as he put it , rejoining the “ family of nations ” in pursuit of peace and “ economic development . ”
Syria entered into talks after Israel bombed what they claimed was a nuclear site in Syria .
Reaching an agreement with Israel offers the regime of Bashar Assad the opportunity of repairing relations with the US and Europe , especially France .
Assad was welcomed to President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s Mediterranean Forum meeting in July .
The purpose of the talks is to detach Syria from its alliance with Iran and to isolate Iran diplomatically in advance of a possible assault by Israel with US backing , or at the very least to place maximum pressure on Tehran to accept US hegemony in the region .
There is no doubt , however , that Olmert ’s resignation is indicative of and will also herald a further shift to the right in official Israeli politics .
The candidates competing to replace Olmert as leader of Kadima both have strong right - wing credentials .
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is currently the favourite to succeed Olmert .
She is presented as a candidate untainted by corruption and has called on the coalition to “ restore the public ’s faith in Israeli politics . ”
A former Mossad agent , she has stressed her role in Olmert ’s security cabinet .
On the Monday before Olmert resigned Livni staged a very public row with him in the Knesset in full view of the cameras .
She accused him of giving too many concessions to Syria .
Her display was necessary to consolidate her position against her main rival for leadership , Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz .
Livni has led the talks with the Palestinians and favours a two - state solution to the Palestinian question .
Until her public row with Olmert , she was regarded as backing his negotiations with Syria .
Mofaz , who has taken a much harder line on the Golan Heights and Jerusalem , is a former chief of staff and defence minister .
He is reputed to have told West Bank army commanders in 2001 that he wanted “ 10 slain Palestinians ” in each territorial brigade area .
According to the book Boomerang by journalists Ofer Shelah and Raviv Drucker , a senior officer pointed out at the time that Mofaz ’s directive would amount to 70 Palestinians being killed each day .
On Thursday Mofaz warned the US not to soften its stance towards Iran after US diplomats met with Iranian officials .
He met with Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to protest the meeting .
A spokeswoman for Mofaz said that he was “ voicing Israel ’s strong concerns . ”
In June this year Mofaz said it was “ inevitable ” that Israel would attack a nuclear Iran .
Essentially the competition between Livni and Mofaz is about who can present themselves as the best war leader .
But whoever wins the leadership contest , they must put together another coalition .
The fragile Kadima party created by Sharon by winning the backing of a section of the Labor Party may not even survive a leadership contest .
Power may pass directly into the hands of Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of Likud .
He was prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and served as finance minister under Sharon .
He resigned from Sharon ’s government in protest over the withdrawal from Gaza .
Netanyahu has called for an immediate election .
It is even possible that Mofaz might attempt to form a coalition with Netanyahu in return for the defence portfolio .

PHOENIX  When Senator John McCain is in Washington , he lives in a luxury high - rise condominium in Arlington , Va. , owned by his wife , Cindy Hensley McCain .
Mrs. McCain also owns their condos in Phoenix , San Diego and Coronado , Calif. , and their vacation compound near Sedona , Ariz .
And it is the beer business , Hensley & Company , she inherited from her father that is the source of the McCain family fortune .
That fortune makes Mr. McCain one of the richest members of the Senate .
Yet barely a sliver of it is in his name .
Democrats have increasingly highlighted Mr. McCain ’s wealth .
Senator Barack Obama ridiculed him on Thursday for being unable to say how many homes he owned , saying it showed that Mr. McCain was out of touch with ordinary Americans .
But with the McCains ’ money in Cindy McCain ’s name , as dictated by a prenuptial agreement , the senator ’s finances are more difficult to assess and scrutinize than those of many other political candidates .
The husbands and wives of senators are subject to fewer disclosure requirements than their office - holding spouses .
In addition , Mrs. McCain , who files separate tax returns from her husband , controls a privately held company and invests mainly through a web of limited - liability corporations and trusts that have few disclosure requirements .
She declined to be interviewed .
Making a Deal with the Devil Peter Schiff
written Sep 26 , 2008
Sep 29 , 2008 Just yesterday , Henry Paulson 's " bailout " bill , with only a few anti-Wall Street , pro-Main Street fig leaves , slapped on by Democrats , appeared ready to sail through Congress on a bi-partisan tide .
But something funny happened on the way to the printing press .
It appears as if some conservative House Republicans are reluctant to sell their souls and ditch any remaining pretense towards American - style capitalism .
What 's left of the Barry Goldwater wing of the Republican Party , which maintains its natural tendency to trust the markets and not government , has dug in its heels .
But , Bush , Paulson and the Democrats have argued that our problems are so dire that free enterprise principles must go out the window .
The struggle is historic , but the Congressmen are fighting a losing battle .
Sadly , Americans now appear willing to abandon their economic heritage at the first sting of financial pain .
Although passage does seem inevitable , it is nevertheless the wrong thing to do .
Central government planning did not work in the Soviet Union and it will not work here .
Only free market forces are capable of sorting through the mess .
Political meddling will make the problems worse .
In selling the bill to Americans , many are pointing to the Resolution Trust Corporation as an example of similar intervention that worked in the past .
However , there is no proof that RTC actually helped as we have no way of knowing what might have happened had the government stayed out .
Missing in this discussion is that the Savings & Loan crisis of the 1980's , much like the current crisis , was a byproduct of government interference in the free market .
By insuring bank deposits through the FDIC , the government created a moral hazard that resulted in extreme risk taking among member banks , whose depositors sought only high yields , without any regard for the risks that the banks were incurring .
Banks that refused to take big risks lost deposits to those banks that did .
Absent FDIC insurance , depositors would have considered risks as well as rewards , and the S & L crisis never would have happened in the first place !
The urgency for passing this bailout bill is based on the claim that the American economy will collapse if nothing is done .
If the government were to stay out , and allow the market to function , there will certainly be a great deal of economic pain .
Companies will go bankrupt , banks will fail , real estate and stock prices will keep falling , and many people will lose their jobs .
However , government action will not prevent any of this .
At best , it will merely delay the inevitable , but only at the cost of increasing the severity of the underlying problems , thus making their ultimate resolution that much more painful to endure .
The bottom line is that there is no way to resolve our economic problems without a severe recession , and our politicians need to level with the public .
As a nation , we gambled on the alluring riches of real estate and we lost .
The price must be paid .
Contrary to the Bush Administration rhetoric , the fundamentals of our economy are not sound .
If they were , we would not be in this mess .
Recessions are meant to restore balance , purge excess , and liquidate mal - investments .
On that score we have a lot of work to do .
We are being told that this plan will help the economy by keeping the spigots of consumer credit flowing .
However , to really address the fundamental problems , those spigots must be tightened .
Since we have already borrowed and spent ourselves into bankruptcy , the last thing we need is for consumers to borrow more .
Our leaders maintain that without this bailout consumers will not be able to borrow money to buy cars .
So what is wrong with that ?
We already have plenty of cars , and if we are broke , why do we need to buy more ?
Instead , we need [ to ] drive our old cars longer , pay off our underwater auto loans , and produce more cars for export .
It is also argued that without access to credit parents will not be able to borrow money to send their kids to school .
That 's fine by me as it will force Universities to reduce tuitions to levels families can actually afford .
They will either have to cut out all of that bureaucratic fat , or go out of business for lack of customers .
In the end it is impossible for the American economy to be rebuilt on a sounder foundation of savings and production without a lot of economic pain .
Government efforts to reinforce the shaky foundation of borrowing and consuming will result in the entire structure falling down around us .

Here is a crazy idea to address the United States ’ gaping fiscal deficit : persuade corporate America to start paying taxes .
An investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that almost two - thirds of companies in the United States usually pay no corporate income taxes .
Big companies , those with more than $ 50 million in sales or $ 250 million in assets , are less likely to avoid Uncle Sam altogether .
Still , about a quarter of them report no tax liability either .
The G.A.O. , which looked at tax returns from 1998 through 2005 , does not tell us exactly how so many corporations managed to avoid the taxman .
It simply notes that they were able to record sufficient expenses  salaries , interest and “ other deductions ”  to cancel out their taxable income .
We find it hard to believe that some two - thirds of American companies fail to turn a profit .
What we find easier to believe is that corporations have become increasingly skilled at tax - avoidance strategies , including transfer pricing  overcharging their American units for products and services provided by subsidiaries abroad to artificially reduce their profits here .
Chess and Islam
Some people claim that the game of chess increases ones wit and intelligence , and it assists one in learning the ways of battles .
This claim is unreasonable .
Chess has nothing to do with wit or intelligence ; on the contrary intelligence suffers a derangement by this game .
The player of chess becomes so absorbed in this game that he has no care or concern for anything else .
Yes there is no surprise in the fact that by constant playing , ones ability to manoeuvre the various ways and moves of the game improves .
But then what is the benefit of this gain ?
Similarly this game has no relationship with the strategies of battle or war .
The act of the game is limited to its technical or ordinary manoeuvres e.g. the knight moves so and the elephant moves so .
In true and real battles these are not the moves to be found .
The manoeuvres of war are totally distinct and separate .
In short both these claims are absurd .
Some claim that according to the Mazhab ( school of thoughts ) of Imam Shafiee R A the playing of chess is permissible but it must be stated that this was the first view of the great imam but even then he fixed certain conditions for its permissibility , e.g. involvement in the game must not be to the extent that the performance of Salaat is delayed from its fixed time ; the game must not be played abundantly ; absorption in it must not be so much that the answer to someones salaam is not given , etc .
These conditions are not to be found these days when this game is being played .
It is also a fact that Imam Shafiee later withdrew of chess being permissible .
Many of the great Muslim scholars have clearly stated the prohibition and non-permissibility of chess .
Imam Malik RA said that it is worse than the game of nard ( backgammon , which is also haram ) and more destructive than gambling .
Hadhrat Ali also said :
 Chess is gambling of the Ajam people ( non Arabs ) 
The prophet said :
He who plays Backgammon has disobeyed Allah Taala and His ( Rasool ) .
The playing of chess is Haraam .
If the playing of chess is accompanied by gambling than its prohibition is unanimous .
If it is played without gambling then there is a difference of opinion in its prohibition .
Where Allah Taaala declared alcohol and gambling as forbidden , he explained the reason for this prohibition .
Allah says in the Holy Quran that Shaytan desires to create an ill feeling amongst you .
He desires to create hatred among you , and to direct your attention from Salaat and Allah Taalas remembrance .
So wherever this is present , the prohibition will come into force , and that practice will become Haraam .
All are aware of the degree of absorption in these games .
Absorption in this game ( chess ) is so much , that we seek the protection of Allah Taala .
The truth of the matter is that when someone becomes rooted in some practice and this practice penetrates his very blood and veins , then until death it remains overpowering , and in this very practice a man finally dies .

Efforts from Gov. Palin's office and others to fight the investigation into " Troopergate " are heading into overdrive .
Alaska 's attorney general said yesterday that state employees wo n't honor the subpoenas to testify that have been issued in the probe .
The attorney general is a Palin appointee .
Meanwhile , five Republican lawmakers in Alaska filed a lawsuit and asked a judge for an emergency order to stop what they called the legislature 's " McCarthyistic investigation . "
The Associated Press notes that McCain 's campaign is taking a more active role .
According to the AP , the campaign has " dispatched a former top U.S. terrorism prosecutor from New York , Ed O'Callaghan , to assist Palin 's personal lawyer working to derail or delay " the investigation .
The strategy also extends to dealing with the press .
As the AP notes , this week Palin " effectively turned over questions about her record as Alaska 's governor to John McCain 's political campaign . "
National reporters are essentially no longer allowed to speak with Alaska officials , including those in the governor 's office :
The McCain campaign is demanding that it becomes the de facto source for answers about the operations of Alaska 's government during the past 20 months .
Palin 's normal press secretary , for example , now turns away inquiries from any reporter who is n't permanently based in Alaska , referring questions to the presidential campaign .
When the AP asked the state 's health department about some health - related lawsuits , they were referred to a McCain spokeswoman .
" In general the state is sending media inquiries this way because we 're just inundated with hundreds and hundreds of phone calls , " the spokeswoman told the AP .
Earlier this week , a ProPublica reporter called the governor 's office and had a similar experience .
Asked about the state 's use of eBay , a spokeswoman for the governor 's office , Kate Morgan , referred ProPublica to the McCain campaign .
The reason cited ?
Alaska state ethics law .
" Our ethics law in Alaska does n't allow for state workers to answer questions about campaign matters , " explained Morgan .
" We have so many press calls coming in , and reporters often are n't clear whether questions are campaign - related .
If the McCain campaign decides the question has to do with state business , they will refer the call back . "
It ’s hard for ranchers here to figure how it came to this -- again .
After railing for more than a decade against the federal government for reintroducing gray wolves to the region , after finally winning the battle to get the animals taken off the endangered species list , what went so wrong that Washington stepped in last week to protect the wolves all over again ?
It began near here in this high - altitude chaparral .
No sooner were gray wolves delisted in March than sportsmen in Idaho , Montana and Wyoming began locking and loading .
Wyoming officials declared 90 % of the state a “ free - fire zone . ”
Hunters from around the state flocked to rural Sublette County to bag a wolf .
Rancher Merrill Dana , 57 , saw the results right away .
Hunters aboard snowmobiles chased wolves across the early spring snow on his sprawling ranch .
“ The first morning it was opened up , they killed three up here , ” he said .
“ Trespassers .
We did n’t even know they were up here until we heard the snow machines . ”
Advertisement
Dana said he has been offered as much as $ 2,500 for permission to hunt wolves on his land .
He refused .
As with many ranchers here , there is no love lost between Dana and wolves .
He was mad the interlopers had n’t asked permission to hunt .
“ I wanted people I know to get them , ” said Dana , who was among a hunting party that eventually killed a 110 - pound male .
Through the early summer , an average of a wolf a day was being killed across the region .
In all , at least 130 animals died since the delisting , or nearly 10 % of the wolf population in the northern Rockies .
Then , on July 21 , a federal judge stopped the hunt .
Last week , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service capitulated and began the process to relist wolves .
“ People overreacted , ” said cattle rancher John Robinette of Dubois , Wyo .
“ I do n’t think the policy was intended as : ‘ Go out and see how many wolves you can kill . ’ ”

Robinette has lost cattle , horses and dogs to wolves .
Even when the wolf was listed , he had a rare federal permit to shoot any wolf he saw on his 25,000 acres .
But he said he was convinced that giving everyone that right would lead to needless and reckless slaughter .
“ People went out all over the state shooting and bragging about it and putting pictures in the paper , ” Robinette said .
“ This is what I dreaded this spring : that someone would go out and get a bunch of pups out of a den and get their picture in the paper .
It was going to draw unwanted attention . ”
Among cattlemen , distaste for wolves is as broad and wide as the sagebrush plain that stretches in all directions from Dana ’s ranch .
Once hunted nearly to extinction , the West ’s most - reviled predator roams freely here , coming down to these khaki - colored valleys from nearby national forests in search of elk and the occasional cow or calf .
Dana ’s thoughts about wolves are complicated .
He enjoys wildlife and readily acknowledges that the clever and strong wolf is especially fascinating .
But after the controversial program to reintroduce the wolf in the 1990s , the animal has come to symbolize unwelcome federal meddling in rural Western lives and land .

For the time being , at least , wolves in the northern Rockies are back on the endangered species list while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reconsiders the issue .
Federal officials are monitoring the wolf management programs in Montana and Idaho , which canceled its wolf hunt planned for this month .
In Wyoming , federal wildlife officials took over wolf management while a committee of the Wyoming Legislature crafts a new policy .
It was a stunning reversal in what wildlife biologists had hailed as a success story .
The species had flourished , its population growing by about 20 % a year since wolves were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995 .
This was proof the Endangered Species Act worked , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said when it delisted the wolf in March .
In July , federal District Judge Donald Molloy issued an injunction against the state wolf plans , after a challenge by environmental groups .
He questioned whether indiscriminate killing would reduce wolf numbers back to crisis levels .
He also said the hunt could isolate packs of wolves , reducing the species ’ gene pool .
Some wildlife biologists say the damage is already done .
Nearly all of the known wolves in Wyoming ’s free - fire area were killed in little more than a month .
Recent estimates show that the wolf population in the three states began to decline for the first time in more than a decade even before the hunt .

“ The decision [ to relist them ] has brought the wolves a massive reprieve , a lifeline , ” said Louisa Wilcox , who tracks the issue for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Livingston , Mont .
Some of the wolves shot since March were known to have killed livestock and were taken by authorized hunters .
But half of the wolves killed without permits were shot in Sublette County .
“ The wolves in the predator area were taken out ; those wolves are gone , ” said Mike Jimenez , who leads the Wyoming wolf recovery project for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
“ That ’s no surprise .
They are vulnerable to hunting . ”
Suzanne Stone , who manages a wolf program in Idaho for Defenders of Wildlife , said that Wyoming ’s hunt could n’t have come at a worse time for wolves .
“ Late spring , they ca n’t travel that well , ” she said .
“ They stay close to their den sites , and they are not going to leave the pups or the alpha female .
It ’s an easy time of year to kill wolves . ”

Dana thinks he knows the details of the last wolf kill , on May 2 .
He believes the hunter was a young man who tracked a female for 70 miles on a snowmobile in and out of dense stands of trees .
“ She was a loner who was plumb lost , ” Dana said of the wolf .
“ All her mates were gone [ killed ] .
The kid was going through sagebrush and fences and trees .
He tore up an $ 8,000 snow machine . ”
In the last seven years , Dana has lost 11 calves and cows and two dogs to wolf predation .
His neighbor , Kevin Campbell , 54 , says he has never lost livestock to wolves .
Their experiences reflect regional and national statistics .
Across the county in 2006 , coyotes , dogs , mountain lions and even vultures killed more cattle than did wolves .

Last year in Montana , coyotes were blamed for 51 % of cattle losses due to predators , while dogs were accountable for 11 % , according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service , part of the federal Department of Agriculture .
Yet the perception persists that wolves are dramatically reducing livestock inventories and big game .
Elk and deer populations are stable in Idaho , Montana and Wyoming , state wildlife officials say .
“ When you say ‘ wolf , ’ it drives a lot of hard feelings , ” said Robinette .
To Campbell , a rancher in Bondurant , Wyo. , who was helping Dana sort and load cattle for sale last week , wolves and livestock are not compatible .
“ I try to have an open mind , ” he said , shifting in his saddle .
“ But I think they should go back to the policy we just had , to be able to shoot them . ”

In rural areas of the upper Rockies , it ’s not uncommon to come across bumper stickers proclaiming “ The Only Good Wolf Is a Dead Wolf . ”
Although sentiments are somewhat less volatile in the cities , a store in upscale Jackson this week had two stuffed wolves for sale for about $ 4,500 each .
One tag read “ recent taxidermy . ”

The busy Java developer 's guide to Scala Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
Recently , reader feedback has led me to realize that I have left behind an important aspect of Scala 's language while crafting this series : Scala 's package and access modifier facilities .
So I 'm going to take a moment and cover this before diving into one of the more functional elements of the language , the apply mechanism .
Packaging
To help segregate code in such a way that it does n't conflict with one another , Java™ code provides the package keyword , creating a lexical namespace in which classes are declared .
In essence , putting a class Foo in a package named com.tedneward.util modifies the formal class name to com.tedneward.util .
Foo ; it must be referenced as such .
Java programmers will be quick to point out that they do n't do this , they import the package and thus save themselves from having to type the formal name out .
This is true , but it merely means that the work of referencing the class by its formal name falls to the compiler and bytecode .
A quick glance at javap output reveals this to be the case .
About this series Ted Neward dives into the Scala programming language and takes you along with him .
In this exciting developerWorks series , you 'll learn what all the recent hype is about and see some of Scala 's linguistic capabilities in action .
Scala code and Java code will be shown side by side wherever comparison is relevant , but ( as you 'll discover ) many things in Scala have no direct correlation to anything you 've found in Java code -- and therein lies much of Scala 's charm !
After all , if Java code could do it , why bother learning Scala ?
Packages in the Java language have a few quirks to them , however :
The package declaration must appear at the top of the .
java file in which the package - scoped classes appear ( which causes some serious havoc with the language when trying to apply annotations to the package ) ; the declaration holds scope across the entire file .
This means that the rare case in which two classes are tightly - coupled across package boundaries has to be split across files , leading the unwary to not recognize the tight coupling between the two .
Scala takes a slightly different approach in respect to packaging , treating it as a combination of the Java language 's declaration approach and C# 's scope d approach .
With that in mind , a Java developer can do the traditional Java approach and put a package declaration at the top of a . scala file just as normal Java classes do ; the package declaration applies across the entire file scope just as it does in Java code .
Alternatively , a Scala developer can use Scala 's package " scoping " approach in which curly braces delimit the scope of the package statement , as in Listing 1 :
Listing 1 .
Packaging made simple
package com { package tedneward { package scala { package demonstration { object App { def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { System.out.println
( " Howdy , from packaged code ! " ) args.foreach(( i ) => System.out.println
( " Got " + i ) ) } } } } } }
Effectively , this code declares one class , App , or to be more precise , a single class called com.tedneward.scala.demonstration .App .
Note that Scala also permits the package names to be dot - separated , so Listing 1 could be written more tersely as shown in Listing 2 :
Listing 2 . Packaging made simple ( redux )
package com.tedneward.scala.demonstration { object App { def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { System.out.println
( " Howdy , from packaged code ! " ) args.foreach(( i ) => System.out.println
( " Got " + i ) ) } } }
Use whichever style seems more appropriate because they each compile into exactly the same code constructs .
( The scalac compile goes ahead and generates the .class files in package - declared subdirectories as javac does . )
Import
Of course , the logical flip - side of packaging is import , Scala 's mechanism for bringing names into the current lexical namespace .
Readers of this series have already seen import in a couple of samples before now , but it 's time for me to point out some of import 's features that will come as a surprise to Java developers .
First of all , you can use import anywhere inside the client Scala file , not just at the top of the file and correspondingly , will have scoped relevance .
Thus , in Listing 3 , the java . math .
BigInteger import is scoped entirely to the methods defined inside the object App and nowhere else .
If another class or object inside of mathfun wanted to use java . math .
BigInteger , it would need to import the class just as App did .
Or if several classes in mathfun all wanted to use java . math .
BigInteger , the import could occur at the package level outside the definition of App and all of the classes in this package scope will have BigInteger imported .
Listing 3 . Import scoping
package com { package tedneward { package scala { // ... package mathfun { object App { import java . math .
BigInteger def factorial ( arg : BigInteger ) : BigInteger = { if ( arg == BigInteger .
ZERO ) BigInteger .ONE else arg multiply ( factorial ( arg subtract BigInteger . ONE ) ) } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { if ( args.length > 0 ) System.out.println ( " factorial " + args ( 0 ) + " = " + factorial ( new BigInteger ( args ( 0 ) ) ) ) else System.out.
println ( " factorial 0 = 1 " ) } } } } } }
Importing does n't stop there , however .
Scala sees no real reason to differentiate between top - level members and nested ones , so you can use import to bring not just nested types into lexical scope , but any member ; by importing all of the names inside java .
math .
BigInteger , for example , you can drop the scoped references to ZERO and ONE to just name references as in Listing 4 :
Listing 4 . Static imports ... without the static
package com { package tedneward { package scala { // ... package mathfun { object App { import java . math .
BigInteger import BigInteger ._ def factorial ( arg : BigInteger ) : BigInteger = { if ( arg == ZERO ) ONE else arg multiply ( factorial ( arg subtract ONE ) ) } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { if ( args.length > 0 ) System.out.println ( " factorial " + args ( 0 ) + " = " + factorial ( new BigInteger ( args ( 0 ) ) ) ) else System.out.
println ( " factorial 0 = 1 " ) } } } } } }
By using the underscore ( remember the wildcard character in Scala ? ) , you effectively tell the Scala compiler that all of the members inside BigInteger should be brought into scope .
And because BigInteger has already been put into scope by the previous import statement , there 's no need to explicitly package - qualify the class name .
In fact , these could even be combined into a single statement because import can take multiple , comma-separated targets to import ( shown in Listing 5 ) :
Listing 5 . Bulk imports
package com { package tedneward { package scala { // ... package mathfun { object App { import java . math .
BigInteger , BigInteger ._ def factorial ( arg : BigInteger ) : BigInteger = { if ( arg == ZERO ) ONE else arg multiply ( factorial ( arg subtract ONE ) ) } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { if ( args.length > 0 ) System.out.println ( " factorial " + args ( 0 ) + " = " + factorial ( new BigInteger ( args ( 0 ) ) ) ) else System.out.
println ( " factorial 0 = 1 " ) } } } } } }
This saves you a line or two .
Note that the two cannot be combined : the first imports the BigInteger class itself and the second , the various members inside that first class .
You can also use import to introduce other non-constant members as well .
For example , consider a math utility library ( of questionable value perhaps , but still ... ) in Listing 6 :
Listing 6 . Enron 's accounting code
package com { package tedneward { package scala { // ... package mathfun { object BizarroMath { def bizplus ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a - b } def bizminus ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a + b } def bizmultiply ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a / b } def bizdivide ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a * b } } } } } }
Using this library could get quite annoying over time , having to type BizarroMath every time one of its members was requested , but Scala allows for each of the members of BizarroMath to be imported into the top - level lexical namespace , almost as if they were global functions ( shown in Listing 7 ) :
Listing 7 . Calculating Enron 's expenses
package com { package tedneward { package scala { package demonstration { object App2 { def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { import com.tedneward.scala.mathfun.BizarroMath._ System.out.println ( " 2 + 2 = " + bizplus ( 2,2 ) ) } } } } } }
There are other interesting constructs that would allow a Scala developer to write the more natural 2 bizplus 2 , but that will have to wait for another day .
( Readers curious about a potentially heavily - abusable Scala feature can look at the Scala implicit construct as covered in Programming in Scala by Odersky , Spoon , and Venners . )
Access
While packaging ( and importing ) are part of the encapsulation and packaging story in Scala , a large part of it , as with Java code , lies in its ability to restrict access to certain members in a selective way — in other words , in Scala 's ability to mark certain members " public , " " private , " or somewhere in - between .
The Java language has four levels of access : public , private , protected , and package - level access ( frustratingly applied by leaving out any keyword ) .
Scala :
Does away with package - level qualification ( in a way )
Uses " public " by default
Specifies " private " to mean " accessible only to this scope "
By contrast , " protected " is definitely different from its counterpart in Java code ; where a Java protected member is accessible to both subclasses and the package in which the member is defined , Scala chooses to grant access only to subclasses .
This means that Scala 's version of protected is more restrictive ( although arguably more intuitively so ) than the Java version .
Where Scala truly steps away from Java code , however , is that access modifiers in Scala can be " qualified " with a package name , indicating a level of access up to which the member may be accessed .
For example , if the BizarroMath package wants to grant member access to other members of the same package ( but not subclasses ) , it can use the code in Listing 8 to do so :
Listing 8 . Enron 's accounting code
package com { package tedneward { package scala { // ... package mathfun { object BizarroMath { def bizplus ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a - b } def bizminus ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a + b } def bizmultiply ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a / b } def bizdivide ( a : Int , b : Int ) = { a * b } private [ mathfun ] def bizexp ( a : Int , b : Int ) = 0 } } } } }
Note the private [ mathfun ] expression here .
In essence , the access modifier is saying that this member is private up to the package mathfun ; this means that any member of the package mathfun has access to bizexp but nothing outside of that package does , including subclasses .
The powerful meaning of this is that any package can be declared in the " private " or " protected " declaration all the way up to com ( or even _root_ which is an alias for the root namespace , thus essentially making private [ _root_ ] the same thing as " public " ) .
This provides a degree of flexibility in access specification far beyond what the Java language provides .
In fact , Scala offers one more degree of access specification : the object - private specification , illustrated by private [ this ] , which stipulates that the member in question can only be seen by members called on that same object , not from different objects , even if they are of the same type .
( This closes a small hole in the Java access specification system that was useful for Java programming interview questions and not much more . )
Note that the access modifiers will have to map on top of the JVM at some level and as a result , some of the subtleties in their definition will be lost when compiled or called from regular Java code .
For example , the BizarroMath example above ( with the private [ mathfun ] - declared member bizexp ) will generate the class definition in Listing 9 ( when viewed with javap ) :
Listing 9 . Enron 's accounting library , JVM view
Compiled from " packaging.scala " public final class com.tedneward.scala.mathfun.BizarroMath extends java.lang .
Object { public static final int $ tag ( ) ; public static final int bizexp ( int , int ) ; public static final int bizdivide ( int , int ) ; public static final int bizmultiply ( int , int ) ; public static final int bizminus ( int , int ) ; public static final int bizplus ( int , int ) ; }
As is obvious from the second line of the compiled BizarroMath class , the bizexp ( ) method was given a JVM - level access specifier of public which means that the subtle private [ mathfun ] distinction was lost once the Scala compiler was finished with its access checks .
As a result , for Scala code that is intended to be used from Java code , I 'd prefer to stick with the traditional " private " and " public " definitions .
( Even " protected " will sometimes end up mapping to JVM - level " public , " so when in doubt , consult javap against the actual compiled bytecode to be certain of its access level . )
Application
When talking about arrays in Scala ( Array [ T ] s to be exact ) obtaining the i'th element of the array is in fact " another one of those methods with funny names .... "
As it turns out , although I did n't want to get into the details then , this was n't exactly true .
OK , I admit it , I lied .
Technically , the use of the parentheses against the Array [ T ] class is a tad bit more complicated than simply a " method with a funny name " ; Scala reserves a particular nomenclature association for that particular sequence of characters ( that being the left - parens - right - parens sequence ) because that is so often used with a particular intent in mind : that of " doing " something ( or in functionalspeak , " applying " something to something ) .
In other words , Scala has a special syntax ( more accurately , a special syntactic relationship ) in place for the " application " operator " ( ) " .
To be precise , Scala recognizes the method called apply ( ) as the method to invoke when said object is invoked using ( ) as the method call .
For example , a class that wants to behave as a functor ( an object that acts as a function ) can define an apply method to provide function - or method - like semantics :
Listing 10 .
Play that Functor music , code boy !
class ApplyTest { import org.junit._ , Assert ._
@ Test def simpleApply = { class Functor { def apply ( ) : String = { " Doing something without arguments " } def apply ( i : Int ) : String = { if ( i == 0 ) " Done " else " Applying ... " + apply ( i - 1 ) } } val f = new Functor assertEquals ( " Doing something without arguments " , f ( ) ) assertEquals ( " Applying ...
Applying ...
Applying ... Done " , f( 3 ) ) } }
Curious readers will be wondering what makes a functor different from an anonymous function or closure .
As it turns out , the relationship is fairly obvious :
The Function1 type in the standard Scala library ( meaning a function that takes one parameter ) has an apply method on its definition .
A quick glance through some of the generated Scala anonymous classes for Scala anonymous functions will reveal that the generated classes are descendants of Function1 ( or Function2 or Function3 , depending on how many parameters the function takes ) .
This means that where anonymous or named functions do n't necessarily fit the design approach desired , a Scala developer can create a functor class , provide it with some initialization data stored in fields , and then execute it via ( ) without any common base class required ( as would be the case for a traditional Strategy pattern implementation ) :
Listing 11 .
I said ' play that Functor music , code boy !'
class ApplyTest { import org.junit._ , Assert ._ // ... @ Test def functorStrategy = { class GoodAdder { def apply ( lhs : Int , rhs : Int ) :
Int = lhs + rhs } class BadAdder(inflateResults : Int ) { def apply ( lhs : Int , rhs : Int ) :
Int = lhs + rhs * inflateResults } val calculator = new GoodAdder assertEquals ( 4 , calculator ( 2 , 2 ) ) val enronAccountant = new BadAdder ( 50 ) assertEquals ( 102 , enronAccountant ( 2 , 2 ) ) } }
Any class that provides the appropriately - argumented apply method will work when called as long as the arguments line up in number and in type .
Conclusion
Scala 's packaging , import , and access modifier mechanisms provide the fine degree of control and encapsulation that a traditional Java programmer has never enjoyed .
For example , they offer the ability to import select methods of an object , making them appear as global methods , without the traditional drawbacks of global methods ; they make working with those methods exceedingly easy , particularly if those methods are methods that provide higher - order functionality , such as the fictitious tryWithLogging function introduced earlier in this series ( " Do n't get thrown for a loop ! " ) .
Similarly , the " application " mechanism allows Scala to hide execution details behind a functional facade such that programmers may not even know ( or care ) that the thing they are invoking is n't actually a function but an object imbued with significant complexity .
The mechanism provides another dimension to Scala 's functional nature , one which can certainly be done from the Java language ( or C# or C++ for that matter ) but not with the degree of syntactic purity Scala provides .
That 's it for this installment ; until next time , enjoy !

Brian May , the guitarist and founding member of the legendary rock band Queen , earned his PhD in astronomy last year from Imperial College London .
His PhD thesis A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud has just been co-published by Springer and Canopus Publishing Ltd .
May 's thesis examines the Zodiacal Light , the misty diffuse cone of light seen in the West after sunset and the East before sunrise .
Though anyone can see the Zodiacal Light from a suitably dark location , it is poorly understood , and has been the subject of relatively little research .
May began his research of the Zodiacal Light in 1970 and completed his research and thesis in 2007 , following a 30 - year hiatus to play guitar in the well - known rock band Queen .
While some readers may expect a rock - and - roll guitarist to write a popular astronomy book , A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud is a rigorous , academic examination of the Zodiacal Light .
May 's thesis documents the building of a pressure - scanned Fabry - Perot Spectrometer , equipped with a photomultiplier and pulse - counting electronics , and its deployment at the Observatorio del Teide at Izaña in Tenerife , at an altitude of 7,700 feet ( 2,567 m ) , to record high - resolution spectra of the Zodiacal Light .
More than 250 scans of morning and evening Zodiacal Light were recorded , in two observing periods in 1971 and 1972 .
" I have thoroughly enjoyed my years playing guitar and recording music with Queen , but it 's extremely gratifying to see the publication of my thesis , A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud , " May said .
" I 've been fascinated with astronomy for years , and I was happy to finally complete my PhD last year and record my studies of the Zodiacal Light in this book . "

Research shows that as more scholarly and research journals are available online , researchers are citing fewer of them - and they are primarily newer papers .
There 's no question the Internet gives scientists and researchers instant access to a wealth of academic journals , a very good thing , but the impact had n't been studied until recently .
New research in Science says that scholars are actually citing fewer papers in their work , and the papers they do cite tend to be more recent publications .
This trend may be limiting the creation of new ideas and theories .
James Evans is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Chicago , who focuses on the nature of scholarly research .
During a lecture on the influence of private industry money on research , a student instead asked how the growth of the Internet has shaped science .
" I did n't have an immediate answer , " Evans said .
When he reviewed the research on the Internet and science , Evans discovered that most of it focused on much faster and broader the Internet allows scholars to search for information , but not how the medium itself was impacting their work .
" That 's where this idea came from .
I wanted to know how electronic provision changed science , not how much better it made it , " he said .
Evans analyzed a database of over 34 million articles and compared their online availability from 1998 to 2005 to the number of times they were cited from1945 to 2005 .
The results showed that as more journal issues came online , few articles were cited , and the ones that were cited tended to be more recent publications .
Scholars also seemed to concentrate their citations more on specific journals and articles .
" More is available , " Evans said , " but less is sampled , and what is sampled is more recent and located in the most prominent journals . "
Are life sciences researchers lazy ?
Evans 's research also found that this trend was not evenly distributed across academic disciplines .
Scientists and scholars in the life sciences showed the greatest propensity for referencing fewer articles , but the trend is less noticeable in business and legal scholarship .
Social scientists and scholars in the humanities are more likely to cite newer works than other disciplines .
So what is it about doing research online versus in a bricks - and - mortar library that changes the literature review so critical to research ?
Evans has identified a few possible explanations .
Studies into how research is conducted show that people browse and peruse material in a library , but they tend to search for articles online Online searches tend to organize results by date and relevance , which leads allows scholars and scientists to pick recent research from the most high profile journals .
Some search tools like Google factor the frequency with which other users select an item during similar searchers to determine relevance .
Online , researchers are also more likely to follow hyper - linked references and links to similar work within an online archive .
Because of this , as more scholars choose to read and reference a given article , future researchers more quickly follow .
Does this phenomenon spell the end of the literature review ?
Evans does n't think so , but he does believe that it makes scholars and scientists more likely to come to a consensus and establish a conventional wisdom on a given topic faster .
" Online access facilitates a convergence on what science is picked up and built upon in subsequent research . "
Is there a rush to popularity ?
The danger in this , he believes , is that if new productive ideas and theories are n't picked up quickly by the research community , they may fade before their useful impact is evaluated .
" It 's like new movies .
If movies do n't get watched the first weekend , they 're dropped silently , " Evans said .
Evans plans to work with linguists and computer scientists to explore how ideas are expressed in articles to better understand what the consequences of losing old ideas are and how they can be retrieved and resurrected , a challenge he sees as being important in the pursuit of knowledge .
" With science and scholarship increasing online , findings and ideas that do n't receive attention very soon will be forgotten more quickly than ever before . "

IN 1968 Garrett Hardin , a professor of biology , published an article in the journal Science that was to have a profound impact on the social sciences , including economics .
In it , he explained “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” .
“ Picture a pasture open to all , ” he wrote .
A herdsman grazing his animals on the land will have an incentive “ to add another animal to his herd .
And another ; and another …
But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons .
Therein is the tragedy . ”
Each herdsman captures all the benefit from an extra animal but the cost of overgrazing is borne by all .
Hardin 's example was not new .
It was first mentioned by a mathematician , William Foster Lloyd , in 1833 ; the idea goes back to Aristotle .
But it struck a chord .
The idea seemed plausible in itself and was borne out by history .
Britain had had a system of common land before the 18th century ; its enclosure ( privatisation by landowners ) made possible the agricultural revolution .
Hardin 's analysis suggested two things .
First , that the commons are somehow backward , characteristic of tribes living in rainforests , or of pastoral nomads in African drylands .
Second , that tragedy is inevitable .
From the point of view of efficiency , the commons should probably be replaced by systems of public or personal ownership .
An unsolvable problem of the past might not seem like fertile ground for debate .
But 40 years after Hardin 's article , the problem of the commons is still pressing .
It is not simply that three - quarters of those living on less than $ 2 a day still depend in some way on commonly held resources .
The concept of the commons is also spreading to new areas .
Their essential feature is that they share one characteristic with private property and one with public goods .
Like public goods , they are not “ excludable ” : the common resource is too extensive to keep people out very easily .
But they are also “ subtractable ” ( or “ rivalrous ” ) , like private property : if one person uses them , another 's access is diminished .
( With a classic public good , such as street lighting , one person 's usage does not affect anyone else . )
Many things other than rainforests or drylands share these attributes .
Indeed an entire industry seems to have sprung up to identify “ new commons ” ( such as the internet ) or to claim as commons things not always seen that way .
Silence , for example , should arguably be seen as a commons , because if one person interrupts it , there is less of it for others to enjoy .
At the biennial meeting of the International Association for the Study of the Commons in July , Charlotte Hess of Syracuse University extended the concept of the commons from traditional natural resources to things such as medicine , knowledge and what are usually seen as global public goods , like the oceans and Antarctica . *
The other implication of Hardin 's analysis — that the commons are doomed — came under attack early on .
When economists began to look at how systems of commonly managed resources actually worked , they found to their surprise that they often worked quite well .
Swiss Alpine pastures ; Japanese forests ; irrigation systems in Spain and the Philippines .
All these were examples of commons that lasted for decades .
Some irrigation networks held in common were more efficiently run than the public and private systems that worked alongside them .
Though there were failures , too , it seemed as if good management could stave off the tragedy .
Before he died , Hardin admitted he should have called his article “ The Tragedy of the Unmanaged Commons ” .
In “ Governing the Commons ” , which was published in 1990 , Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University described the rules needed to keep a commons going .
She showed that there are almost always elaborate conventions over who can use resources and when .
What you take out of a commons has to be proportional to what you put in .
Usage has to be compatible with the commons ' underlying health ( ie , you can not just keep grazing your animals regardless ) .
Everyone has to have some say in the rules .
And people usually pay more attention to monitoring abuses and to conflict resolution than to sanctions and punishment .
The comedy of the commons
Defining the commons is also vital .
In systems run by a few families , people are very precise about which bit of forest or seashore they manage .
In systems too large for a single group , there are layers of decision - making : the nomads of the Sahel , for example , used to have overlapping informal authorities up and down the Niger river .
Tragedy often occurs when governments come along in hobnailed boots and trample over these informal systems , as happened in the Sahel during a dreadful drought in the 1970s .
The big unanswered question is how far the things that economists have learnt about traditional commons apply to the “ new commons ” .
In the case of global warming , the commons is the whole earth .
It is not easy to see how rules that encourage shared responsibility can be made to stick .
Yet this has happened in other international examples .
Mrs Ostrom suggests the so - called “ miracle of the Rhine ” — the clean - up of Europe 's busiest waterway — should be seen as an example of successful commons management because it was not until local pressure groups , city and regional governments and non-governmental organisations got involved that polluters were willing to recognise the costs they were imposing on others , and cut emissions .
An inter -governmental body ( the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine ) did not have the same effect .
The economics of the new commons is still in its infancy .
It is too soon to be confident about its hypotheses .
But it may yet prove a useful way of thinking about problems , such as managing the internet , intellectual property or international pollution , on which policymakers need all the help they can get .

Deep sea treasures : Hundreds of new species found at Great Barrier Reef
Hundreds of new marine animal species , including colourful soft corals , crustaceans and worms , have been discovered on reefs off the Australian coast .
The wealth of finds , at Lizard and Heron islands on the Great Barrier Reef , and Ningaloo Reef in north - western Australia , surprised researchers taking part in the global Census of Marine Life ( CoML ) .
A green banded snapping shrimp ( top ) and Comb Jellyfish were two of the new species discovered off Heron Island
Far from being cut off from humanity , the sites harbouring the new species are well known to divers .
About half the soft coral species catalogued were thought to be new to science .
Researchers also found dozens of crustacean species , possibly representing more than one family of animals , that were previously unknown .
They included new species of shrimp - like tanaids , some with claws longer than their bodies .
Up to 60 per cent of tiny amphipod crustaceans , the insects of the marine world , were not currently described .
Other major finds included many potentially new ' bristle worms ' , relatives of leeches and earth worms .
Up to two - thirds of those found at Lizard Island alone were thought to belong to new species .
Dendronepthya soft coral ( l ) and a Nardoa Rosea sea star ( r ) were found in the warm waters off Australia 's north - western coast
Census of Marine Life chief scientist Dr Ron O'Dor , from Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , said : ' Amazingly colourful corals and fishes on reefs have long dazzled divers , but our eyes are just opening to the astonishing richness of other life forms in these habitats .
' Hundreds of thousands of forms of life remain to be discovered . '
The scientists left behind plastic structures described as ' empty dolls houses ' to provide homes for marine animals at Lizard and Heron islands .
Creatures that move into the Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures ( ARMS ) will be studied over the next three years .
Dr Julian Caley , from the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville , Queensland , and co-leader of the CoML CReefs project , said : ' We were all surprised and excited to find such a large variety of marine life never before described .
' Compared to what we do n't know , our knowledge of marine life is a proverbial drop in the ocean .
Inventorying the vast diversity and abundance of life across all ocean realms challenges both science and the imagination . '
Nearly six years ago , Deputy Drug Czar Scott Burns mailed a two - page letter to every prosecutor in America urging them to target and “ aggressively prosecute ” marijuana violators , including first - time offenders .
At that time , I spent some 5,000 words addressing Mr. Burns numerous lies and exaggerations — which included this shocking statement , “ No drug matches the threat posed by marijuana . ”
Yes folks , in 2002 that was the official position of your federal government .
Fast forward to today and you ’ll see that little , if anything , has changed among the Czars who cohabit the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Earlier this month Scott Burns flew to Humbolt County in northern California where he gave this revealing ( as in , it reveals just how clueless this man really is ) interview with the editors of the Arcata Eye , explaining why the White House continues to believe that pot remains the most dangerous herb on the planet .
However , rather than bleed my fingertips to the bone responding to Mr. Burns ’ inherent inability to tell the truth , this time around I ’m simply going to let his words speak for themselves .
An interview with Scott Burns , deputy drug czar – July 25 , 2008
via The Arcata Eye
Eye :
Is it realistic to keep marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug , in with cocaine and heroin ?
Burns :
Yes it is , and I ’ll tell you why .
…
You ca n’t talk to a counselor in this country , Republican or a Democrat or an independent or a Marxist , and they will tell you , political beliefs aside , everyone that is addicted to drugs in this United States , started with either alcohol and / or marijuana , and they started when they were 13 , 12 or 11 .
That does n’t mean everyone that used those substances goes on to be a heroin addict , but you do n’t have to have an IQ over 120 to figure out that if you can keep young people off marijuana , you can keep them from being addicted for life .
The last thing I ’ll say is , we were talking about Nora Volkov , the head of NIDA , National Institute of Drug Abuse , who before said there is no correlation between smoking pot and rewiring and damaging the developing brain of young people , who now will tell you unequivocally that there is .
Because of the higher potency , it is the same as cocaine and methamphetamine and heroin .
They see it from the MRIs , the PET scans .
They also are seeing psychosis and other mental problems from young people smoking this higher potency , which frankly should be called marijuana 2.0 , drug .
So yeah , it should remain a schedule 1 .
Eye : …
Is there enough research to indicate that [ marijuana ] has no medical efficacy ?
I can bring you chemotherapy patients who would tell you that it is the only thing that suppresses their nausea and gives them an appetite .
So is there nothing to what they ’re saying and feeling ?
Burns : …
Anybody can say something makes me feel better anecdotally .
And I hear that a lot .
“ Marijuana is the only thing that makes me feel good . ”
I say you should try crack , because from what I hear , crack cocaine will make you feel really good as well .
This is not about making people feel better , it ’s about as a country and the effects it will have on all of us , all 305 million of us .
Because someone tells me that “ smoking crack cocaine releases my nausea and allows me to have healthier appetite , ” does that mean that we legalize it nationwide , and that its available to kids in a greater number ?
We have to make those kind of policy decisions .
And we ought not make them on people who say , “ Me personally , it makes me feel better . ” …
Yeah , the whole thing is a con .
If you wanna call it what it is , it ’s a joke .
Eye : … I could tell you without question that there are innumerable , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions of people who smoke marijuana on a regular basis , are fully functioning contributing citizens .
Other than the fact that they do something that the government tells them is illegal .
They ’re contributing , they ’re motivated , they obey the law , they vote , they pay taxes , they have children and they smoke marijuana .
What about that ?
Does n’t the federal government ’s prohibition of this drug simply put a lot of profit in it for criminals , breed criminal enterprises and also breed disrespect for the authority of government ?
Burns : …
Whether or not they are functioning or not , there are others that say , they sit on the couch and eat Cheetos , and I ’ve talked to hundreds of moms and dads that have said I wish you could do something , because my son has done nothing in 25 years but sit around and smoke dope .
So for every person you have that you say is a taxpaying successful person , I could give you , I think five , of a mom and a dad or a loved one say , “ My god , this addiction to this drug is a horrible thing . ”
Eye : … [ T ] he whole premise of America ’s freedom and self determination .
How can we reconcile that with the government telling us what we can ingest and what we can’t ?
Burns : … [ O ] n many issues … I think most Americans would agree that it should be that way .
But on some issues that affect all of us for the good of the order we have to come to some consensus .
And not everybody ’s happy , are they ?
And every time we do n’t get to do what we want , I know there are states where they really really like to marry young girls , 12 , 11 , or 10 and they would argue to you , “ How dare the federal government preclude us from engaging in certain activities ? ”
Well , in some instances we just say your , quote , “ constitutional rights ” and your freedom to do certain things gets trumped by the rest of us who say , “ You know that ’s just not a good idea . ”
You get simple to follow course content that you can access anytime , anywhere .

US officials are fiercely putting out a series of economic fires with all eyes now focused on the fate of Washington Mutual after AIG became the latest company to be thrown a lifeline .
According to the New York Post , US banking regulators are actively searching for a candidate to take over the Seattle , Washington - based bank amid fears it could be the next to be felled by the economic maelstrom .
The New York Times said on Wednesday that the bank had hired Goldman Sachs to discuss a possible sale , with possible bidders including institutions such as Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase and HSBC .
Washington Mutual , the country ’s largest savings and loan , is now seen as one of the firms the most exposed to the current mortgage crisis sweeping the ailing housing sector .
Known as WaMu , it has seen its stocks savaged in a bloodbath on US markets in recent weeks , losing some 85 per cent of their value this year .
Shares plunged again on Wednesday on the stock market losing some 13.36 per cent to end the day at US $ 2.01 ( S$ 2.87 ) .
The west coast bank ’s total share value is now set at less than US $ 4 billion .
The Wall Street Journal said Wells Fargo and Citigroup had shown an initial interest .
But if no buyer emerges , the government could be forced to place the bank into conservatorship , the New York Times said .

Ed Note : Sometimes it 's hard to hear music as described on the page .
Bill DeMain 's story on Miles Davis and Kind of Blue in our latest magazine is wonderful , but we wanted to make sure readers actually got to hear the sounds .
So we asked Ransom to remix it with any YouTube clips he could find .
The following is a mish - mash of Bill 's story and Ransom 's writing , all enhanced with Miles ' music .
We 're hoping it gives readers a slightly richer experience .
Enjoy !
Music icon Miles Davis has long been revered as a jazz pioneer -- but what exactly did he pioneer ?
To some purists , jazz music can be broken into two distinct eras : Before Miles and After Miles .
A student and bandmate of Bebop legends Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker , Miles ' musical education took place occasionally at the Julliard School of Music but mostly in the smoky clubs of 52nd street , where he was trained in the esoteric art of " hot jazz , " a hyper - complex , acrobatic style of playing torrential melodies at breakneck tempos .
Miles was a quick study , but after a year touring as a rising star in Charlie Parker 's band , he dropped out in 1958 .
Miles found that the " hot " stuff did n't speak to his soul ; instead , he was captivated by the pensive , intimate sounds of pianist Thelonious Monk , singer Billie Holiday and composer Gil Evans .
Their songs cut deeper and played more slowly than popular " hot jazz " tunes , and with those musicians ' help and influence , he pioneered a style known as " cool jazz , " which focused the genre 's intensity into a laser beam of sound .
Here are some clips that help illustrate the " birth of the cool , " as music historians have dubbed it .
A quiet fire : the early years
From early in his career , Miles was obsessed with the idea that a single note could convey all the beauty of music .
That idea started to take form in his one - off recordings from the late 1940s , when to most Americans he was nothing special -- just another fast - blowing sideman who'd once played with Charlie Parker .
Jobs were scarce and he drifted around , on the cusp of celebrity but not truly finding it until he moved to Paris in 1949 , where he was hailed as a jazz god .
When he returned to he U.S. , the contrast was unbearable , and Miles ' career almost went permanently off the rails .
Broke , bored and frustrated by a lack of creative momentum , he turned to heroin -- a period in his life he would later call " a four - year horror show . "
By 1954 , the junk was threatening everything he held dear .
Shunned by even his closest friends , he returned to his hometown of St. Louis , where he locked himself in his family 's guest house for two months and kicked the habit cold - turkey .
After that , his resolve to find a new sound grew stronger than ever , and his playing became richer .
It was imbued with a deep loneliness and heartache that had n't been there before -- on full display in his 1955 release ' Round About Midnight , which put Davis back on the map .
Here 's a clip from the title track , " ' Round Midnight , " a song written by Thelonious Monk :
On this album , he pared down his solos and found drama in moments of silence ; Miles ' " cool " aesthetic dominates the beginning of the song .
Here , Miles trumpet has a depth of feeling and starkness that never errs on the side of sentimentality .
( The clip is from a performance in Stockholm , 1967 , and features Wayne Shorter on sax and Herbie Hancock on the piano . )
He now had all the tools he needed to construct his masterpiece , Kind of Blue .
Miles ' " Blue " Period
Sessions for Kind of Blue commenced on March 2 , 1959 in a converted Greek Orthodox church in Manhattan .
Together with his sextet , which included pianist Bill Evans and saxophonist John Coltrane , Davis was creating beautiful compositions spontaneously .
He abandoned the usual chord progressions that govern jazz and supplied only outlines for his pieces .
To capture the spirit of discovery , he gave his band vague directions : telling them to " play this pretty " or make it " Latin- flavored . "
After just nine - hours in the studio , they were finished , and the resulting album tracks are all first takes ; " First - take feelings -- they 're generally the best , " remarked pianist Evans .
Here clips from a few tracks on this classic album .
So What ?
The five tracks on Kind of Blue may have been improvised , but they did n't come out of nowhere .
" So What " is n't just the name of a song -- it was one of Miles ' favorite expressions .
Whenever someone would challenge him on an idea or decision , he would respond in his raspy voice : " so what ? "
You can hear his motto in the sassy two - note phrases that run throughout the song .
Freddie Freeloader
This tune was named after a guy who often tried to sneak into Miles ' gigs without paying , and the groove captures Freddie 's slippery personality .
It also features what many feel are some of the best solos on the album , a part of Miles ' musical legacy that went on to influence lots of other musicians ; you can hear it in the free - roaming solos of guitarist Duane Allman and the keyboard works of the Doors ' Ray Manzarek .
Ken has his say
Ken Burns ' Jazz is a great film that has a segment devoted to the making of Kind of Blue .
It 's worth watching just for the interviews ; the reverence with which critics and other musicians talk about Miles speaks volumes .
Miles : the later years
After briefly touring behind Kind of Blue , Miles set off on new adventures .
During the next 30 years , until his death in 1991 , he pioneered the use of electric instruments in jazz and experimented with rock , funk and pop .
Some jazz purists felt that Miles went from birthing the cool to chasing it -- they point to his final album , You 're Under Arrest , which includes covers ( excuse me , " jazz reinterpretations " ) of Cyndi Lauper 's " Time After Time " and Michael Jackson 's " Human Nature " .
Check out this strange , very 80s video for " Decoy , " a soul - electronica hybrid which sounds about as far from " Freddie Freeloader " as you can get while still playing the trumpet :
Despite critics of his later work , however , it could be argued that , having perfected his vision of " cool jazz , " it was natural for Davis to move on to other styles and musical expressions .
No matter : even if he 'd released five Michael Jackson cover albums , Kind of Blue ensured he 'd always be known as the Father of the Cool ; it was moment in musical history when his spare phrasing and sense of melodic space found an answer to the eternal question : " What is the sound of one note swinging ? "
What To Do With All the Felons ?
As Glenn Greenwald has been recently pointing out , the entire upper echelon of the Bush presidency are rank crooks , criminals and felons of the most serious sort who are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands for the most nefarious and lying of motives .
Joan McCarter of Daily Kos has meticulously documented and followed the many crimes of Bush and his minions as they trampled all over the FISA statue in some slimy authoritarian quest , comprehensible in its necessity only to creeps .
Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake followed the gross crimes inflicted upon Valerie Plame , her family and the CIA for years , adding another layer of treachery and betrayal to the American people in sick , deadly criminality .
Irrespective that Bush ’s VP and his closest advisor were and are obvious felons in the matter , Bush should have been impeached over the noxiously gross breach of process and justice when he commuted Libby ’s sentence .
Tragically the liberal uproar over impeachment is about to be officially moot , the one - time window of availability for accountability and adherence to principle about to irrevocably slam shut .
Not impeaching Bush does not mean he and his administration are at all immune from further prosecution , of course not , there is no statute of limitations for lying to kill , for treachery , or for spying on our people .
Digby of Hullabaloo has written the worst decision Bill Clinton ever made was letting Iran - Contra slide in the name of healing and " getting things done . "
The decision flat - out sanctioned criminal behavior in Republican minds while showing Democrats to be easy manipulated weaklings , leading to the totally credible thesis that such inadvertent sanction of criminality is partly responsible for the cadre of crooks we have for an Executive Branch now .
Since impeachment is folded away , what is the path forward for the all the Bush crimes next January in the first year of the fervently hoped - for Obama Presidency ?
Should he win in November , will Obama usher in another Let It All Slide episode of criminal American presidential history ?
Sarah Robinson of The Big Con has written eloquently and fervent hope that an Obama victory can be fundamentally viewed as the Boomers finally getting their obsolete Vietnam - racism - sexism battles put behind us , mercifully moved on to history so Barack Obama can give politics and our young people a fresh start .
Would n’t starting the process of putting Bush and Cheney behind bars for life be an inherent act of looking backward , of living in the past ?
Frank Rich passed on the Obama quote of this generational aloofness today as above “ the psychodrama of the baby boom generation . ”
The selling point of Mr. Obama ’s vision of change is not doctrinaire liberalism or Bush - bashing .
I think that ’s a compelling rationale for the future and a much needed anecdote to a lot of our current political problems — not all , of course not , but many , should a future President Obama be good enough and have the support to pull that off .
Urgent change looking forward free from the shackles of the past is critical for the health of the Republic , yet what about the dead and wounded , and all that grieve for them left behind ?
What about Valerie Plame , her family and all her people at the CIA ?
What about the basic precious rights for all Americans that were tossed to the shitcan when they spied on us ?
Well , there may be some other kind of remedy .
There may be some sort of truth and reconciliation commission process that ’s been tried in other countries , South Africa , Salvador and what not , where if you come forward and admit that you were in error or admit that you lied , admit that you did something , then you ’re forgiven .
Otherwise , you are censured in some way .
Censured in what way , Mr. Clarke ?
Censure and depravity to truth , justice , accountability and adherence to constitutional principle ?
Is that path “ forward ” worth not being shackled to all the noxious boomer baggage that will hold us back ?
I hope the reader understands how fervently I do not wish to hoist the leader of my own party on this nasty political prong when the mission is to beat John McCain .
I am a small person with few answers ; service , judging by what God gave me , should always be my primary path in this life .
I proudly bought Obama lawn signs , bumper - stickers and clothes yesterday and will help the Obama campaign again today in my $ 2,300 2008 Presidential election goal .
I like being a good soldier for the Party .
Adherence to truth and events force me to state , however , that prosecuting Bush and Cheney for life behind bars while somehow simultaneously launching a new political paradigm very necessarily free from boomer baggage will be one of the first great challenges of the Obama Presidency .
Marginalize me as a boomer Bush - basher , it ’s cool , but the sacrifices of the dead and wounded for nothing but criminal lies will never be ignored as long as I breathe .
Every time I use perl I feel mildly positive about it right up until I encounter CPAN .
I 've never managed to make CPAN work , despite the multitude of systems I 've tried it on over the years .
Is there some secret I do n't know ?
To install one module ( " install Google : : Chart " ) there 's a hilarious chain of literally almost a hundred dependencies that CPAN auto - infers .
That 's fine enough .
But it eventually gets back to Class ::C3 , which wants Algorithm : : C3 , which it happily installs ( eventually printing " *** Algorithm :: C3 successfully installed . " ) and then fails all its test cases :
# Failed test 'use Class ::C3 ; '
# at t/00 _load.t line 9 .
# Tried to use ' Class : : C3 ' .
# Error : Can't locate Algorithm / C3.pm in @INC ( @INC contains : /home / martine/.cpan/build/Class-C3-0.19/i nc /home / martine/.cpan/build/Class-C3-0.19/b lib/lib /home/ martine/.cpan/build/Class-C3-0.19/b lib/arch /home / martine/.cpan/build/Test-Simple-0.8 0/blib/arch /home/martine/.cpan/build/Test-Simple-0.8 0/blib/lib /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8 /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.8
/usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5
/usr/lib/perl/5.8 /usr/share/perl/5.8 /usr/local/lib/site_perl . ) at /home / martine/.cpan/build/Class-C3-0.19/b
lib/lib/Class/C3.pm line 25 .
If I run it again , it again claims Algorithm : : C3 is n't installed , while if I run " install Algorithm : : C3 " , it claims it 's not installed .
The thing that really gets me here is that though this is different in the details than the other problems I 've had with CPAN , in practice this is effectively exactly the problem I had before the last time I tried Perl out ( I guess that was mid-2006 , because I think I was in Japan ) .
Is CPAN just perpetually screwed ?
Here 's some guesses after spending five minutes poking around : maybe they were lying when they said I could set the PREFIX ?
I notice that include path does n't include the prefix I 'd specified .
Maybe this AutoInstall module does n't work with it ?
" The Germans pushed us into the ground floor , a kind of stall .
I pushed myself into a corner , the others lay on the ground .
Through the door frame I saw the Germans bringing up heavy boxes and heard someone running down the stairs .
After the explosion I remember nothing . "
Later that day , the 15 - year - old was pulled from the rubble by villagers .
He was the only survivor .
A team of astronomers has discovered the least luminous , most dark matter - filled galaxy known to exist .
The Segue 1 galaxy is one of about two dozen small satellite galaxies orbiting our own Milky Way .
This is a very faint galaxy , a billion times less bright than the Milky Way .
But despite its small number of visible stars , Segue 1 is nearly a thousand times more massive than it appears , meaning most of its mass must come from dark matter .
â€ œSegue 1 is the most extreme example of a galaxy that contains only a few hundred stars , yet has a relatively large mass , â€ said Marla Geha , an assistant professor of astronomy at Yale and lead author on a paper about Segue 1 .
Geha and her colleagues have observed about half of the dwarf satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way .
These objects are so faint and contain so few stars that at first they were thought to be globular clusters â€ “ tightly bound star clusters that also orbit our host galaxy .
But by analyzing the light coming from the objects using the Keck telescope in Hawaii , the researchers determined these objects are actually galaxies , but just very faint .
Looking only at the light emitted by these ultra - faint galaxies , Geha and her colleagues expected them to have correspondingly low masses .
Instead , they discovered that they are between 100 and 1000 times more massive than they appear .
Invisible dark matter , she said , must account for the difference .
Although dark matter doesnâ€™t emit or absorb light , scientists can measure its gravitational effect on ordinary matter and believe it makes up about 85 percent of the total mass in the universe .
Finding ultra - faint galaxies like Segue 1 , which is so rife with dark matter , provides clues as to how galaxies form and evolve , especially at the smallest scales .
â€ œThese dwarf galaxies tell us a great deal about galaxy formation , â€ Geha said .
â€ œFor example , different theories about how galaxies form predict different numbers of dwarf galaxies versus large galaxies .
So just comparing numbers is significant.â€ 
Itâ€™s only recently that astronomers have discovered just how prevalent these dwarf satellite galaxies are , thanks to projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , which imaged large areas of the nighttime sky in greater detail than ever before .
In the past two years alone , the number of known dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way has doubled from the dozen or so brightest that were discovered during the first half of the twentieth century .
Geha predicts astronomers will find even more as they continue to sift through new data .
â€œThe galaxies I now consider bright used to be the least luminous ones we knew about , â€ she said .
â€ œItâ€™s a totally new regime .
This is a story thatâ€™s just unfolding .â€ 

The three - year - old gag order imposed on Advanced Micro Devices ' antitrust lawsuit against Intel should be lifted , according to an Aug. 21 court filing by media outlets the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and Computer & Communications Industry Association .
AMD originally filed the antitrust case against Intel in 2005 , claiming Intel operates a microprocessor monopoly and used a rebate program to persuade customers into avoiding competitors ' products .
Intel sells 80 percent of the microprocessors sold in the market and controls 90 percent of the revenue in the microprocessor market .
The judge in the Delaware case issued a 2005 gag order on all participants in the case to protect trade secrets .
" We trust the court can find a way to protect the companies ' trade secrets , without blocking all information on the allegations in this case , " Ed Black , CCIA president and CEO , said in a statement .
" Intel has already been fined $ 25 million in South Korea for engaging in this illegal , anticompetitive rebate program .
We would hope evidence related to that illegal behavior and business practice would not be something anyone would want to or could afford to emulate . "
In addition to the South Korean antitrust fine , which Intel is appealing , and the AMD charges against the chip maker , Intel also faces a " statement of objections " filed by the European Commission in 2007 claiming Intel violated European Union antitrust laws by selling chips below cost to major customers to limit the use of AMD chips .
In addition , the New York attorney general launched an investigation in January into whether Intel used rebates , predatory pricing and exclusive contracts to harm AMD 's rival market position .
In 2005 , Japan 's Fair Trade Commission found Intel violated antitrust regulations through a rebate scheme involving Toshiba and others designed to limit AMD sales .
" The public has a well - established right to observe what is going on in our courts , whether it is a criminal trial or a business dispute , " CCIA attorney David Finger said .
" Each in its own way has an important impact on society and public access promotes confidence that justice is being done fairly . "
The CCIA and others involved in seeking a lift of the gag order in the Delaware case contend the protective order has been too broadly applied , with the result being virtually no documents in the case are available to the public or the media .
" For example , Intel 's response to the plaintiffs ' [ AMD ] statement filed on May 15 , most parts which allege Intel 's individual behaviors toward the computer manufacturers were redacted , even though the events took place so long ago that there is no likely reason that their disclosure could cause competitive damage , " the court filing states .
" Similarly , some redactions clearly contain nothing more than lists of third party employees .
Identifying personnel in companies not party to this litigation cannot reasonably be construed to cause competitive injury , nor does such information implicate personal privacy interests , yet this information has also been redacted from public view . "
The filing adds , " Of course , litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them . "
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant fuel there is , but extracting it from water or organic material is currently not a very efficient process .
Scientists are therefore studying certain bacteria that exhale hydrogen as part of their normal metabolism .
" The production of hydrogen by microorganisms is intimately linked to their cellular processes , which must be understood to optimize bioenergy yields , " said Amy VanFossen of North Carolina State University .
Of particular interest are microbes that thrive in hot temperatures , near the boiling point of water .
VanFossen and her colleagues carried out a detailed DNA study of one of these thermophilic ( heat - loving ) bacteria called Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus , which was first found in a hot spring in New Zealand .
The results , presented last week at the American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia , indicate which genes allow C. saccharolyticus to eat plant material , referred to as biomass , and expel hydrogen in the process .
Hydrogen economy
Fuel cell vehicles are starting to be available for lease in California and the New York area .
They run off of hydrogen gas and emit only water vapor out the tail pipe .
Hydrogen can be found everywhere : it 's the " H " in H2O and a major element in biological processes .
The problem is that it takes quite a bit of energy to separate the hydrogen from the molecules it is found in .
However , certain organisms , such as the bacteria in cow stomachs , get energy from food through a chemical reaction that releases hydrogen gas .
Often this hydrogen is immediately taken up by other bacteria , called methanogens , that convert it to methane .
One of the challenges , therefore , of producing hydrogen from bacteria is to prevent the methanogens from gobbling up the gas .
The advantage of thermophiles is that they operate at temperatures that are typically too hot for methanogens .
C. saccharolyticus , for example , prefers a toasty 160 degrees Fahrenheit ( 70 degrees Celsius ) .
Furthermore , the chemistry of hydrogen formation is easier at these higher temperatures , said Servé Kengen from Wageningen University in the Netherlands .
" In general , thermophiles have a simpler fermentation pattern compared to [ lower temperature ] mesophiles , resulting in fewer byproducts , " he said .
Bionic microbe
Kengen is part of a European Union project called Hyvolution , which is developing decentralized hydrogen production that can be performed near where biomass is grown .
" Biological hydrogen production is well suited for decentralized energy production , " Kengen said .
" The process is performed at almost ambient temperature and pressure , and therefore it is expected to be less energy intensive than thermochemical or electrochemical production methods [ which are alternative ways to get hydrogen ] . "
Kengen said that C. saccharolyticus , or what he calls " Caldi , " is very attractive for this application .
It is unique in that it eats a wide range of plant materials , including cellulose , and can digest different sugars ( technically carbohydrates ) at the same time .
" The wide range of carbohydrates it grows on suggests that C. saccharolyticus will yield a plethora of industrially relevant carbohydrate degrading enzymes , " VanFossen told LiveScience .
These enzymes — now isolated through VanFossen 's genetic analysis — could help get more hydrogen from a given quantity of biomass .
" Once we are able to engineer Caldi ( not yet possible ) we want to further improve its hydrogen producing capacity , " Kengen said .

The Fact Sheet from the U.S. Treasury states :
The purchases are intended to be residential and commercial mortgage - related assets , which may include mortgage - backed securities and whole loans .
The Secretary will have the discretion , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , to purchase other assets , as deemed necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets .
So Paulson , in consultation with Bernanke , could “ deem it necessary ” to “ stabilize ” the financial markets by buying boat loads of gold .
Or by cornering the market in uranium or platinum .
Or they could decide that they needed to buy Microsoft and Google .
Just like Bush and Cheney have gotten us into oil wars and wars to protect Israel under the guise of being necessary to protect our national defense , Paulson and Bernanke could do anything they want by pretending it is for the stability of the financial markets , especially since no one could challenge their actions in court .
Calling all designers , developers , information architects , project managers , writers , editors , marketers , and everyone else who makes websites .
It is time once again to pool our information so as to begin sketching a true picture of the way our profession is practiced worldwide .
Possibly the most important invention of the past century , the web is undeniably one of the most robust engines of knowledge transfer , political and social change , artistic endeavor , and economic growth the world has seen .
Remove the web , and billions in trade disappear .
Websites enable people who ca n’t walk to run to the store .
They bring knowledge and freedom of thought to places where such things are scarce ; make every person with a connection a citizen of the world ; and allow every citizen to be heard .
Yet nobody bothered to conduct a serious inquiry into the working conditions of people who make websites until A List Apart launched its first survey in 2007 .
Last year nearly 33,000 of you took the survey , enabling us to begin figuring out what kinds of job titles , salaries , and work situations are common in our field .
The responses to last year ’s survey began teaching the world about the previously invisible profession powering its information economy .
The responses also taught us what we did wrong in constructing the survey .
This year ’s survey corrects many of last year ’s mistakes , with more detailed and numerous questions for freelance contractors and owners of ( or partners in ) small web businesses .
There are also better international categories , and many other improvements recommended by those who took the survey last year .
As we did last year , we will analyze this year ’s data and publish the results for all to see in an upcoming issue of A List Apart .
We will also , as we did last year , provide an “ anonymized ” version of the raw data , so that the highly motivated among you can do your own number crunching .
Enough talk !
Please take the survey and encourage your friends and colleagues who make websites to do likewise .
The world is watching .

In Italia esiste pure un'associazione e questo fa ben sperare .

C'è qualcuno che ne sa di più e vuole offrirmi consulenza ?
L’iniziativa , si legge in una nota diffusa dall ' assessorato , intende avviare un confronto per la realizzazione di un progetto di inserimento della Capra Cashmere nella regione , attraverso la creazione di una rete di allevatori a supporto dell ’ organizzazione e della gestione dell ’ allevamento e di tutti gli aspetti ad esso correlati , dalla programmazione dei servizi di pascolo regolato , ai controlli igienico - sanitari , alla produzione e commercializzazione del filato in cashmere .
La Capra Cashmere , famosa soprattutto per la fibra pregiata che produce , possiede molte caratteristiche perfettamente adattabili al territorio valdostano .
Selezionato per vivere nell ’estrema variabilità ambientale e climatica delle zone di montagna , questo animale può essere allevato ovunque , in particolare laddove , per motivi di degrado del terreno o mancanza di viabilità , non sono consentiti l’utilizzo di mezzi agricoli né grossi investimenti in ricoveri o attrezzature sofisticate .
Vive all ’aria aperta durante tutto l’anno , anche nelle zone più povere e su terreni marginali , cibandosi di piante infestanti e non utilizzabili da altri animali , assumendo così una funzione di « diserbante naturale » , di grande utilità nella pulizia del sottobosco , con evidenti vantaggi in termini di bonifica dei terreni e prevenzione degli incendi .

Frank :
" We do n't believe they had the votes and I think they are covering up the embarrassment of not having the votes .
But think about this : somebody hurt my feelings so I will punish the country .
I mean that 's hardly plausible .
And there were twelve Republicans who were ready to stand up for the economic interest of America but not if anybody insulted them .
I 'll make an offer :
Give me those twelve people 's names and I will go talk uncharacteristically nicely to them and tell them what wonderful people they are , and maybe they 'll now think about the country . "
Classic .
Earlier Ed Henry reported about Republicans blaming Democrats and said he could n't find anything partisan in the speech given by Nancy Pelosi .
The speech is available here and after going through it , I can't find anything that would be considered overly partisan in it .

The current spate of anthrax attacks on media and government buildings in the United States has heightened the undercurrent of concern since September 11 about the possibility of links between the perpetrators and the Iraqi regime .
However , fears that the hidden hand of Saddam Hussein lies behind these attacks are based on rumour and speculation that , under closer scrutiny , fail to support the weight of the charge .
First , there is the history of UN weapons inspections in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 .
It is true that Iraq has not fully complied with its disarmament obligation , particularly in the field of biological weapons .
However , this failure does not equate to a retained biological weapons capability .
Far from it .
Under the most stringent on - site inspection regime in the history of arms control , Iraq 's biological weapons programmes were dismantled , destroyed or rendered harmless during the course of hundreds of no -notice inspections .
The major biological weapons production facility - al Hakum , which was responsible for producing Iraq 's anthrax - was blown up by high explosive charges and all its equipment destroyed .
Other biological facilities met the same fate if it was found that they had , at any time , been used for research and development of biological weapons .
M oreover , Iraq was subjected to intrusive , full - time monitoring of all facilities with a potential biological application .
Breweries , animal feed factories , vaccine and drug manufacturing facilities , university research laboratories and all hospitals were subject to constant , repeated inspections .
Thousands of swabs and samples were taken from buildings and soil throughout Iraq .
No evidence of anthrax or any other biological agent was discovered .
While it was impossible to verify that all of Iraq 's biological capability had been destroyed , the UN never once found evidence that Iraq had either retained biological weapons or associated production equipment , or was continuing work in the field .
Another mitigating factor is purely scientific : Iraq procured the Vollum strain of anthrax from American Type Culture Collection , a company based in Rockville , Maryland , which provides commercially available viruses - such as anthrax - to consumers worldwide .
While Iraq had investigated other strains , including those indigenous to the country , it was the Vollum strain that Iraq mass - produced for weapon use .
It is a unique , highly virulent form of anthrax , and its use would represent the kind of link needed to suggest Iraq as a likely source .
That is not to say that the presence of a Vollum strain would automatically indict Iraq , or that a non - Vollum strain clears Iraq .
However , federal investigators currently think that the anthrax used in New York and Florida is the same strain , most probably the Ames strain , a variety native to the US .
The strain used in Washington is as yet unidentified , but it has been assessed as non-weapons grade and responsive to antibiotics .
Based upon this information , it would be irresponsible to speculate about a Baghdad involvement .
There is also the political factor .
Despite the ongoing efforts of the US and Great Britain to maintain economic sanctions , Baghdad has been very successful in developing a political and diplomatic momentum to get them lifted since weapons inspectors left three years ago .
The events of September 11 brought this anti-sanctions momentum to a halt .
It makes absolutely no sense for Iraq to be involved in a bio - terror attack that , in one fell swoop , undermines what has been Iraq 's number one priority over the past decade : the lifting of economic sanctions .
There is another side to the political equation .
America 's policy towards Iraq continues to be one of abject failure , and President Bush 's administration exhibits the same level of frustration and impotence shown by its predecessor in trying to piece together aviable plan for dealing with Saddam 's continued survival .
Washington finds itself groping for something upon which to hang its anti-Saddam policies and the current anthrax scare has provided a convenient cause .
It would be a grave mistake for some in the Bush administration to undermine the effort to bring to justice those who perpetrated the cowardly attacks against the US by trying to implement their own ideologically - driven agenda on Iraq .
Those who have suggested that Iraq is the source of the anthrax used in the current attacks - including Richard Butler , a former chairman of the UN weapons inspection effort - merely fan the flames of fear and panic .
There is no verifiable link whatever and it is irresponsible for someone of Mr Butler 's stature to be involved in unsubstantiated speculation .
His behaviour has , it seems , been guided by animosity towards Baghdad , rather than the facts .

General L a T e X tips and tricks
Introduction
This page lists a number of general LaTeX tips and tricks that I learned while working on my PhD thesis .
I have written the entries in a Question - and - Answer format , but cannot rightly call them FAQs .
After all , these questions were not asked frequently , but just the once — by me .
Also , in contrast to many real FAQ pages and documents , my answers make absolutely no pretence at completeness or even general applicability .
All that these tips and recommendations describe is what worked for me in my setup .
It would be nice if it worked for others as well , but I have taken no special steps to guarantee or investigate that .
It is also quite possible — likely , even — that my questions have other , perhaps better solutions and answers that I was simply not aware of , or that I knew about but somehow never chose to pursue or use .
The Questions
CINCINNATI - Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York is proposing a new way to gauge poverty in the United States .
Bloomberg planned to discuss the city 's alternative to the federal poverty measure in a speech last night at the national convention of the NAACP .
He said the 1960s - era federal formula for deciding who is living below the poverty line is outdated .
Bloomberg 's trip to Cincinnati was canceled because of bad weather , and his office said Deputy Mayor Linda Gibbs , who earlier gave a briefing on the measure , would deliver his speech for him .
In the prepared speech , Bloomberg said : " If we 're serious about fighting poverty , we also have to start getting serious about measuring it . "
City officials said under the federal formula , which is $ 20,444 for a family of four , some 19 percent of New Yorkers are considered poor .
Under the new formula , which takes into account New York 's high cost of living , the poverty line is at $ 26,138 and 23 percent of New Yorkers are below it .
New York 's new measure factors in more costs than the current formula , which is heavily weighted to grocery spending , Bloomberg said .
The city 's version counts tax credits and other government benefits while adjusting for geographic differences such as housing costs .
The new formula provides " a more accurate picture of who is poor and what that word means - today - in 2008 , " Bloomberg said in his prepared text .
New York will offer help to other cities that are interested , he said .
Bloomberg , who considered an independent presidential run this year , also urged the presidential candidates to make poverty a priority issue in their campaigns .
Advocates of changing the federal poverty measure , which has been under study for years , say New York 's way of measuring would better assess US poverty and the impact of government programs , helping better target resources .
How poverty is measured is politically sensitive because it helps determine eligibility for some federal programs .
" So in Washington , while there 's a never - ending debate about how to confront poverty , there is hardly any clarity on who is actually poor , " said Bloomberg , a billionaire businessman , in the prepared text .
The city 's Center for Economic Opportunity , established by Bloomberg in 2006 , used Census data , earlier research into the federal measure , and poverty researchers to come up with the new threshold .

After seven long years , the FBI and the Justice Department say they are closing the books on the anthrax investigation .
But the investigation into the investigation is only beginning , and it will focus on what Congress members described Thursday as apparent missteps by authorities that dramatically prolonged the probe , unfairly maligned an innocent government scientist , and raised questions about whether federal agents had conclusively ruled out other suspects besides microbiologist Bruce E. Ivins .
Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) and Rep. Rush D. Holt ( D - N.J. ) , frequent critics of the FBI , demanded a far more detailed release of documents by the bureau and the Justice Department to support the government ’s case , as well as congressional hearings into the investigation .
Grassley sent a three - page letter Thursday evening to Atty .
Gen. Michael B. Mukasey and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III , giving them two weeks to respond to 18 questions that raised concerns about virtually every aspect of the probe .

Holt , who represents the district from which the anthrax - laced letters were mailed , said in an interview that he was reaching out to other House members to discuss a combined inquiry of sorts by the judiciary , intelligence , science and technology , and government oversight committees .
“ We do n’t want this to be another Lee Harvey Oswald case where the public says it is never solved to their satisfaction , ” said Holt , referring to conspiracy theories surrounding President Kennedy ’s 1963 assassination .
“ Somebody needs to finish the job that would have been finished in a court of law . ”
Other than Congress , he said , “ I ’m not sure where else to do it . ”
Ivins , a researcher at the government ’s biodefense lab at Ft. Detrick , Md. , apparently killed himself last week as authorities were preparing to charge him with murder .
The 2001 attacks killed five people , sickened at least 17 others , and sparked one of the largest and costliest criminal investigations in U.S. history .

On Wednesday , senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI gave private briefings to those affected by the attacks and to members of Congress ; released a trove of previously sealed documents ; and held a news conference , all in an effort to convince the public that they could have proved in court that Ivins was the lone culprit -- if they ’d had the chance to charge and prosecute him .
But by Thursday , a chorus of skeptics had taken to talk radio shows and the Internet .
They homed in on government admissions that at least 100 other people may have had access to the particular batch of anthrax that was ultimately linked to the deadly mailings , and that Ivins had never been conclusively placed near the mailbox in New Jersey from which the letters were sent .
They also questioned why the FBI and the Postal Inspection Service allowed the public to believe that another researcher at Ft. Detrick , Dr. Steven Hatfill , was the sole culprit for more than a year after they apparently began to believe he was innocent .
Hatfill recently received a $ 5.8 - million settlement from the government .
Maureen Stevens , the widow of Robert Stevens , a Florida photo editor who was the first victim of the attacks , held a news conference Thursday calling on the government to admit to faults in its investigation and pay additional millions to her and possibly to other victims .
And numerous scientists and legal experts questioned the reliability of the evidence presented by the government , particularly the novel genetic tests that the FBI said proved that Ivins alone carried out the attacks .
One of them was Holt , a physicist turned congressman , who said he wanted to see some level of independent inquiry that involved a wide array of experts who could deconstruct the scientific aspects of the investigation .

In his letter , Grassley also wanted to know how exactly the government zeroed in on Ivins , whether he had taken a lie - detector test , what was known about his deteriorating mental condition , and how investigators could be sure that no one else might have helped him in preparing or mailing the letters .
“ The FBI has a lot of explaining to do , ” said Grassley , whose staff has already started consulting experts and collecting information .
“ They have been less than forthcoming with Congress throughout this entire process , and it deserves a full and thorough vetting . ”

Privacy has always been a major concern for BitTorrent users and there are only a few ways to remain anonymous .
By using a secure connection , as the new TorrentPrivacy tool offers , you can bypass almost every firewall or traffic shaping application , while making sure that nobody can see what you 're downloading .
The TorrentPrivacy software has been developed so that anybody can use it , from BitTorrent novices through to experts .
TorrentPrivacy uses a pre-configured version of uTorrent , so there are no settings that have to be entered manually .
It pretty much works straight out of the box .
First you have to chose a connection point – at the moment they have servers in Europe , USA , Canada .
The closer the connection point is to your true location , the faster the speeds you will get from the service .
Then , after you ’ve chosen a connection point , just click connect and the program will connect to the server .
The connection is made through the SSH protocol with 128 bit encryption , which prevents traffic shaping and keeps your traffic ambiguous to prying eyes .
TorrentFreak briefly tested the application and it worked surprisingly well .
People who are used to uTorrent would n’t notice any difference .
The download speeds we got were great as well .
Alex , who runs Torrentreactor.net and TorrentPrivacy , told TorrentFreak : “ We started the TorrentPrivacy project at the end of 2007 .
The idea was to give torrent users an anonymous BitTorrent service from a party they can trust .
TorrentReactor has been online for approximately 4 years , and we believe that when people see that TorrentPrivacy uses ns1/ns2.torrentreactor.net as DNS servers , they wo n’t have any questions about a possible government setup of torrentprivacy.com . ”
When we asked Alex about his motivation to start the project , he said that he wanted to make it as easy as possible for BitTorrent users to be anonymous , and get the RIAA and MPAA off their backs .
“ We do n’t like the situation where two organizations from the USA believe they can rule the world .
The Pirate Bay showed them that other countries have other laws and American laws do n’t work outside of USA .
We want to be the pain in their asses , and allow users to download what they want without fear of a sudden door knock . ”
Sounds great , right ?
Yes it does , but unfortunately the service is not free .
TorrentPrivacy currently has three payment options .
$ 2.95 per week , $ 9.95 per month and $ 99.95 per year .
I guess it ’s up to you whether you think it ’s worth it or not .
Archaeologists have found what they have described as a " breathtaking engineering project " in Lincolnshire .
Almost 60 miles of medieval canals , possibly built by monks to ferry stone , have been identified in the Fens .
Although the canals were up to 40ft wide they have filled up with silt and are now only visible from the air .
Experts said the network of waterways represented an achievement not matched until the Industrial Revolution 300 years later .
Viking raiders
Martin Redding , of the Witham Valley Archaeology Research Committee , discovered the canals using aerial photographs .
" They have been completely infilled by later deposits that have been brought in by flooding eight hundred years .
He added : " These canals are important because they represent a breathtaking engineering project .
" Just think of the skilled engineers , surveyors and huge workforce this scheme would have needed . "
Mr Redding said more study was needed but speculated that the canals could have been started as a way of transporting stone to rebuild monastic sites devastated in Viking raids .
I have been coding a new multi - touch mouse driver for GNU / Linux , in Python of course .
I got the basic tapping down , but I wanted to go further .
I though it would be cool to be able to put all five fingers down and have it trigger the Compiz scale plugin , or similar .
I looked around for a non hackish way of doing it , and was appalled by the [ lack ] of documentation , and even support , for interfacing Python to Compiz Fusion .
So , what would any DIY Python / GNU / Linux freak do ?
Write his own binding of course !
I wrote pyCompiz just for this purpose .
Its really simple , you can call any compiz plugin in one line or less : D
To trigger the scale plugin : compiz.call( ‘ scale ’ , ‘ initiate_key ’ ) .
I have it hosted on a Google Code page , for anyone interested .
I do n’t plan on updating it very often , only for bug fixes .
There really are n’t any features that could be added , its such a simple thing .
Anyway , here is the link .
Its under the GPLv2 License , so anyone can use it .
Happy Hacking !
Palin appeared at the bar on 20th and Walnut streets last night to shake hands with her fans for about an hour before the first presidential debate .
While the crowd inside was friendly , hundreds of people lined the street outside in protest with signs that read things like " Palin is Santorum With Lipstick . "
Palin did not take questions from reporters nor did she talk policy .
She posed for pictures and chatted with supporters , many of whom were from outside the city limits , and made an approximately minute - long statement .

The big story about last night 's debate was n't in Mississippi at the podiums , it was in the spin rooms after the event .
This is when the big gun surrogates customarily provide the campaign talking points and of course the biggest guns in the rack are the VP candidates .
Oddly , although not unexpectedly , Sarah Palin was no where to be found .
She was n't even in Ole Miss .
The McCain camp deployed Mr. 9/11 , Rudy Guiliani , to do the on air honors while the pit poodle put on her lispstick and dressed up in local baseball garb to hit a Irish pub in Philly Meanwhile the networks were flooded with hate mail from McCain supporters demanding to know why their overheated hockey mom was n't invited to the party .
My guess is the campaign will encourage the notion that this was all a result of ' liberal bias ' of the hateful media rather than admit they wo n't allow her to speak in public .
One doubts the deluded who believe sharing a maritime border with Russia " is too " foreign policy experience , will put two and two together themselves .

Several months ago I wrote about receiving the American Community Survey .
[ link edited for length ]
As if the American Community Survey is not enough of a frontal attack on privacy , I received Form SBO - 1 from the US Department of Commerce last week .
What are they asking for ?
Information on my 2007 Self - Employment .
Are you as surprised as I am that the year they are studying is 2007 ?
This survey is done only once every five years .
I can only wonder what the odds are of receiving both the American Community Census and this Survey in the same year ?
I must be a lucky guy !
I wonder if the same person that came to my front door to check on the status of my American Community Survey will be sent back .
She inquired as to whether or not I had sent it in , and I answered truthfully .
“ Yes , I sent it back ” , was my reply .
I believe in privacy .
I believe that anything I must submit to a Federal Agency that ONLY I know , should be requested voluntarily or demanded via a warrant .
Otherwise , I am being singled out by the Federal Government while my neighbor is not .
And that is not equal treatment .
Privacy lost will never be recovered .
It is only because so many cooperate , that they continue to coerce us into even more cooperation .
But this same information is then used to undermine the freedoms and liberties we know we should have .
Principles are worthless if they are not stood upon , and I will stand on my principles here .
My race , my sex , my education , my source of financing should have no bearing on government decisions .
They have no bearing on the success or failure of my business .
I alone bear that responsibility .
If I do not answer the questions , I face a $ 5,000 fine .
If I do not answer truthfully , I face a $ 10,000 fine .
I wonder how they will know I did not answer truthfully if they do not already know the answers ?
To realize that the Commerce Department is busy collecting data on 2007 , the year prior to the collapse of the economy , is a surprise .
Perhaps they want to determine what was working before the wheels came off the economic engine of Small Business Owners and the self - employed , such as myself .
Think again .
There are no survey questions on how to improve the business environment .
There are no questions asking what conditions need to be present to hire additional employees .
There are no questions asking if I am even making a profit .
There are no questions about the personal sacrifices I have made in order for my personal business to succeed .
If you are like me , you may wonder why that is .
The truth is the only concern they have is how much they can tax you .
Here is what they want to know about me :
In 2007 , did another company or organization own more than 50 % of this business ?
In 2007 , did employees under an Employee Stock Ownership Plan own more than 50 % of this business ?
( Basically did anyone else own more than 50 % of my business )
In 2007 , was this business jointly owned by a husband and wife , and who primarily operates the business .
Did two or more members of the same family own the majority of this business ?
What was the percentage of ownership of the top four owners , and their job titles ?
How did I acquire the ownership ?
When did I acquire ownership ?
What is my function ?
How many hours per week do I work ?
Is this my primary source of income ?
Have I owned any other businesses prior to this one ?
What is my education level ?
What is my sex ?
What was my age on December 31 , 2007
Am I from the United States ?
Am I Spanish / Hispanic / Latino ?
( Apparently these are NOT races for this survey )
What is my race ?
( If I were Spanish / Hispanic / Latino , there is not that option .
There are 14 other choices , and I can write in Spanish / Hispanic / Latino if I choose to do so . )
Am I a veteran ?
Am I a disabled veteran ?
When did I start this business ( what year ) ?
Where did I get the capital to start this business ?
How much capital did I use to start this business ?
Did this business operate from my home ?
As a franchise ?
What sources were used to finance expansion or pay for capital improvements in 2007 ?
Which of the following customers provide me with 10 % or more of my business 's total sales / services ?
Federal Government ?
State and local Government ?
Other Businesses ?
Individuals ?
What percentage of my total sales was exports outside the United States ?
In 2007 , did I establish operations outside the United States ?
In 2007 , did I transfer any business functions outside the United States ?
What language do I conduct business in ?
What type of employees do I have ?
Options include Full - time paid , Part - time paid , Paid day laborers , Temporary , Leased , and contractors .
What benefits were totally or partially paid ?
Health insurance , contributions to retirement plans , profit sharing , Paid holidays , vacation and sick leave ?
Did I have a web site in 2007 ?
Do I make purchases online ?
Am I still in business ?
If not , why not ?
There are many options .
Yet the one that should be included if they send this survey out it 2012 is : Government Interference in Free Market Capitalism .
I am not sure how many of you may have also gotten this survey .
If you did , I would love to know how you handled it .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The National Snow and Ice Data Center has reported that sea ice in the Arctic now covers about 2.03 million square miles .
The lowest point since satellite measurements began in 1979 was 1.65 million square miles , last September .
With about three weeks left in the Arctic summer , this year could wind up breaking that record , scientists said .
Arctic ice always melts in summer and refreezes in winter .
But over the years , more of the ice is lost to the sea with less of it recovered in winter .
While ice reflects the sun ’s heat , the open ocean absorbs more heat , and the melting accelerates warming in other parts of the world .
Sea ice also serves as primary habitat for threatened polar bears .
“ We could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point , ” said Mark Serreze , a senior scientist at the data center , in Boulder , Colo .
“ It ’s tipping now .
We ’re seeing it happen now . ”
Okay , now Obama has really made this week complete , getting Limbaugh all pissy .
Limbaugh wrote a long article , that I wo n’t be linking to , in which he ’s downright apoplectic that Obama put him in an ad , linking him to McCain .
Limbaugh is upset that the ad made him look like he was n’t a friend to minorities .
Uh huh .
The man who played the song “ Barack the Magic Negro ” on his show is now upset that Obama – yes , Obama – made him look like he might be a racist .
( And let ’s not forget the last election when Limbaugh mocked people with Parkinson ’s . )
I ’m gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that maybe , just maybe , Obama made Limbaugh look like Limbaugh .
Anyway , kudos to the Obama campaign for ticking off Limbaugh .
Let ’s see more ads like that .
Lord knows it would n’t be hard to tie McCain to Coulter and the rest of them too .
Over $ 400 M Poured Into Thin -Film Solar Tech In One Week
August 28th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
This past week was an eventful one for thin - film solar companies Nanosolar and AVA Solar , which received a total of over $ 400 million in funding .
Nanosolar , which took in $ 300 million , has now raised nearly half a billion dollars of capital .
The company plans to use the money to expand thin - film solar panel production at its San Jose and Berlin factories .
AVA Solar received $ 104 million to finish production of its 200 MW factory in Colorado .
The factory is expected to start production in 2009 .
Do n’t think that this is the last you ’ll hear about thin film solar funding — the field is projected to produce an estimated $ 22 billion in revenues by 2015 .
And with thin - film trumping crystalline silicon as a cost efficient technology , rest assured that utility companies wo n’t hesitate to get on board .

John McCain 's top foreign - policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , is a leading expert on U.S. - allied Georgia -- and was a paid lobbyist for the former Soviet republic until March , in the run-up to what has become a major battle between Georgia and Russia .
Democratic rival Barack Obama 's presidential campaign was quick to try to paint Mr. Scheunemann 's dual roles as a conflict of interest after Sen.
McCain swiftly took Georgia 's side in the dispute , and cited it as evidence that Sen.

London 's Electric Avenues New Playground for Alternative Cars
Since the introduction of stringent congestion fees , London traffic has loosened up and cleaned up .
Britons are now increasingly cruising their capital in cars running on alternative energy to avoid the charge .

Washington , D.C. —
Today ’s shocking revelation [ Aug. 1 ] about the apparent suicide of an Army microbiologist , a lead suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks , has intensified the need for a thorough investigation into the only significant bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil , said Alan Pearson , Director of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Control Program at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
“ The FBI must not let the death of Bruce Ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks , ” said Pearson .
“ The chance to prove Ivins ’s guilt before a court of law has been lost , but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the American people remains . ”
CNN reported today that the FBI will soon close the case “ because a threat no longer exists . ”
Pearson says that the number one question still to determine is whether Ivins was responsible for the attacks and , if so , whether he acted alone and with complete secrecy .
“ If Ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks , did he have any assistance ?
Did anyone else at the Army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to , during , or shortly after the anthrax attacks ? ” asked Pearson .
“ The FBI must see this investigation through to completion . ”
Pearson added that if it is established that Ivins or anyone else working at the government ’s biodefense lab at Fort Detrick , Maryland produced the anthrax used in the attacks or diverted anthrax powder from the lab ’s stocks , the implications would be significant .
“ It appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country , ” said Pearson .
“ The implications for our understanding of the bioterrorism threat and for our entire biodefense strategy and enterprise are potentially profound . ”
Dr Stabler said : " The fact that Byron kept [ the letters ] is important .
He was absolutely fascinated by his own reception and the way he was perceived .
He even mingled his poetry with his own self - creation .
He pretended not to care about his reader while at the same time making huge efforts to keep track of what his readers thought about him . "
John McCain has made it clear this week he does n't understand what 's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does .
But on Thursday , he took his populist riffing up a notch and found his scapegoat for financial panic -- Christopher Cox , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
To give readers a flavor of Mr. McCain untethered , we 'll quote at length : " Mismanagement and greed became the operating standard while regulators were asleep at the switch .
The primary regulator of Wall Street , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) kept in place trading rules that let speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino .
They allowed naked short selling -- which simply means that you can sell stock without ever owning it .
They eliminated last year the uptick rule that has protected investors for 70 years .
Speculators pounded the shares of even good companies into the ground .
" The chairman of the SEC serves at the appointment of the President and has betrayed the public 's trust .
If I were President today , I would fire him . "
Wow .
" Betrayed the public 's trust . "
Was Mr. Cox dishonest ?
No .
He merely changed some minor rules , and did n't change others , on short - selling .
String him up !
Mr. McCain clearly wants to distance himself from the Bush Administration .
But this assault on Mr. Cox is both false and deeply unfair .
It 's also un-Presidential .
Take " naked " shorting , in which an investor sells a stock short -- betting that it will fall in price -- without first borrowing the shares he is selling from an investor who owns them .
The SEC has never condoned the practice , and since 2005 it has clamped down on short selling in any stock that shows evidence of naked shorting .
The SEC further tightened its rules against naked shorting just hours before Mr. McCain excoriated Mr. Cox for doing nothing .

Feinstein on bailout : Set execs ' on fire ' if they do n't play ball RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Americans do n't like the bailout .
That 's the message that Sen.
Dianne Feinstein is receiving from her constituents , making her more hesitant than many of her fellow Democrats to pass the $ 700 billion Wall St. bailout proposed by President Bush , McClatchy reported .
" Only one of a thousand supports it  whatever it is , " the California Democrat said .
" People call us and say they 're really against bailing out fat - cats .
That 's a big issue . "
Even as lawmakers claimed a compromise had been reached early Sunday morning , doubts remained on both sides of the aisle about a bill that has grown from three pages to more than a hundred and offers little protection of taxpayers .
Feinstein explained one of the main sources of voters outrage over the bailout plan during an address to Congress : " I 'm told that the reason the Treasury Secretary does n't want limits on executive compensation is because he believes that an executive then wo n't bring his company in to partake in any program that is set up . "
" Well here 's my response to that , " she said .
" We can put that executive on his boat , take that boat out in the ocean and set it on fire if that 's how he feels .
That 's what should happen , or his company does n't come in . "
Feinstein said the frantic push for the bill from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson feels too much like the rush into Iraq , the San Francisco Chronicle reported .
" There is a great deal of cynicism among those of us who have to live with having voted to go into Iraq based on misinformation and intelligence that later turned out not to be truthful , " Feinstein said
A full transcript of Feinstein 's floor statement to Congress can be seen here .
Here ’s a statement that should be preserved for posterity : Defense Secretary Robert Gates told an audience at West Point that , although he believes Iran is “ hellbent ” on developing nuclear weapons , the last thing the U.S. needs is to get into another war in the Middle East .
Gates got misty toward the end of his speech , telling cadets he feels “ personally responsible ” for their lives .
GJSentinel.com : Gates said the U.S. military was not organized and equipped for the kind of wars it finds itself in today .
“ The current campaign has gone on longer , and has been more difficult , than anyone expected or prepared for at the start , ” he said .
“ And so we ’ve had to scramble to position ourselves for success over the long haul , which I believe we are doing . ”
He called a drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq “ inevitable , ” with the debate mainly over timing .
“ But the kind of enemy we face today — violent jihadist networks — will not allow us to remain at peace , ” he said .
“ What has been called the `long war ’ is likely to be many years of persistent , engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity .
This generational challenge cannot be wished away or put on a timetable .
There are no exit strategies . ”

According to CNN , Gates got emotional at the end of his speech as he gave the assembled cadets some advice :

“ KEEP your house ” reads the handwritten sign on a chain - link fence some 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles .
It is an advertisement , although it could be the attitude of an overstretched buyer who owes the bank more money than his home is worth .
Many people in Moreno Valley have simply walked away from their properties .
As abandoned lawns turn brown in the desert climate , the fallout spreads .
It is no longer a matter of saving individual houses , but a whole city .
Until recently Moreno Valley was one of the fastest - growing cities in America .
It lies in the Inland Empire , a two - county region in southern California that is so called largely because it is difficult to know how else to characterise such a sprawling expanse of detached homes , strip malls and warehouses .
Between 1990 and 2007 the Inland Empire 's population grew from 2.6 m to 4.1 m — the equivalent of adding a city the size of Philadelphia .
As in other regions now suffering from a rash of foreclosures and falling house prices , such as south Florida and Nevada , rapid growth is itself largely to blame .
Moreno Valley had the misfortune to swell at a time of lax lending practices .
Whole neighbourhoods were built on cheap credit and inflated expectations — palaces for the middle class .
Around Camino del Rey , on the city 's southern edge , huge Spanish - style houses with three - car garages sit empty .
The city 's population growth appears to have gone into reverse .
Moreno Valley 's high schools expected to enrol 9,850 pupils last year .
They fell short by 780 .
Fewer people with less disposable income is bad news for shopkeepers .
The Moreno Valley commerce centre ( a strip mall , despite the grand title ) has six vacant units in its main building .
Stores along Alessandro Boulevard , the city 's main drag , have been occupied by Pentecostal churches — a sure sign of low rents .
John Husing , an Inland Empire economist , says the housing slowdown has scared off financial - services and civil - engineering firms , for the moment at least .
A bigger economic threat is just coming into focus .
The Inland Empire is America 's warehouse : goods , mostly from China , are sorted and assembled there before being distributed across the country .
Until recently increasing trade could be counted on to prop up the economy .
Traffic through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles , America 's two biggest by container volume , levelled off only briefly during the early 1990s recession and continued to grow in 2001 .
Now it is declining .
In June imports through the two ports were 15 % and 12 % below last year 's level .
Moreno Valley 's office - vacancy rate is already the highest in the region .
All this would be a shock to any city , but it is particularly startling in a place used to double - digit percentage increases in tax revenues .
Moreno Valley has been forced to tap its reserves to make up a $ 7.1 m shortfall .
That may grow , says Bob Gutierrez , the city manager .
State politicians are still trying to close an enormous hole in California 's budget , which is now seven weeks late .
When it comes , the budget is likely to involve a raid on local finances that will put places like Moreno Valley further in the red .
Despite the gloom , a few souls are rather cheerful .
Public - transport advocates and planning groups such as the Congress for the New Urbanism have seized upon the crisis in far - flung regions like the Inland Empire as evidence that sprawl is no longer viable .
“ The frontier of endless mobility that we 've known our entire lives is closing , ” wrote Bill McKibben , an environmentalist , in the Washington Post .
At last , the urbanists predict , Americans will return to city centres .
They will swap their sport-utility vehicles for public transport and begin to act more like well - behaved Europeans .
Some of these cheerful forecasts appear to be coming true .
Across southern California , use of the skeletal rail network is rising .
Property prices are indeed holding up fairly well in older neighbourhoods near the coast .
It can be difficult to convince people in Beverly Hills or Santa Monica that the state has a housing crisis .
But the growing price gap between such burghs and places like Moreno Valley can be read in two ways .
It is both a sign of the suburbs ' plight and the thing that is gradually renewing their competitive edge .
The Inland Empire 's housing market did not collapse because people chose not to live in sprawling suburbs .
They clearly did , hence the huge growth there .
The problem was that buyers could not really afford the houses that were being built .
Now they can .
Mr Husing reckons 39 % of residents can now afford the average property — up from just 18 % in 2005 .
House - builders are at last creating smaller homes , and a few buyers are returning .
Now the task is to ensure that neighbourhoods are not snapped up by slumlords .
The nearby city of Grand Terrace has done that in part by levying a small tax on renting .
Places like Moreno Valley retain two enormous advantages over traditional cities .
They have lots of cheap , available land and a pool of workers keen to avoid the ever - lengthening commute to Los Angeles and Orange County .
When it comes to attracting businesses , these two factors outweigh high petrol prices .
The city of Ontario , which contains the Inland Empire 's main airport , already has more than two jobs for each home .
Greg Devereaux , the city 's manager , reckons it will eventually have more than three .
Bill Batey , Moreno Valley 's mayor , is frank about the city 's present problems .
When asked about its future , though , he brightens .
Pointing to a large aerial photograph on the wall , he outlines plans for a new warehouse , a cluster of medical offices and a lot more houses .
There is plenty of empty space in the photograph ; indeed , there is a huge expanse of bare earth directly across the street from city hall .
The frontier is not closed yet .
Good news , chubbies !
Science has got your back .
Researchers at the Salk Institute have found two drugs that trick the muscles in mice into thinking they 've been working out like crazy , even when said mice have been playing World of Warcraft and eating Funyuns for 8 straight hours .
One drug , known as Aicar , increased the mice 's endurance on a treadmill by 44 percent after just four weeks of treatment .
A second drug , GW1516 , supercharged the mice to a 75 percent increase in endurance , but had to be combined with exercise to have any effect .
" It 's a little bit like a free lunch without the calories , " said Dr. Ronald M. Evans , leader of the Salk group .
The results , Dr. Evans said , seem reasonably likely to apply to people , who control muscle tone with the same underlying genes as do mice .
And if the drugs work and prove to be safe , they could be useful in a wide range of settings .

Yeah , settings such as your couch , your desk chair and your bed , as those are the only places you 'll be sitting when you 're taking a pill that tricks your body into thinking you 're some sort of Olympian .
Of course , the initial uses are going to be for people with diseases such as diabetes that are improved with exercise , but you know the major pharmaceutical companies are licking their chops and looking at the insanely - large couch potato demographic .
The future is now !

So , very soon , you will own a cell phone that has a very good camera and knows where you are within ten or fifteen feet .
And the web will know who you are and who your friends are .
What happens ?
Well , when you take a photo , you can automatically send it to the clowd .
The clowd can color correct and adjust the photo based on the million other photos it has seen just like this .
[ Debbie wonders , is n’t it called a " cloud " ?
I guess I was subconsciously coining a new term–which I so rarely do–this time , combining crowd and cloud into something new .
I think I like it , even if it is a bit artificial ] .
The clowd can figure out that this was the high school graduation ( same time , same location ) , and realize that you were there with fifty of your closest friends , and automatically group the photos together … leaving out the people it ’s obvious you do n’t like .
The clowd can also find pictures taken of the same person , but by other people , and show them to you .
Or cooler still , introduce you to those people .
So , you take a picture of Keith Jarrett at Carnegie Hall and the clowd introduces you to other people who took his picture in ther places .
( No , you should n’t have to tell the clowd it ’s Keith , it should know .
But yes , you will opt in to all of this … you ask before it takes these matchmaking liberties ) .
Wait .
Alex suggests that this is the yearbook of the future .
What an antiquity the yearbook we all own is .
What happens when every student builds her own yearbook all year long ?
The clowd grabs your pictures , your friends ’ pictures , pictures that the group has admired .
It grabs the teachers you ’ve written about , but leaves out the ones you ’ve never interacted with .
And everyone gets a different yearbook , of course .
PS your privacy is fairly shot .
See a dangerous driver ?
Send a video snippet to the clowd .
The clowd collates that with a bunch of other shots of the same driver … busted .
And the clowd also knows where you are , camera or no camera .
So it can tell you when your old friend is just two gates away from you , also wasting time at the airport waiting for her flight .
Or it can do Zagats to the ten thousandth power by not only suggesting the best nearby restaurant ( based on your food circle of friends ) but can also integrate with Open Table and only recommend restaurants that actually have room for you .
Or it can let restaurant owners do yield management and find you a table at a good enough restaurant at the best possible price …
[ And Dave points out that facial recognition lives in the clowd as well .
Take a picture of someone and the clowd tells you who it is … ]
This is going to happen .
The only question is whether you are one of the people who will make it happen .
I guess there ’s an even bigger question : will we do it right ?
Condoleezza Rice , on her way to a NATO meeting yesterday , showed once more her penchant for jaw - dropping hypocrisy when she said with nothing even approaching shame :
Russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and that 's its military power .
That 's not the way to deal in the 21st century .
As Salon 's Glen Greenwald says , " it 's simply a fact that the U.S. invades , bombs , occupies , and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries far more than any other country on the planet .
It 's not even a close competition . "
Has there been even one disagreement between the Bush administration and a non-allied foreign power in the past seven years that has been met with anything other than force , or the overt or implied threat of force , by the United States ?
Hell , they even changed the name of French Fries to " Freedom Fries " at the Capitol when France was against using military force against Iraq .
Maybe now " Occupation Fries " would be more accurate .
Greenwald points out :
Just during the time Rice has served in the Bush administration , we bombed , invaded and occupied Afghanistan ; did the same to Iraq ; repeatedly bombed Somalia , killing all sorts of civilians ; fed bombs to Israel as they invaded and bombed Lebanon ; top political officials ( led by John McCain and Joe Lieberman ) have repeatedly threatened , and advocated , that the same be done to a whole host of other countries , including Iran and Syria .
Rice was one of the most prominent purveyors of neocon sloganeering of phrases including " smoking guns " and " mushroom clouds . "
She turned the State Department into the War Cheerleading Department .
She appears before Congress to urge heightened aggression against Iran .
In the previous article bearing , in substantive part , the title of this one , I pointed out the statements Ms. Rice made about the Georgian conflict with Russia :
" This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia , where Russia can threaten a neighbor , occupy a capital , overthrow a government and get away with it .
Things have changed . "
And :
" I have heard the Russian president say that his military operations are over .
I am saying it is time for the Russian president to be true to his word . "
But Condi's cognitive dissonance is not the only unexplainable phenomenon we are dealing with here .
She made all of her astonishingly dissonant statements before the press .
Where were the questions from reporters about how her rhetoric does n't come close to matching her past performance ?
Surely there are members of the mainstream press corps that are n't working for FOX .
Surely some of them have alarm bells that go off when they hear these incongruent sermons being preached by the woman who has embraced the Bush Doctrine of " preemptive war " as tightly as any in his circle .
But if there are some of those folks in the press , I have n't heard them asking any of the obvious questions .
Maybe they think that 's Greenwald 's job .
Or Garrett 's job .
But if they happened to ask me , they 'd find out that I would much prefer them to put me out of work , or at least be forced to find another topic to write about .
According to the media , Al - Qaeda ( CIA ) leaders are ' leaving Iraq to bolster the fight in Afghanistan '
Photo of Afghan children from : http://flickr.com/photos/46595582@N00/93022980.
The CIA would like you to think that America and Europe are fighting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan .
The reality is that the USA and NATO are fighting people who want to end the colonial occupation of their country by people who have allowed the heroin trade to flourish .
People claiming to be al - Qaeda are usually working for the security services of one country or another .
Asia Times , 24 July 2008 , ( Al - Qaeda 's got a brand new bag by Pepe Escobar ) quotes Mustafa Abu al - Yazeed , 'a senior al - Qaeda commander in Afghanistan . '
Most likely , al - Yazeed is employed by the CIA to promote their propaganda .
In an interview with Pakistan 's Geo TV , al - Yazeed says :
1 . " There is no difference between the American people and the American government itself . "
In other words , the CIA wants the American people to think they might as well support Bush .
2 . " If we see this through sharia law , American people and the government itself are infidels and are fighting against Islam . "
In other words , the CIA wants people to think the struggle in Afghanistan is not about gaining independence from the occupiers , but about extremist Islam .

3 . " We have to rely on suicide attacks which are absolutely correct according to Islamic law .
We have adopted this way of war because there is a huge difference between our material resources and our enemy 's , and this is the only option to attack our enemy . "
In other words , the CIA wants to paint the Afghan resistance as a bunch of fanatics rather than freedom fighters .
The CIA does not want people to know that suicide bombings can be faked by the CIA .

4 . " It is the government of Pakistan which has most damaged our cause .
President Musharraf violated the trust of Muslims and contributed to the destruction of the Islamic government of Afghanistan ...
Musharraf and his government have made big mistakes , there is no such example in other Islamic states . "
In other words , the CIA does not want people to know that it has fallen out with Musharraf and wants him toppled and wants Pakistan broken up .

What Is Love I 'm pretty sure this is from You 're the Man Now Dog .
Last week we floated an absolutely delicious rumor - the sort of inside media gossip that we hope to be known for when future generations are considering our legacy .
Specifically , it was the story of the crazy pooping intern .
A summer intern at one of the networks , we heard , went on an on - the - job pooping spree , but somehow stayed on and continued her internship through the rest of the summer .
Tips have poured in , and it's become clear this is the story of your worst at - work nightmare come to life .
Here 's how one locked toilet at NBC caused a disaster :
The intern was at NBC in New York , at the famous 30 Rock ( NBC has not responded to our request for comment ) .
Our tipsters diverge a tiny bit in their details , but all agree that this intern did exist , and she did have quite an accident .
They say it all happened on the intern 's first day on the job , in June .
Apparently , she tried to make a run to the bathroom , but did n't quite get there .
One account :
Said intern did in fact shit all over the 18th and 25th floors of 30 Rock .
She did it in the hallway , on the floor , on a pile of FedEx boxes , on the way between floors … pretty much everywhere but the bathroom or ( hey , sometimes you 're desperate ) a garbage can .
Or a cup .
Or a napkin .
Or in her hands .
No , just streaking through the hallways .
And then she took it into that room where she locked herself in and proceeded to wipe ( sorry , I could n't come up with a better word ) it on the walls , on the computer , on those same FedEx boxes .
It was a shitshow ( pun absolutely intended ) .
One tipster even said that the intern was in a meeting with her boss when the drama occurred .
News of it spread quickly throughout the building .
What was the reason for the treason ?
We hear that bad foreign water was blamed :
The intern blamed the mess on bad water that she drank in Israel ( although she had been back from her vacation more than 2 weeks before she started ) .
The rumor at NBC is that it was some kind of laxative induced disaster .
The cleaning staff reportedly took care of the mess .
But the biggest mystery of all :
Why , and how , did said intern get to stay on for the rest of the summer ?
For one thing , it was n't her fault : the bathrooms were locked , and she did n't yet have a key .
And a general sense of mortification kept everyone quiet :
The bosses did want to fire her but were so shocked that she came back that they were a little scared because , what kind of person does something so gross and then shows up the next day like nothing happened ?
No one wanted to bring it up again , so she got to stay by default .
This poop story is truly nightmarish .
Deep inside , we all harbor a fear that something like this might befall us on the first day at a new job .
Nevertheless , this person was able to hold her head up high and continue in what must have been the most snicker - inducing environment imaginable .
And with little hope of a good recommendation .
Pooping intern :
We salute your courage .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) -
These days when customers walk into electronics stores , the first question they ask is how much electricity the fridge , washing machine or laptop computer they are contemplating buying consumes .
An employee of LG Electronics ' home appliances store checks its LCD televisions displayed for customers at a store in Seoul in this April 16 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak / Files
“ Energy savings were not exactly a hot topic among customers last year , ” said Kim Dong - han at South Korean electronics retailer Hi-Mart .
“ But this year , nine out of ten people ask point blank whether a product will help them save money . ”
With oil at around $ 145 a barrel and electricity costs jumping , consumers are becoming preoccupied with keeping down their power bills .
Electronics makers that develop energy efficient product lines and market them effectively to customers may get an edge in a gloomy global economy , firms say .
“ Going green is not only eco-friendly but crucial for business , ” said Kim Jik - soo , a spokesman at LG Electronics .
“ This goes beyond just products , extending throughout the development and manufacturing process . ”
From washing machines that use steam instead of hot water , to fridges that use low energy compressors , to low power computer screens , electronics firms are furiously developing energy efficient products and heavily promoting lines already on the market that use less electricity than competitors ’ brands .
“ My electricity bill more than doubles in the summer as we turn on the air conditioner , ” said Park Yu- jin , 32 , a housewife in Seoul with two kids .
“ I also have to do lots of laundry for the kids .
The bill now easily tops 170,000 won ( 82 pounds ) a month . ”
Homemakers such as Park are increasingly buying front - load washing machines , which use gravity to move water instead of agitators as in top loaders .
And now , newfangled washers from LG Electronics and Whirlpool offer an option to use steam instead of hot water , cutting water and power use by more than 70 percent compared with some top - load models .
“ We will gradually shift to front loaders and the steam technology will become more mainstream , ” said LG spokesman Kim .
LG expects four out of ten frontload washers it sells in North America to use steam technology by the end of this year , compared with two out of ten currently .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Their biggest appliance plant in South Korea makes mostly front loaders , while recently built plants such as one in Russia have stopped manufacturing top loaders altogether .
USING LESS POWER
Among refrigerators , which consume 30 percent of overall power in a typical home , traditional compressors are giving way to linear compressors that use up to 40 percent less power and make less noise .
In the computing industry , power - saving has long been a key priority as bigger and hungrier gadgets challenge battery life .
PC makers from Apple to the Lenovo Group are replacing screens lit by conventional cold cathode fluorescent lamps ( CCFLs ) with light emitting diode ( LED ) displays .
“ LED saves up to 40 percent of the power used in traditional backlights , ” said Jeff Kim , an analyst at Hyundai Securities .
“ Next year they will be commonly found in notebook screens , and will be increasingly used in TV panels from 2010 . ”
Market researcher DisplaySearch expects LED - backlit displays to account for 50 percent of notebook panels in 2010 , up from 12 percent this year .
By 2015 , all laptop displays will use LEDs , generating sales of $ 6 billion .
LED is also set to claim traditional incandescent lamps in buildings and on streets .
Samsung Electro - Mechanics recently replaced lighting in the South Korean parliament building with new LED products and reported LED consumed just one sixth the power of incandescent bulbs .
HIGHER PRICE TAG
But too often , these energy - efficient products carry a hefty price premium to reflect the cost of developing new technologies , which in turn hampers faster adoption .
For instance , Whirlpool ’s washing machines with steam feature are sold at $ 1,300 - $ 1,500 ( 655-756 pounds ) , compared with a traditional machine priced at $ 700 .
Still , makers argue that the lifetime savings from green products could amount to the price of the appliance itself .
“ You could buy another 32 - inch LCD TV within 3 years with the money saved on electricity from our 52 - inch power - saving TV , ” said LG ’s Kim , referring to a new TV model with a sensor that adjusts brightness to match surrounding light levels .
Sometimes a little incentive helps .
Japanese electronics retailer Bic Camera is running a campaign in which buyers of eco-friendly products get extra credit points that can be used for future purchases .
“ That ’s a little nudge to help people buy products that are more efficient , even if they are slightly more expensive , ” said Naoko Ito , a Bic Camera spokeswoman .
“ Consumer interest is high . ”
A U.S. survey by Forrester Research last year found that green consumers , who agree to pay extra for electronics that use less energy or come from an environmentally friendly maker , are more brand - loyal than average consumers .
“ More than 25 million U.S. adults fall into this segment , enough for even the largest consumer electronics marketers to target , ” Forrester analyst Christopher Mines said .
“ Green - targeted PCs and other electronics will evolve as part of the consumer electronics industry ’s move to go beyond ‘ beige box ’ design , ” he said .
“ Apple certainly leads the way here . ”
A green - technology product that establishes new benchmarks and appeals to concerned consumers “ will have an iconic market presence if done right , ” Mines adds .
Despite a hike in fuel prices , Brussels Airlines decided not to increase its fuel tax , but rather to slow its
Avro planes by about 10 km/h ( from Mach 0.7 to Mach 0.69 ) on European routes .
This would cut its annual fuel bill by 1 million euros ( $ 1.6 m ) , adding an average minute or two to flight times .
( Ed : Flying to Rome , that does not matter , as minimum waiting time for luggage at Fiumicino airport is one hour anyway ... )
Other measures taken are to use lighter seat covers ( saving 50 kg per flight ) , and to monitor the amount of water taken onboard to flush the toilet .
They are also considering taking out all of the ashtrays , which are unused anyway .

Phil Gramm recently said , “ We have become a nation of whiners . ”
And that this is a “ mental ” recession .
You also have Rush Limbaugh spouting off that 5 % of the U.S. carries the other 95 % .
The Republican party is out - of - touch .
The amazing thing , about these statements , is that the GOP is finally being honest about who they are and who they represent .
They do n’t support the average person .
Their base is , as George W. Bush said , “ the haves and the have mores . ”
The sad part is that they have been able to bring in middle and low income people , as Republican voters , by using wedge issues to distract them from the fact they are voting against their own financial interests .
The good news is that people are waking up and realizing that fact .
John Mica is part of that elitist Republican clique .
He consistently votes against the middle class .
Eight thousand people a day are facing foreclosure .
In District 7 we have some of the worst in the U.S. According to the Daytona Beach News - Journal on July 10th , 2008 “ Court filings related to foreclosures totaled 1,135 in Volusia and Flagler counties in June . ”
“ Flagler County saw a 242 percent leap … Volusia County also saw a significant 91 percent increase … ”
John Mica recently voted against Assistance to States for purchasing Foreclosed Homes HR 5818 , Housing Foreclosure Assistance HR 3221 , National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act HR 2895 , and he voted NO on regulating the Subprime Mortgage industry HR 3915
John Mica voted twice to support the “ Enron loophole ” ( HR 5660 Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 ) that Phil Gramm finally managed to sneak onto a bill in 2000 .
Mrs. Wendy Gramm worked at Enron and was part of that criminal operation responsible for most of their employees losing their retirement .
Oh , well .
That ’s the “ Ownership Society ” for you .
John Mica also voted for the Bankruptcy Bill , in 2005 .
That bill made sure that average Americans wo n’t be able to get a fresh start .
Studies have shown that most middle class bankruptcies are a result of medical bills .
Of course , John Mica and his millionaire buddies do n’t have to worry if they make a mistake .
Thanks to the Republicans if you are wealthy enough to have an “ asset protection trust ” , you are able to file bankruptcy , walk away with most all of your assets , and rebuild .
Safety nets for the poor are bad .
If you are rich , then it ’s ok .
They also voted down a Democratic amendment to help military personnel .
But , the Republicans support the troops , right ?
At least that ’s what the car magnet says .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Army scientist who apparently committed suicide this week was close to being charged in connection with a series of deadly anthrax attacks in 2001 , federal law enforcement officials said on Friday .

They said Bruce Ivins , 62 , who worked for the last 18 years at government biodefense research laboratories at nearby Fort Detrick , Maryland , took an overdose of painkillers over the weekend and died on Tuesday in an apparent suicide .
A lawyer representing Ivins said the scientist had fully cooperated with the government ’s anthrax investigation for six years , that he was innocent and they would have established that at trial .
“ We are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law , ” attorney Paul Kemp said in a statement .
“ The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people , as has already been seen in this investigation .
In Dr. Ivins ’ case , it led to his untimely death . ”
The finely powdered anthrax was sent through the mail to media organizations and politicians shortly after the September 11 attacks by al Qaeda militants in 2001 .
The anthrax mailings killed five people and sickened 17 , shut down a Senate office building and spread fear of further biological attacks among Americans already reeling from September 11 .
The only deadly biological attack to take place on U.S. soil , it severely disrupted the national postal service , forcing billions of dollars in changes to its operations and turned ordinary envelopes into something to be feared .
The law enforcement officials said the death of Ivins could lead to the end of the FBI ’s long - running and much - criticized criminal investigation .
Earlier , suspicion cantered on another government scientist , Steven Hatfill , but he was not charged and the government agreed in June to pay him $ 5.85 million to drop his lawsuit against the Justice Department .
SKILLED MICROBIOLOGIST
The Los Angeles Times said Ivins had been informed of his impending prosecution shortly before his death .
Viewed as a skilled microbiologist , Ivins helped the FBI analyze materials recovered from one of the anthrax - tainted envelopes sent to a senator ’s office in Washington , the newspaper reported .
The Justice Department , the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service said in a brief statement that “ substantial progress has been made in the investigation , ” but declined to give details now .
Court documents detailing the evidence against Ivins have yet to be unsealed , and law enforcement officials said they were briefing victims and families of the victims as well as members of Congress .
In 2002 , Hatfill , who worked in the same laboratory as Ivins at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of infectious Diseases USAMRIID , was called “ a person of interest ” in the investigation by then - Attorney General John Ashcroft .
The anthrax incident embarrassed experts in biodefense , who had spent years warning the U.S. government of the threat of such an attack .
“ It ’s a shame that people ’s awareness about the kind of disruption and destruction that is possible came from someone working inside biodefense circles , ” Monica Schoch - Spana of the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh said in a telephone interview .
CNN interviewed a man who identified himself as Tom Ivins , brother of the deceased .
He confirmed his brother had committed suicide and said he himself had been interviewed by the FBI 18 months ago in connection with the investigation .
Alan Pearson , director of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Control Program at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation , urged the FBI to keep investigating .
“ If Ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks , did he have any assistance ?
Did anyone else at the Army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to , during , or shortly after the anthrax attacks ? ”
Pearson asked .
America has survived a feckless political class in the past , and it will again after this week .
But Monday 's crash and burn of the Paulson plan on Capitol Hill reveals a Washington elite that has earned every bit of the disdain that Americans have for it .
This crowd can't even make sausage .
The 228-205 defeat reflects badly on all concerned , starting with the Democrats who run the House .
The majority party is responsible for assembling a majority vote , and Speaker Nancy Pelosi failed in that fundamental task .
Her ...
Sarah Palin calls herself a " Bible - believing Christian . "
She was baptized in the Roman Catholic church but then raised in the Assemblies of God denomination from the time she was four - years - old until 2002 .
Today she no longer considers herself a Pentecostal .
In high school , she led her local Fellowship of Christian Athletes group .

Religion / Church : Evangelical Christian ; Non-Denominational
Palin was rebaptized at age 12 in the Wasilla Assembly of God .
When she left the church in 2002 , she and her family joined Wasilla Bible Church as their place of worship .
According to the National Catholic Reporter , today Palin frequents an independent , non-denominational Christian church known as Church on the Rock , located in Wasilla , Alaska .
It was also reported in the past by an Associated Press religion writer , that Palin sometimes attended the Juneau Christian Center in Juneau , Alaska .
Sarah Palin's Expressions of Faith
When early testing showed that Palin 's fifth child would be born with Down syndrome , Palin 's pro-life stance and undoubtedly her Christian faith , kept her from ever considering ending the pregnancy .
When little " Trig " was born , Sarah told the Anchorage Daily News , " she was sad at first but they now feel blessed that God chose them . "
This press statement from the Palin family explains in more detail :
" Trig is beautiful and already adored by us .
We knew through early testing he would face special challenges , and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives .
We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place .
We are truly blessed . "

Palin opposes abortion in all cases , except to save the life of the mother .
As governor of Alaska , she stated :
" Faith is very important to so many of us here in America , and I would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech . ”
Also as governor of Alaska , Palin strengthened the faith - based initiatives that had been set up by her predecessor .
She supported capital punishment and favored schools teaching both evolution and creationism .
She opposed embryonic stem cell research and said : “ We should not create human life , create an embryo and then destroy it for research if there are other options out there . ”
In a 2008 vice presidential debate , Palin said she is “ tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners , ” but “ I do n’t support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman . ”
She also indicated that she would support a federal constitutional amendment , like the one in Alaska , banning same - sex marriage .
Michael Paulson , a religion writer for the Boston Globe , put together this faith perspective called , " Sarah Palin on faith , life , and creation . "
In it he includes this portion of a 2006 Anchorage Daily News article :
" Her Christian faith , they say , came from her mother , who took her children to area Bible churches as they were growing up ( Sarah is the third of four siblings ) .
They say her faith has been steady since high school , when she led the Fellowship of Christian Athletes , and grew stronger as she sought out believers in her college years .
Palin does n't brandish her religion on the campaign trail , but that does n't prevent others from doing so . "
During her 2008 campaign for the vice - presidency , Palin spoke at the Wasilla Assembly of God , asking members to pray " for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right also for this country , " and " that our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from God .
That 's what we have to make sure we 're praying for : that there is a plan and that plan is God 's plan . "
A longtime Alaska resident , Chas St. George , said , " Wearing her faith quietly fits more with Palin 's personality . "

While playing 1899 , he played what he described as a " bird of a shot " , which became " birdie " over time .
The word golf does not mean " Gentleman Only , Ladies Forbidden " .
This is an internet myth .

1. This is Floyd Marinescu and Bobby Norton here at OOPSLA with Guy Steele .
Guy can you tell us a bit about yourself and introduce yourself to the viewers ?
I am a Sun Fellow at Sun Microsystems laboratories right now and I 've worked at a number of companies before that , Thinking Machines Corporation , Tartan Laboratories ; I taught at Carnegie - Mellon University before that .
My interest has always been in programming languages ; I 've been interested in programming languages for almost 40 years .
I guess I did my involvement from first years in FORTRAN in 1968 when I was still a young teenager , got involved with APL and LISP and other languages and after that I 've just enjoyed learning language after language and trying to understand their relationships near design structure .
2 . For developers you started in JAVA , what lessons can they learn from past languages ?
One thing you can learn is that there have been different concerns about programming over the past 50 years and languages are tended to redress those themes ; for example pattern matching , that was a hot topic among the 60s and a lot of languages were developed just to try to help you solve the pattern matching .
SNOBOL , for example , to do string matching and there were some artificial intelligence languages .
They focused on that and they thought that if only we could match the right knowledge , then we would have the answers to our disposal to solve the problems and they made some progress that way .
Later other topics are just concurrency became an issue and concurrency is addressed more beginning in the 70s and 80s , good languages such as Concurrent Pascal .
I think in the beginning programming languages tended to dress the problem of scientific computation in business programming , but as we build more and more tools systems programming became sort of a third topic area in some languages such as C and Pascal used right operating systems so there are a number of languages developed to tackle those .
There are questions of types and what information a compiler could figure out about a program without actually having to run the program and so there has been a period of exploration of more and more elaborate type theories , and those got elaborated , I think , during the 80s and 90s .
Finally when we reached the 90s and the explosion of the Internet we were concerned about programming the Internet , programming World Wide Web and worrying about issues of safety and limiting virus transmission , and also to make it easy to download codes of platform independence became a real issue once the Internet came into its own and JAVA helped address that issue .
So I guess my point is that one reason there is n't a single universal programming language is that our needs have changed over time and languages tend to change or emerge to address those needs .
So it 's important for a developer to understand his historical context , I suppose , by historical context I mean the last five years , now that we get there , or it might mean the last 20 or 30 .
But to understand what are the perceived needs to are driving the language designs and , of course , this is an endless circle , it 's not a matter of a beginning and end , but things are constantly progressing through time .
3 . Where do you think we are now in terms of JAVA relative to the initial perceived needs it was designed for ?
I think JAVA is serving a certain need which is very well , which is commercial processing on the web , transaction processing , supporting internet commerce and levering other kinds of content to web .
It 's also being used on servers to serve web app content to the web .
I would say that JAVA is currently not addressing high and scientific computation for example and I think that 's actually a conscious decision .
There was a movement in the late 90s on the part of people in places like the National Laboratories and people who 've been FORTRAN programmers , the one who gets some of the benefits of JAVA such as platform portability and proposed a bunch of changes in addition to JAVA that would support their needs and they were rejected by the JAVA community process because I think the JAVA community as it existed had found a certain central sweet spot and we were afraid adding too much might disrupt their comfortable situation and so , I think that is OK .
It 's OK for a language not to try to support everyone in the world , but then those who are n't supported they need to find some other language , some other niche to occupy .
4 . In the panel , you mentioned concurrency as being a major driver of language evolution .
Can you tell us a bit more about that and how you see that going ?
There has been a fascination on the part of … with parallel processing for a long time and super computers have been parallel for the last 20 or 30 years and I worked for a super computer company , for example , Thinking Machine Corporation , we were all excited about building a parallel computer with thousands of processors and trying to get the software working on that , we thought it 'll be only a matter of a few more years before that parallelism would hit the desktop .
We were off by 20 years , but it 's now arrived .
We are seeing multi core chips , and it's not so much we 've reached the end of Moore law as that the economic tradeoffs have reached the point where we 're better off putting more than one core in a chip , even for desktop computers , even for laptops .
And so now that we have become widespread the software programming is becoming an issue , and so we are going to see our next 5 - 10 years languages designed .
John Miller , in the Computer World last March , was saying that if your programming language does n't address parallelism it is going to wither and dye within the next 5 - 10 years .
JAVA , of course , does support concurrency .
It 's got more multiple threads and I would say that was the first programming language that made platform independent multithreading mainstream which was great .
But it 's a 10 - year - old design and there are some issues with the way JAVA addressed it ; in particular I have often said I think one of that major design mistakes of JAVA , and I wish I had caught this 10 years ago , is that to hand out a pointer to an object for any purpose is to hand out the ability to lock it ; locks are public , it would have been better if locks were private and that is probably something we can't retract at this point .
So we can add new concurrency mechanisms to JAVA and sort of abandon the old locks , perhaps even a new locking mechanism , but the existing mechanisms are going to need some revision for sake of safe concurrent programming .
I guess I should 've explained the reason why you do n't want to hand out a public pointer to a lock is it allows denial service attacks .
If a slightly untrusted piece of code decides to lock something you do n't expect to be locked , then that object does become unavailable to methods who are to be using it , and so there are some safety issues involved with exactly the way you go about supporting the synchronization for concurrency .
5 . Will JAVA be the best tool for the JAVA for the concurrent programming or should we be looking at things like Erlang which were designed around this from the beginning ?
A couple of things first : I hesitate to recommend any languages " the best " for a job in such a broad category .
Second , Erlang has already earned its place I think for a certain kind of concurrency application such as telephony and grew up in that arena , apparently is very well suited for it .
I am not an expert on Erlang , I 've read some papers on Erlang , I 've read Erlang programs , I 've not written them , but it seems to be very clean language design , from my point of view as a language designer .
I think that JAVA is perhaps a little more general purposed than it has been designed and used more widely throughout the World Wide Web , which is nice .
6 . Do you see the concurrency features in Erlang reason enough to work on some kind of interoperability or perhaps in running Erlang on the JVM ?
I am always for interoperability and I am always for using the JVM or other VM's as platforms for multiple languages .
Erlang does have some strengths and I think it would be great to try to explore the interactions of Erlang in JAVA .
I speak as one who 's learned a lot of programming languages , a few of them in great depth and others in less depth but enough to be modernly fluent in them and I find that every new programming language I learned increases my breath of knowledge , my breath of expressiveness and even if I do n't write any more code in that new language it changes the way I think about writing code and languages I already know .
So I found value in learning lots of different programming languages .
My early LISP code was in more of a FORTRAN style , now it is in a more APL style because learning APL caused me to think more globally about aggregates of data in the way I process arrays , so I tend to think about processing the entire lists when I write list code and of course my knowledge of APL and LISP tends to influence by JAVA style as well .
I hope for the better , so yes , I think it would be great if languages such as Erlang could interoperate with JAVA and I think it would be better for people on both sides to learn the other style .
7 . What do you think would be the three languages that every software developer should know in order to have a good wide breath of available paradigms and theoretical knowledge , or let 's say five ?
I think a practitioner needs to know both JAVA and either C or C++ , just because those are the big working languages today .
Then I 'd pick two or three other languages for stylistic enrichment ; I guess I would recommend perhaps LISP , FORTRAN and APL if you wanted to pick old time languages .
More recently you might want to take a look at Ruby and Haskell , to pick a functional language , and COBOL , which has some interesting ideas in it you wo n't find in some of the other languages .
8 . Back to the parallelism topic , a lot of developers are asking why is n't threading good enough .
What 's the difference between multi core and multithreads ?
Why do we need new paradigms and constructs for that ?
It 's because the threads hardly give you anything more than just the knowledge that you have multiple cores , multiple processors working on your job .
Having multiple threads is the lowest level primitive that gives you access to multiple processors , and it's like having just GOTOs without having FOR loops and WHILE - DO and subroutine calls .
The problem is not in having access to processors and figuring out how to organize the parallelism for your benefit , as you need to figure out what the higher level of abstractions are that you really want to work in most of the time .
Yes , you want to dig down there and get the low level of things .
It 's like having arrays instead of just address arithmetic .
So we want to figure out how to organize processors into groups and clusters .
I find it very interesting that programming languages and people who design programming languages that provide for control parallelism very often use metaphors out of social science .
They 'll talk about things like master - slave relationships and producer - consumer relationships , they 'll talk about whether threads are dependent or independent , and these have very strong overtones of social organization and social relationships , and this may be because a lot of our experience of organizing parallel processes before computers had to do with organizing people , so as to work cooperatively or collaboratively .
And so one can talk about hierarchies and various kinds of peer to peer and collaborative relationships and try to gain some inside from those metaphors .
9 . Is there anything to say about what some of these new constructs might be ?
Well , one of them is simply the idea of data parallel programming which , again I keep mentioning APL in part because I am here at a conference where APL 2007 is collocated , which I find exciting ; I have had an interest in that language ever since it came out , which has been 40 years now , it came out in the 1967 , I think , as an IBM product .
The data parallelism is that you organize your data into collections , typically arrays , and let the structure of data guide the structure of parallelism .
Another organization is so called " separate address space languages " , where the model is that you write a sequential program , but then you run many copies of it , then you have some way for the different copies to communicate , typically by message passing or through some kind of restricted shared memory structure .
Yet a different way to organize it is to say there is one big address space , or to put it another way in high level language terms , there are many processes that each has access to all the same variables and there the problem is managing the concurrent access to the variables so they are not stepping on each other 's feet all the time .
And that 's very much like having a classroom full of students and a single blackboard and they can all write on the blackboard ; we have to make sure they are cooperating the right way .
So these are different ways of organizing a parallel computation , and we want to design languages to support one or another of these metaphors in a clear way .
There are other ways of doing it as well that are more exotic , but those are sort of the big three that I can think of .
10 .
What do you think of this recent trend of developers taking upon themselves to build their own domain specific languages ?
I think that is fantastic .
In fact they are just added , in some sense , to every programming effort begins with trying to figure out what it is you really want to talk about and then you build up a library that supports that .
Every time you write a subroutine you 're in effect customizing your base language to be a little bit closer to your domain .
We think a domain specific language uses a fairly comprehensive set of such subroutines or macros or some kind of facility , so that by the time you are actually thinking about the application , you are thinking in terms that are closer to the terminology of domain than the terminology of programming , and so you are not thinking so much about the mechanics of subroutines and increasing i by one and things like that , and you are thinking more of each step about something that makes sense within your proper domain .
But many programming efforts begin by first building o domain specific language or at least a domain specific set of subroutines and then going from there .
So to that extent many programmers end up being language designers although they do n't necessary think of it that way .
Now , there are people who consider those language designers like an application programmers who set out to build specific languages to support certain kinds of domains .
We mentioned Erlang earlier , in fact , perhaps Erlang started out life as an attempt to build a domain specific language for making telephone connections and turned out to be much more general than that in every way , which is great .
I like to point to something like Make , which is an extremely domain specific language for describing how to compile and build components as to make a complete system of some sort and that is so domain specific that is not at all general purpose , it 's probably not complete , but it handles the specific task very well .
Bill Gasper , he was one of the old time hackers at MIT and he said : " Do n't forget a data structure is merely a stupid programming language , and its point is that a data structure in effect , when given to the program that processes it , is guiding a computation and in effect constitutes a dumb little language that turns a specific application into a more specific one " .
11 . So as developers are exploring the creation of DSLs , how can they become better language designers ?
First of all it helps to study the literature of languages ; if you want to become good at anything , you should read about it first .
So if you want to design new languages you can be better at it if you study existing language designs and sort of try to pull them apart and learn what makes them tick .
There is a technical vocabulary that you can learn that helps you to talk about the features of a language ; we talk about things like types and binding and scope , there is lexical scope and dynamic scope and variable access to inheritance and things like that .
These are terms that we use and if you can come up to a new programming language with these concepts in mind , it can help to more accurately pick a part , how are languages put together in terms of why it was put together the way it was , and that can help you design languages .
Now that said , it would be really boring if every language we spoke was designed by grammarians ; languages ideally should be living as well and the design of a language should be driven not only by these theoretical considerations , but also by the needs of a specific application domain .
So my other advice to a would - be language designer is really understand the language , at least one application domain you hope language will address , understand that well and then try to figure how your language addresses that .
12 . What do you see as tradeoffs or some guidelines tour when doing domain driven design , creating new APIs that are expressive as domain concepts versus creating new languages that are expressive as the domain concepts ?
I guess I would see two differences between those and those would be convenience and convention .
It 's certainly convenient for the developer of a domain specific language to work within an existing language and develop APIs to just involve method calls and function calls , and that also makes it easy to use because you 've got existing tools and framework for using that existing language such as JAVA .
The downside of that is maybe less convenient to use in part because JAVA method calls may not be the conventional notation of the domain ; if it were physics for example the notation of physics does n't look anything like the notation of JAVA and so you 're interpreting things like " .add " when you want to add , instead you want a plus sign , that kind of thing .
So in ability to support the conventional notation of a domain , may make it less convenient for a user to use , on the other hand use an existing framework may make it more convenient in other ways .
So to the extent that you want to aid the application developer by letting him use the tools that he 's used to use in his notational conventions and his concepts , you can develop the concepts of any notation , but if you can provide the notation as well that 's a boon .
Now that said , one could choose a language other than JAVA in which to embed domain specific language and turns out that some languages as base languages are more extensible and allow wider variety of notations and others .
LISP , for example pretty much imposes their requirement that you start with everything being parenthesized .
That may seem awkward , but on the other hand it provides an elaborate macro facility that in other ways may allow you to adjust the notation .
There have been other extensible languages designed in the past .
The extensible languages were big deal in the 1960s and they kind of fell away in the 70s , and there may be a better revival coming up as we try to build language structures and frameworks that better support the development of domain specific languages .
Fortress is one good example of that , the language project that I am working on now that 's on labs .
Fortress started out life as an attempt to build a high and scientific programming language , but we ended up designing a framework for language experimentation in which our first experiment was the scientific language , and to that end we 've tried to add a lot of facilities for notation extensibility , and one of the things we want to experiment with is building other very different domain specific notations to see whether this idea of flexibility pays out or not .

For years , the data contained in the weekly Commitment of Traders Report ( COT ) , issued by the CFTC , have indicated that several large COMEX traders have manipulated the price of silver and gold .
For an equal number of years , the CFTC has reluctantly responded to public pressure over this issue with blanket denials of any wrongdoing .
Many analysts have agreed with the CFTC�s position , conjuring up various ways to explain why a massive short position held by a handful of traders is not manipulative .
The recent widespread shortage of silver for retail purchase coupled with a price collapse appears to have shaken these analysts � confidence that the COMEX silver market is operating �fair and square . �
Well it should , since there is no rational explanation for a significant price decline going hand in hand with product shortages other than collusive manipulation .
For any remaining doubters that COMEX silver and gold pricing is manipulated , the following CFTC data should be considered .
This data is taken from a monthly report issued by the CFTC , called the Bank Participation Report .
Here�s the link for the report - http://www.cftc.gov/marketreports/bankparticipation/index.htm
The relevant data is found in the July and August futures sections .
I will condense it .
These facts speak for themselves .
Here are the facts .
As of July 1 , 2008 , two U.S. banks were short 6,199 contracts of COMEX silver ( 30,995,000 ounces ) .
As of August 5 , 2008 , two U.S. banks were short 33,805 contracts of COMEX silver ( 169,025,000 ounces ) , an increase of more than five - fold .
This is the largest such position by U.S. banks I can find in the data , ever .
Between July 14 and August 15th , the price of COMEX silver declined from a peak high of $ 19.55 ( basis September ) to a low of $ 12.22 for a decline of 38 % .
For gold , 3 U.S. banks held a short position of 7,787 contracts ( 778,700 ounces ) in July , and 3 U.S. banks held a short position of 86,398 contracts ( 8,639,800 ounces ) in August , an eleven - fold increase and coinciding with a gold price decline of more than $ 150 per ounce .
As was the case with silver , this is the largest short position ever by US banks in the data listed on the CFTC�s site .
This was put on as one massive position just before the market collapsed in price .
This data suggests other questions should be answered by banking regulators , the CFTC , or by those analysts who still doubt this market is rigged .
Is there a connection between 2 U.S. banks selling an additional 27,606 silver futures contracts ( 138 million ounces ) in a month , followed shortly thereafter by a severe decline in the price of silver ?
That �s equal to 20 % of annual world mine production or the entire COMEX warehouse stockpile , the second largest inventory in the world .
How could the concentrated sale of such quantities in such a short time not influence the price ?
Is there a connection between 3 U.S. banks selling an additional 78,611 gold futures contracts ( 7,861,100 ounces ) in a month , followed shortly by a severe price decline in gold ?
That �s equal to 10 % of annual world production and amounts to more than $ 7 billion worth of gold futures being sold by 3 U.S. banks in a month .
How can this extraordinary concentrated trading size not be manipulative ?
Because prices fell so sharply after the short sales were taken ( with the appropriate dirty tricks as I have previously explained ) holders of known physical silver in the world suffered a decline in value of more than $ 2.5 billion and long COMEX silver futures holders suffered a similar $ 2.5 billion decline in the value of their contracts .
In gold , because the dollar value held is much greater than silver , investor losses were much greater , on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars on their physical holdings .
Declines in the value of mining shares adds many billions more .
Was this loss of value caused by the concentrated short selling of 2 or 3 U.S. banks ?
What real legitimate business do 2 or 3 U.S. banks suddenly have for selling short such quantities of speculative instruments over a brief time period ?
Do we want banks to be engaging in this type of activity ?
If the manipulation was not successful , would U.S. taxpayers be called on to bail out yet another bank speculation gone bad ?
Do the traders who lost money in the recent price collapse of silver have a reason to believe that their money is now in the pockets of these two or three U.S. banks ?
If so , do they have recourse ?
The data in the Bank Participation report is clear and compelling .
that it is hard to conclude anything but manipulation .
It is beyond credulity to conclude other than two or three banks caused one of the most severe price collapses in precious metals history .
The CFTC has a lot to answer for as the regulatory agency responsible for preventing this type of blatant manipulation .

Hamas men have detained scores of Fatah officials in the last week
A number of top representatives of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas have been arrested in the Gaza Strip , officials from his Fatah movement say .
Fatah officials Ibrahim Abu Naja and Zakaria Agha were among those detained as part of a continuing Hamas crackdown following a coastal bombing last week .
Mr Abbas appointed the two men to run Fatah in Gaza when the Islamist Hamas seized control of the area in 2007 .
Fatah says dozens of its men are being held , but Hamas has not given a number .
A Hamas spokesman said the latest arrests were in response to the detentions of Hamas men in the West Bank .
Beach - side bomb
Earlier the Palestinian president ordered the release of dozens of Hamas members rounded up by his security forces in the West Bank in the past week -- during the day , four men were set free .
Hamas and Fatah have to stop fighting for all of us

Hamas and Fatah battle for power
Both sides arrested large numbers of each other 's supporters in the aftermath of a bomb blast in Gaza a week ago , in which five Hamas members and a girl were killed .
The bomb exploded inside a car travelling past a beach where people were enjoying a day by the sea .
Hamas insists the arrests of Fatah members are part of its investigation into the bombing .
Fatah denies any involvement in the attack .
The latest detentions show that the tit - for - tat , politically motivated campaigns are continuing , our correspondent says .
Microsoft has received a patent on a “ new and improved ” Page - Up and Page - Down system .
Timothy D. Sellers et al. was awarded the patent on August 19 , 2008 for a “ Method and system for navigating paginated content in page - based increments . ”
Abstract for United States Patent 7,415,666
A method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document , such as one page , regardless of whether the zoom is such that some , all or one page is currently being viewed .
In one implementation , pressing a Page Down or Page Up keyboard key / button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page , and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page .
For example , if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom , a Page Down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page .
Similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row .
Full text of 7,415,666
Perhaps patent examiners are unable to tell what ’s obvious or not because the very language in which patents are written is so obscure .
Try parsing this sentence :
A document viewing component , such as in the form of a control hosted in a program , controls the scrolling operation , such as by containing a scroll control .
Most likely this twisted language is the work product of Workman Nydeggar , the patent attorneys on this one .
No doubt they are responsible for this closing flourish :
While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions , certain illustrated embodiments thereof are shown in the drawings and have been described above in detail .
It should be understood , however , that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed , but on the contrary , the intention is to cover all modifications , alternative constructions , and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention .
Patent 7,415,666 was submitted in March 2005 so it took three years for the patent office to take in all this mumbo- jumbo and decide to give its approval .
So if the USPTO is going to approve nearly every patent — and I ’d love to see a list of rejected ones — why does it take three years to do so ?
Also , 7,415,666 was not the only good news for Timothy D. Sellers of Bellevue WA .
This week , he had three patents approved , upping his own total to nine .
He re-invented the toolbar , among other things .
Thanks to Richard Forno’s of InfoWarrior for his posting to Dave Farber ’s IP list .
If you 're one of the thousands of voters angry over the Democrats ' cave on domestic spying and telecom amnesty , a new online grassroots movement is now making it easy to buy a local ad on MSNBC , CNN and several other networks , for less money than you 'd think .
A group of Barack Obama supporters and startup SaysMe.tv have created a new television ad to keep both the public and lawmakers ' attention focused on the issue of warrantless wiretapping and the telecoms ' immunity from lawsuits in the United States .
Credit : GetFISARight
The grassroots group Get FISA
Right has created a 30 - second spot critical of the surveillance bill passed by Congress earlier this month .
It 's placed the spot with a Los Angeles startup that buys ad time in bulk from cable providers and resells off slivers to individuals willing to pay for airtime in markets around the country .
The mashup means anyone who supports the repeal of the controversial law can pay online with a credit card to run the advertisement in any of eight cable TV markets around the country .
By August 15 , 22 markets will be available .
The cost of spots varies from six dollars for placement on CNBC between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. in Cleveland , for example , to $ 1,856 to run on CNN in New York City between 6 p.m. and midnight .
The wiretap protest movement started life as a group on Barack
Obama 's social networking site My.BarackObama.com .
The group was dedicated to deterring Obama from voting for a measure that legalized President
Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program and granted retroactive legal immunity to the phone companies that cooperated with the spying when it was illegal .
Membership swelled to more than 24,000 ahead of the July vote , but it still failed to deter Obama from supporting the unprecedented expansion of U.S. domestic spying powers .
Determined to keep the debate alive into the next Congress , GetFisaRight is using SaysMe.
TV to bring their message to television , 30 - seconds at a time .
It 's a first for online activists : A netroots invasion of a medium traditionally dominated by deeper pockets like special interest political groups , official political campaigns and corporations .
Spots have already been purchased in Charlotte , North Carolina , Dallas and Los Angeles .
SaysMe.tv enables individuals to choose where and when they want to advertise their causes and opinions on cable television networks using an embeddable online application .
Screenshot : Saysme.tvSupporters can choose which markets and what time they want the ad to run .
SaysMe.TV then submits the ad to the cable company , which takes up to two weeks to approve , making sure that it conforms to the cable network 's standards , FCC regulations and federal electioneering law .
SaysMe.TV then sends the purchaser of the ad an e-mail 24 hours before the ad runs to tell them exactly what time the spot will appear .
" The value of these ads is that they expose this issue to people who have n't otherwise heard about it , " says Jon Pincus , the chief organizer of the effort .
" In the aggregate , this effort as a whole has value . "
Pincus teamed up with SaysMe.TV and other activists on the group 's Wikito create the 30 - second ad .
The point , he says , is to build up enough political clout to change the debate in races where candidates are running with significant online support .
He also hopes to influence Congress and the next administration to revisit the issue of amnesty and domestic spying .
" We care about this issue , we 're not going away , we expect things to change , and we expect Congress and the administration to get FISA
right , " Pincus says .
The group had also encouraged community activists to attend the " listening sessions " organized by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee this month .
The sessions were designed to gather grassroots feedback to build the party platform that will be voted on during the convention in August – though it seems unlikely that the Democratic party will add opposition to a bill it already passed as a plank in its platform .
Now Pincus and other group members are figuring out how to most effectively use the new TV tool .
Pincus says he envisions running anti-amnesty ads in his hometown of Seattle , where Democratic challenger and netroots favorite Darcy Burner is running for Congress .
Burner was against the telecom immunity legislation , and Pincus says that running some ads might help to publicize that fact and turn out supporters for her .
Lisa Eisenpresser , SaysMe.TV's CEO , calls her service a " vending machine " for cable TV slots .
And unlike direct political contributions , there 's no spending limit for TV ads – though she says that the company reports customers ' payment information to the Federal Election Commission whenever an ad promotes a particular candidate .
SaysMe.TV and Spotrunner , a similar service , make the most sense for issue groups such as Pincus ' FISA group , rather than for political candidates , says Phil de Vellis , a senior associate and vice president for the Democratic political advertising firm Murphy Putnam Media .
That 's because political candidates still want to generally rely on the expertise of professionals with demographic and voting data to wring the most bang out of their advertising bucks .

Haiti used to grow its own rice , and its farmers were protected by high tariff barriers .
But as a condition for an International Monetary Fund loan in 1986 , it was compelled to slash tariffs , and within two years the local markets had been flooded by heavily subsidised American rice .
Local farmers , unable to compete , went out of business .
The process was repeated in 1994 .
Globalised Haiti , no longer able to feed itself , was at the mercy of the world food prices .
Meanwhile , the price of food has become a pawn in the hands of financial speculators .
Speculative trading in agricultural commodities has grown by more than 1,000 per cent in the past four years , to more than $ 150 bn ( £ 76bn ) .
With the price of oil – the key ingredient in fertilisers and agrochemicals – surging unstoppably , food prices are expected to remain at historic highs for the next decade .
A sane world would at this point reverse course and do some of the worthy things that UN summits are so good at talking about – helping some of the 96 per cent of African farms dependent on rainfall to build irrigation systems , for example .
But the business - driven priority , as endorsed by the FAO summit , is to gouge open the world 's economies even faster , via a speedy conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalisation .
That is likely to make it even harder for the poor to feed themselves .
This is the third post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lectures four and five , which are on the topic of sorting .
The previous post covered a lecture on " Divide and Conquer " algorithm design technique and its applications .
Lecture four is devoted entirely to a single sorting algorithm which uses this technique .
The algorithm I am talking about is the " Quicksort " algorithm .
The quicksort algorithm was invented by Charles Hoare in 1962 and it is the most widely used sorting algorithm in practice .
I wrote about quicksort before in " Three Beautiful Quicksorts " post , where its running time was analyzed experimentally .
This lecture does it theoretically .
Lecture five talks about theoretical running time limits of sorting using comparisons and then discusses two linear time sorting algorithms -- Counting sort and Radix sort .
Lecture 4 : Quicksort
The lecture starts by giving the divide and conquer description of the algorithm :
Divide : Partition the array to be sorted into two subarrays around pivot x , such that elements in the lower subarray <= x , and elements in the upper subarray >= x .
: Partition the array to be sorted into two subarrays around pivot x , such that elements in the lower subarray <= x , and elements in the upper subarray >= x. Conquer : Recursively sort lower and upper subarrays using quicksort .
: Recursively sort lower and upper subarrays using quicksort .
Combine : Since the subarrays are sorted in place , no work is needed to combine them .
The entire array is now sorted !
The main algorithm can be written in a few lines of code :
Quicksort ( A , p , r ) // sorts list A [ p..r ] if p < r q = Partition ( A , p , r ) Quicksort ( A , p , q - 1 ) Quicksort ( A , q+1 , r )
The key in this algorithm is the Partition subroutine :
Partition ( A , p , q ) // partitions elements in array A [ p..q ] in - place around element x = A[p ] , // so that A [ p ..i ] <= x and A [ i ] == x and A [ i +1..q ] >= x x = A[ p ] i = p for j = p+1 to q if A[j ] <= x i = i+1 swap ( A[ i ] , A[j ] ) swap ( A[p ] , A[i ] ) return i
The lecture then proceeds with the analysis of Quicksort 's worst - case running time .
It is concluded that if the array to be sorted is already sorted or already reverse sorted , the running time is O ( n2 ) , which is no better than Insertion sort ( seen in lecture one ) !
What happens in the worst case is that all the elements get partitioned to one side of the chosen pivot .
For example , given an array ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , the partition algorithm chooses 1 as the pivot , then all the elements stay where they were , and no partitioning actually happens .
To overcome this problem Randomized Quicksort algorithm is introduced .
The main idea of randomized quicksort hides in the Partition subroutine .
Instead of partitioning around the first element , it partition around a random element in the array !
Nice things about randomized quicksort are :
Its running time is independent of initial element order .
No assumptions need to be made about the statistical distribution of input .
No specific input elicits the worst case behavior .
The worst case is determined only by the output of a random - number generator .
Randomized - Partition ( A , p , q ) < strong > swap ( A[p ] , A[rand ( p , q ) ] ) </ strong > // the only thing changed in the original Partition subroutine ! x = A[ p ] i = p for j = p+1 to q if A[j ] <= x i = i+1 swap ( A[ i ] , A[j ] ) swap ( A[p ] , A[i ] ) return i
The rest of the lecture is very math - heavy and uses indicator random variables to conclude that the expected running time of randomized quicksort is O ( n·lg ( n ) ) .
In practice quicksort is 3 or more times faster than merge sort .
Please see Three Beautiful Quicksorts post for more information about the version of industrial - strength quicksort .

Lecture 5 : Lower Sorting Bounds and Linear Sorting
The lecture starts with a question -- How fast can we sort ?
Erik Demaine ( professor ) answers and says that it depends on the model of what you can do with the elements .
The previous lectures introduced several algorithms that can sort n numbers in O ( n·lg ( n ) ) time .
Merge sort achieves this upper bound in the worst case ; quicksort achieves it on average .
These algorithms share an interesting property : the sorted order they determine is based only on comparisons between the input elements .
Such sorting algorithms are called Comparison Sorts , which is a model for sorting .
It turns out that any comparison sort algorithm can be translated into something that is called a Decision Tree .
A decision tree is a full binary tree that represents the comparisons between elements that are performed by a particular sorting algorithm operating on an input of a given size .
Erik uses decision trees to derive the lower bound for running time of comparison based sorting algorithms .
The result is that no comparison - based sort can do better than O ( n·lg ( n ) ) .
The lecture continues with bursting outside of comparison model and looks at sorting in linear time using no comparisons .
The first linear time algorithm covered in the lecture is Counting Sort .
The basic idea of counting sort is to determine , for each input element x , the number of elements less than x .
This information can be used to place element x directly into its position in the output array .
For example , if there are 17 elements less than x , then x belongs in output position 18 .
The second linear time algorithm is Radix Sort , which sorts a list of numbers by examining each digit at a given position separately .
Erik ends the lecture by analyzing correctness and running time of radix sort .

Have fun sorting !
The next post will be about order statistics ( given an array find n- th smallest element ) .
Mr. Kuntar , who was formally pardoned by Israel on Tuesday as part of the swap agreement , gave a different version of the night of the attack in his court testimony in 1980 , excerpts of which were published for the first time on Monday in Yediot Aharonot , an Israeli newspaper .
He told the court that Israeli gunfire had killed Mr. Haran as soldiers burst in to free him and that he did not see what happened to Mr. Haran ’s daughter .
Smadar Haran , the widow , still lives in Nahariya , just six miles from the Lebanese border .
So do Mr. Goldwasser ’s parents ; his wife ’s mother lives just a few doors down .
In a home surrounded by lush red bougainvillea , lemon and orange trees , and a high wall with a security gate , Mrs. Haran recently discussed her decision to speak out on the prisoner release .
Folding herself up on a high - backed striped couch , dark eyes staring straight ahead , she spoke softly but firmly of her decision not to stand in the way of Mr. Kuntar ’s release .
“ Samir Kuntar is not my private prisoner , and we live in a country where there is a framework for making decisions , ” she said , echoing what she wrote in a letter to the prime minister and the cabinet ahead of their decision to proceed with the deal .
“ I asked them not to think about my personal pain and to make decisions according to the interests of the state . ”
“ What happened to me and my family will always be part of me , part of my personal pain , but it does not mean that I do n’t see the pain of others , the Goldwasser and Regev families , ” she said .
And the best part is they could do it all from the comfort of their armchairs , without shouldering the costs of travelling to Afghanistan and the threats posed by gangs of Taliban militants .
Before Thomas 's project there was only one known site in the Registan desert region of Afghanistan and the last time a researcher visited the area was in the 1970s .
Using Google Earth , Thomas 's team have managed to catalogue 450 sites in the area , dating back centuries if not millennia .
" Even in the 70s when it was possible to go to Afghanistan it was quite a tribal area , quite an inhospitable area ... and to be quite frank there are easier areas to work than in the middle of the desert , " Thomas said .
In Google Earth 's satellite images of the Registan , which lies on the border between the Helmand and Kandahar provinces , Thomas and his team found deserted villages , camp sites , small fortresses , cemeteries , reservoirs and underground water channels .
This month , Thomas presented a poster containing detailed new plans of the citadel of Bust to the World Archaeological Congress in Dublin , Ireland .
Bust was the tenth to twelfth century Ghaznavid dynasty 's winter capital and stretches over seven kilometres along the Helmand river .
French archaeologists worked on the site in the 40s and 50s but the sheer scale of the remains meant large areas went unsurveyed , Thomas said .
" Only 130 of the 1286 known archaeological sites [ in Afghanistan ] have plans , " Thomas said .
" A lot of the sites are in very remote areas .
They have n't been excavated properly or even visited in detail , so what we 've done is we found that about 250 of those sites fall within high resolution areas in Google Earth , and we 've been focusing on the medieval sites and drawing plans based on the Google Earth images . "
Thomas said although archaeologists had leapt on Google Earth for use in their lectures and visual presentations , they had been lazy about using the potential data it contains for research .
While many archaeologists buy highly detailed satellite images of areas they are studying for hundreds of dollars , Google Earth is free and has built - in measurements , making it far easier to sketch plans .
" The most important aspect of the work is that we 'll be able to go to the Afghan archaeological institute and say these are the sites in this area , if you 've got guys down there you can either go and visit them or you can at least start thinking about trying to protect them , " Thomas said .

I realise there are times when the police need to work undercover if they suspect a crime is being committed .
But that is quite different to going into a crowd as an agitator to create disruption .
Last Sunday afternoon in Parliament Square , Central London , and several thousand anti-war protesters were gathered to mark President George W. Bush ’s last official visit to Britain .
The crowd was , as usual , relaxed , supportive and friendly .
So friendly that some people reckon an anti-war demo is a good place to find a partner .
It certainly beats internet dating .
The man I was to meet that day , however , left me angry and bemused .
At the start , the demo – organised by Stop The War Coalition , CND and the British Muslim Initiative – was peaceful , if lively .
Many protesters came with hooters , drums , screeching whistles and saucepan lids – every one of them passionately opposed to the invasion of Iraq .
But looming over us ominously was a heavy security presence : riot police , armed officers , even snipers on rooftops .
These days it appears permissible to wave a gun at Britons exercising their democratic rights .

Unless you are Scrooge McDuck or have a life - size poster of Dr. Eric R. Pianka on your wall , you probably like to see babies smile .
It is n't just you .
In a mother , her baby 's smile also lights up the reward centers of her brain , just like free money , wrote Baylor College of Medicine researchers in Pediatrics today .
Not only could findings like this help scientists learn more about the magic of the mother - infant bond , it could also tell us how it sometimes goes wrong , said Dr. Lane Strathearn , assistant professor of pediatrics at BCM and Texas Children 's Hospital and a research associate in BCM 's Human Neuroimaging Laboratory .
To study this relationship , Strathearn and his colleagues asked 28 first - time mothers with infants aged 5 to 10 months to watch photos of their own babies and other infants while they were in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner .
The machine measures blood flow in the brain .
In the scans , areas of increased blood flow " light up , " giving researchers a clue as to where brain activity takes place .
In some of the photos , babies were smiling or happy .
In others they were sad , and in some they had neutral expressions .
They found that when the mothers saw their own infants ' faces , key areas of the brain associated with reward lit up during the scans .
The areas stimulated by the sight of their own babies were those associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine .
Specifically , the areas associated included the ventral tegmental area / substantia nigra regions , the striatum , and frontal lobe regions involved in emotion processing , cognition and motor / behavioral outputs .
" These are areas that have been activated in other experiments associated with drug addiction , " said Strathearn .
" It may be that seeing your own baby 's smiling face is like a ' natural high ' . "
The strength of the reaction depended on the baby 's facial expression , he said .
" The strongest activation was with smiling faces , " he said .
There was less effect from pictures of their babies with sad or neutral expressions .
" We were expecting a different reaction with sad faces , " he said .
In fact , they found little difference in the reaction of the mothers ' brains to their own babies ' crying face compared to that of an unknown child .
Overall , the mothers responded much more strongly to their own infants ' faces than to those of an unknown baby .
" Understanding how a mother responds uniquely to her own infant , when smiling or crying , may be the first step in understanding the neural basis of mother –infant attachment , " said Strathearn .
Others who took part in this study include Drs. Jian Li and P. Read Montague of BCM and Peter Fonagy of the University College London in the United Kingdom .
Funding for this research to Strathearn came from the National Institutes of Health educational and mentoring grants and to the General Clinical Research Center .
Other funding came from grants to Montague from the Kane Family Foundation , the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
Ubuntu Linux :
Why me ?
( source : Rebecca )
To quench my thirst of experiencing Linux , I started my journey way back in the year 2000 with RedHat 6 .
It was not a love at first sight and I had to reinstall Windows 2000 on my machine since I was too young to understand the concept of dual - boot !
LiveCD was something I never knew in my dreams even !
The very thought of messing up my windows installation while trying to get things fixed with Linux haunted me for days .
Things are very different today from what they were a decade ago .
With the advent of LiveCDs , the perception for Linux has changed quite dramatically .
What was one believed to be a geek ’s operating system is now being used by school kids , doctors and grandpas too !
One more valid reason for immense popularity of Ubuntu Linux is that it does n’t need prior knowledge about * nix system and architecture to visit your favorite website .
You can do it just by booting up your machine with a LiveCD .
I ’ve myself been an Ubuntu fanboy !
Though geeks prefer a distro which gives freedom and power to conceive what they ’re actually trying to do and what ’s happening within the operating system .
However , there are people who want an operating system which is free and easy to install , configure and most importantly , use .
Keeping all these factors in mind , we would like to evangelize on of the best distro ’s for newbies , advocating the following 5 reasons :
The ability to have a glimpse :
With the support of LiveCD , a fanboy can actually have a good enough look into the distro if not a full experience .
It gives a chance to visualize and build a thought for the distro , based on one ’s preferences and use case .
Ease of installation and configuration :
You need not be a master of terminal windows and an ace of shell commands / scripts to run a mighty Ubuntu on your machine .
The latest release of the distro has a much faster and easier installation wizard .
Installing Ubuntu through Windows using Wubi , or performing a single or dual boot installation is far more easier than it was in the past .
You need not bother much about the partitioning act or the swap space to make a complete Ubuntu installation .
Out of the box support :
The Ubuntu developers have done exceptionally great in making it an “ out - of - the - box ” Linux distro .
The seamless support it offers for the third party devices like digital cameras , usb drives , wireless connectivity , the ability to use restricted device drivers ( if you wish to ) , etc. is a so very different and appreciable for people with varying desires and skills .
Ease of upgrade :
As times change , desires often grow symmetrically .
This leads to periodic software and security upgrades .
Owing to the use of apt - get package installer , the upgrade for the installed softwares is just a click away .
One does n’t need to do much apart from entering the root password of course .
Even the upgrade to a newer release of Ubuntu is a cake walk , provided you have an Internet connection .
Community support : Having a good community backup can do wonders in spreading a word about a technology , application or an OS for that matter .
There is absolutely no denial of the fact that Ubuntu users cherish a large community support .
Be it development or support , Ubuntu outlives several other distros in this classification .
Having said so much is so little to help evangelize Ubuntu Linux .
You need to give it a shot if you have n’t by now .
Saying so does n’t mean Ubuntu is the best Linux distro .
But , it is definitely a Linux distro which created a wave - pool in the Linux ecosystem .
and a must try for all noobs out there .
For several weeks , a variety of political observers , most notably ThinkProgress ’ Amanda Terkel and Matt Corley , have highlighted Karl Rove ’s connections to John McCain ’s campaign .
And for several weeks , Bush ’s former chief strategist — the man the president affectionately calls “ Turd Blossom ” — has been arguing that there really is n’t a relationship .
Just a couple of weeks ago , George Stephanopoulos identified Rove as an “ informal adviser ” to McCain before an ABC News interview .
Rove denied it , and when Stephanopoulos suggested that Rove offers the McCain camp advice and information , Rove would only concede to “ chit chat ” with the Republican presidential campaign .
Not surprisingly , there appears to be a little more to the relationship .
Peter Stone writes in National Journal :
“ Generally speaking , Rove ’s advice [ for McCain ] is action - oriented and useful , ” said another senior consultant to the McCain camp .
“ It ’s always well received . ”
This McCain adviser noted that Rove talks periodically to [ McCain ’s chief political strategist , Charlie Black ] and a few other top campaign aides on several key matters .
“ It can be policy ideas , messaging ideas , fundraising prospects , or people who need calls from someone in the campaign . ”
Rove is “ part of the information network that the campaign has , ” this adviser said , adding that Rove talks fairly regularly to such key people as Wayne Berman , a major fundraiser for McCain ; Nicolle Wallace , a communications adviser ; and Steve Schmidt , a senior aide .
This is n’t necessarily a surprise , but it ’s interesting for a few reasons .
One , of course , is that McCain keeps trying to position himself as different from Still - President Bush , but that ’s awfully difficult under the circumstances .
Not only is McCain offering Bush ’s foreign and domestic policies as his own , but he ’s taking advice from the guy who shaped Bush ’s campaigns .
Two , there is the small matter of journalistic ethics .
For reasons that defy logic , Rove has been hired to play the role of professional “ journalist ” for a variety of outlets , including Fox News , the Wall Street Journal , and Newsweek .
No one seriously expects credible , independent , bias - free reporting from Rove , but no serious news outlet should be comfortable paying someone to offer commentary and analysis on a presidential campaign while simultaneously advising one of the candidates in the presidential campaign .
And three , the National Journal article also noted that Rove , when he ’s not pretending to be a journalist and / or advising the McCain campaign , is also consulting with far - right campaign outfits .
[ A ] way from the spotlight , Rove has been … spending a considerable amount of time as an outside adviser to Freedom ’s Watch , the conservative political group that is expected to spend tens of millions of dollars to help elect House GOP candidates .
William Weidner , a Freedom ’s Watch board member , recently told National Journal that Rove has offered strategic advice to both the group and its major financial backer , Las Vegas casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson .
Weidner , president of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. , which Adelson chairs , called Rove “ an invaluable asset ” to the group . [ … ]
[ William ] Weidner [ a Freedom ’s Watch board member ] stressed that Rove has been “ very generous with his time and ideas .
He gives up his time for those things he believes in . ”
Two GOP strategists said they have heard that Rove has worked out a private consulting deal with Adelson ; this arrangement , one strategist reported , pays Rove in the mid-six figures for giving speeches and providing assistance to Freedom ’s Watch on labor union issues , a top priority of the group .
It ’s noteworthy because National Journal also recently reported that Rove is “ up to his eyeballs ” in trying to “ nurture new independent political groups ” to help McCain and other Republicans on Election Day .
It ’s illegal , of course , for independent groups to coordinate with campaigns .
It ’s interesting , then , that Freedom ’s Watch and the McCain campaign just happen to be getting advice from the same person .

I noticed that the Associated Press story about Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden ’s comments about taxes and the wealthy on Good Morning America today , left out an important part of the quote .
The part where Biden stressed that yes , the wealthy will pay more taxes , but their taxes will be less than they were under Ronald Reagan .
Biden was asked about Obama ’s tax increase on those making more than $ 250,000 , and said , “ It ’s time to be patriotic , time to jump in , time to be part of the deal , time to help get America out of the rut , and the way to do that is , and they are still going to be paying less taxes than they paid under Reagan . ”
See , the full quote makes a lot more sense , but the ever rightward leaning AP could not be bothered to use the full quote .
Biden said he is n’t nervous about the closeness of the race , “ Not at all .
Look when 82 % of the people think the country is going in the wrong direction , when the same outfit has been in charge for the last eight years , when you are in a position where you have Wall Street crumbling right before our eyes , and hope to God we can prop it up to keep it from spreading to Main Street like a plague .
The idea that they are going to reelect somebody that does n’t have a fundamental disagreement with George W. Bush on the economy , taxes , healthcare , etc , I am not nervous at all . ”

The McCain campaign jumped all over this saying that higher taxes and bigger government are n’t patriotic , but Biden never mentioned big government .
The Obama camp would be thrilled if the McCain campaign wants to spend their time defending tax cuts for the wealthy .
Doing so would be making Obama ’s point for him .
Of course , the McCain camp is going to try to spin this as Obama wanting to raise taxes on everyone , but the idea that the wealthy have gotten a free ride over the past eight years resonates with a lot of people .
Why can’t Republicans accept a tax right that is in line with those of their high priest Ronald Reagan ?
I think the past eight years have proven once again that trickledown economics does n’t work .
The plan of tax cuts for the rich , and credit for everyone else , has pushed our economy towards the edge of collapse .
What ’s wrong with asking those who have the most to pay their fair share ?
They have benefitted the most from the past eight years and now it is time to give a little back .
This is populist argument that hits home with many people .
It is point that the McCain campaign would be foolish to vigorously oppose .

The Democratic - led Congress appears intent on using its oversight powers to investigate the Bush administration until the day the latter packs up and walks out of the White House .
Oversight hearings and reports have been as common as lobbyists on Capitol Hill since the Democrats swept the 2006 elections .
In July alone , hearings covered a range of subjects including allegations of faulty wiring installed by US contractors in Iraq , possibly misleading testimony from Environment Protection Agency ( EPA ) Administrator Stephen Johnson , and charges that politics guided hiring of career workers in the Justice Department .
White House officials consider the scrutiny a burden and a waste of legislative time .
" When you have divided party government , you have more vigorous oversight , " says James Thurber , director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University .
With Election
Day only three months away there 's little time left for the lame - duck Congress to push for substantive changes in response to the lame - duck Bush administration 's alleged misdeeds .
Take the issue of executive privilege .
Democratic congressional leaders investigating the mass firing of US attorneys in 2006 have long demanded that former political aide Karl Rove and other Bush officials testify before Congress .
But they 've refused to appear , citing executive privilege – the legal doctrine that holds a president is entitled to keep conversations with staff private , in order to promote candor .
On July 30 , a federal judge rejected the White House 's claim that executive aides have immunity from congressional oversight .
But the legal wrangling on this issue is likely to stretch on well past election day .
It remains to be seen whether the next Congress will care to pursue this issue once Bush himself is out of office .
On executive privilege " Congress has not been that successful , " says Mr. Thurber .
What oversight can achieve
The purpose of congressional oversight is not necessarily legal change , however .
This counterpart of Congress 's legislative powers is also meant to reveal problems and ensure the exercise of constitutional responsibility on the part of the executive branch .
" To assess the oversight of one year can take several years , " says David Rohde , a political scientist at Duke University .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D ) of California , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , has long championed congressional oversight authority as an often overlooked , vital function .
Done right , it can shape national policy just by producing public information , said Mr. Waxman at a 2006 symposium on the subject .
In 1994 , Congress held extensive hearings into the practices of the tobacco industry .
These did not lead to any enacted bill – then , or in subsequent years .
But the hearings forced tobacco executives to talk on the record and under oath , and to release thousands of pages of internal tobacco industry documents .
State attorneys general used this information to bring the lawsuits against the industry which eventually led to restrictions on tobacco advertising and a monetary settlement worth over $ 200 billion .
" It would be wrong to ascribe these accomplishments to the congressional hearings ... but without question , those hearings [ in 1994 ] had a galvanizing effect , " said Waxman .
Now Waxman is one of the primary oversight irritants to the Bush administration .
He 's probed everything from reconstruction in Iraq to the firings of US attorneys to alleged politicization at the General Services Administration .
For officials , a waste of time
" One thing that is clear is that there is a heckuva lot more oversight than there was [ before 2006 ] , " says David Rohde .
" But a degree of it is for show . "
That 's the main complaint of the Bush administration – as it was for the Clinton administration .
The White House calculates that it has had to respond to more than 300 congressional investigations or inquiries .
As of last December , officials estimated they 'd produced more than 1 million pages of documents in response to these probes .
Officials grumble that voters are far more concerned about the price of gas than whether Karl Rove will be forced to respond to the latest congressional subpoena .
It 's true that polls show congressional approval ratings at record lows .
A Gallup survey in early July found that only 14 percent of respondents approved of the job Congress is doing – half of President Bush 's own record - low job approval rating of 28 percent .
Tension over oversight is as much institutional as partisan , says Thurber .
Every White House resists inquiries from Congress , particularly when it 's controlled by the opposition party .
The Clinton administration too complained it had produced more than 2 million pages of documents for congressional inspection from 1996 to 1998 .
White House staff spent over 55,000 hours responding to requests , said Clinton officials at the time .
On his visit to the Middle East , Barack Obama gave ritual affirmations of his support for Israeli policy , but what Israel needs from America is n’t more love , but tougher love .
Particularly at a time when Israel seems to be contemplating military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites , the United States would be a better friend if it said : “ That ’s crazy ”  while also insisting on a 100 percent freeze on settlements in the West Bank and greater Jerusalem .
Granted , not everybody sees things this way , and discussions of the Middle East usually involve each side offering up its strongest arguments to wrestle with the straw men of the other side .
So let me try something different .
After I wrote a column last month from Hebron in the West Bank , my blog , nytimes.com / ontheground , was flooded with counterarguments  and plenty of challenges to address them .
In the interest of a civil dialogue on the Middle East , here are excerpts from some of the readers ’ defenses of Israel ’s conduct in the West Bank and my responses :
Jews lived in Hebron for 1,800 years continuously ... until their community was murdered in 1929 by their Arab neighbors .
The Jews in Hebron today  those “ settlers ”  have reclaimed Jewish property .
So I do n’t see what makes them illegitimate or illegal .

This easy to understand film explains how 95 % of money is created from thin air by private U.S. and European banks .
And why the current financial crisis may lead to financial Armageddon .
The financial crisis may be much worse than anyone has told you .
It could change how we issue money and this is something the most powerful men in the world will do everything they can to stop .
Hence , he government bailout .
Reality is that we may face a bigger crisis than the 1929 depression .
This is a more important video than anything I 've ever shown on this site .
And do you want to understand the very strange situation this weekend with the Democrats supporting the White House bailout plan , and Republicans resisting ?
More to come tomorrow !
Verizon has released details of the agreement it and other ISPs signed last week to block access to Usenet groups that have been caught trafficking child pornography .
Instead of simply blocking the handful of offending groups , however , Verizon has decided to enforce a blanket ban on what could be tens of thousands of completely innocent groups .
It all started when New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo enlisted the help of Verizon and other ISPs with his assault on child pornography spread through Usenet groups .
A while ago , Cuomo 's investigators submitted anonymous reports to ISPs like Verizon , Sprint , and Time Warner Cable about child pornography images stored on their servers and trafficked through Usenet groups .
When the ISPs did nothing — failing to uphold their policy of taking swift action against peddlers of child porn — Cuomo 's investigators threatened to charge the ISPs with fraud and deceptive business practices .
The ISPs bargained with Cuomo's office and came to an agreement in which each would pay $ 1.125 million to the Attorney General 's office and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to fund further efforts .
The ISPs also agreed to clean up their servers and block access to Usenet groups that are spreading child pornography , and Verizon has now offered details on exactly how it plans to enforce this ban .
Originally , Cuomo's office claimed to have found child pornography on 88 of the 100,000 - plus Usenet groups .
Perhaps aspiring to win a G - rating from Utah , CNET reports that Verizon has opted to block not just the 88 offending groups , but a whole lot more .
Verizon will provide access only to the " big 8 , " a group of hierarchies that are actively managed and governed by a more substantial set of rules than the banned groups .
The banned hierarchies include alt .* , a hierarchy known to be a haven for trading many forms of copyrighted media ( fonts , wares , movies , TV shows , music , porn — you name it , it 's there ) and , of course , the child pornography Cuomo 's office is after .
alt .* and the other groups Verizon will censor are also home to plenty of harmless discussion groups , such as alt .
tv.simpsons , alt.fan , alt.religion , and more .
While Ars Technica commends the crusade against child pornography , ISPs agreeing to wipe a whole Usenet hierarchy off the digital map seems too much like using a sledgehammer to strike a nail .
One could argue that Usenet / newsgroups do n't see quite the same traffic they used to back in the 80s and 90s .
Even so , Verizon is now voluntarily agreeing to censor an entire network containing hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of legitimate and innocent discussions in the name of squashing a few problem areas .
As we 've suggested before , this form of overzealous approach could turn into a trend that enables governments to regulate content that is arbitrarily deemed harmful to the public good or even commercial interests .

IITs to relax SC / ST cut- offs
New Delhi , Mon , 25 Aug 2008 NI Wire
Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT ) , the premier Indian engineering institute has decided to increase the relaxation of scores in aggregate cut - off numbers from current 40 % to 50 % to fill up all the reserved seats scheduled for Schedule Caste ( SC ) and Schedule Tribe ( ST ) students from the next academic year .
This year , IITs could not fill up all the reserved seats of SC / ST students and 66 total seats are still vacant in all seven IITs .
This year , six new IITs - Gandhinagar , Patna , Bhubaneswar , Hyderabad and in Punjab and Rajasthan containing each with 120 seats including 27 per cent reserved quota are at the edge of opening .
The government had also announced last year to increase the quota for SC / ST students in all old IITs that would collectively enhance the reserved number of seats in the next session , which will be difficult for IITs to fill up all the seats of reserve quota in its present admission procedure .
In this regard , the directors of all seven IITs have convened a meeting on Sunday at IIT Kharaghpur , West Bengal , and decided to ease the cut - off numbers barrier for the reserved categories students .
The directors have also sent ‘ the cut - off relaxation ’ proposal to the Ministry of Human Resource Development for approval .
According to this proposal , the directors have suggested to allow a 50 % relaxation of scores for reserved category students including physically handicapped as against the current 40 % , for the next Joint Entrance Exam ( JEE ) that is scheduled in April 2009 .
In this admission - year when a general category student became eligible by getting overall 172 scores out of 489 , the aggregate cut - off for an SC / ST student was 104 after 40 % relaxation .
And in respect to the latest decision of granting 50 % relaxation , it would now be 86 in the next academic year , April 2009 .
“ Lowering academic standards is the only way to fill so many reserved category seats , ” said a former JEE chairman , commenting on this move .
Moreover , directors have also suggested to carry forward this year ’s 66 vacant seats into next admission year .
For those SC / ST students who get admission for the preparation of IIT - Joint Entrance Examination ( JEE ) will now get more relaxation in the entrance examination of preparatory classes .
The IIT - Directors have also asked the government to add Singapore as the entrance examination centre from the next year .
This year , IIT had conducted the entrance examination at 117 cities including Dubai .
Hey everyone , been on the road for two days now and I 'm about to pull out of Idaho Falls , ID and head north and then east into Montana .
The drive has been beautiful so far .
Eastern Oregon is incredible .
I had driven through there in the past , but it was night time and I did n't know what I was missing , but wow , one of the most colorful places I 've ever been .
My travel was delayed a bit , however , when I stopped to get my oil changed , and I thought the story was worth passing along .
Now , I ordinarily avoid Wal - Mart like the plague , but I needed a change and I was about to hit a piece of road with no services for over 100 miles , so I figured I better get it done while I had the chance .
Sadly , the ONLY place in town to change my oil was at the local Wal - Mart .
So as sick as it made my stomach , I pulled up and did it .
The girl ( yes , not a woman ) who took my information seemed friendly at first .
She politely inquired about the full car load of stuff and said " you must be going somewhere cool . "
" Chicago " I said with a smile .
I handed her the keys to the car and stepped out .
She told me it would be a 20 - minute wait , so I grabbed the iPod and the paper I had and went into the waiting room .
By the way , the one thing I was happy about was that at least this oil change was going to be cheap .
Under $ 25 .
About 25 minutes later the girl came into the waiting room and told me the car was ready .
I paid , took back my keys and jumped in , ready to hit the open road again .
But when I turned on my car the oil monitoring system said I was still at 10 % of my oil 's life .
That was weird .
I got out of the car and asked the girl if she was sure that the oil change had in fact been done .
She said " Yep , I know it was , cause I did it myself . "
" Can you explain why my car is telling me it has n't been ? "
" Well we do n't reset the meter in any of those Japanese cars " was her response .
I thought maybe she was right .
In all honesty , I was n't sure if this was something that had to be reset myself or if the car automatically did it upon an oil change .
The only way to find out was to check for myself .
So I headed back to the car , popped the hood , and stuck in the dipstick .
Sure enough , it was almost empty .
Unreal .
They had just charged me $ 24 and told me they had changed the oil , but it was never done !
They knew they were the only place for miles and miles , this could cause serious problems for people without the monitoring system to alert them it was n't done .
If it was n't for that I never would have thought to double check .
In the future I will .
Anyhow , at this point I was n't Wal - mart 's happiest customer ever .
So I went back in and told the girl what I found .
She called in the mechanic and IN FRONT OF ME said to him " why did n't you change the oil ? "
Clearly she either forgot , or just did n't care that she had already told me that SHE had done it .
His response was " You told me to just pull it into the lot , you did n't say anything about an oil change . "
I was on the mechanic 's side for a minute until he looked at me and said " When we get these foreign cars in here , sometimes it gets confusing . "
Now I was just livid .
First of all , my car being foreign was 100 % , fully and completely irrelevant to the fact that they had just charged me $ 24 to allow my car to sit in their garage for 24 minutes before pulling it into their parking lot .
A dollar a minute .
Wow .
On top of that , the disdain for my foreign car was becoming very apparent now .
Which was also irritating .
My bet is that neither of these people knew that while their own American cars were built by foreign workers for next - to - nothing wages , all of my Honda Civic ( with the exception of the engine ) was assembled in Ohio by well paid , and highly skilled Americans .
The parts were also produced in Indiana , Kentucky and Ohio , once again , by American workers .
Long story short , I thought about getting a manager and demanding my money back .
And in retrospect , I should have .
But I wanted to get back to the road and try to keep my blood pressure low .
So I waited a few more minutes while the mechanic replaced the oil in my ever - so - complex Civic and instead of getting my money back I 'll just blog about what a rotten , evil and horrible place Wal - Mart is .
I hate Wal - Mart .
Ok , so now it 's time for me to hit the road , so much for this being a quick note .
So when I was there just a few weeks ago , photographing for I think the fourth time , there was a proposal being floated that each canister be put into its own individual plastic bag , and then each bag would go into its own individual black box that 's made for containing human ashes .
And that would be it .
To me , the arc of the project – if it ends like that , which it seems it probably will – has a certain kind of conceptual logic to it that I appreciate .
I appreciate the form and the story of these canisters , that they 're literally breaking down further every day , even between my visits to the hospital .
My time of doing it , then , is finite as well .

( Thanks to Joseph Antonetti for his help with the images – and to editor Alan Rapp for instigating this book in the first place ) .
There 's a spectacular new book coming out at the end of this summer called Library of Dust , by photographer David Maisel , published by Chronicle Books .
I had the intensely exciting – and flattering – opportunity to write one of the book 's introductory essays ; that essay now re-appears below .
I first learned aboutwhen I interviewed Maisel back in 2006 for Archinect .
In 1913 , Maisel explained , an Oregon state psychiatric institution began to cremate the remains of its unclaimed patients .
Their ashes were then stored inside individual copper canisters and moved into a small room , where they were stacked onto pine shelves .
After doing some research into the story , Maisel got in touch with the hospital administrators – the same hospital , it turns out , where they once filmed One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest – and he was granted access to the room in which the canisters were stored .
Over time , however , the canisters have begun to react chemically with the human ashes held inside them ; this has thus created mold - like mineral outgrowths on the exterior surfaces of these otherwise gleaming cylinders .
There was a certain urgency to the project , then , as " the span of time that these canisters are going to be in this state is really finite , " Maisel explained in the Archinect interview , " and the hospital is concerned that they 're now basically corroding .
"
In order to deal with the fragility of the objects , and to respect their funerary origins , Maisel set up a temporary photography studio inside the hospital itself .
There , he began photographing the canisters one by one .
He soon realized that they looked almost earthlike , terrestrial : green and blue coastal forms and island landscapes outlined against a black background .
But it was all mineralogy : terrains of rare elements self - reacting in the dark .
Maisel 's photos have now been collected into a gorgeous , and physically gigantic , book .
It 's expensive , but well worth checking out .
The following is my own essay for the book ; it appears alongside texts by Terry Toedtemeier and Michael Roth .
In Haruki Murakami ’s novel Hard - boiled Wonderland and the End of the World , an unnamed man finds himself walking through an unnamed town .
Its depopulated spaces are framed most prominently by a Clocktower , a Gate , and an Old Bridge .
The nameless man is told almost immediately to visit the town ’s central Library – an unspectacular building that “ might be a grain warehouse ” for all its allure .
“ What is one meant to feel here ? ” the man asks himself , crossing a great , empty Plaza .
“ All is adrift in a vague sense of loss .
” Once inside the Library , the man meets a Librarian .
The two of them sit down together , and the man prepares to read dreams .
They are not fairy tales written in pen and ink , however , but the psychic residues of long - dead creatures , a gossamer field of electrical energy left behind in the creatures ’ bleached skulls .
Weathered almost beyond recognition , one such skull is “ dry and brittle , as if it had lain in the sun for years . ”
The skull has been transformed by time into something utterly unlike itself , marked by processes its former inhabitant could not possibly have anticipated .
Each skull is the most minimal of structures , seemingly incapable of bearing the emotions it stores hidden within .
One skull in particular “ is unnaturally light , ” we read , “ with almost no material presence .
Nor does it offer any image of the species that had breathed within .
It is stripped of flesh , warmth , memory . ”
It is at once organic and mineralogical – living and dead .
The skull is also silent , but this silence “ does not reside on the surface , [ it ] is held like smoke within .
It is unfathomable , eternal ” – intangible .
One might also add .
This “ smoke ” is the imprint of whatever creature once thought and dreamed inside the skull ; the skull is an urn , or canister , a portable tomb for the life it once gave shape to .
The Librarian assists our nameless narrator by wiping off a thin layer of dust , and the man ’s dream - reading soon begins .
Dust is a peculiar substance .
Less a material in its own right , with its own characteristics or color , dust is a .
It is the “ result of the divisibility of matter , ” Joseph Amato writes in his book Dust : A History of the Small and the Invisible .
Dust is a potpourri of ingredients , varied to the point of indefinability .
Dust includes “ dead insect parts , flakes of human skin , shreds of fabric , and other unpleasing materials , ” Amato writes .
Many humans are allergic to dust and spend vast amounts of time and money attempting to rid their homes and possessions of it , yet dust ’s everyday conquest of the world ’s surfaces never ends .
Undefended , a room can quickly be buried in it .
Dust lies , of course , at the very edge of human visibility : it is as small as the unaided eye can see .
And dust is not necessarily terrestrial .
“ Amorphous , ” Amato continues , “ dust is found within all things , solid , liquid , or vaporous .
With the atmosphere , it forms the envelope that mediates the earth ’s interaction with the universe . ”
But dust is found beyond that earthly sphere , in the abiotic vacuum of interstellar space , a freezing void of irradiated particles , where all dust is the ghostly residue of unspooled stars , astronomical structures reduced to mist .
Strangely representational , the chemistry of this stardust can be analyzed for even the vaguest traces of unknown components ; these results , in turn , are a gauge for whatever hells of radiation once glowed , when the universe burned with intensities beyond imagining .
Those astral pressures left chemical marks , marks which can be found on dust .
Such dust – vague , unspectacular , bleached and weathered by a billion years of drifting – can be read for its astronomical histories .
Dust , in this way , is a library .
A geological history of photography remains unwritten .
There are , of course , entire libraries full of books about chemistry and its relationship to the photographic process , but what the wordfails to make clear is that these photographic chemicals have a geological origin : they are formed by , in , and because of the earth ’s surface .
Resists , stops , acids , metals , fixes – silver - coated copper plates , say , scorched by controlled exposures of light – produce imagery .
This is then called .
Importantly , such deliberate metallurgical burns do not have to represent anything .
Photography in its purest , most geological sense is an abstract process , a chemical weathering that potentially never ends .
All metal surfaces transformed by the world , in other words , have a literally photographic quality to them .
Those transformations may not be controlled , contained , or domesticated , but the result is one and the same .
Photography , in this view , is a base condition of matter .
David Maisel ’s photographs of nearly 110 funereal copper canisters are a mineralogical delight .
Bearded with a frost of subsidiary elements , their surfaces are now layered , phosphorescent , transformed .
Unsettled archipelagos of mineral growths bloom like tumors from the sides and bottoms – but is that metal one sees , or some species of fungus ?
The very nature of these canisters becomes suspect .
One is almost reluctantly aware that these colors and stains could be organic – mold , lichen , some yeasty discharge – with all the horror such leaking putrescence would entail .
Indeed , the canisters have reacted with the human ashes held within. , of course ; each canister holds a corpse – reduced to dust , certainly , burnt to handfuls of ash , sharing that cindered condition with much of the star - bleached universe , but still cadaverous , still human .
What strange chemistries we see emerging here between man and metal .
Because thesepeople ; they had identities and family histories , long before they became nameless patients , encased in metal , catalytic .
In some ways , these canisters serve a double betrayal : a man or woman left alone , in a labyrinth of medication , prey to surveillance and other inhospitable indignities , only then to be wed with metal , robbed of form , fused to a lattice of unliving minerals – anonymous .
Do we see in Maisel ’s images then – as if staring into unlabeled graves , monolithic and metallized , stacked on shelves in a closet – the tragic howl of reduction to nothingness , people who once loved , and were loved , annihilated ?
After all , these ash - filled urns were photographed only because they remain unclaimed ; they ’ve been excluded from family plots and narratives .
A viewer of these images might even be seeing the fate of an unknown relative , eclipsed , denied – treated like so much dust , eventually vanishing into the shells that held them .
It is not a library at all – but a room full of souls no one wanted .
Yet perhaps there is something altogether more triumphant at work here , something glorious , even blessed .
There is a profoundlyaspect of these objects , a physical statement that we , too , will alter , meld with the dust and metal : an efflorescence .
This , then , is our family narrative , not one of loss but of There is a broader kinship being proclaimed , a more important reclamation occurring : the depths of matter will accept us back .
We will be rewelcomed out of living isolation .
We are part of these elements , made of the dust that forms structures in space .
Maisel ’s photographs therefore capture scenes of fundamental reassurance .
The mineralized future of everything now living is our end .
Even entombed by metal , foaming in the darkness with uncontrolled growths – there is splendor .
To disappear into this metallurgical abyss of reactions – photographic , molecular – is n’t a tragedy , or even cause for alarm .
There should be no mourning .
Indeed , Maisel ’s work reveals an abstract gallery of the worlds we can become .
Planetary , framed against the black void of Maisel ’s temporary studio , the remnant energies of the long dead have become color , miracles of alteration .
There are no graves , the photographs proclaim : only sites of transformation .
That is our final , inhuman release .
At the end of winter 2005 , David Maisel traveled to a small city in Oregon .
There were bridges , plazas , and gates .
He was there to locate an old psychiatric hospital – a building now housing violent criminals – because the hospital held something that interested him .
Upon arrival , he met with the head of security , who already knew why Maisel had come .
The two of them walked down a nearby corridor , where Maisel was shown what he ’d been looking for .
It was an isolated room behind a locked door – smaller , less official , than expected .
Within it was the Library of Dust .
David Maisel 's Library of Dust is available both through Chronicle Books and through Amazon.com – though you can also buy a signed copy through photo - eye Don't miss my earlier interview with David over at Archinect – and , at some point soon , take a long trip through David 's website
Grand Theft Auto pulled from sale after Bangkok teen murders taxi driver ' to see if it was as easy as in the game '
A Thai student murdered a taxi driver while trying to recreate a scene from the Grand Theft Auto computer game .
Polwat Chino , 18 , who was said to be an obsessive player of the controversial game , stabbed the 54 - year - old driver ten times .
' He said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game , ' chief police investigator Veeravit Pipattanasak said .
Grand Theft Auto , which is made by Edinburgh - based firm Rockstar North , has been criticised for depicting carjackings , drive - by shootings and prostitution .
It has also been accused of encouraging juvenile crime in Britain .
Now a
Thai video game distributor has halted sales of ' Grand Theft Auto ' as backlash against the controversially violent game began .
The 18 - year - old high school student , who is now in custody , faces death by lethal injection if found guilty of robbing and killing the 54 - year - old taxi driver over the weekend .
Copycat killing : Police watch as the suspect , second right , re-enacts the crime in Bangkok yesterday
Police said the youth showed no sign of mental problems during questioning and had confessed to committing the crime because of the game .
The youth , described by his parents as polite and diligent , was arrested late on Saturday after he was found trying to steer a cab backwards out of a Bangkok street with the severely wounded driver in the back seat , newspapers reported .
The suspect told police he did not mean to kill the driver , whom he had chosen as a possible victim because of his age , but that he stabbed him to death when he fought back , newspapers reported .
" We are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games , " Sakchai Chotikachinda , sales and marketing director of New Era Interactive Media , said .
Grand Theft Auto IV : The controversial game has been pulled in Thailand after the attack
" We are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service , " Sakchai said .
" Grand Theft Auto " , now available in its fourth edition , has been criticised for depicting violence including beatings , carjackings , drive - by shootings , drunk driving and prostitution .
A senior official at Thailand 's Culture Ministry said the murder was a wake - up call for authorities to tackle the issue of violent video games , and urged parents to pay closer attention to what their children played .
" This time - bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse , " Ladda Thangsupachai , director of the ministry 's Cultural Surveillance Centre , said .
" Today it is a cab driver , but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner . "
The ministry has been pushing for tougher regulation of video games such as Grand Theft Auto , including the imposition of a rating system on sales and restriction on hours that youngsters can play the games in public arcades .
A multi-million dollar lawsuit was filed in the U.S. state of Alabama against the makers and marketers of Grand Theft Auto in 2005 , claiming that months of playing the game led a teenager to kill two police officers and a 911 dispatcher .
The blockbuster Grand Theft Auto games are published by Nasdaq - listed Take - Two Interactive Software .
Sarika Singh after her high Court victory A 14 - year - old Sikh girl has won her High Court discrimination claim against her school after it excluded her for breaking its " no jewellery " rule .
Sarika Singh , from Cwmbach , south Wales , was excluded by Aberdare Girls ' School in November 2007 for refusing to take off her religious bangle .
A High Court judge in London ruled on the controversial matter after reserving judgement last month .
The school said it would consider the judgement " in detail " .
Sarika says the Kara bangle - a slim steel bracelet - is important to her as it is a symbol of her Sikh faith .
As a result of the judgement , Sarika is allowed to return to the school in September , wearing the Kara .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Her lawyers had told Mr Justice Stephen Silber that the Kara was as important to her as it was to England spin bowler Monty Panesar , who has been pictured wearing the bangle .
The judge declared the school was guilty of indirect discrimination under race relations and equality laws .
After the judgement , Sarika said : " I am overwhelmed by the outcome and it's marvellous to know that the long journey I 've been on has finally come to an end .
" I 'm so happy to know that no - one else will go through what me and my family have gone through and no other pupil will ever get banned from wearing their Kara again .
" I just want to say that I am a proud Welsh and Punjabi Sikh girl . "
Sarika 's mother , Sinita , 38 , added : " We are over the moon .
It is just such a relief . "
Her father Satnam Singh read a statement which said : " We are very pleased with the outcome of the case but we are extremely disappointed that we had to come to the High court in the order to give our daughter the right to wear the Kara in school . "
Mr Justice Silber said he had been told the Kara bangle was regarded as vital to the Sikh religion .
It denoted the " God 's infinity " he said and was effectively a " handcuff to God . "
The judge rejected claims by the school that the bangle , which he said was less obtrusive than some watches , could be seen as a " symbol of affluence . "
He said many watches which were allowed at the school were more expensive than than the simple plain steel Kara .
Sarika Singh's is the latest in a number of religious dress cases
School and religious symbol cases
He commented : " In this case there is very clear evidence it was not a piece of jewellery but to Sarika was , and remains , one of the defining focal symbols of being a Sikh . "
He said his decision had already been made known to the school authorities , who had agreed to Sarika returning at the start of the next term in September when she will begin preparing for her GCSEs .
The judge also refused the school permission to appeal , although it can still seek permission from the Court of Appeal .
The governors and head teacher at the school said in a statement that the decision to defend their action was taken after careful consideration by all concerned , and in good faith .
" It was not taken lightly .
We regret that this action became at all necessary , " they said .
" We note the comments of the judge regarding the advice offered to the school .
" Should Sarika wish to return to school in September , in accordance with the judgment , she will be offered help and support to reintegrate her into the normal day - to - day life of the school . "
HAVE YOUR SAY Symbols of faith should be allowed in schools as long as they do n't cause a safety hazard Chris , London , UK Liberty , which backed Sarika , argued the school had breached race relations , equality and human rights laws
They said it also contravened a 25 - year - old law lords ' decision which allows
Sikh children to wear items representing their faith , including turbans , to school .
Anna Fairclough , the Singh family 's solicitor , said : " It 's a shame that each generation has to fight the same battles .
This battle was already fought 25 years ago and Sarika should n't have had to go through that again .
" Our great British traditions of religious tolerance and race equality have been rightly upheld today . "
A spokesperson for Rhondda Cynon Taf council said it had been informed of the High Court 's judgement in the case and it would " be working with the school 's governing body to ensure Sarika Singh 's continued education . "

LEACH GETS THE SHORT SHRIFT ….
Last night , DDay asked a very reasonable question : “ If a 30 - year Democrat spoke at the RNC , excoriated his former party , and endorsed the Presidential candidate of the opposite party , would the media cover it ? ”
DDay was referring , of course , to former Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa , a respected , long - time Republican lawmaker who not only endorsed Barack Obama , but appeared at the Democratic convention last night to urge others to follow his lead .
This development barely generated any attention at all .
When Zell Miller appeared at the Republican convention , it was a key development .
When Joe Lieberman , who is n’t even a Democrat anymore , announced his own appearance at the GOP convention , this was a major story .
Some former Democratic delegate in Wisconsin moved inexplicably from supporting Clinton to backing McCain , and her switch is treated as exceedingly important .
Leach , however , is getting the short shrift .
He ’s a credible , serious guy , who was part of the House Republican caucus for decades , and this year , Leach concluded that Obama is the leader the nation needs .
Maybe he ’s too mild - mannered to generate more attention ( he did not , for example , mention “ spitballs ” during his speech last night ) .
Maybe if he ’d challenged Chris Matthews to a duel , news outlets would have taken his remarks more seriously .
But that ’s a genuine shame , because Leach had a message worth listening to : “ As a Republican , I stand before you with deep respect for the history and traditions of my political party .
But it is clear to all Americans that something is out of kilter in our great republic … .
Seldom has the case for an inspiring new political ethic been more compelling .
And seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment … .
I stand before you proud of my party ’s contributions to American history but , as a citizen , proud as well of the good judgment of good people in this good party , in nominating a transcending candidate , an individual whom I am convinced will recapture the American dream and be a truly great president : the senator from Abraham Lincoln ’s state — Barack Obama … .
This is not a time for politics as usual … .
Obama will recapture the American dream and be a truly great president . ”

We think we know what will make us happy , but we do n't .
Many of us believe that money will make us happy , but it wo n't .
Except for the very poor , money can not buy happiness .
Instead of dreaming of vast wealth , we should dream of close friends and healthy bodies and meaningful work .
The Psychology of Happiness
Several years ago , James Montier , a “ global equity strategist ” , took a break from investing in order to publish a brief overview of existing research into the psychology of happiness [ PDF ] .
Montier learned that happiness comprises three components :
About 50 % of individual happiness comes from a genetic set point .
That is , we 're each predisposed to a certain level of happiness .
Some of us are just naturally more inclined to be cheery than others .
That is , we 're each predisposed to a certain level of happiness .
Some of us are just naturally more inclined to be cheery than others .
About 10 % of our happiness is due to our circumstances .
Our age , race , gender , personal history , and , yes , wealth , only make up about one - tenth of our happiness .
Our age , race , gender , personal history , and , yes , wealth , only make up about one - tenth of our happiness .
The remaining 40 % of an individual 's happiness seems to be derived from intentional activity , from “ discrete actions or practices that people can choose to do ” .
If we have no control over our genetic “ happy point , ” and if we have little control over our circumstances , then it makes sense to focus on those things that we can do to make ourselves happy .
According to Montier 's paper , these activities include sex , exercise , sleep , and close relationships .
What does not bring happiness ?
Money , and the pursuit of happiness for its own sake .
“ A vast array of individuals seriously over - rate the importance of money in making themselves , and others , happy , ” Montier writes .
“ Study after study from psychology shows that money does n't equal happiness . ”
The Happiness Paradox
Writing in The Washington Post last June , Shankar Vedantam described recent research into this subject .
If the United States is generally wealthier than it was thirty or forty years ago , then why are n't people happier ?
Economist Richard Easterlin of the University of Southern California believes that part of the problem is the hedonic treadmill : once we reach a certain level of wealth , we want more .
We 're never satisfied .
From Vedantam 's article :
Easterlin attributes the phenomenon of happiness levels not keeping pace with economic gains to the fact that people 's desires and expectations change along with their material fortunes .
Where an American in 1970 may have once dreamed about owning a house , he or she might now dream of owning two .
Where people once dreamed of buying a new car , they now dream of buying a luxury model .
“ People are wedded to the idea that more money will bring them more happiness , ” Easterlin said .
“ When they think of the effects of more money , they are failing to factor in the fact that when they get more money they are going to want even more money .
When they get more money , they are going to want a bigger house .
They never have enough money , but what they do is sacrifice their family life and health to get more money . ”
The irony is that health and the quality of personal relationships are among the most potent predictors of whether people report they are happy — and they are often the two things people sacrifice in their pursuit of greater wealth .
Why are n't rich people happier ?
Perhaps it 's because many of them are workaholics , because they 're more focused on money than on the things that would bring them joy .
A brief companion piece to The Washington Post story notes that researchers have found that “ being wealthy is often a powerful predictor that people spend less time doing pleasurable things , and more time doing compulsory things and feeling stressed . ”
In general , rich people are n't much happier than those of us in the middle class .
Yes , money can buy happiness if it elevates you from poverty , but beyond that the benefits are minimal .
So why do so many people believe that money will make things better ?
Stumbling on Happiness
In 2006 , Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert published Stumbling on Happiness , a book about our inability to predict what will really make us happy .
Here is is a 22 - minute video of a presentation Gilbert made at TED 2004 , in which he compresses his ideas into bite - sized chunks .
Gilbert says that because humans can plan for the future , we naturally want to structure our lives in such a way that we are happy , both now and later .
But how do we know what will make us happy ?
We do n't .
In fact , we 're surprisingly bad at predicting what will bring us joy .
Gilbert asks :
Which future would you prefer ?
One in which you win the lottery ?
Or one in which you become paraplegic ?
Which would make you happier ? [… ]
A year after losing their legs , and a year after winning the lotto , lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives .
The problem is impact bias , the tendency to overestimate the “ hedonic impact ” of future events .
Put another way , the things that we think will make us happy usually do n't make us as happy as we think they will .
Winning the lottery is n't a panacea .
Having an affair with your hot new co-worker wo n't be as thrilling as you imagine .
And losing a leg is n't the end of the world .
It turns out that humans are able to synthesize happiness .
Many people look outside themselves for fulfillment ; they expect to find it in things , or in relationships , or in large bank accounts .
But true happiness comes from within .
True happiness comes when we learn to be content with what we have .
13 Steps to a Better Life
What does all this mean to you ?
If money wo n't bring you happiness , what will ?
How can you stop making yourself miserable and start learning to love life ?
According to my research , these are the thirteen actions most likely to encourage happiness :
Do n't compare yourself to others .
Financially , physically , and socially , comparing yourself to others is a trap .
You will always have friends who have more money than you do , who can run faster than you can , who are more successful in their careers .
Focus on your own life , on your own goals .
Foster close relationships .
People with five or more close friends are more apt to describe themselves as happy than those with fewer .
Have sex .
Sex , especially with someone you love , is consistently ranked as a top source of happiness .
A long - term loving partnership goes hand - in - hand with this .
Get regular exercise .
There 's a strong tie between physical health and happiness .
Anyone who has experienced a prolonged injury or illness knows just how emotionally devastating it can be .
Eat right , exercise , and take care of our body .
( And read Get Fit Slowly ! )
Obtain adequate sleep .
Good sleep is an essential component of good health .
When you 're not well - rested , your body and your mind do not operate at peak capacity .
Your mood suffers .
( Read more in my brief guide to better sleep . )
Set and pursue goals .
I believe that the road to wealth is paved with goals .
More than that , the road to happiness is paved with goals .
Continued self - improvement makes life more fulfilling .
Find meaningful work .
There are some who argue a job is just a job .
I believe that fulfilling work is more than that — it 's a vocation .
It can take decades to find the work you were meant to do .
But when you find it , it can bring added meaning to your life .
Join a group .
Those who are members of a group , like a church congregation , experience greater happiness .
But the group does n't have to be religious .
Join a book group .
Meet others for a Saturday morning bike ride .
Sit in at the knitting circle down at the yarn shop .
Do n't dwell on the past .
I know a guy who beats himself up over mistakes he 's made before .
Rather than concentrate on the present ( or , better yet , on the future ) , he lets the past eat away at his happiness .
Focus on the now .
Embrace routine .
Research shows that although we believe we want variety and choice , we 're actually happier with limited options .
It 's not that we want no choice at all , just that we do n't want to be overwhelmed .
Routines help limit choices .
They 're comfortable and familiar and , used judiciously , they can make us happy .
Practice moderation .
Too much of a good thing is a bad thing .
It 's okay to indulge yourself on occasion — just do n't let it get out of control .
Addictions and compulsions can ruin lives .
Be grateful .
It 's no accident that so many self - help books encourage readers to practice gratitude .
When we regularly take time to be thankful for the things we have , we appreciate them more .
We 're less likely to take them for granted , and less likely to become jealous of others .
Help others .
Over and over again , studies have shown that altruism is one of the best ways to boost your happiness .
Sure , volunteering at the local homeless shelter helps , but so too does just being nice in daily life .
Remember :
True wealth is not about money .
True wealth is about relationships , about good health , and about continued self - improvement .

Is it More Important to be Rich or to be Happy ?
Markos and his diarist have a great find here .
McCain admitting that he was responsible for deregulating Wall Street over the past decade .
Nice .
So now that we know that McCain ’s campaign manager was a lobbyist paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight off regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and that McCain himself is now taking credit for deregulating Wall Street , I think John McCain has worked his Keating Five magic once again .
-- Posted Friday , 1 August 2008 | Digg This Article | Source : GoldSeek.com
Martin Hutchinson , writing at PrudentBear.com , reminds us that " It was established pretty convincingly by Milton Friedman and proved beyond all doubt in the inflationary episodes of the 1970s and 1980s that if you want to bring inflation under control you must set interest rates at a margin above the current inflation level . "
How much above ?
He says that savings returns should be roughly " a normal level of 3 % plus inflation . "
So if " official " inflation is at 5 % , like it is now , then this means that savings rates should be 8 % ?
Sweet !
But real inflation , as measured by John Williams at shadowstats.com , is roaring far above a measly 5 % , and while " annual CPI - U Surges to 5.0 % " , as per the headlines , inflation measured the older , pre-Clinton way is 12.6 % in June !
Which is up from 11.8 % in May !
Yow yow yow !
We 're freaking doomed !
So if inflation is actually running at 12.6 % , the interest paid on savings should be 15.6 % ?
Even more sweet !
This prompted me to do a little research , and I found that in the whole universe there are only three species of organism where the majority of the population do not comprehend the horrific implications of inflation that is more than 3 % , which is recognized everywhere in the cosmos as the cutoff between , " Mommy , I am scared ! " and " Mommy , something big and ugly ate daddy , and it is looking at us and licking its lips ! "
But since I do n't want to get into a big argument about the relative stupidity of Earth creatures versus , for instance , the Glarth species on Remulac V , which are actually a kind of slug , but which has a gold standard for their money and thus they keep their money supplies strictly controlled .
Instead , I want to look at how , with an " official rate of inflation " of 5 % , the bank money market rate is 0.72 % , a one - year certificate of deposit pays 2.25 % , while a five year certificate of deposit pays 3.39 % !
Hell , the 30 - year T - bond barely yields 4.6 % !
Hahaha !
8 % on bank savings ?
In our dreams !
Mr. Hutchinson continues ominously , " The overall lesson is as usual bearish .
Almost all the world has abandoned proper anti-inflationary discipline and is destined to suffer a period of high inflation and recession in the coming years . "
Naturally my mood turns dark at that assessment , which may be what prompted The Economist magazine to remark , " countries , like people , behave dangerously when their mood turns dark . "
They do n't actually explain what they mean by that , but the magazine correctly said , " The credit crunch is in part the consequence of a flawed regulatory system .
Lax monetary policy allowed Americans to build up debts and fuelled a housing bubble that had to burst eventually . "
This was eerily presaged by last week 's stirring Mogambo Minute Of Outrage ( MMOO ) editorial , which started off similarly , " The credit crunch is , in part , the consequence of " , but which continues , " corrupt Congressional scumbags getting corrupt Federal Reserve scumbags to act irresponsibly stupid to implement bizarre , impossible , laughable neo-Keynesian econometric theories by creating a continuous flood of money and credit so that an unfolding bust would be reversed and they could all make a lot of money , and their friends would make a lot of money , when the economy again booms under such an onslaught of new money , but which will cause horrendous inflation in consumer prices and people will get grumpy as hell , but about which we wo n't talk at all and we 'll pretend that suffering and misery inflicted by higher prices does n't exist in reality because it does n't exist in their stupid , stupid , stupid little econometric models . "
So , I conclude , we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve , which , I am delighted to say , is also the opinion of the esteemed Gene Epstein .
In his Economic Beat column in Barron 's this week , he says , " The abolition of the central bank is just a major first step �
But it is a necessary first step " to the prevention of boom - and - bust cycles !
Hooray !
And well said !
None of this has penetrated the thick head of Joseph Stiglitz , however , who is not only a laughable Leftist loser of a staffer at Columbia University , whose PhD is obviously an acronym signifying Pin Head Doofus , but also a guy who won a Nobel Prize in economics .
You would think that a guy as ostensibly smart as that would , well , be smart , but this moron has never , found anything wrong with anything the Fed has done , ever , and in fact spent his career slobbering over Alan Greenspan in fawning servility and losing money at the World Bank .
And now that the profound stupidity of serial bubbles has finally burst , here comes the ridiculous Stiglitz , writing an essay in The Financial Times titled " Fannie 's and Freddie 's free lunch " .
He says that the " core of the problem " , putting his powerful brilliance to work , is that " millions of Americans were made loans beyond their ability to pay . "
He does not mention that the ridiculous loans were made by the ridiculous banks seductively enticing borrowers of all stripes , including speculators eager to recoup some of the money they lost in 2000 , and all done with the blessing of the Fed , with the blessing of the government regulators , with the blessing of Congress and with the blessing of PhD poseurs like him , and every step of the way .
He says , as is totally consistent with his ridiculous Leftist / Marxist / Commie ways , " We need to help them stay in their homes , including by converting the home mortgage deduction into a cashable tax credit and creating a homeowner 's Chapter 11 , an expedited way to restructure their liabilities . "
Hahaha !
Giving people actual cash with which to buy houses they cannot afford !
Hahaha !
And then giving them a fast and easy way to stiff their creditors , too !
Hahaha !
Perfect Leftist giveaway idiocy !
But , to be fair , this is standard Stiglitz thinking , as he is such a weird Leftist loony tunes kind of guy , but Columbia University has this guy on its faculty ?
Hahaha !
And now Columbia will soon have Fredric Mishkin , too , a thoroughly repugnant Fed governor who actually endorses an asinine policy of pursuing an " inflation target " ( which is the most despicable and outrageous damned thing anybody could say , and for which he should be shunned as the intellectual leper and laughable fool that he is ) , of about 2 % a year !
Purposely creating inflation !
Wow !
This is truly insane !
The question is , " Why is Columbia staffing itself with people like this ?
And what is the real value of a degree from Columbia , given their faculty ? "
In fact , what will be the value of any college degrees when there are no jobs ?
Maybe , because we got rich because we bought gold with which to capitalize on such monumental economic stupidity , we can hire some of them to help count all the gold we have !
How ironic that would be !
Hahahaha !

Click here for Gallup 's special roundup of July 's important election polls .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Registered voters show a slight preference for Barack Obama ( 46 % ) over John McCain ( 43 % ) if the presidential election were held today , according to the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking results .
The three percentage point advantage for Obama matches the average since early June , when Obama clinched the number of delegates needed to head to the Democratic convention as the presumptive presidential nominee .
Since then , Obama has never trailed McCain among registered voters , though McCain has tied Obama five times during this span , including Gallup Poll Daily tracking reports for last Friday and Saturday .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
The Democratic convention is now just three weeks away , while the Republican convention will begin four weeks from today .
The conventions are one of the most anticipated events of the election calendar , in part because each candidate typically receives a " bounce " in support in the polls following their official nomination as the party 's presidential candidate .
-- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from August 1 - 3 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,659 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Things are n't that bad for Senator John McCain .
After being dissed by Madonna last night in England , he 's got his own singer who 's endorsing him .
Latin American singer Daddy Yankee ( aka Ramon Ayala ) , most famous for his song " Gasolina , " joined McCain in his home state of Arizona this morning .
The duo appeared at Phoenix 's Central High School .
Truthfully , the audience at the school ( from this vantage point , most appeared to be teenage girls ) looked somewhat bored with the senator 's message .
But they sprang to life - complete with squeals - when McCain introduced the reggaeton star .
( See video below ) .
McCain acknowledged , in his remarks , that at least for this audience he had far less gusto than Mr. Yankee .
" I know why you are sitting here , and that is not to listen to me so much , but I brought a special friend along with me today , a great American success story , " the senator said .
" One of his most famous songs , I know you 're very familiar with , ' Gasolina . '
Well , here he is , Daddy Yankee . "
The singer offered a quick endorsement for McCain before hugging and kissing the squealing young women .
" I am here endorsing Senator McCain because I believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation , " Ayala said .
" And like I said before , he has been a fighter for the Hispanic community , and I know that for me personally , I chose him as the best candidate because he has been a fighter for the immigration issue . "
The sound bite of the day came when the star was asked what his song " Gasolina " was about .
Without hesitation he said , " Energy independence . "
But this endorsement does beg the question - why are celebrities OK for McCain but not for Obama ?
McCain spokesman Taylor Griffin said there 's a big difference .
" Daddy Yankee is a great American success story , " Griffin said .
" There 's a difference between being a worldwide celebrity and being supported by one .
Barack Obama has the celebrity thing down pat , but is he ready to lead ?
No . "
A federal judge has rejected a demand from the American Civil Liberties Union that she censor a document posted in an Ohio courtroom titled " Philosophies of Law in Conflict " because the Ten Commandments are included .
" It is truly unfortunate that the ACLU apparently has nothing better to do than to file baseless charges against a dedicated public servant like Judge [ James ] DeWeese , " said Francis J. Manion , a senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice .
" A first - year law student – looking at the facts and law of this case – could have told the ACLU that there never was a legal basis for this ridiculous contempt charge , " Manion said .
" We 're pleased that the [ federal ] court acted expeditiously in tossing out this latest gambit in the ACLU 's ongoing harassment of Judge DeWeese . "
The conflict began when the ACLU sued DeWeese for posting a copy of the Decalogue in his courtroom , resulting in a judge ordering that the document could not be posted by itself .
Philosophies posted in an Ohio courtroom
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Subsequently , DeWeese posted the " Philosophies of Law in Conflict , " a document that includes the Ten Commandments along with a list of " humanist precepts " and a commentary by the judge about the two conflicting philosophies .
The Ten Commandments state the biblical foundation for morality , including :
You shall have no other gods before me .
You shall not kill .
You shall not murder .
You shall not commit adultery .
The humanist precepts include :
The universe is self - existent and was not created .
Man is the product of a cosmic accident , and there is nothing higher than man , Ethics depend on the person and the situation .
There is no absolute truth .
The meaning of law evolves .
In response , the ACLU requested that DeWeese be held in contempt for posting the Ten Commandments .
However , the judge who originally ordered the first Ten Commandments display removed said the current display was perfectly legal .
" The court can find no principled basis upon which to find that , or even fully consider whether , the new display is constitutionally impermissible , " wrote U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen O'Malley in her opinion .
She held DeWeese was not in contempt of her prior order and further said the ACLU 's attempt to censor the philosophies of law was " misplaced . "
The ACLU had accused DeWeese of putting up the comparative display in violation of O'Malley 's 2002 injunction against the Ten Commandments under the caption " Rule of Law . "
The ACLU claimed DeWeese was in " public defiance " of the court order and was " undermining the administration of justice . "
RELATED : Court case determines church must shut down
O'Malley found no validity to the ACLU argument .
" It was clear from the start of this latest episode in the ACLU 's harassment of Judge DeWeese that the ACLU was choosing to ignore current law regarding public displays that include the Decalogue in an educational or historical setting , " Manion said .
" The U.S. Supreme Court has made it perfectly clear – in cases brought by the ACLU itself – that government officials are permitted to discuss , acknowledge and display the Ten Commandments in a context that underscores the role played by Decalogue in ' history , civilization or ethics . '
Any reasonable person can see that this is precisely what Judge DeWeese 's current display does . "
Along with the displays of the differing faith systems , DeWeese has added his own commentary .
" All law is legislated morality , " he writes .
" The only question is whose morality .
Because all morality is based on faith , there is no such thing as religious neutrality in law or morality . "
He continued , " Ultimately there are only two views .
Either God is the final authority , and we acknowledge his unchanging standards of behavior .
Or man is the final authority and standards of behavior change at the whim of individuals or societies . "
" Our Founders saw the necessity of moral absolutes .
President John Adams said , ' We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion .
Our Constitution was made for a moral and religious people .
It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other , ' " he continued .
" The Declaration of Independence acknowledges God as Creator , Lawgiver , ' Supreme Judge of the World , " and the one who providentially superintends the affairs of man , " he said .
" I join the Founders in personally acknowledging the importance of Almighty God 's fixed moral standards for restoring the moral fabric of this nation . "
An image of DeWeese 's commentary has been posted on the ACLJ website .
DeWeese told the Mansfield News Journal the ACLU simply was trying to silence his speech .
" It 's really about a debate of philosophies and how that affects our criminal caseloads , " he said .
" I put both sides up .
People can make their own decisions . "

Erlang 's actor concurrency model is a good fit for a wide range of concurrent applications .
One domain that would seem ideal is real - time control of concurrent physical processes .
But as it stands right now Erlang is best suited for soft real - time applications - there 's really nothing in the language or runtime geared towards hard real - time constraints .
Towards Hard Real - Time Erlang talks about one piece of the puzzle : a hard real - time scheduler .
In the last decades faster and more powerful computers made possible to seriously take into account highâ € “ level and functional programming languages also for nonâ € “ academic projects .
Haskell , Erlang , Oâ€™CAML have been effectively exploited in many application fields , demonstrating how highâ € “ level languages can help in writing efficient , readable and almost bugâ € “ free code , rapidly stealing the prominent position gained in many fields by OO languages such as Java and C ++.
One of the fields where lowâ € “ level imperative languages are still preferred to functional programming is that of hard realâ€ “ time applications , since usually programmers ( and managers ) think that highâ € “ level languages are really not able to cope with the complex and critical requirements of realâ€ “ time .
In this paper we propose an implementation of a hard realâ€ “ time scheduler entirely written in Erlang , and perfectly integrated with the Erlang BEAM emulator .
Performance analysis show that the proposed solution is effective , precise and efficient , while remaining really simple to use as expected by Erlang programmers .
The paper closes with mentions of two more pieces of the puzzle .
Realâ € “ time message passing will be introduced in a future version ... ...
A solution to the unpredictable behaviour of garbage collection should be implemented before a really hard realâ € “ time scheduling can be done in Erlang .
Besides the scheduler , message passing , and garbage collector , what else do you think is needed before Erlang or something like it is a viable alternative in this domain ?
Or is the actor model really not such a great fit ?
* Edit : Based on a comment from renox added closing quotes about message passing and garbage collector and added message passing to the editorial question .
Palin credits electoral success to witchhunter John Byrne
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This
In perhaps one of the strangest twists to date in the story of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a video now shows the governor crediting her electoral success to a preacher who claims to successfully hunt witches .
The speech , shown below , was filmed in June .
Palin describes the visit of Pastor Thomas Muthee to the Wasilla Assembly of God in 2005 .
" As I was mayor and Pastor Muthee was here and he was praying over me , and you know how he speaks and he 's so bold .
And he was praying ' Lord make a way , Lord make a way , ' " Palin remarked .
 And I 'm thinking , this guys really bold , he does n't even know what I 'm going to do , he doesnt know what my plans are , " she continued .
" And hes praying not 'oh Lord if it be your will may she become governor , ' no , he just prayed for it .
He said , ' Lord make a way and let her do this next step .
And that s exactly what happened . ' "
 So , again , very very powerful , coming from this church ,  she added .
In 1988 , Pastor Muthee and his wife traveled to Kenya after being " called by God . "
Setting up shop in the basement of a grocery store , they claim to have brought 200 people " to God " and away from the town 's " spiritual oppression . "
The source of the oppression ?
Witchcraft , Muthee says .
When researching the community , they found that a woman named " Mama Jane " ran a divination clinic that drew a large following in the town .
 We prayed , we fasted , the Lord showed us a spirit of witchcraft resting over the place ,  Pastor Muthee said .
Muthee made his experiences into a video called Transformations , which documents his " spiritual warfare " against demons and occult practices .
Spiritual warfare is more common in Latin America and Africa , where the concept of day - to - day demons has a stronger hold .
The video 's trailer is available here .
The film -- and Muthee 's practices -- received treatment in a 1999 Christian Science Monitor article .
" According to accounts of the witchhunt circulated on evangelical websites such as Prayer Links Ministries , after Pastor Muthee declared Mama Jane a witch , the townspeople became suspicious and began to turn on her , demanding that she be stoned , " the London Times noted Tuesday .
" Public outrage eventually led the police to raid her home , where they fired gunshots , killing a pet python which they believed to be a demon . "
Palin's speech accompanied the Wasilla Assembly of God's Masters ' Commission , which the church 's pastor said will allow Alaska to become a refuge for American evangelicals during the coming " end of days " -- or Armageddon .

In the process of that research , I discovered that governments have murdered millions of their own citizens , and that in some cases , the death toll may have actually exceeded that of World War II .
To get some idea of the numbers involved , I surveyed the extent of genocide and mass killing by governments since 1900 .
The results were shocking : according to these first figures , independent of war and other kinds of conflict , governments probably have murdered 119,400,000 people , Marxist governments about 95,200,000 of them .
By comparison , the battle - killed in all foreign and domestic wars in this century total 35,700,000 .

These monstrous statistics sharply reoriented my research .
For over thirty years , as a political scientist and peace researcher , my research had focused on the causes and conditions of war , conflict , and peace .
I had believed that war was the greatest killer and that nuclear war would be a global holocaust .
Now I have found that aside from war the total killed by government was almost four times that of war .
It was as though a nuclear war had already occurred .
Surprisingly few have recognized this .
While much has been published on individual genocides , such as of the Jews or Armenians , and some general analyses have been done , as by Kuper 4 , virtually no research has been published on the total amount of genocide and mass murder among nations .
5
The one exception is Elliot 's Twentieth Century Book of the Dead , which arrives at a figure of about 100,000,000 killed in this century , including war .
The work , however , omits many small genocides and is limited in its treatment of killing by Marxist governments .
For these reasons , with a grant from the United States Peace Institute , I undertook in 1988 a project to refine and elaborate my findings , to determine empirically the conditions and causes of government genocide and mass killing , and to assess the role of democratic versus autocratic institutions .
The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of such governmental murder , to test further whether the more democratic a nation , the more secure its citizens from such killing , and to publish the results in a major monograph .
Among the first studies undertaken was that of Soviet genocide and mass murder .
This was a very difficult task , for while widely different estimates were available on such Soviet institutions as the labor camp , such polices as collectivization or the Red Terror , or such events as the deportation of Poles in 1939 - 1941 , few experts had tried to systematically accumulate and total them over Soviet history .
To my knowledge , there are only two major works in English attempting to tally the toll in some systematic manner .
6 Robert Conquest gives a carefully accumulated total for the Stalin years ( at least 20,000,000 killed ) 7 ; and in his samizdat translated into English , Dyadkin , a Soviet geophysicist , did a demographic analysis of excess Soviet deaths , 1926 to 1954 , and concluded that Soviet repression killed 23,100,000 to 32,000,000 Soviet citizens over this 29 - year period .
8
Scattered here and there in one book or another are estimates of the number murdered .
For example , Panin claims that 57,000,000 to 69,500,000 were killed , and says that estimates of authors in the West vary from 45,000,000 to 80,000,000 9 ; Solzhenitsyn mentions a 66,000,000 figure calculated by an ŽmigrŽ professor of statistics 10 ; and Stewart - Smith gives an estimate of 31,000,000 killed in repression 11 .
Like Dyadkin's , some estimates have been based on demographic analyses , as Medvedev 's 22,000,000 to 23,000,000 total ( 1918 - 1953 ) , or Dyadkin 's aforementioned figures .
12
For lack of a thorough statistical accumulation and analysis of Soviet genocides and mass murder from 1917 to recent years , I had to undertake at least a first effort in this direction .
Initially , the result was to be a chapter in a monograph on 20th century genocide and mass killing .
But it soon became clear that the Soviets themselves are responsible for so many genocides , and that so many different kinds of mass killings had occurred , that to unravel and present the detailed events and institutions involved and the related statistics would require a monograph itself .
Thus this book .
To best present the historical details , statistical analyses , and various figures and sources , and yet to make the book readable and useful to various publics , I have divided the book in the following way .
First , the statistical data , sources , and analyses have been separated from the historical when , what , and why of the estimates .
This provides an explanation and understanding of the deaths being reported , and historical narrative for those uninterested in the statistical details , while also making available the statistical material for specialists .
Second , rather than put all the statistics in one , huge appendix at the end of the book , an appendix has been prepared for each historical period , thus keeping the historical narrative and related statistical material together .
Third , each historical period has been treated as a chapter , with the associated statistical appendix at the end .
Finally , an historical overview and analysis and presentation of the final results was made the first chapter , which constitutes an executive summary .
Its appendices sum up the statistical data , compares these to estimates in the literature , and simulates the result of altering some important assumptions .
I should note that there is a clear division in style between the appendices and the historical narrative .
In the appendices I have tried to be as objective , neutral , and balanced in a conservative direction as possible , recognizing that we all have biases that work against our best intentions in surprising ways .
The methodological appendix to this book spells out the principles and procedures guiding the preparation of the estimates and totals in the appendices .
However , in the narrative I have been less than dry and disinterested .
I am clearly horrified by the nature and extent of mass killings being recorded ; as a pacifist , I have been so overcome with emotion that at times I have had to put this work aside many times .
Therefore , I did not restrain myself from peppering the narrative with adjectives like " monstrous " , " horrible " , and " evil " , and liberally used irony and sarcasm as rhetorical weapons against this inhumanity .
The style of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag seemed also appropriate here .
But he wrote with a mission , and from the perspective of his own experience , and I am no Solzhenitsyn .
Once I was able to unload myself onto a preliminary draft , I then thoroughly revised it , eliminating the more " egregious " adjectives and phrases .
Nonetheless , a style remains which is more assertive , less " balanced " , than some specialists and historians might desire .
If this be so , then I can only say that it is to others I must leave writing with dispassion about the murder of tens of millions of human beings .
One final comment on the term murder .
If anything may appear to display an anti-Soviet , less than professional bias , it may be the consistent accusation that the Soviets have murdered all these millions ; and to use the term in the title of this book .
I am doing this , however , because I believe the technical meaning of murder fits what the Soviets did .
To murder someone means to unlawfully and purposely kill him , or to be responsible for his death through reckless and depraved indifference to his life ( as in Soviet deportations or the labor camps ) .
As established by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal after World War II , " crimes against humanity " consists of
We are now entering the closing weeks of what promises to be yet another close and contentious presidential election contest .
As each side seeks to maximise its advantages and minimise its weaknesses , the Republican party has chosen the lowest of low roads , engaging in two sleazy political marketing campaigns over the past week .
First , DVDs of an anti-Muslim documentary film are being distributed to 28 million voters in swing states like Florida , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , Colorado and Wisconsin .
Second , Republican telemarketers have begun push polling aimed at scaring Jewish voters in swing states from voting for Barack Obama .
The 2005 film , called Obsession : Radical Islam 's War Against the West , warns that Islamic jihadists aim to take over the US government and destroy our way of life and urges voters to consider which candidate will best protect the nation .
Among other subtleties , the film attempts to equate Islam with Nazism , juxtaposing scenes of children being encouraged to become suicide bombers with shots of Nazi rallies .
The film was distributed as an advertising supplement in major newspapers , including the New York Times .
In addition , the Republican Jewish Coalition has mailed the DVDs to rabbis and Jewish organisational mailing lists , while a Christian Zionist group distributed it to delegates at the Republican and Democratic conventions .
Sheldon Adelson , a major funder of arch - conservative causes and Likud party leader Bibi Netanyahu , personally gives the DVD to participants in the Taglit Birthright Israel tours he funds for Jewish young people .
The film 's production and promotional campaign were bankrolled by the Clarion Fund , an obscure non-profit that has not filed the required IRS form that would allow the public to see who its officers and major funders are .
The group was founded , however , by Raphael Shore , an Israeli - Canadian citizen and supporter of John McCain .
Shore 's website , Radical Islam , featured an editorial endorsing McCain for president .
That 's a big no - no : 501c3s are n't legally allowed to endorse candidates .
The mass distribution of Obsession is an obvious Republican scare - tactic , right out of the Rovian playbook .
Party operatives believe that scaring Americans into believing there 's a jihadist under every bed will play to Republican strengths and Democratic weaknesses on national security .
They swiftboated John Kerry in 2004 .
Now they 're jihadising Barack Obama .
To this end , Jewish voters in swing states have also been the targets of push polling from Republican - affiliated marketing outfits .
Joelna Marcus of Key West , Florida received a telemarketing call asking if she is Jewish .
After replying " yes " , she was asked whether she was religious .
Then the push poller then asked her if her opinion of Barack Obama would change if she knew that Obama had given lots and lots of money to the PLO .
In Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , Debbie Minden received a call asking whether her support for Obama would be swayed if she knew " his church was anti-Israel " or that Hamas endorsed him and that its leaders had met with him .
The caller also asked if she would change her mind if she learned he was Muslim .
The New Republic 's Jonathan Cohn also received a call in Michigan and took notes of the smears : According to the caller , some of Obama 's best friends in Chicago were " pro-Palestinian leaders " ; Jimmy Carter 's anti-Israel national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski is an Obama foreign policy adviser ; Obama sat on a board which funded a " pro-Palestinian charity " ; Obama said that if elected he would call for a summit of Muslim nations and exclude Israel .
Minden reported that her call came from a firm called Research Strategies , which is none other than Wilson Research Strategies , whose founder is Chris Wilson .
Wilson is a top Republican consultant and friend of , you guessed it , Karl Rove .
Cohn said his call came from a company called Central Marketing , which has done push polls on behalf of the campaigns of Republicans John Thune and Michael Bloomberg .
And Ben Smith reported last week that the Republican Jewish Coalition has admitted hiring the Republican telemarketing outfits to do the push polling .
Amazing how a little bit of sleuthing leads this filth right to the door of the Republican party .
The way these things work , McCain has plausible deniability because the calls are n't made by his campaign .
But they and the DVD are clearly designed to raise fears about national security and suppress Jewish turnout for Obama .
If Republicans can reduce the number of Obama voters in key swing states by a few percentage points , they figure they strengthen McCain 's chances of winning .
This is American presidential politics at its most disgusting .

Jesus brought you to this site , so keep reading to find out what HE wants to tell you .
GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD !
THIS WEBSITE HAS BEEN THERE .
Jesus commanded ALL Believers to CAST OUT demons ( Mark 16:17 ) ( Mathew 10:8 ) .
Jesus did not say to go to someone else to have your demons CAST OUT .
Nor did Jesus say to CAST OUT everyone else 's demons and leave yours IN .
Luke 6:46 - 49
46 And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
47 Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
48 He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
49 But he that heareth , AND DOETH NOT , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
Mathew 7:5 - Jesus speaking -
Thou hypocrite , first CAST OUT the beam [ demon ] OUT of thine own eye ; [ SELF DELIVERANCE ] and then shalt thou see clearly to CAST OUT the mote [ demon ] OUT of thy brother 's eye .
Luke 11:24 - When the unclean spirit ( demon ) is gone OUT of a man , he ( demon ) walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto MY HOUSE ( YOU ) whence I came OUT .
Luke 11:25 - And when he cometh , he findeth it ( YOU ) swept and garnished ( you are not doing self Deliverance ) .
Luke 11:26 - Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits ( demons ) more wicked than himself ; and they enter IN , and dwell there : ( IN YOU ) and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
Luke 24:39 - ... FOR A SPIRIT ( DEMON ) HATH NOT FLESH AND BONES ...
This is why demons want to be IN you , and why every Believer needs to do self Deliverance .
Luke 4:18 - Jesus speaking - The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because He hath anointed me to PREACH the gospel to the poor ;
He hath sent me to HEAL the brokenhearted , to PREACH DELIVERANCE to the CAPTIVES , [ Believers ] and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised .
The Ministry of Jesus was threefold .
He Taught , did Healings and Miracles , and cast OUT demons .
There are over two billion Christians in the world .
You can find ANY one Believer to help you with Deliverance ( besides doing self - Deliverance ) .
This website will PREACH / TEACH you what you need to do DAILY to defeat the works of the devil .

DELIVERANCE MANUAL
This very extensive and free website IS the Manual .
We have no printed or audio material to send you .
HOW YOU CAN , AND DO , HAVE DEMONS - EVERYONE HAS DEMONS , NO EXCEPTIONS ( so this includes all Christians ) .
Jesus said in Mark 7:21 - For from WITHIN , out of the heart of men - [ any human ] , - proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders - [ caused by demons within ] ,
7:22 - Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness : - [ caused by demons within ]
7:23 - All these evil things come from WITHIN , and defile the man - [ any human ] .
The main point in these three Scriptures is not the " evil " mentioned , but that the demons are WITHIN any human .
For those of you who demand to see a Scripture before you can believe something , there are NO Scriptures that say YOU do NOT have demons .
That should settle it !
Jesus spoke to demons that were WITHIN humans .
Demons spoke to Jesus from WITHIN the human , using the human 's vocal cords .
During Deliverance , sometimes you speak to demons WITHIN the human .
Sometimes the demon speaks from WITHIN the human , using the human 's vocal cords .
In Mark 8:32 , satan spoke to Jesus from WITHIN Apostle Peter , using Peter 's vocal cords .
In Mark 8:33 , Jesus spoke to satan that was WITHIN Peter .
When you are Born Again as a Christian / Believer / True Worshipper , JESUS / Holy Spirit comes to abide in your SPIRIT .
Demons CANNOT get INTO your Spirit .
You are a triune being - BODY , SOUL and SPIRIT .
Your SOUL is your MIND , WILL and EMOTIONS .
BODY - Christians can have a sickness / disease just like the unSaved .
That 's caused by demons ( if not caused by other factors ) .
SOUL - Do you have a bad temper ?
That 's a demon .
Is there mental illness in your family background ?
That is a demon .
Do you have trouble serving God ?
That 's a demon .
Do you have problems with bad thoughts ?
That is a demon(s ) in your mind , will or emotions .
SPIRIT - Demons cannot get into your SPIRIT , but , the demons surround your SPIRIT like a glass jar surrounds its contents , and you have trouble serving the Lord JESUS .
The contents of the jar cannot get out until you remove the lid ( demons ) .
Deliverance can get rid of the demons .
Looking for a Miracle ?
In Mark 9:39 , Jesus calls Deliverance a Miracle .
Get your Miracle today .
Mark 1:39 - And He ( Jesus ) preached in their synagogues ( churches ) throughout ALL Galilee and CAST OUT DEMONS .
( IN the church ?
Yes !
Is your church casting out demons ? )
If not , pack your bags and stay home .
IF My people , who are called by My name , shall humble themselves , pray , seek , crave , and require of necessity My face AND turn from their wicked ways , THEN will I hear from Heaven , forgive their sin , and heal their land .
II Chronicles 7:14
Jesus said ,
Those that Believe SHALL cast out demons ( Mark 16:17 ) .
If you obey this COMMAND , you become a Demonbuster .
Are you a Believer ?

Know this - EVERYONE has demons , ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANS .
There is no Scripture that says this .
It is just a matter of FACT .
There is no Scripture that says you do NOT have demons .
Jesus said the demons are living INSIDE of you , not OUTSIDE .
Jesus also said the demons call your body their house .
Do you live OUTSIDE of your house ?
Neither do your demons !
In Matthew 15:26 and Mark 7:27 , Jesus says that Deliverance is THE CHILDREN'S BREAD .
The term " Christian " did not exist while Jesus walked the earth .
" THE CHILDREN " were Believers .
Jesus cast demons out of Believers .
Are you a " child of God " ?
The Deliverance message is not MY doctrine .
It is not MY opinion .
It is not MY belief .
JESUS said to do it , and we ( those that believe ) do .
You DO NOT have to go through Deliverance to get to Heaven .
But why would you want to keep all your problems ( demons ) if there was a way to get rid of them ?
Deliverance IS that way .
When you get to Heaven , Jesus may ask you why you did not do Deliverance like He commanded all Believers to do .
JESUS IS THE DELIVERER
JESUS DID COME IN THE FLESH , AND WILL COME AGAIN .
In Mark 16:17 , Jesus said , And these signs SHALL follow them that BELIEVE ;
In my name SHALL they cast OUT demons ; they SHALL speak with new tongues ;

Colossians 1:9-10
For this reason we also , from the day we heard of it , have not ceased to pray and make [ special ] request for you , [ asking ] that you may be filled with the full ( deep and clear ) knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [ in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ] and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things ---
That you may walk ( live and conduct yourselves ) in a manner worthy of the Lord , fully pleasing to Him and desiring to please
Him in all things , bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of God [ with fuller , deeper , and clearer insight , acquaintance , and recognition ] .
( Amplified Bible )
One Recommended Spiritual Warfare Prayer to pray at least daily
Print this out and pray it often .
This is an anti-evil Prayer .
In the name of JESUS , I cover myself and the one reading this with the Blood of JESUS .
I ask for giant warrior angels to protect us .
As your war club and weapons of war , I break down , undam , and blow up all walls of protection around all witches , warlocks , wizards , satanists , sorcerers , and the like , and I break the power of all curses , hexes , vexes , spells , charms , fetishes , psychic prayers , psychic thoughts , all witchcraft , sorcery , magic , voodoo , all mind control , jinxes , potions , bewitchments , death , destruction , sickness , pain , torment , psychic power , psychic warfare , prayer chains , incense and candle burning , incantations , chanting , blessings , hoodoo , crystals , root works , and everything else being sent my way , or my family member 's way , or any Deliverance Ministries way , and I return it , and the demons to the sender , SEVENFOLD , and I bind it to them by the Blood of Jesus , and I cut and burn their ungodly silver cord and lay lines , in JESUS ' Name .
Short version - IN THE NAME OF JESUS , I BREAK AND RETURN ALL EVIL BEING SENT MY WAY , AND I RETURN IT AND THE DEMONS TO THE SENDER ONE HUNDRED FOLD .
Acts 5:38
Now in the present case let me say to you , stand off ( withdraw ) from these men and let them alone .
For if this doctrine or purpose or undertaking or movement is of human origin , it will fail ( be overthrown and come to nothing ) ;
Acts 5:39
But if it is of God , you will not be able to stop or overthrow or destroy them ; you might even be found fighting against God !
YOU CAN'T STOP Deliverance BECAUSE IT IS OF GOD !
YOU CANNOT PRAY A DEMON AWAY .
THEY MUST BE CAST OUT IN THE NAME OF JESUS .
" Prayer and Fasting " is in addition to Deliverance .
CAUTION -
If you are EXPOSING the devil in any way , you better be doing DAILY Spiritual Warfare , Deliverance , breaking and RETURNING all evil being sent your way .
If you can hear the Oh the Blood of Jesus midi file , and it gets under your skin , do n't turn your speakers off .
The demons absolutely hate this song or any song that is about the Blood of Jesus .
The more this bothers you , the more demon infested you are .
You actually could get some Deliverance by having this tune play in the background , and some demons may actually leave your home or apartment too .
Copy the midi file and play it in your home over and over or just let it play on your computer .
I have it set to play continuously .
Every time you click your SAVE button , think of SALVATION , which also means DELIVERANCE .
He that hath ears to hear , let him hear - LUKE 14:35

JESUS IS THE DELIVERER
2 Tim 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the Lord reward him according to his works : 1 Tim 1:20
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
Anyone attempting or doing evil to Believers will be awarded by the Lord , according to their works , and we turn them over to satan .
Jesus said we would do greater works than He. John 14:12 - Verily , verily , I say unto you ,
He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
These greater works are not found in the Bible .
HOW Deliverance and Spiritual Warfare are done are some of the greater works .

PRAYING FOR A REVIVAL ?
REPENT AND REVIVAL WILL COME !
Years ago , I was at a church service and the only thing I remember the preacher saying was , “ You can have as much of God as you want . ”
I believe that is true and all of the Body of Christ Jesus should be seeking all of God we can have .
In reading in Exodus and Numbers there were times the Israelites rebelled against Moses and the Lord and He sent pestilence and punishment for disobedience to the Israelites .
Thousands were killed and Moses stood before the Lord and asked Him to not destroy all of Israel .
Seeking the Lord and repentance was the answer for stopping the pestilence .
We as the Body of Christ Jesus need to look at our lives to see if we have rebelled against the Lord and repent .
( Lev 26:14 , 26:21 , 26:25 ; Exodus 9:15 . )
Mathew 4:17 “ Jesus began to preach saying REPENT for the Kingdom of God is at Hand . ”
Lev. 19:2 ; 20:7 ; 20:26 ; 11:44
“ Ye shall be holy ; for I am Holy . ”
2 Chronicles 7:14
“ If my people , which are called by my name , shall HUMBLE themselves , and PRAY , and SEEK My face , and TURN from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will FORGIVE their sin , and will heal their land . ”
WORD FROM THE LORD
“ My people who are called by my name have turned from me as rebellious children from their parents .
They have hardened their hearts toward me and have chased after other gods .
Turn , Turn , Turn , repent , repent , repent .
Judgment is at the door and has begun .
My Word says to have no other gods .
Turn from them , tear down the high places set up in your hearts and be holy … .
For I AM Holy .
I am your righteousness .
I am your escape from the things that are coming .
Today is the day of salvation .
I am your dwelling place .
All who come to me will never be turned away .
Repent , seek me , turn from the evil in the world .
The Truth of My Word will be the only thing left standing . ”
Rev. 21:8 says , the Fearful , unbelieving , abominable , murders , whoremongers , sorcerers , idolaters , liars will have a place in the Lake of Fire .
Mathew 6:21
Says where your treasure is there will your heart be also .
Mark 7:21 says out of the Heart of man comes evil thoughts , sexual immorality , theft , murder , adultery , greed , wickedness , deceit .
Mark 16:17
“ Those that believe will cast out demons . ”
We as true believers can cast out the evil in our hearts ( Soul ) .
When the people of God repent and turn - Revival will begin .
Matthew 3:11 “ I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance ; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear ;
He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghose , and with fire . ”

DESTROYING THE WORKS OF WITCHCRAFT
THROUGH FASTING AND PRAYER by Ruth Brown
Snip from a blog post by Rolling Stone contributor Matt Taibbi on the media phenomenon surrounding Republical vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin :
Sarah Palin is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the modern United States .
As a representative of our political system , she 's a new low in reptilian villainy , the ultimate cynical masterwork of puppeteers like Karl Rove .
But more than that , she is a horrifying symbol of how little we ask for in return for the total surrender of our political power .
Not only is Sarah Palin a fraud , she 's the tawdriest , most half - assed fraud imaginable , 20 floors below the lowest common denominator , a character too dumb even for daytime TV - and this country is going to eat her up , cheering her every step of the way .
All because most Americans no longer have the energy to do anything but lie back and allow ourselves to be jacked off by the calculating thieves who run this grasping consumer paradise we call a nation .
(…)
The great insight of the Palin VP choice is that huge chunks of American voters no longer even demand that their candidates actually have policy positions ; they simply consume them as media entertainment , rooting for or against them according to the reflexive prejudices of their demographic , as they would for reality - show contestants or sitcom characters .
Kucinich says bailout does n't have the votes RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 28 , 2008
Print This Email This
As the Wall Street bailout talks continue , a critical Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) is not confident that House will pass the legislation , as he told The Hill .
" If the votes were there , this would be on the floor , " he said .
" The votes are n't there . "
" Is this the United States Congress or the board of directors of Goldman Sachs ? " Kucinich asked today .
" Why are n't we helping homeowners directly with their debt burden ?
Why are n't we helping American families faced with bankruptcy .
Why are n't we reducing debt for Main Street instead of Wall Street ?
Is n't it time for fundamental change in our debt - based monetary system , so we can free ourselves from the manipulation of the Federal Reserve and the banks ? "
Kucinich attended a meeting of the " Skeptics Caucus , " organized by Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) and consisting of House Democrats skeptical of the bailout effort .
The meeting 's speakers included economic professor James Galbraith of the University of Texas and former FDIC chairman William Isaac .
Sherman called the legislation a Bush administration " power grab " and a handout to Wall Street .
" This is greatest shift of power to the imperial presidency and the greatest shift of wealth to a still wealthy Wall Street that anyone could imagine , " Sherman said .
" None of this has been subject to a critical analysis , " charged Rep. Kucinich .
" We have n't had access to the books to the people who are claiming they are going broke . "
" They rushed this Congress into the Iraq resolution and look what happened , " he added , comparing the rushed tone behind the bailout effort with the push to invade Iraq , " Catastrophe for this nation as well as for the people of Iraq . "
" The $ 700 billion bailout for Wall Street is driven by fear , not fact , " Kucinich said on the House floor Sunday .
" This is too much money in too a short a time going to too few people while too many questions remain unanswered .
Why are n't we having hearings on the plan we have just received ?
Why are n't we questioning the underlying premise of the need for a bailout with taxpayers ' money ?
Why have we not considered any alternatives other than to give $ 700 billion to Wall Street ?
Why are n't we asking Wall Street to clean up its own mess ?
Why are n't we passing new laws to stop the speculation , which triggered this ?
Why are n't we putting up new regulatory structures to protect investors ?
How do we even value the $ 700 billion in toxic assets ? "
Video of the Congressman 's speech is available to view below :
Brad Huston sends us these knuckle tattoos :
Got this done in honor of Carl Sagan .
Inspired from his quote from “ Cosmos ” :
“ The nitrogen in our DNA , the calcium in our teeth , the iron in our blood , the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars .
We are made of starstuff . ”
Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body , the atoms that construct the molecules , are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy , enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life .
So that we are all connected to each other biologically , to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically .
That ’s kinda cool !
That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that .
It ’s not that we are better than the universe , we are part of the universe .
We are in the universe and the universe is in us . ”
Be humble for you are made of earth , be noble for you are made from stars

Subscribe Object Oriented PHP Memory Concerns By Ryan Campbell · September 17th , 2008
It ’s hard to imagine pushing the limits of object oriented PHP so far that your web servers choke , but the truth is those limits are reached faster than you think .
We ’ve run some tests over at Wufoo and it turns out that any sort of mass object creation is pretty much not going to work at scale .
The problem is this limit on object creation forces developers to balance code consistency , which is desirable — especially for the old - schoolers , with performance .
While replacing objects with arrays when possible makes things a little better , the most performance friendly approach involves appending strings .
For your convenience , we ’ve run some tests that measure page execution times and memory usage to create the following guideline to help you plan out what areas of your code may have to break away from an object oriented nature .
The Benchmarks Basically , we set up a simple PHP page to iterate over a loop and create 1 ) a giant concatenated string , 2 ) an array of arrays containing the word ‘ test ’ , and 3 ) an array of objects with one variable set to ‘ test ’ .
Load Time Memory Used Control 12.6ms 1.42 mb 11,000 strings 15.7ms 1.45 mb 11,000 arrays 26.6ms 3.99 mb 11,000 objects 148.8ms 7.70 mb 25,000 arrays 44.1ms 7.25 mb 1,500,000 strings 253.2.6ms 7.14mb
As the table shows , creating objects takes a good amount of memory and time when compared to a string or array .
And since 7.7 mb is nearing the default memory limit for PHP , the page is about to time out .
Sure , the memory limit can be increased , but the point is that there is still a maximum .
For most pages , 11,000 objects is overkill .
But in some cases , like exporting a hefty database to CSV format or returning data from a public API , we may want to return 50,000 + records .
Workarounds
The good news is that the memory limitation does not put us in a place where the advantages of reusable code is completely removed .
We just have to take a few precautions when writing code that has intensive looping or object creation .
unset ( ) - Avoid getting at objects through the accessor , and work directly with the recordset loop .
After each iteration , unset the object that was just created .
After a quick test , 45,000 objects could be created and unset using 1.43 mb of memory at peak .
Static Method Calls -
A static method can be called without the need to instantiate an object .
For example , if our desired output is an XML string , but we need some of the objects helper functions , we can still call functions off of the objects statically with Object : : function ( ) .
Doing so only increased memory usage from 1.45 mb to 1.46 mb in the string example .
Paging - The downside to unset ( ) and static methods is that we have to bypass our accessors to get at the objects and work directly with the loop .
A third option is to be strict with paging , and never allow for more than X number of objects to be returned .
This will keep the code 100 % consistent , but may be a bit more intensive on the database and increase page execution time .
Why Does this Matter ?
Many development techniques , such as domain driven design , keep a set of value objects along with an accessor to each of those objects .
The accessors act as an API that make retrieval of the objects easy and consistent .
For example , let ’s say we have a User object , and a UserAccessor — we would call UserAccessor -> loadAllUsers ( ) , which would return to us an array of User objects .
Then , we can loop through the array , and display a list of all users and have access to the member variables and functions .
This is great because all developers work with the same objects , and SQL queries are constrained to accessors .
Even if this is n’t your preferred development style , chances are your object oriented approach strives to achieve similar levels of consistency .
That said , we can see from the benchmarks above that there may be situations where a portion of code we ’ve created cannot return an array of objects because of memory limitations .
Overall , object memory usage is far from a deal breaker , but it is something every developer worried about scaling should be aware of .
For more information , here are a couple of links that may provide some more insight .
What would you do with $ 700,000,000,000 ?
Well , you could stave off the recession for a few months , but it seems congress did n’t buy into that .
But let ’s put this into perspective .
Do you have any idea what you could do with seven hundred billion dollars ?
Here ’s an idea : solve green energy .
I know , you say , you ca n’t solve a difficult problem just by throwing money at it .
But my point is , you can solve a difficult problem by throwing money and a million scientists at it .
Seriously .
Back of the envelope :
1 – Hire one million scientists and engineers full time for a few years , and ask them to solve green energy .
Tell them to form groups and share ideas however they like .
Plan on spending about $ 390 billion here .
2 – To keep them from slacking off , tell them you ’ll pick the top 1000 most promising projects after a few years and give them an additional one hundred million dollars funding each for a second phase .
3 – To keep the people in phase 2 from slacking off , tell them you ’ll pick the top 100 most promising projects after another few years for an additional one billion dollars funding each for a third phase .
4 – To keep the people in phase 3 from slacking off , tell them the top 10 out of those projects will be selected after ten years or so for a further ten billion dollars funding each for a final phase .
This should be enough for the actual build - out of the technology .
The LHC cost less than that .
You ’d even have enough money left over to give the most successful project at the end a ten billion dollar bonus .
The money you ’d make back with the technology would be many times the original investment , and the trade it would generate would likely rescue the economy big time .
Speaking of the economy , the companies you ’d steal the scientists from are probably considering layoffs anyway , so it wo n’t have much short - term negative impact .
Also , you do n’t need to borrow the full amount at the beginning , since the projects are funded in phases .
This is a doable idea if you ’re actually planning to invest $ 700,000,000,000 into something useful , as opposed to just handing it over to your buddies .
Come on , people , this is just the first thing off the top of my head .
Ca n’t we get anyone to think more than a few months ahead around here ?
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The rise of gadgets like the iPhone , Blackberry and Xbox threatens to unravel the decades of innovation that helped to build the Internet , a leading academic has warned in a new book .
Steven Levy , a journalist from Newsweek magazine , holds the Apple iPhone outside the Apple store on New York 's 5th Avenue June 29 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
Professor Jonathan Zittrain says the latest must - have devices are sealed , “ sterile ” boxes that stifle creativity and turn consumers into passive users of technology .
Unlike home computers , new Internet - enabled gadgets do n’t lend themselves to the sort of tinkering and collaboration that leads to technological advances , he says .
The mix of gadgets , over - regulation and Internet security fears could destroy the old system where mainstream technology could be “ influenced , even revolutionized , out of left field ” .
“ I do n’t want to see a two - tier world where only the experts can survive ... and the non-experts are stuck between something they do n’t understand and something that limits them , ” Zittrain told Reuters in an interview .
Zittrain , professor of Internet governance and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute , Oxford University , says the Internet ’s simple , open architecture is key to its enormous success and also its flaws .
Amateur enthusiasts have come up with scores of new ideas by tinkering with the Internet on home computers .
However , hackers have caused huge disruption by exploiting its loose structure .
Zittrain contrasts one of the first mass - produced home computers , the Apple II from the 1970s , with Apple ’s latest gadget , the iPhone .
He says the iPhone is typical of what he calls “ tethered appliances ” .
“ They are appliances in that they are easy to use , while not easy to tinker with , ” he writes .
“ They are tethered because it is easy to for their vendors to change them from afar , long after the devices have left warehouses and showrooms . ”
They are a world away from the “ generative Internet ” , a term Zittrain uses to describe the open , creative , innovative approach that helped build the Internet .
The rise of viruses and fraud has also led to tighter controls on PCs , particularly those in schools , universities , offices and public places , Zittrain says .
People are often blocked from experimenting with shared computers and their input is severely limited .
There is still time to save the Internet , he believes , although the answer lies in social rather than technological changes .
Society should resist more regulation and place its trust in the Internet ’s users .
The success of Wikipedia , the online encyclopaedia written and edited by its readers , shows how self - governance can work .
Internet users should see themselves as “ netizens ” , active participants in the online world rather than passive consumers .
“ The community itself exercises a form of self - restraint and policing , ” he said .
“ You see it in Britain when you try to jump a queue , you see it on Wikipedia when a page is vandalised .
“ The challenge to the technologists is to build technologies to let people of good faith help without having to devote their lives to it . ”

Islam and Honor Killings ( Revised )
Posted in notes by Imam Zaid Shakir on 2007 - 12-13
For that reason , we ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul for other than murder or spreading corruption in the land , it is as if he has killed the whole of humanity …
Qur’an 5:35
One of the gravest charges levied against Islam , in terms of its alleged antipathy towards women , is the claim that it encourages a phenomenon known as honor killings .
This un-Islamic practice consists of the murder of female family members who are seen as dishonoring their families through real or perceived acts of indiscretion , such as premarital sexual relations or unapproved dating .
This charge has been intensified recently due to the tragic murder of a Pakistani Canadian teenage girl , Aqsa Parvez .
The practice of honor killings has absolutely no sanction in the Qur’an , the Prophetic practice , or in the evolved systems of Islamic law .
In the case of fornication or adultery , the only way a charge can be levied against an individual , male or female , is through confession , which is discouraged , or by four people actually witnessing the male organ penetrating the female .
Even if four people witnessed a naked man engaged with a naked woman , but could not actually testify that they witnessed penetration , their testimony would be rejected .
In a somewhat related issue , it should be noted that in three of the four Sunni schools of law , as is the case with all of the major Shiite schools , pregnancy is not a proof of fornication , as the possibility of rape exists in such a case .
Therefore , if a single woman were to become pregnant , according to the overwhelming majority of Islamic jurists , there is no basis for punishing her .
In the few well - publicized instances where a pregnant woman has been threatened with death , the minority opinion of the Maliki School of law was unjustly evoked , as occurred in Nigeria , or criminal malfeasance occurred as is the case in Pakistan .
In the case of dating , there is no Islamically - mandated punishment for a male or a female seeing a member of the opposite sex against the wishes of their families .
Such situations should be handled with counseling , compassion and a healthy dose of common sense .
Muslim immigrants who have migrated to the West should realize that they have placed their children in an environment where there is a tremendous amount of anti-Islamic peer pressure .
This is especially true if they have placed their children , as was the case of the young lady who was recently murdered in Canada , in public schools .
Children who succumb to that pressure should not be seen as “ bad ” kids , for by the standards of the society that has shaped them , no matter how strong their home environment is , they are normal .
To kill a female guilty of an offense such as dating or dressing like her peers under such circumstances is nothing short of cold - blooded murder , and no Islamic authority can argue otherwise .
The overwhelming majority of Muslim societies are free from the practice of honor killing , although it does endure in some parts of the Middle East and South Asia .
According to statistics released by the United Nations in 2000 there are approximately 5,000 deaths annually from “ honor ” killings .
Even if one killing occurred due to such barbarity , it would be one too many , as the Qur’an emphasizes .
However , to use the existence of such killings to smear Islam shows the desperation and misplaced priorities of many of those levying such attacks .
Most of those deaths are the pathetic acts of sick individuals , who are far removed from the letter , as we have shown above , and the spirit of Islam .
An example of such an individual is Muhammad Riaz , a British Muslim of South Asian descent who died as a result of a fire he set to burn to death his wife and four daughters , allegedly because his wife resisted his attempt to arrange marriages for his daughters .
His wife and daughters did perish in that fire .
To present Riaz , whose daughters had neither fornicated nor dated , as anything other than a sick individual is a sad attempt to defame Islam .
To attack Islam from this angle is a case of misplaced priorities because it can distract attention from far graver abuses of women that demand immediate redress .
For example , the State Department estimates that approximately 800,000 women and girls are trafficked as sexual slaves annually .
The overwhelming majority of these females are taken from and sent to nominally Christian countries .
Over the last five years well over one thousand women have been kidnapped and then gruesomely murdered in Guatemala .
Their bodies usually turn up after a few days , mutilated and in some instances with messages such as “ death to bitches ” written on them .
To date only three men have been incarcerated in connection with those attacks .
Would it be proper to thereby conclude that the “ Christians ” of Guatemala , an overwhelmingly Christian nation , have no regard for the suffering of their women ?
Of course it would not .
At the end of the day , attacks such as the one that resulted in the death of Aqsa Parvez are acts of domestic violence resulting from rage that emanates from a total neglect of Islamic teachings .
Ms. Parvez lost her life due to such violence and perhaps there are a few other instances where Muslims women in Canada or here in the United States , have been similarly victimized .
However , these instances should be kept in perspective .
In the United States there are approximately 1,200 women killed every year by their husbands or intimate partners .
There are other “ Christian ” nations where murders of this type are even higher .
The United States , Guatemala , and other countries we could mention where similar abuses occur are Christian nations .
However , it would be disingenuous to use such statistics as an indictment against Christianity .
These issues are an affront to humanity and require our collective attention .
Until we all view the problem this way , we are in jeopardizing the health and integrity of our society .
Saying this is not to minimize the gravity of so - called honor killings to the extent that they do occur in Muslim societies .
As Muslims , we are commanded to be committed to justice .
That commitment entails that as a community we oppose in the strongest terms “ honor ” killings and take immediate action to end such a practice in our communities .
Practical steps include the following :
1. Emphasize that such killings have no sanction in the Qur’an , the Prophetic practice , or in Islamic law .
2. Declare anyone guilty of involvement in honor killings to be a cold - blooded murderer .
3 . Encourage judicial authorities to enact the harshest penalties possible for anyone accused of involvement in such killings .
4. Educate our Muslim communities , especially in the West , about the un-Islamic nature of honor killings , and the pressures , nuances , challenges and complications facing young Muslims , male and female in the West .
5 . Work to eliminate the double standards , and to expose the hypocrisy that exist in our communities , generally , concerning attitudes and standards relating to the indiscretions of males as opposed to females .
In conclusion , Islam honors the female , and values femininity .
It is up to every Muslim to translate teachings in that regard into a beautiful reality that helps to elevate the status of women in all societies .
Honor killings , domestic violence in general , murders of the type terrorizing women in Guatemala , female sexual slavery and trafficking , pornography , especially its more violent manifestations , are all crimes against humanity that we should oppose in the strongest terms and work strenuously to eliminate .
If our women are not safe , physically , emotionally , spiritually , or psychologically we are all at risk , for without women men are incomplete , and without men women are incomplete .
Our Prophet , peace and blessings of God upon him alluded to this complementariness when he said , peace upon him , “ Women are the complimenting halves of men . ”
Let us all work harder to make our societies whole .
Comments
By Tamara on December 14 , 2007 at 10:40 am Dear Imam Shakir : Sallam allykum .
I am very pleased with this very fair and wonderful article .
You discussed it in a outstanding way .
I grew up in Jordan , where honour killings are common .
Girls lost their lives for rumors , or even mistakes and rape .
And the problem is that the law there gives immunity to the murderer and he gets few months in Jail only .
When the goverment tried to change the law , it was rejected by the Islamists inthe parliment !
So how do you explain that contradiction ?
Also in Sheikh Hamza 's program Rihla on MBC , he only discussed domestic violence and never mentioned anything about honour killings , which was a disappointment to many women , Although this subject was discusssed in the Rihla 's blog by many women , including me .
I thank you that you have opened a doomed subject that other imams just try to avoid it because they feel that they will loose their popularity .
I am glad you stood up for the truth and justice .
However , how can you prevent such actions against women when the majority of the imams keep mentioning that women are Shaitans and that women with no hijab are a sexual object ?
and how can you convince a teenager living in this country not to engage in these practices or even wear the hijab and keep on being discriminated against ?
I have found out after living here and in the Middle East that women there are discriminated against because they are women , and muslim women are discriminated against here in the west because they are Muslims !
and the issue of female Muslim Identity cannot be resloved !
Thank you

Some of us know " honor " killings pre-date Islam by centuries and , in fact , are un -Islamic .
But there is a problem , Imam Zaid .
When I recently conducted a nationwide survey on " honor " killings in Jordan , over 20 % of my representative sample of respondents told me they believe Islam tells them they must avenge affronts to family honor by killing .
So there is a dire need for mosque education if we want to prevent even a fraction of these people from acting on this belief .

By Mai El - Sadany on December 16 , 2007 at 8:15 am Jazakum Allahu Khairan Imam Zaid for the wonderful piece .
I 've always wanted to hear a strong point of view on honor killings coming from such a renowned source :)
By Sana Muhammad on December 16 , 2007 at 8:52 am Assalam o Alykum , Its really a nice article from Imam Ziad Shakir .
But I wanna say that our duty is not finished by writing or reading articles but we should do some practicle work by educating our societies specially students and teachers of Islam .
Thank You .

Asalaamu ' alaikum , Thank you Imam Zaid for the very insightful article .
In response to Sana Muhammad 's response above , please note that the article did conclude with many practical steps for us to follow .
By Momina Mir on December 17 , 2007 at 7:00 am Assalam u Alaikum Br. Zaid Jazakallah
Khair for such a detailed discussion about honor killings and how they are not justified in Islam .
Several non-muslim colleagues of mine have read your article and have appreciated a Muslim 's point of view .. over the hundreds of islamophobic remarks that are being made in the media everywhere .
Its very helpful for Muslim youth like myself to educate ourselves on the position Islam takes on honor killings and then for us to be able to discuss this with non-muslim peers that ask us about it .
I would request that when you have time , could you please also writeIslam 's view on the Hijab , why we wear it , the benefits etc because the media has made it sound as if the murder of Aqsa Parvez was because she didnt wear the hijab and cover herself properly .
There is a backlash against all the Muslim women that wear the hijab and i find myself having to justify it a lot lately .
Would really like to be able to do it properly .
By tsaracen on December 17 , 2007 at 10:33 am Assalamu alaikum , Jazak Allah khayr , May ur words reach the farthest corners of all countries Islamic and most importantly non-muslim countries .
Islam is love of Allah and all his creations - Human , animal , plants , seen and unseen creatures .. Muslim and Non-muslim .
May the Love of Allah and islam win over the ignorance of Man and his vices Jazak Allah khayr
By Ibrahim on December 18 , 2007 at 7:07 am Jazakallahukhairan for the article and especially for the practical steps outlined that we can take to improve our society ...
From what ERS said , I think number 4 is the most crucial ( IMO the difference between the " Muslim " doing it and the human traffickers doing it is that Muslims are finding a way to justify it ) at this time ...
By khadijah on December 18 , 2007 at 7:34 am Assalaamu alaykum Jazakallah for this piece .
This topic is oft evaded , perhaps , like opinions on suicide bombing , people are in two minds and do n't know where Islam stands regarding the matter - because of their very constricted black and white acquired stance on Islam .
Some immigrants , and I can only speak from my asian extraction , who , on shifting to the west , continue to live in this bubble of innocence and are unaware that their children could ever be caught in the depravity of the culture after the disciplinal upbringing .
Their parents ' shock to learn this however can lead to heinous consequences , even death at an extreme level .
the practical steps recommended by the imam if but into action would be an excellent start to ending this barbaric tradition .
On top of this , the relationship of parents and their children on coming to the west should not be one of distrust and suspicion , this can only be circular in causing detachment on both sides .
While it is unfortunate that many of our young brothers and sisters are trapped in unislamic activities at universities etc , if fellow muslims are seen as nonjudgemental or if the parents can be seen to be receptive beacons to the child 's anxieties and confusion , rather than stern silhouettes in the shadows , insha'Allah the child will willingly change his / her ways and sincerely repent to our Lord swt rather than simply being censured from doing a wrong , all the while planning on how to commit it again without even coming near to understanding what they are doing that is so wrong or how to get out of the spiral .
By Nermina on December 19 , 2007 at 6:07 am Esselamu Alaikum .
May Allah bless you and your family .
As muslim woman in the west I was very pleased to bump into this article defending Islam it 's pure teachings and the integrity and importance of women around the world .
I emailed it to my brother as soon as i read it , for unfortunately he needs the da'wa .
Last week my dearest brother had sent me an article from the New York Times written by this Dutch representative of some sort ( I do n't really know his title ) that attacked islam on the basis of the honor killings .
He also attacked of what he so called the " modorate muslims . "
He claimed that these moderate muslims who are defending Islam and emphasizing the peace of Islam are nowwhere to be found when it comes to the killings of innocent women .
He concluded that there must not be any since they 're not willing to stand up for their fellow muslim women .
Anyway , it just shows how uneducated people are when it comes to Islam , ufortunately even muslims are included in this category .
I wanted to respond to him and say no , this is not true , but I had no core facts .
I erased him from my email right before I read your article .
I wish I had his information to respond to him now .
InshaAllah I will try and find him and respond with this wonderful article of yours .
By Elias on December 19 , 2007 at 8:20 am
Dear Sir , you have hit the nail on the head by increasing the awareness that people in the West should stop beating on a dead camel and use the same cliche over and over again , that is blame Muslims for all the woes of humanity instead of holding individuals accountable and sometimes groups that instigate hatred .
I was similarly devastated by the tragic event and believe me it literally hit home because I am in Canada .
Many talk show hosts are merely demagogues who regurgitate the above - mentioned cliche and conveniently ignore the fact that on our own turf there was a lunatic who killed 49 women yet Muslims did not rush to label Picktall as a blood - sucking Christian vampire , because frankly he is not a Christian and I would be offended to call him a Christian .
It would have done your article even more jsutice if you had included it this gruesome story too .
Thank you and Merry Xmas to all fellow Christians and Happy Eid to all fellow Muslims as well as Happy Belated Hanukah to Jews .
Regards , Elias !
By Jamal on December 19 , 2007 at 8:26 am it has to be noted that According to government figures in Britain around 7,000 - 10,000 of people are killed in honour killing in western culture , men killing their spouse for havibg affair and in some cases women killing their men for the same reason , though less in number than men .
most of these killings has to do with psychological tension that naturally arise 's from these circumstances .
Islam prevents it by forbidding Khalwa , and practicing purdah .
By conspirisi on December 19 , 2007 at 2:09 pm an interesting piece .
But non-muslims would be forgiven for thinking that the piece was coloured with romantacism .
For example in the piece it says .
" The overwhelming majority of Muslim societies are free from the practice of honor killing , although it does endure in some parts of the Middle East and South Asia .
According to statistics released by the United Nations in 2000 there are approximately 5,000 deaths annually from
By Nour on December 22 , 2007 at 7:02 am
Alsalam allaykom wa rahmat Allah wa baraktoh , , , , , , , , I really THANK Imam zaid for this article , which shows the real picture of Islam , the forgiveness and the importance of women in the society , but unfortunately as mentioned in my Arab country , men just act as monsters when they doubt in a girl that she is involved with someone , and just exaggerate the whole thing while there is nothing , the girl is just innocent .
From my point of view , Arab society are always afraid on there daughters to make mistakes with men , it is normal for a certain degree , but what happened with us that the parents make a boundaries , heavy one on her mind , on the way she think , on her life and thinking they are doing the best for their children , while it is not because the girl in the teenage get interested in other sex and it is normal , we could not ignore this facts , we can not change our God create , and unfortunately the knowledge that the girl want regarding this matter get it form wrong sources .
Sex , honor killing , even the girl here self is like a night mare for the most Arab parents which prevent them for raising and directing their children the correct way , I mean is there a better source regarding the sexual health and information than the mother for the girls and than the father for the boys ??????????????
really believe that we are in a denial state regarding this issue , I mean I could not image going to my mother and ask her about Honor killing , it is going a shame on me !!!!!!!
Or I could make a terrible mistake so it 's better not to ask the closest woman in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We really need a lot of courage to discuss such issue in the Arab world .
There is another thing regarding this issue , in my country there are many envy and bad people who just accuse an innocent girl in fornication or even a trial to fornicate , just to hurt her and collapse her life , and you can not imagine the devastating consequences that happen for the girl , even if she does n't killed but she will live her life depressed .
By Mehmood on December 27 , 2007 at 6:29 am
You might consider the following pages that I have written and which is included in advice to British police on these and other matters
http://www.muslimsinbritain.org/guide/text038006.htm and http://www.muslimsinbritain.org/guide/text038007.htm
I have concentrated on practical community action and tackling misconceptions , rather than discussion of Islam 's moral position , because my readership requires practical assistance .
I did write " some ethnic groups within the Muslim community are very much more prone to domestic violence than others " - I could be more explicit and say " Punjabi ( Muslim , Sikh and Hindu - DV seems to be endemic in Punjabi families ) ; Kurdish and Levantine ( Palestinian , Lebanese , Jordanian etc ) .
It would be interesting to read what others think .
salaams Mehmood
By N.M. on December 27 , 2007 at 12:58 pm Salam Alaykom , First I really thank Imam Zaid for this article and wish that all Muslim could read it to clear all the misconception about Islam that the Arab believe and do criminals under the name of Allah .
I want to share you my own experience and show you how Arab really have no mercy for the girls :
Im a girl , 23 years old , live in Arab country , my story started 4 months ago .
I worked at a bank for a year and I was not friendly with the employees because I don�t find my self comfortable in mixed environment .
That made them hated me for no worthy reason , but because I was not one of them , they thought that im conceited but im not .
My relationship with my manager was not good with me because I was not responsive with him , you know I was at the office with him and he spend most time working for late night and he was so impolite with me , his looks at my body , was killing me .
I could not stand it , this made me crazy and made me rude with him , but useless he was very rude as he had a power in the bank .
I tried to find another job but useless .
And this entire bad environment made me uncomfortable at my work and made many mistakes at work which made the manager to get mad of me .
I stayed there for one year , and one day I asked the cleaning guy about the shop that he bought the cleaning stuff from it , as it was really very good one in order to buy it buy for Mum , then he gave me a paper that included the address of the shop and a mobile number for the owner , my manager saw me while im taking the paper from the cleaning guy and think that I was try to set up a date with him , I told him exactly what happened but useless he did not believe me .
Then he told everybody , and most was shocked because they know that im a good girl , but you how men don�t believe that there is a good girl and it were a chance to get revenge of me , because they thought I was acting the polite role .
After all of that all the men employees started annoying me and acting in a very dirty way just to see if im a good or not , at first I was able to defend my self but then I got afraid and tired and before 2 weeks for leaving the bank , I could not tell you what I heard from the employees " they were disrespectful and pitches .
After that I started a new work , but unfortunately , they knew about what happened in the bank and off course believe all the lies about me , and started acting disrespectfully just to see if im a good one or not , it is not just that , the bank hired people to annoy me in the town and to follow me where ever I go , they told all the town that im a very bad girl who have no virtue , al the people dealt with me bad , very bad way , then I could not stand all this and quit from my job .
Then start working again , but useless , because all Arab men are the same , just think that the girl is a stupid and weak creature who could make mistakes easily , therefore I decided to quite again .
No one know that Im honored student , got high distinction in the university and responsible for financing my Family because my father is dead .
No one is interested to know the truth about me , for now the guys are still following me and say bad things about me and harm my reputation .
This is my story , which shows the Arab perspective for woman and how they act like monsters against the girl even she is innocent thinking that they are really Muslims .
If you could know how much im desperate and very sad and even afraid .
Please pray for me .
And thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my story with you .

May you continue to display the great dignity you have demonstrated throughout the ordeal you have undergone and may you be blessed with a better work environment .

Thank you for the insightful comment .
The Muslim world is extremely vast spanning from Morocco to the southern Phillipines .
In most of this area " honor " killing is not a problem to the extent that it is in the areas I indicated .
The UN number of 5000 was accepted for the sake of argument and a serious research project could justifiably be undertaken to examine the underlying causes of killings that do occur , or the accuracy of the numbers .
I am not trying to make excuses for anybody , I am trying to demonstrate what the Islamic ideal is and make a small contribution towards helping our community move closer to that ideal .
It should be noted that in areas of the Muslim world where there are significant Christian populations , such as Lebanon and Syria , " honor " killings are also common among those Christians .
Violence against women , of various types , is a universal phenomenon and we have to all work to eliminate it .
By MM on January 10 , 2008 at 4:50 pm
I just want to say that the problem is that this blog is going to be read by muslims who will never even think about doing this kind of thing .
How can we get through to people who need help in this regard !
These are the ones who need to know the teachings of islam not the middle classes who will take the time out to find this blog !
How can these people be reached ??

You so much for writing this amazing article .
All true pious Muslims should be campaigning hard against honor killings because honor killing is a grave sin in Islam for various reason ie killing , following un -Islamic custom .
May Allah ( Swt ) give you and rest of people who campaign against honor killing the highest heaven .

Unquestionably consider that which you said .

You controlled to hit the nail upon the top and also outlined out the entire thing without having side effect , other folks could take a signal .

Also , I believe usually there are some factors that keep your insurance premium decrease .
One is , to contemplate buying motors that are inside good list of car insurance providers .
Cars that are expensive are definitely more at risk of being robbed .
Aside from that insurance coverage is also using the value of the car , so the more pricey it is , then the higher your premium you only pay .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- International comparisons of health - care systems can be tricky to tease out , but the Dutch appear most satisfied with their system and Americans the least satisfied , according to a new survey of 10 industrialized countries .
The Dutch system was most popular with its citizens while adults in the U.S. were itching for national reform the most , according to Harris Interactive , which cited three separate data sets .
A third of Americans said they believe the U.S. system " has so much wrong with it that we need to completely rebuild it , " while only 9 % in the Netherlands hold such a sentiment about their health - care system .
Twelve percent of Spaniards favored a complete overhaul , compared with 15 % in France , 17 % in New Zealand , 18 % in Australia and 20 % in Italy .
People in the Netherlands also were most likely to say their health - care system works well and needs only minor changes , with 42 % holding that view vs. 29 % who said so in France .
About a quarter of participants in Canada , New Zealand and Australia were fairly satisfied with their health care .
The U.S. and Italy were least likely to want minimal changes , with only 12 % and 11 % supporting just minor tweaks , respectively .
Americans are fed up with the headaches in their system , but that 's generally not due to the quality of care they receive , said Uwe Reinhardt , professor of economic and public affairs at Princeton University .
Had the survey asked participants about their most recent hospital stay , for example , the U.S. likely would 've scored higher , he said .
" What Americans are upset about is the unbelievable hassle of having to select health insurance , maybe not getting it ... losing insurance when they lose their job , " Reinhardt said .
" The American citizen is massively insecure . "
Doctors and nurses routinely hear demoralizing news that U.S. medicine is inferior " when the real problem is the way we finance health care and the hassle of claiming insurance , " he said .
Americans ' feelings about the U.S. health - care system have remained stable over the last decade , with roughly twice as many saying they want a complete overhaul compared with other nations , said Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , a private foundation in New York that has tracked the issue .
What 's more , Americans ' personal share of medical expenses is the highest in the industrialized world , Davis said .
In 2007 , 30 % of Americans reported having out - of - pocket medical expenses of more than $ 1,000 in the last year compared with 19 % of Australians , 12 % of Canadians , 10 % of Germans and New Zealanders , 5 % of Dutch and 4 % of Britons .
Accounting for success
The Dutch financing system has been transitioning to a new model in the last year , where residents contribute payroll taxes into a central fund , Reinhardt said .
Then they receive a voucher to buy coverage from nonprofit or for - profit private insurers .
Those polled as the change went into effect may have been reluctant to add any more reforms -- even though the system functions pretty much the same way as before , he said .
" The system is so tightly regulated and so many transfers are made among people to make sure everyone can afford the insurance and everyone has access to the same care that it 's really just a social insurance system in disguise , " Reinhardt said .
" It 's not even vaguely close to the U.S. system . "
Dutch health care also addresses patients ' need for medical attention during nonbusiness hours , Davis said .
" The Netherlands has this amazing off - hours system of care so you can always get a nurse or doctor at night or in the evening . "
It 's not just Dutch patients who seem satisfied .
In 2006 , only 3 % of physicians in the Netherlands said they thought their system needed a complete overhaul compared with 9 % of U.K. doctors and 16 % of doctors in the U.S , according to the Commonwealth Fund .
In some countries that have universal coverage , a sense of pride pervaded the participants ' answers , along with a smaller dose of concern about the systems ' sustainability .
In Great Britain , nearly 70 % agreed that the National Health Service must be maintained because it's " crucial " to British society , according to the Harris Interactive survey .
But 24 % called it a " great enterprise " that probably can't be maintained in its current form .
Contemplating trade - offs
Majorities in France ( 70 % ) and Britain ( 59 % ) said their health systems are the envy of the world .
Still , nearly as many in France as in the U.S. said fundamental changes are needed to make the system work better .
Half of American adults said so compared with 47 % of French adults .
Victor Rodwin , professor of health policy and management at New York University 's Wagner School of Public Service , said the French and Danish have among the highest satisfaction rates in European polls of health - system perceptions .
" The French tend to defend their system because they look across the channel and see the British system of rationing and they say that 's not for them , " he said .
" They look across the Atlantic and see the U.S. number of uninsured and high prices and say that 's not for them . "
At the same time , some French physicians complain that they 're underpaid and that the system is weighed down by wasteful spending and a lack of responsiveness to consumer preferences , Rodwin said .
In France , people automatically receive a standard , generous insurance benefit that includes prescription drug coverage , he said .
They have no deductibles but small copayments .
The system is financed largely through taxes .
" What makes France unique is there 's such good access not only to primary care , which you also get in Britain , but also to specialty care , " Rodwin said .
" And there 's a high premium on patient choice . "
To be sure , France has one of the most expensive health - care systems in Europe , with expenditures totaling about 11 % of its gross domestic product .
The U.S. spends 16 % of its GDP on health care .
Cost containment has been an issue in France for the last 20 years , but unlike the U.S. , lawmakers there are n't talking about national health reform , Godwin said .
Still , cost concerns are growing , he said .
" There is an increasing realization that this can not last forever .
There 's constantly new technology and pressure to cover all this and deliver it to the entire population . "
Harris Interactive tapped three sources for its findings .
The data for France , Italy , Spain and Germany come from an FT / Harris Poll conducted in June 2008 for the Financial Times .
The data for the U.S. and Great Britain come from a Harris Interactive survey conducted for the International Herald Tribune and France 24 in May 2008 .
The data for the Netherlands , Canada , New Zealand and Australia come from a Harris Interactive survey conducted for the Commonwealth Fund between March and May 2007 .

If you already are familiar with Spiceworks , then you can skip ahead to “ Brief History ” – but if not , read on .
Network Inventory for the budget - crunched masses
If you are a systems administrator or IT manager who maintains a small to medium sized shop , you probably do n’t have a lot of money to spend ( heck , who does these days ? ) on proactive network monitoring and inventory tools .
So , any company that puts out an inexpensive high - quality tool to help you manage your network is a welcome sight .
Of course , if it is a free high - quality tool … well , that ’s even better !
Back on the subject of SMB ’s : we IT staffers hardly have the budget to accommodate our users penchant for occupying every last byte of disk space on a daily basis – much less to buy a systems management , monitoring or help desk system to help contain the chaos … trying to earmark funds for such a product can be difficult since it is n’t something that directly improves your user ’s productivity or aids in the company ’s growth .
I ’m here to tell you that you can put at least some of your financial concerns to rest … go ahead , you can spend that money on that needed disk space .
Next , open your web - browser and surf to http://www.spiceworks.com to get your own free copy of a quality network asset inventory system .
Help desk and network monitoring
Spiceworks is actually three tools in one : A network asset inventory system , a help desk portal and a network monitoring solution .
Remember that movie “ Dune “ ?
“ He who controls the Spice … controls the Universe - * ahem * well , I guess at least “ the network “ .
Ok , now that I ’ve affirmed my geekiness ( and age ) , read on as I tell you a bit about Spiceworks .
Brief history
Originally released July of 2006 , Spiceworks has grown by leaps and bounds , both in terms of features as well as its customer - driven focus .
Utilizing an ad - based revenue model ( akin to Google applications ) on top of a SQLite database , the company has taken the cost factor out of the equation when it comes to choosing a management solution for your IT department .
Side note :
Do n’t like ads ?
You can eliminate them from the app for a paltry $ 10 a month .
I started using Spiceworks in early 2007 ( after using another great free solution , Open - Audit ) , and found out very quickly how easy it was to set up and use .
The installation process literally took me a few minutes .
After which I was up and running – I mean we ’re talking no tweaks , no additional components to install , just setup and go .
Spiceworks will soon be releasing version 3.0 of their highly - acclaimed software , with some awesome new goodies .
If you ’ve never used Spiceworks before , this is the time to try it out .
Existing features include :
Help desk system
Run and edit your own reports on a huge variety of asset data
Ping , Traceroute , and run Remote Control against a computer
Compare workstation configurations with each other
Index and monitor Event Log entries and other stats
Fully integrated help & user - community based forums
Automatic discovery of Windows , Linux , Mac and SNMP based devices
Manual asset addition ( not limited to network devices )
Inventory software license keys of many popular applications
Attach documents and custom notes / attributes to any asset
Determine your complete network inventory at a glance ; view distribution of hardware vendors , servers , software installations and more
Some new features to whet your appetite :
Microsoft Exchange monitoring – keep track of your heavy mailbox hitters and Exchange services
LDAP integration – Allow your users to login with their Active Directory credentials while submitting a help desk ticket
Asset groups – organize your assets into logical containers
Service providers –
Add important dates , phone numbers and other contact information pertaining to your service providers ( contractors , ISPs , web - hosting , etc . )
Revamped user navigation interface
Share reports with other Spiceworks community members
Get a preview of what ’s coming up
In preparation for their unveiling of 3.0 , Spiceworks has released a series of videos that go over some of the newest features .
Also , a heavy duty beta period is in process as I type this ( which I am a part of , thank you ! ) , with super feedback from the user community to aid in making this the best version so far .
Community driven development
Speaking of feedback , I have to say that this is THE number one thing that sets SW apart from any other software I have ever used .
The staffers routinely scour the forums looking for feature requests ( denoted by Digg - like ratings – in this case , “ spiciness ” ) to add , depending on how much the community wants them .
So , if there ’s something that you just do n’t like with regards to the interface , charting , reports , etc. – just say so .
If it ’s a valid request , most likely the SW developers will take note and make the changes in the next version !
Also , the staff actually communicates with you personally – something completely different than the anonymous mailer auto - replies we ’ve come to know and hate .
From what I can tell , EVERY employee that I ’ve spoken with at SW is passionate about their software .
Finally , something spicy that wo n’t give me heartburn .
Spiceworks – A Free Network Management Software
The Radio Australia , September 19 , 2008 -
Reports in the Chinese media suggest the company at the centre of a contaminated milk scandal knew it had a problem as far back as 2005 .
Our correspondent Kerri Ritchie reports , more than 6,000 children in China are sick and four babies have died after drinking milk laced with melamine .
Chinese media is reporting dairy company Sanlu knew its products were contaminated three years ago but kept quiet .
Sanlu ’s chairwoman has been sacked along with a number of government officials .
New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra part - owns Sanlu .
Fonterra knew about the crisis six weeks before it went public .
New Zealand trade minister Phil Goff does n’t believe Fonterra ’s representatives at Sanlu should be arrested but he says Fonterra should learn some lessons .
“ China is a market of huge opportunity but it ’s also a market which operates quite differently from New Zealand , ” he said .
Fonterra says it ’s now doing all it can to make things right .
Meanwhile , the Chinese government quality watchdog says nearly 10 per cent of milk samples taken from top Chinese dairy companies was contaminated by melamine .
The nationwide inspection of milk showed the problem of contamination ran wider than the tainted milk powder that has made thousands of infants ill .
Officials said most milk was safe to drink , trying to bolster public trust already rocked by a litany of food scares involving eggs , pork and seafood in recent years .
The General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine says almost one - tenth of milk batches from Mengniu Dairy and Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd tested positive for melamine , a compound banned in food .
At the latest count , 6,244 children have fallen ill with kidney stones after drinking powdered melamine - tainted milk , with four deaths and 158 suffering “ acute kidney failure ” .

This is a comparison of the usability of Empathy and Pidgin ( as suggested in DesktopTeam / Meeting /2008-08-07 ) , to help in deciding which should be used in Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex .
Test performed by Matthew Paul Thomas from 11~20 August 2008 , with empathy 2.23.6-0ubuntu2 and pidgin 1:2.4.3-ubuntu1 on Intrepid Ibex alpha 3 .
Wherever the wiki page says " ( ) " , it needs a link to a bug report .
I have not yet had time to report them all as bugs .
Access and installation
In the Applications menu , Empathy had the tooltip “ Send and receive instant messages ” , and Pidgin had the slightly geekier “ Send instant messages over multiple protocols ” .
In both cases , this is slightly missing the point : sending and receiving instant messages are the means by which you chat with people , not ends in themselves .
( And in Empathy , you can have voice or video chats without sending or receiving instant messages at all . )
A better tooltip would be “ Chat with people on AIM , Google Talk , MSN , Jabber ” ... etc .
Empathy access
Empathy appeared in “ Applications ” >
“ Internet ” as “ Empathy Instant Messenger ” with an icon of two blue blobs .
Clicking the status icon in the panel also revealed or hid the Contact List .
Pidgin access
Pidgin appeared in “ Applications ” > “ Internet ” as “ Pidgin Internet Messenger ” , with a purple bird icon .
Clicking the status icon in the panel also revealed or hid the Buddy List .
Installation
Whichever program is chosen will be installed by default , so the package description matters more for whichever program is not chosen .
However , the description still appears in Add / Remove Programs ’
“ Installed applications only ” view .
And for both programs , the description presented in Add / Remove Programs is quite user - hostile .
In Empathy ( inappropriate sections underlined ) : ( LP 259788 )
Empathy Instant Messenger
High - level library and user - interface for Telepathy Empathy consists of a rich set of reusable instant messaging widgets , and a
GNOME client using those widgets .
It uses Telepathy and Nokia 's Mission
Control , and reuses Gossip 's UI .
The main goal is to permit desktop
integration by providing libempathy and libempathy - gtk libraries .
libempathy - gtk is a set of powerful widgets that can be embeded [ sic ] into any
GNOME application .
This packet contains the empathy IM application and account manager .
And in Pidgin ( inappropriate sections underlined ) : ( LP 259793 )
Pidgin Internet Messenger graphical multi-protocol instant messaging client for X Pidgin is a graphical , modular Instant Messaging client capable of using
AIM / ICQ , Yahoo ! , MSN , IRC , Jabber , Napster , Zephyr , Gadu - Gadu , Bonjour ,
Groupwise , Sametime , SILC , and SIMPLE all at once .
Some extra packages are recommended to use the core functionality present
in most pidgin installations :
* gstreamer0.10-plugins-base , gstreamer0.10-plugins -good
- Sound support .
More extra packages are suggested to use increased functionality :
* gnome - panel | kicker | docker :

Setup
How easy is it to :
set up my existing Yahoo , Google Talk , AIM , and Jabber accounts ?
create a new Jabber account ?
connect to Freenode IRC with automatic Nick Serv identification ?
connect to Canonical IRC with SSL and authentication ?
Empathy
On first launching Empathy , nothing appeared to happen : a non-expert might easily think that the program does n’t work at all .
A small grey square appeared in the notification area , but it took me a while to notice .
( fixed in trunk )
Clicking the grey square opened an empty “ Contact List ” window , with an “ Accounts ” window over top of it .
The window said : “ To add a new account , you can click on the ' Add ' button and a new entry will be created for you to start configuring . ”
This made it unclear how to set up an existing account , why the “ Add ” button had n’t clicked itself , or why I ’d be interested in “ configuring ” an “ entry ” instead of setting up an account ( b.g.o 548703 ) .
The “ Add ” button required further interaction to complete its goal , but did not end with an ellipsis ( b.g.o 548704 ) .
Clicking “ Add ” changed the right side of the “ Accounts ” window into a form for setting up a “ New Account ” , despite having an “ I already have an account I want to use ” checkbox ( b.g.o 548707 ) .
The “ Undo ” button did n’t actually undo anything ; it just returned to the “ No Accounts Configured ” display ( b.g.o 548709 , fixed in trunk ) .
If the “ I already have an account I want to use ” checkbox was checked , the “ Create ” button did n’t actually create an account either ( b.g.o 548712 ) .
Accounts were given weird names by default , for example “ jabber0 ” or “ aim1 ” ( b.g.o 546445 ) .
The “ Login ID ” or equivalent field should have been focused by default , but was not ( b.g.o 548716 ) .
Expanding the “ Advanced ” section enlarged the window , but collapsing it again did not return the window to its previous size ( b.g.o 548717 ) .
Empathy repeatedly asked to create a “ default keyring ” .
If I chose not to do this ( by clicking “ Deny ” ) , Empathy falsely reported that all accounts had an “ authentication failure ” , and it was n’t obvious why this had happened ( ) .
And if I did choose to create a “ default keyring ” , when I changed Empathy ’s status to “ Available ” I was confronted with four keyring alerts in quick succession , one each for each of the accounts I had set up ( ) .
This was extremely unpleasant .
Pressing the Enter key in the password field did not complete setting up the account ( ) .
And whenever an account was created , by default it was not “ Enabled ” ( b.g.o 547323 ) .
These are likely to make people wonder why the account setup is n’t working .
Even after enabling an account , Empathy remained “ Offline ” by default , when the reason I set up an account in the first place was almost certainly that I wanted to use it ( ) .
The status menu did not extend to the full width of the menu ’s button , making choosing a status needlessly difficult ( ) .
The Accounts window covered the entire contents of the Contact List window by default , making the effects of account changes difficult to see ( ) , and the Contact List window could not be brought in front of the Accounts window ( ) .
When I set up exactly the same account twice “ by mistake ” , Empathy did not correct the error .
Trying to connect the second of the duplicate accounts produced the error “ ( null ) Network error ” ( ) .
When I chose to delete one of the accounts , Pidgin produced a confirmation alert that appeared centered over the Buddy List instead of over the Accounts window whence I ’d actually opened it ( ) .
Failed authentication was cleverly shown in the contact list with an “ Edit account ” button , but this panel was not scrollable , so in a small window it subtracted from the space available to show contacts in other accounts ( ) .
And the notification persisted even after the account had been removed ; clicking the “ Edit account ” button in this case produced a malfunctioning Accounts window ( ) .
Clicking “ Remove ” produced an obnoxious alert telling me that “ Any associated conversations and chat rooms will NOT be removed if you decide to proceed ” , despite Empathy knowing that there were no associated conversations or chat rooms ( ) .
Yahoo
With “ Yahoo ” chosen , Empathy asked for “ Login ID ” and password , which — because it was in a single “ Settings ” group — looked wonky ( ) .
Having previously used my Yahoo account with Yahoo Messenger and other chat programs , I was familiar with the term “ Yahoo ID ” , but not “ Login ID ” , so it was n’t clear whether I was supposed to enter my Yahoo ID or my entire Yahoo address ( b.g.o 548693 , fixed in trunk ) .
Entering just my Yahoo ID , I successfully connected to my Yahoo account .
Google Talk
With “ Google Talk ” chosen , Empathy again asked for “ Login ID ” and password .
My Google
Talk account uses an e-mail address , not a “ login ID ” .
Entering my e-mail address in the field , I successfully connected to my Google Talk account .
AIM
The first field was correctly labelled “ Screen Name ” , but again was not focused by default .
The “ Advanced ” section of the account setup was not lined up with the rest of the form ( ) .
I successfully connected to my AIM account .
Existing Jabber
The Advanced section was oddly indented and poorly aligned ( ) , and contained a “ Use old SSL ” checkbox for which the meaning of the off state was not obvious ( ) .
I successfully connected to my existing Jabber account .
New Jabber
I guessed that to create a new account , I needed to uncheck “ I already have an account I want to use ” .
However , this appeared to do nothing : the resulting form looked identical to that for adding an existing Jabber acount , and it did not ask me to enter the password for my new account twice ( as a registration form should do ) .
I went ahead anyway , and Empathy pretended to add a new account , but uselessly showed the error “ Name in use ” in the Contact List , instead of showing it in the registration form when I might have been able to do something about it ( ) .
Freenode IRC
There was no apparent way to set up an IRC connection in Empathy .
Canonical IRC
There was no apparent way to set up an IRC connection in Empathy .
Pidgin
On first launch , Pidgin helpfully noticed that I had no accounts set up , and presented an “ Accounts ” window with a welcome message inviting me to “ press the Add button below and configure your first account ” .
Since this was the only useful thing I could do , it was n’t clear why the “ Add ” button did n’t click itself ( d.p.i 6659 ) .
The button also required further interaction to complete its goal , but was missing an ellipsis ( d.p.i 6662 ) .
On clicking “ Add ” , a fairly straightforward “ Add Account ” window appeared , with the only slightly confusing details being “ Protocol ” ( d.p.i 6663 ) and “ Local alias ” ( d.p.i 6824 ) .
The “ Add Account ” window was not a dialog , so it was possible to return the “ Accounts ” window to the front , click “ Add ” again , and open any number of “ Add Account ” windows .
It seems likely that the only reason people will ever do this is by mistake ( d.p.i 6823 ) .
The “ Add Account ” window should have focused the first text field by default , but did not , instead focusing the “ Basic ” tab ( d.p.i 6825 ) .
Almost the entire contents of the second tab changed depending on the “ Protocol ” menu selection , which was confusing because that menu was inside the first tab ( d.p.i 6869 ) .
Choosing a different account type caused the window to resize in both directions , causing even the account type menu to jump around ( ) .
The button for completing the account setup was labelled “ Save ” , when “ Add ” would have made more sense ( ) .
The button did not respond to the Enter key ( ) .
When I set up exactly the same account twice “ by mistake ” , Pidgin did not correct the error .
Whenever I connected one of the duplicate accounts , the other would disconnect with the message “ 1 account was disabled because you signed on from another location ” ( ) .
When I chose to delete one of the accounts , Pidgin produced a confirmation alert that appeared centered over the Buddy List instead of over the Accounts window whence I ’d actually opened it ( ) .
Failed authentication was cleverly shown in the Buddy List with “ Modify Account ” and “ Reconnect ” buttons , but this panel was not scrollable , so in a small window it subtracted from the space available to show contacts in other accounts ( ) .
The notification correctly disappeared if I removed the account from the “ Accounts ” window .
Yahoo
On choosing “ Yahoo ” I was invited to enter my “ Username ” and password .
Yahoo accounts have Yahoo IDs , not “ Usernames ” ( ) .
On clicking “ Save ” , the ( now very different ) “ Accounts ” window showed that I was online with Yahoo , and my Yahoo buddies appeared in the “ Buddy List ” window .
Google Talk
On choosing “ Google Talk ” I was invited to enter my “ Username ” , “ Domain ” ( defaulting to “ gmail.com ” ) , “ Resource ” ( defaulting to “ Home ” ) , and password .
In contrast , Google ’s own Google Talk client asks only for “ Email ” and password .
I had no idea what a “ resource ” was in this context , and there was no help available ( ) .
Ignoring the “ Resource ” field , I successfully connected to my Google Talk account .
Confusingly , it showed up in the “ Accounts ” window as an “ XMPP ” account rather than a Google Talk account ( ) .
( I know that Google Talk uses XMPP , but presumably the point of having an explicit Google Talk option at all is to hide that implementation detail . )
AIM
“ AIM ” was the default “ Protocol ” choice , and invited me to enter my “ Username ” and password .
AIM accounts have Screen Names , not “ usernames ” ( ) .
I successfully connected to my AIM account .
Existing Jabber
The protocol menu contains “ XMPP ” but not “ Jabber ” ; even if technically correct , this is unhelpful , since even people who use Jabber may be unfamiliar with “ XMPP ” ( d.p.i 4564 ) .
( One way of solving this would be to label the choice “ Jabber / XMPP ” or “ Jabber ( XMPP ) ” . )
On choosing “ XMPP ” I was invited to enter my “ Username ” , “ Domain ” , “ Resource ” , and password .
I was used to entering my complete Jabber ID ( mpt @jabber.org.nz ) , not separating it into a “ username ” and “ domain ” , and again I did not know what a “ resource ” was .
Pidgin let me enter mpt @jabber.org.nz as my “ username ” without entering a “ domain ” , and only once the “ Add Account ” window was closed did it show the unhelpful error “ Error resolving jabber.org.nz@ : Name or service not known ” ( ) .
After re-entering the first and last parts of my Jabber ID in the appropriate fields , I successfully connected to my Jabber account .
New Jabber
I nearly completely missed seeing any way to create a new Jabber account within Pidgin .
The fourth time I used it , I noticed that a “ Create this account on the server ” checkbox appears when the “ Add Account ” window ’s “ Protocol ” menu is set to “ XMPP ” .
This is n’t nearly obvious enough for what most people will think of as a different operation from setting up an already - existing account ; and without asking for the password twice ( as registration forms usually do ) , there is no protection against creating an account with a mistyped password and then never being able to sign in to it ( ) .
It also resulted in poor feedback : instead of telling me in - place in the “ Add Account ” window that the ID I had chosen was already taken , Pidgin put up a nasty alert featuring the face of a dead person and the near - useless text “ 409 : Conflict ” , and then left me with no clue what to do next ( ) .
Freenode IRC
On choosing “ IRC ” I was invited to enter my “ Username ” , server , and password .
Here “ Username ” meant “ Nickname ” , and this time it was n’t just misleading , it was false : the real IRC “ Username ” field was on the “ Advanced ” tab ( ) .
I successfully connected to Freenode , and a small window opened containing server messages that I was n’t interested in .
This happened every time I connected to the network ( ) .
Canonical IRC
I successfully connected to Canonical IRC using SSL .
Accounts
Can I easily tell which accounts are online , and toggle accounts online and offline ?
Can I easily change my picture , choosing from a set of default pictures or taking a photo with a built - in camera ?
Empathy
Seeing which accounts were online and offline , and trying to reconnect a disconnected account , required opening and closing the “ Accounts ” window , which was annoying ( ) .
Setting my picture was not obvious : it required clicking an unlabelled button in the “ Personal Information ” window ( ) .
Clicking the button opened a file picker titled “ Select Your Avatar Image ” ( avatar ? ? ) to my Pictures folder , despite it containing no pictures .
It did not let me take a picture using my computer ’s built - in camera ( ) , it did not let me crop my chosen picture to be recognizable at buddy icon size ( ) , and it did not make easy using the same picture for every account ( ) .
Pidgin
Pidgin let me disconnect from , and reconnect to , an account using its “ Accounts ” submenu , but suggested this would “ Disable ” the account , which was needlessly alarming ( ) .
Setting my picture for every account was possible by clicking the existing picture in the Buddy List window .
And setting my picture for an individual account was possible by opening the “ Accounts ” window , selecting the account ( none was selected by default , ) , choosing “ Modify ” , checking the “ Use this buddy icon for this account ” checkbox , then clicking an unlabelled button ( ) .
In both cases , clicking the button opened a file picker titled “ Buddy Icon ” to my home folder .
It did not let me take a picture using my computer ’s built - in camera ( ) , it did not let me crop my chosen picture to be recognizable at buddy icon size ( ) , and it did not make easy using the same picture for every account ( ) .
A “ Remove ” button let me remove the current icon , but was available even if there was no current icon ( ) .
Status
How easily can I see my current status ?
How easily can I change my status ?
Empathy
I could see and change my status from the menu at the top of the Contact List window .
I could even change my status when no accounts were set up , which was probably more confusing than useful ( ) .
I could also see my status from an icon in the panel , though there was no apparent way of changing my status from there ( clicking the icon toggled the visibility of the Contact List window ) .
Pidgin
I could easily change my status using the menu at the bottom of the Buddy List window .
When I chose “ Away ” or “ Do not disturb ” , a text field appeared temporarily in case I wanted to be more specific about my status , which was pretty neat .
How attractive and compact is the contact list ?
How easy is it to find someone and tell whether they ’re online ?
How easily can I add and remove contacts ?
If someone has multiple accounts , how easy is it to group them ?
Are animated pictures distracting ?
If someone has a garish or unrecognizable picture , how easily can I override it with a photo of the person ?
How well - integrated is the contact list with my address book ?
Empathy
The initial presentation of the contact list was adequate , though using italics to show each person ’s status was gratuitous since it was already both smaller and grey ( b.g.o 548632 ) , and showing “ Available ” for everyone who had not set a custom status made it needlessly difficult to see who had set one ( ) .
There was a border under the heading for each group , which was slightly misleading ( b.g.o 548627 ) .
There was a stylized picture of a foot at the top right of the window for no obvious reason ( ) ; clicking it opened the Accounts window .
Each contact had a very large tooltip , in which the account name was in inverse color for no obvious reason ( ) .
The status icons for each contact were exactly aligned with my own , which was a nice touch .
The “ New Contact ” dialog was quite small by default , and poorly organized ( ) : it used a “ Contact ” group to separate everything in the dialog from nothing else by default , it had a large person icon on the right that apparently did nothing , it used an “ Identifier ” label instead of the proper account - specific terminology ( ) , it used the term “ Alias ” without explaining it , it had a picture of a blackboard in the bottom left corner for no apparent reason ( ) , and the “ Groups ” section featured a run-on sentence almost as bad as this one ( ) .
Copying and pasting a colleague ’s Jabber ID , I copied some leading and trailing whitespace as well .
The “ Identifier ” field should have ignored this , but did not ( ) .
When clicked “ Add ” , all trace of the person I was adding disappeared : there was no option to show pending contact approval requests , which meant there was no apparent way to cancel the request .
There was also no apparent way to remove a contact ( ) .
There was no apparent way to group a person ’s multiple accounts together ( ) .
Having selected a contact to update their details , I was surprised to find that “ Edit ” > “ Personal Information ” showed my own details rather than the contact ’s ( ) .
I eventually found what I was looking for , accessed from the repetitively - labelled “ Edit ” > “ Contact ” > “ Edit ” menu item ( ) .
Despite this labelling , the window included non-editable information such that it was a superset of the “ Edit ” > “ Contact ” > “ Information ” window , so the latter window seemed to be completely redundant ( ) .
The “ Edit Contact Information ” window contained a large buddy icon , but there was no apparent way to override this icon ( ) .
There did not seem to be any address book integration .
Evolution had let me enter instant messaging details for people in its address book , but Empathy ignored them ( ) .
Pidgin
The initial presentation of the contact list was adequate .
There was a border under the heading for each group , which was slightly misleading ( ) .
Each contact had a very large tooltip , containing ( amongst other things ) mysterious “ Subscription ” text such as “ Subscription : From ” or “ Subscription : None ( To pending ) ” ( ) .
The icon for my status was slightly out of line with the icons for everyone else’s .
The “ Add Buddy ” dialog was quite understandable , except that it used the same needlessly vague “ username ” term as the main “ Accounts ” window .
However , once I clicked “ Add ” and the dialog disappeared , nothing seemed to have happened : the other person became one of the “ Not Authorized ” contacts that are not shown by default ( ) .
There was no apparent way to cancel a contact approval request , or to remove a contact ( ) .
I could group a person ’s multiple accounts together by dragging and dropping , but the drag feedback was poor and there was no obvious way to undo a mistaken grouping ( ) .
Having selected a contact and chosen “ Buddies ” >
“ Get User Info ” , I was surprised to be confronted with a dialog asking me to “ enter the username or alias of the person whose info you would like to view ” .
To its credit , the text field auto - completed names from my Buddy List , but what about the contact I had already selected ( ) ?
Once I had selected a contact , the “ Buddy Information ” window was adequate but had slight layout problems ( ) , and did not let me override the contact ’s image ( ) ( see also “ Sending and receiving files ” below ) .
There did not seem to be any address book integration .
Evolution had let me enter instant messaging details for people in its address book , but Pidgin ignored them ( ) .
Notification of new conversations
What happens if someone starts a chat with me ?
What happens if someone mentions my name on IRC ?
Empathy
A new conversation was indicated by the icon in the panel flashing with a speech bubble icon .
The person who had started talking to me was indicated by the same flashing icon next to their name in the Contact List window , but depending on the number and order of my online contacts , this might have been scrolled out of sight .
Strangely , the conversation window itself did not open automatically ; if it had , Ubuntu ’s window manager would have done a much better job of notifying me of the new conversation than Empathy did ( ) .
It turned out that the person had since gone offline .
The only indication of this in the conversation window was that the window had a tab with a grey square , which was n’t obvious , and there was no indication at all of when they had gone offline ( ) .
Pidgin
A new conversation was indicated by the icon in the panel changing color ( from green to orange ) .
A window opened for the person ’s chat , so the window manager effectively requested attention .
Text chat
How easy is sending a message ?
Are conversations attractive and easy to read ?
How well are long messages handled ?
How well are URLs handled ?
How well are emoticons handled ?
Empathy
By default , text chats were displayed in a window that showed only eight lines of text ( ) .
They were presented as plain colored text , with graphic emoticons but no buddy icons or speech bubbles .
In Ubuntu ’s default dark theme , timestamps were practically impossible to read ( ) .
The window had two close buttons , one in the title bar and one inside the window ’s single tab ( b.g.o 551096 ) .
Sending a message was easy , as the message field was focused by default .
Entering a long message resized the window to enlarge the message field automatically , but not as much as it could have ( ) , and pasting in a long passage of text did not automatically show the end of the text as it does in most text fields ( ) .
URLs were displayed as links , but a / character at the end of a URL was not treated as part of the link ( ) , and URLs of the form apt : package - name were not recognized and produced an emoticon instead ( ) .
Pidgin
By default , text chats were displayed in a window that showed about 12 lines of text .
IRC channel windows were the same size as an individual chat window , which is inappropriately small for a chat that is likely to involve dozens of people ( ) .
A timestamp was shown for every utterance , which was a little cluttersome , especially at the default window size .
Sending a message was easy , as the message field was focused by default .
Entering a long message resized the window to enlarge the message field automatically , but not as much as it could have ( ) .
URLs were displayed as links , but URLs of the form apt : package - name were not recognized and produced an emoticon instead ( ) .
A button labelled “ Smile ! ” ( whimsical , but possibly discouraging for business use ) offered a selection of 16 emoticons in a floating window .
This was surprising , because the other items in the same toolbar behaved like menus ( and so do the emoticon selectors in other IM programs ) , and because it meant clicking outside the list of emoticons did not close it ( ) .
Voice chat
How easily can I see which people accept voice chat ?
How easily can I start a voice chat ?
What ’s the sound quality like ?
Is it easy to mute the input ? or the output ?
Empathy
It was easy to see which people accepted voice chat , as they appeared with a microphone icon in the Contact List .
It was incongruous that starting a text chat required double - clicking anywhere in a person ’s row except the microphone , while starting a voice chat required single - clicking on the microphone .
On trying to start a voice chat , Empathy opened a small mostly - blank window with the text “ Ringing ” , which eventually became “ Closed ” .
When the other person tried to initiate the call , it did not show up at all .
I was unable to have a voice chat using Empathy .
Pidgin
Pidgin does not have voice chat .
Video chat
How easily can I see which people accept video chat ?
What ’s the sound and video quality like ?
Is it easy to mute the sound and / or video ?
Empathy
I was unable to test video chat , because Ubuntu did not recognize my notebook ’s camera .
Pidgin
Pidgin does not have video chat .
Sending and receiving files
How obvious is sending a file ?
How easy is receiving a file ?
Empathy
Empathy does not yet support sending or receiving files .
Pidgin
A file being sent to me was indicated by a small , oddly - placed alert featuring the face of a confused person ( ) .
On clicking “ Accept ” , I was was confronted with a “ Save File ... ” ( ) dialog that was massive but mostly empty ( ) .
On clicking “ Save ” , a “ File Transfers ” window appeared , but the transfer never began .
On dragging an image to a person in the Buddy List , or into their open chat window , I was confronted with an alert asking me whether I wanted to set the image as the person ’s buddy icon ( oh , so that ’s how you do it ! ) , or send the file to them .
It would have made more sense to devote this gesture to sending files , and to have a more obvious mechanism elsewhere for overriding someone ’s buddy icon . ( d.p. i 7019 )
Once I had chosen to send the file , it appeared in my “ File Transfers ” window , but not in that of the other person ( who was also using Pidgin ) , and the transfer never began .
In summary , I was unable to send files to , or receive files from , someone else using Pidgin with a Jabber account .
For someone using Google Talk on the Web , which does not support sending / receiving files , I was still able to choose “ Send File ” and select a file .
Only then was I confronted with the error message “ Unable to send file ... user does not support file transfers ” , again with a face - of - a - dead - person icon ( ) , but the impossible transfer still falsely showed up in the File Transfers window as “ Waiting for transfer to begin ” ( ) .
Chat logs
How accessible are chat logs ?
How easily can the logs be searched ?
Can logs from multiple accounts for the same person be grouped , regardless of whether those accounts are still in my contact list ?
Does your previous conversation with a person show up when starting a new conversation with them ?
Empathy
Empathy logged conversations by default .
It had a “ View Previous Conversations ” menu item , which opened a “ Previous Conversations ” window with two tabs : “ Search ” , where I could filter conversations by search text , and “ Conversations ” , where conversations can be filtered by account and then person and then date and then individually searched .
This is an artificial distinction ; it would be more powerful to combine the tabs into a list of conversations that can be searched by text , person , and / or time .
Pidgin
Pidgin ’s logging feature was hostile bordering on vexatious .
As with contact info , Pidgin ’s “ Buddies ” > “ View User Log … ” menu item showed me not the log of the person I had selected , nor a list of contacts for whom any conversations had been logged , nor even a list of logged conversations , but a “ View User Log ” window ( again with the icon of a confused person ’s face ) asking me to type the name of the person whose log I wanted to view .
Once I ’d entered someone ’s name , Pidgin would then unfailingly report that “ No logs were found ” , because “ Instant messages will only be logged if the " Log all instant messages " preference is enabled ” , and that preference was disabled by default .
Pidgin could have detected within a few hundredths of a second that it did not have any logs stored , but it presented the “ View User Log ” scavenger hunt as an available menu item anyway ( ) .
Once I had turned on logging , the log viewer let me see conversations for one person per log window .
The logs were searchable , with search matches highlighted in fluorescent green .
Other cool stuff
What other cool features are available ?
Empathy
Empathy did not have any visible features other than those described above .
Pidgin
Pidgin had “ Buddy Pounces ” , letting me contact a particular person immediately whenever they come online ( albeit taking the fun out of that game ) ; useful , if a little hidden , privacy controls ; and a raft of plugins for extra features and various behaviors .
Help
“ I get an error whenever I go online . ”
Does the help assist with this example problem ?
“ I ca n’t find someone in my contact list . ”
Does the help assist with this example problem ?
“ How do I do voice chat ? ”
Does the help answer this example question ?
Does the About window describe what the program is about ?
Empathy
Empathy ’s help was appalling ( b.g.o 561033 ) .
Discouragingly titled “ Empathy Manual ” , it featured such inanities as “ When you start Empathy the following window is shown ” ; “ Allows to update the user 's status ” ; a pointless full - size screenshot of the “ Accounts window ” ; “ talk with other users ( called contatcs ) ” [ sic , italics in original ] ; multiple occurrences of “ proceed as follow ” ; and a “ Modifying a Contact ” page that was completely empty .
Possibly the only two helpful help pages were those on “ Registering an Account ” , because it provided links to the Web sites for actually signing up for the types of account that Empathy lets you use ; and on “ Creating an Account ” , because Empathy ’s account setup procedure is likely confusing enough to need it .
It did not provide help with any of my example issues .
Empathy ’s About window described it as “ An Instant Messaging client for GNOME ” .
Who ’s he ?
Pidgin
A “ Help ” > “ Online Help ” menu item opened a Web browser to a single long page of friendly and detailed help on the Pidgin Web site .
It is not the Pidgin developers ’ fault , but a problem nonetheless , that this menu item was confusingly similar to the “ Get Help Online … ” item inserted into the “ Help ” menu by Ubuntu ( LP 38341 ) .
That the help was on a Web site made it unavailable when offline ; this would make it ineffective for many of those who need help realizing that their Internet connection in general is the reason they ’re having trouble with instant messaging in particular .
And that the help was not platform - specific also meant that someone using Ubuntu would have to navigate through “ All Platforms ” , “ Windows Specific ” , and “ Linux and Unix - like platforms ” sections , when people may be unfamiliar with those terms .
The sections may also be distracting : for example , the help addressed my example “ I get an error whenever I go online ” problem , but only for Windows .
The help usefully addressed my example problem “ I ca n’t find someone in my contact list ” with specific instructions , though they only covered one possibility ( erroneously - grouped contacts ) .
The help also addressed my example question “ How do I do voice chat ? ” honestly , if a little bleakly ( “ We plan to implement these features eventually … we have no idea when this will happen ” ) .
Pidgin ’s
About window described it as “ a graphical modular messaging client based on libpurple which is capable of connecting to AIM , MSN , Yahoo ! , XMPP , ICQ , IRC , SILC , SIP / SIMPLE , Novell Group Wise , Lotus Sametime , Bonjour , Zephyr , MySpaceIM , Gadu - Gadu , and QQ all at once .
It is written using GTK +. ”
TMI , TYVM .
Conclusion
Empathy and Pidgin are both quite unpleasant to use .
In a couple of cases , this is because the human interface for an entire feature has been poorly designed — most notably Empathy ’s account setup and Pidgin ’s chat logging .
Mostly , however , it is a constant stream of small design glitches and other defects that combine to make the overall experience a frustrating one .
Empathy shows promise as a modest and unobtrusive messaging program that will , apparently , be adaptable as a communication framework in future Ubuntu applications .
And its developers have been enthusiastic and responsive in tackling problems discussed in this evaluation .
For now , though , this “ rich set of reusable instant messaging widgets ” does not seem to have reached 1.0 quality .
It is likely that some features will need extensive redesign before Empathy is usable by a mass audience .
So if it was introduced as Ubuntu ’s default instant messaging program , those novices who did learn to use the current version would get a bad experience with it ( and , thanks to Empathy ’s near - useless help , would further distrust help in general ) , and would then have a lot of relearning to do for the next version .
Pidgin is more mature and fully - featured , with the large exceptions of audio and video chat .
Few design details are actually impressive or delightful , but Pidgin ’s developers have a strong culture of simplicity and consistency , and most of its features ( apart from chat logging ) are more understandable than their equivalents in Empathy .
And Pidgin ’s plug - in mechanism allows for customization and experimentation with new features .
I suggest that Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex continue using Pidgin by default .
I look forward to working with the Empathy and Pidgin developers , if invited , to design solutions to their usability problems .
That 's not " two blue blobs " in the Empathy icon , but two blue heads having a telepathic mind link or something .

Regarding " delayed " error notfication on sending a file to someone using gtalk web interface .
I think that Pidgin ( or any other third party client ) cannot differentiate between the web client and the normal client .
So , it cannot give apriori error ( unless there is some handshaking mechanism involved in the XMPP protocol that allows clients to " discover " capabilities before starting a chat ) - Shantanu Goel
This is wrong .
Pidgin CAN differentiate between web client and normal client ( see http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/disco-categories.html once the server is up again ) .
Also see http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/4650 for File Transfer - related ticket I filed few months ago .
So , there are protocols to tell client type and even specific client features in XMPP …
Pidgin or Empathy ( and many other clients ) do n't use them , unfortunately .

Your Google Talk account does NOT use an email address for its " login ID " , it uses a Jabber ID ( or XMPP ID if you prefer ) .
The text in the interface can of course differ from these terms , as long as it does n't reference email .
The " @ " character does not equal " this is an email address " , the XMPP specification uses the @ symbol to give Jabber IDs in the form user@server / resource ( like warbo@jabber.org / athome ) , but has nothing at all to do with emails .
Google 's implementation happens to use the term " gmail " in its Jabber IDs , in the same way that Microsoft uses " hotmail " is some MSN addresses , but this does n't make either them email services ( there are email services hosted at those servers as well though ) .
Asking for " email " credentials in a chat application would cause confusion in my opinion , as it would n't be clear that the messages were not emails , which is an important implementation detail to show in a world where the term email is used universally to describe the system .
PS : I find it rather ironic that this Wiki software has also made the same incorrect assumption and inserted the above Jabber ID into a completely meaningless and broken mailto link .
- Warbo
I understand that it ’s not an e-mail address , and that it ’s possible to use Google Talk without even having a Gmail account , so the Google Talk client is just plain wrong .
However , that ’s no excuse for Pidgin ’s Google Talk setup to be more complicated , asking you to enter things that have only one possible value .
-- mpt Agreed .
I was just dreading that the applications would switch to using the term " email address " for Google Talk accounts , and then users thinking that the chat program was therefore displaying their emails .
It can take a long time staring at an empty Conversations window before one realises that this program wo n't show incoming emails .
- Warbo
I think it 's great that these apps are finally getting some solid scrutiny .
You must be one of the professionals Canonical hired to improve usability .
With the spot - on review I see here , I am really looking forward to the future !

I have a problem with an analysis that purports to be about usability and yet declines to state who it will be usable for .
Usability - for - everyone inevitably is an exploration about usability - for - only - one .
Chat logs ?
What audience desires chat logs and easy searching ?
What audience would find the added feature more cumbersome to a simple chat interface they desire and add to the complexity of their experience ?
How easy is it to set up an account for someone who has never set up a single chat account before ?
An expert who wants to set up multiple accounts quickly without flipping through multiple window panes ?
Both examples require quite different implementations , and as such , no single implementation will succeed for both .
Once again , who is the audience ?
It is false to say that “ Usability - for - everyone inevitably is an exploration about usability - for - only - one ” .
For example , the sort of person who has trouble with unfamiliar terminology when setting up an AIM account is highly unlikely to be the same sort of person who needs to set up an IRC account with SSL authentication .
But it was n’t particularly difficult mentally switching character to test both those things ( though the evaluation was by no means exhaustive ) .
You are also exaggerating the difference in account setup interface suited for different skill sets , because it ’s a rare task and therefore one that an expert usually would not mind ( or even notice ! ) spending a little more time on in the edge case of setting up multiple similar accounts .
And as for chat logs , both programs already expose that feature and have therefore paid its complexity fee ; but neither of them are getting as high a dividend from it as they could .
For both programs , a better - designed log window would require less interaction overall .
-- MatthewPaulThomas , 2008-09 -24
-- troy - sobotka 2008-10-04 18:27:17 Ugh .
The point I was trying to make is that your audience drives _all_ .
And yes , the person who sets up an AIM account is a far cry from one who sets up IRC with SSL .
That 's the point .
While the high level proficient user can ' dial down ' their knowledge , a greener individual cannot ' dial up ' their knowledge quickly nor effectively .
If the extra feature resides in plain view , it will only complicate the matter ( http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html )
If Mark is deadly serious about delving into the seamless design pattern established by Apple , his ' usability ' people had better understand the cornerstone of design taught in every entry level course -- audience .
Symptomatic terms such as ' What other cool features are there ? ' scare me .
What does your audience want and how can a design more greatly take them there ?
Microsoft Movie Maker and Final Cut Pro are two entirely different applications aimed at entirely different audiences .
While one could argue over the merits of one particular interface element , the bottom line is that the audience drives the application 's design and a comparison between the two based on random audiences would yield completely random results .
Again , I think you are vastly exaggerating the difference in interface suited for different skill sets .
Instant messaging is an extremely simple task compared with making a movie or editing a photo , and that means there is little need to target an instant messaging application at any particular fraction of the audience .
If it helps , you could consider the target audience as “ everyone who is n’t an IRCop ” .
-- MatthewPaulThomas
It is probably true that average user does not use chat history , chat history can be given lower priority and moved out of sight ( it actually kinda is ) .
About quickly setting up accounts : instant messenger 's developers need to setup the account with minimum clicks possible .
The rest of world wants to do it without error , looking to documentation , providing information they do not know for sure , thinking or using advanced knowledge - which results in quick use case .
Even expert users benefit from having setting where they expect them .
And the audience ?
The common people : janitors , taxi drivers , shopkeepers , musicians , news reporters .
Half of the people I know do IT for living ( or at least know what filesystem is ) but I am a freak , world everywhere else is different .

I just installed empathy 2.24 , ekiga 3.00 , and gizmo while looking for an alternative to Skype for voice / video chats .
So far empathy is the only program that 's given me consistent success , using SIP .
I still have n't figured out how to get it to do voice / video with Jabber accounts .
I have n't imported my other account settings into it yet , so I 'm still using pidgin for text chat .
Main reasons here are the familiar UI , metacontacts , support for filetransfers , and several months worth of accumulated logs .
The account creation UI in empathy disturbs me in a couple ways , as already noted above : newly created accounts should be enabled by default ; the sequence of clicks from + Add , Cancel / Create and Close is very unsettling .
In particular , when you 're on the last part of the dialog , the only Submit button is " Close " - I do n't know if that means " OK , I 'm satisfied with this " or " Forget it " .
In fact , experimentation reveals that if you filled in the username / password fields then " Close " = " OK " but if you left the input blank then " Close " = " Cancel " .
It 's simple once you know it , but experimentation should n't have been required in the first place .
Given the number of hours I spent ( unsuccessfully ) trying to get voicechat working in the other programs , I 'll use empathy for this purpose .
If some of the nicer features of pidgin make it into empathy , then I will probably migrate completely .
But for now , I 'm going to be using both pidgin and empathy for a while .

pidgin is getting some audio + video see gsoc 2008 projects .
-- does empathy have otr support ?

Google said Monday that it will cut two key features out of its upcoming " Android " mobile - phone OS : a formal Bluetooth implementation , and Google Talk , the developer 's version of instant messaging .
Google said Monday that it will cut two key features out of its upcoming " Android " mobile - phone OS : a formal Bluetooth implementation , and Google Talk , the developer 's version of instant messaging .
However , Google said that the first phones will indeed have support for Bluetooth hands - free devices .
On the other hand , HTC or T - Mobile , both carriers that have committed to developing Android phones , will apparently not have access to the API that exposes Bluetooth functionality ; dedicated Bluetooth functions will apparently have to be designed in by Google itself .
Google 's omissions were noted as the company released a 0.9 beta to developers .
On Monday , developer advocate Dan Morill explained the decision in a blog post .
" Earlier this week , we released a beta of the Android SDK , " Morill wrote .
" In the accompanying post , I mentioned that we had to remove some APIs from the platform for Android 1.0 , and as a result they do n't appear in the 0.9 beta SDK , and wo n't appear in 1.0 - compatible SDKs . "
The Bluetooth API and the Google Talk functionality were the only omissions that Morill explicitly noted .
Morill quoted Rich Cannings , a Google security researcher , in citing the security concerns that Google had in adding the Google Talk functionality .
Cannings cited three problems with including Google Talk : the exposure of otherwise private information to the Web at large , issues with " Intent " messaging , and the lack of security technologies to prevent the widescale spread of a theoretical Android virus via Google Talk .
Google
Talk is designed to allow users to identify themselves , including the disclosure of their actual names , to friends and contacts .
But a large - scale , Android - based , multiplayer game using Google Talk would also expose this information to the game at large , a breach of privacy that users may not like , Cannings said .
Google
Talk also does not include key security provisions to monitor " intents , " or messages sent within the Android device .
" At first , remote applications could send arbitrary Intents , meaning that your Google Talk friends had almost the same control of your device as you did , " Cannings wrote .
" Even once that issue was resolved , we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request .
We could only trust the identity of the user .
So a " bad " application on your friend 's device could send a message to a " good " application on your device which would negatively affect the good application . "
Finally , Cannings said that a lack of adequate security mechanisms within the Google Talk protocol itself would place too heavy a burden on developers : " An Android application using GTalkService would be reachable from all of the user 's Google Talk friends , and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious ' friend ' or automated malware , " he wrote .
Why was Bluetooth excluded ?
According to Android engineer Nick Pelly , " the reason is that we plain ran out of time , " he wrote , as cited by Morill .
" The Android Bluetooth API was pretty far along , but needs some clean - up before we can commit to it for the SDK .
Keep in mind that putting it in the 1.0 SDK would have locked us into that API for years to come . "
Morill said that the Android team remains committed to supporting a full Bluetooth stack in a future release , but when remains an open question .
Proposed features include bindings to GAP and SDP functionality , access to RFCOMM and SCO sockets , possibly L2CAP socket support from Java , and an API for the handsfree and headset profiles .
" I 'm definitely bummed about these API removals , " Morill concluded .
" I was particularly looking forward to the P2P capabilities offered by GTalkService , but , as always , user security and privacy must come first . "
Six months later , Robert Noyce , then with Fairchild Semiconductor , independently conceived the idea of an integrated circuit .
He also had the idea of adding the metal layer last , then removing much of it , leaving in place on the semiconductor material the metal wires that interconnected the various components .
It was an idea that made mass production of ICs much more feasible .
Noyce went on to co-found Intel .
From The Hill :
Ann Lewis and Howard Wolfson , top aides to Clinton , held a conference call with reporters in which they said that Obama ’s calling on the former first lady to release her tax returns were similar to attacks from the GOP that the Clintons have faced before .
“ I for one do not believe that imitating Ken Starr is a way to win a Democratic primary for the presidency , ” Wolfson said .
Methinks the lady doth protest too much .
Especially after it was Hillary who made “ Mr. Lazio , release those tax returns ” a key part of her 2000 Senate campaign against Republican Rick Lazio .
Back then Hillary said it was “ frankly disturbing ” that a candidate would waffle over when they were going to release their returns .
But now that she ’s the one waffling , saying she may release them “ around ” April 15 ( if we ’re lucky ) , suddenly it ’s the Spanish Inquisition to expect her to be true to her previous word .
( Obama released his returns a year ago . )
And a quick word about the “ around ” April 15th quasi-promise .
Does around April 15 mean before or after the final important primary in Pennsylvania on April 22 ?
And even if it ’s before April 22 , how much before ?
Is Hillary planning on dumping 7 years worth of tax documents on the media with only days to go before the Pennsylvania primary , so there ’s no time for the media to fully vet the documents , no time for Democratic voters to find out what ’s in them and have all the facts before voting ?
Why not just release them now ?
It costs a dime to go to Kinkos .
What is Hillary hiding that she would invoke Monica – Monica ! – in order to change the subject ?
Hillary ’s campaign also argues that there are 20 years of her tax returns already released to the public .
Well , yes – from 1980 to 2000 .
It ’s now 2008 .
We do n’t get to see the last 8 years ?
That ’s an odd standard , and in any case , she did n’t demand in 2000 that Rick Lazio only release his returns pre-1992 .
One more thing .
This of course now means that Hillary was the one acting like Kenn Starr when she demanded that Lazio release his returns .
A handful of scraps of charred wood and a little pile of stone chips - finds from the first excavation at Stonehenge in over 40 years - have added thousands of years to the history of one of the world 's most famous prehistoric monuments .
There was no gold or bronze , but to the archaeologists who led the excavation - professors Tim Darvil and Geoffrey Wainwright - the unlovely heap of finds is real treasure .
They are convinced the stone chips are evidence of belief in the healing power of the " bluestones " , brought 250 km from north Wales , which endured long after the monument was thought to have been abandoned .
It was the magical bluestone - spotted dolomite , which when newly quarried is dark blue speckled with brilliant white stars of quartz - that made Stonehenge the Lourdes of prehistoric Europe , they believe .
Or as Darvill put it yesterday , " the accident and emergency unit of southern England " .
The charcoal fragments also add haunting new evidence to the Stonehenge story .
Darvill and Wainwright revealed today , at the Society of Antiquaries in London , that the earliest dates from 7,000 BC , and the most recent to medieval times , suggesting the site was already important 4,000 years before the oldest stone circle , and continued to draw visitors for centuries after it was believed to have been abandoned .
Although they concede Stonehenge was probably " multifunctional " , possibly also serving as a giant calender marking the solstices , as well as a site of ancestor worship , they are convinced its true importance came from the modest bluestones , the size of a man or smaller , dwarfed by the awesome sarsens .
Two of the original bluestones were broken , many chipped into fragments , and some survive only as stumps underground , after being broken up to serve as healing talismans .
Organic remains , including a few specks of grain and seed , have allowed secure dating for the first time of the bluestone circle : around 2,300 BC , three centuries later than previously thought .
The stones were repeatedly moved and rearranged , and the enormous sarsen trilithons added , before the final outer circle of sarsen uprights and lintels was created around 1,900 BC , creating the world famous profile of the monument .
Although the double - decker bus height sarsens are undoubtedly the most impressive , Darvill and Wainwright believe they were essentially an architectural framework for the bluestones , just as towering medieval cathedrals grew over the shrines of saints .
The stone comes from only one place , an outcrop of the Preseli hills near Wainwright 's home in Pembrokeshire .
The crags are full of springs , many still regarded as healing holy wells , and ancient decorated stones prove they were important from prehistoric times .
Their theory , which they said today was borne out by their excavation results , was that they were brought to Stonehenge by tremendous human effort because of the belief in their healing power .
They completely dismiss the rival theory that the stones were carried by glaciers :
" The one tiny flaw in the theory is that there is absolutely no evidence for glaciation of Wiltshire , " Wainwright said .
They were to add power and importance to what was already a major site of ancestor worship , proved by the charcoal deposits , and the burial mounds and circular bank and ditch enclosure predating the stones .
By re-examining old records they have now found evidence of chips of bluestone buried with many bodies in the Stonehenge area - including that of the Amesbury Archer , one of the richest finds in decades , who died around 2,300 BC - and they believe further research will uncover many more .
Bluestone fragments have also been found at other monuments , including the summit of nearby Silbury Hill .
Many of the bodies bear the marks of horrible illness or injury , supporting their theory that they came to Stonehenge in futile search of a cure or at least respite from excruciating pain .
The Archer , whose grave was found in 2002 just three miles from Stonehenge , came like the much younger man buried near him - who may have been a son or nephew - from modern Switzerland .
The skeleton suggests he spent years in agony from a shattered kneecap , and may eventually have died poisoned by an abscess which rotted a hole through his jaw .
Archaeologists had believed that by the time the Romans arrived in Britain , Stonehenge was just a towering enigma , too huge ever to be lost but its ritual importance entirely forgotten .
The latest finds imply a much more complex story : they include a Roman coin among stone fragments , suggesting the Romans also believed in and sought out the healing magic .
The later charcoal deposits are not the oak or birch of domestic hearths , but midwinter greenery , like holly , ivy and yew - suggesting to Darvill and Wainwright annual gatherings , perhaps for feasting and ceremony at the winter solstice , continuing as late as the 17th century .
The modern day druids and pagans who assemble bearing green boughs for the winter and summer solstices , much mocked for inventing supposedly ancient rituals , may not be so far off the mark after all .
The last excavation at Stonehenge was in 1964 .
Although in April Darvill and Wainwright only won permission from English Heritage for a trench the size of a large hearth rug - " a little piece of keyhole surgery " as Darvill described it - it was the first excavation at which the whole armoury of modern scientific archaeology could be fired .
" This is very much work in progress , " Wainwright said today , " there are more surprises to come , I 'm sure of that . "
Next season they will be back in Preseli , looking for more evidence of ritual practice at the home of the bluestones .
" I 'm sure we 'll find the Welsh architect of Stonehenge yet , " Wainwright said .
• The excavation was funded by BBC Timewatch and Smithsonian Networks .
A documentary on the findings will be screened on BBC2 at 8 pm on Saturday .
Court orders release of Pentagon prisoner abuse pics Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 22 , 2008
Print This Email
This A federal appeals court on Monday ordered the Bush administration to hand over photos depicting abuse of prisoners held by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan , handing the American Civil Liberties Union a victory in an ongoing public records lawsuit filed against the Pentagon .
 This is a resounding victory for the publics right to hold the government accountable ,  ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh , who argued before the court , said in a news release .
 These photographs demonstrate that the abuse of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad was not aberrational and not confined to Abu Ghraib , but the result of policies adopted by high - ranking officials .
Their release is critical for bringing an end to the administrations torture policies and for deterring further prisoner abuse . 
The ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the photographs in 2003 and took the government to court after the Department of Defense failed to comply , arguing that releasing the photos would violate its obligations to prisoners under the Geneva Conventions .
It is not clear whether Monday 's decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , based in New York , will bring the requested photos to light immediately .
An ACLU attorney tells RAW STORY the group does n't know what administration 's next steps will be , but the governemnt may request an en banc review by all 12 judges on the appeals panel or it could take its case all the way to the Supreme Court .
" It 's anyone 's guess as to what they 're going to do , " said Amrit Singh , who argued the ACLU 's case before the appeals court .
The ACLU 's ongoing FOIA lawsuits have compelled the release of more than 100,000 pages of documents , including memos authorizing CIA torture .
At issue in Monday 's decision were 87 photographs the ACLU believed were taken by members of the military at facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan , including the Abu Ghraib prison that became synonymous with US abuses after humiliating photos from there first appeared in the New Yorker in early 2004 .
Although the government stopped trying to fight the full release of Abu Ghraib photos after they all were independently published in 2006 , the ACLU says the Pentagon continues to keep hidden 29 additional images from at least seven different locations in Afghanistan and Iraq .
More detail on the photos , from the 52 - page court decision ( pdf ) :
And while many of the Abu Ghraib photos depicted unclothed detainees forced to pose in degrading and sexually explicit ways , the detainees in the 29 photographs were clothed and generally not forced to pose .
The photographs were part of seven investigative files of the Armys Criminal Investigations Command ( Army CID ) , and were provided to Army CID in connection with allegations of mistreatment of detainees .
In three of the investigations , Army CID found probable cause to believe detainee abuse had occurred related to the photographs at issue here .
The appeals panel went on to overturn the government 's attempt to use FOIA as " an all - purpose damper on global controversy " in finding that the exemptions to the public records law the administration had claimed were not valid .
 This is yet another case in which the administration used national security as a pretext to suppress information relating to crimes that were endorsed , encouraged or tolerated by government officials ,  said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
 The appeals court was correct to recognize both that the administrations suppression of the photographs was without legal basis and that disclosure will further the purposes of the Geneva Conventions by deterring the abuse and torture of prisoners in the future . 

If you 're thinking about fictional mathematicians in print , there are quite a few others who might make the list .
How about the title character from Uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture by Apostolos Doxiadis ( you can read a MAA review by Keith Devlin at http://www.maa.org/reviews/petros.html)?
Or Daisy Love from Jeff Noon 's Nymphomation ?
Hobbs Baranov from William Gibson 's Pattern Recognition ?
Or the narrator from The Oxford Murders , recently also made into a film ?....
From a colleague :
The protagonist of Sam Peckinpah 's film Straw Dogs is a mathematician
not on your list .
Also not on your list is the maths student protagonist of Krystof Zanussi's ( Polish ) film " The constant " .
From another colleague :
Of Prof Moriaty :
It was written that : ' He is a man of good birth and excellent education , endowed by nature
with a phenomenal mathematical faculty .
At the age of twenty - one he wrote a treatise upon the binomial theorem , which has had a European vogue .
On the strength of it he won the mathematical chair at one of our smaller universities , and had , to all appearances , a most brilliant career before him .
But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind .
A criminal strain ran in his blood , which , instead of being modified , was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers .
Dark rumours gathered round him in the University town , and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and come down to London ....'
' Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid , a book
which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it ?'
Moriarty
Please may we have a simple .cgi voting page for this poll ?
I hate having to install plugins , particularly those which take up a lot of cycles like flash .
He 's not fictional ( prof. Comeau , the Stellan Starsgard character , is ) but I like Matt whoever 's question " who 's the most famous living American pure mathematician ? " in Good Will Hunting .
The answer is Ted Kaczynski , the Unabomber .
My initial inclination is to vote for Yakima , the hero of Greg Egan 's Diaspora , but that 's because I really like the book as a whole .
Another candidate , a great contrast with the former , would be Myron Aub who rediscovers mental arithmetic in Asimov 's The Feeling of Power .
More reflection is required .
There 's also Kate Gunzinger from the film ' It 's My Turn ' ( see here ) - this film is in fact given by Weibel in his Introduction to Homological Algebra as a reference for the Snake Lemma , a proof of which opens the film .
I would n't call here my favourite character but Barbara Sabich - Harrison Ford 's wife in Presumed Innocent - is a mathematician ( I think we hear this in the scene where she complains about how long it has taken her to get tenure ) .
A minor , behind the scenes character , but one without whom there would be no story .
I have voted for ' The Square ' but wonder if ' Count von Count ' from Sesame Street should be included ?
He has certainly promoted the joy of numbers and counting to generations of kids around the world !
The list is definitely too " english - centered " .
You are missing many fictional mathematicians in non-English spoken movies .
So , the question of the poll should be : " Who is your favourite English - speaking fictional mathematician " ?
E.g. : have you seen the Argentinian movie " Il treno di Moebius " ( " The Moebius train " ) ?
The Count from Sesame Street gets our vote .
How about John Nash - a beautiful mind ?
Although he is n't my favourite I still love the comment " I am a well balanced individual I have a chip on both shoulders " .
How about David Levinson ( Jeff Goldblum ) in Independence Day ?
Does he count as a mathematician ??
One of the mathematicians on your list is Max Cohen from the film ' Pi ' ( played by Sean Gullette ) , but I 'd prefer to nominate Cohen 's mentor in the same film , Sol Robeson ( played by Mark Margolis ) .
When Cohen becomes obsessed with finding patterns in the digits of pi ( π ) , Robeson quite rightly rebukes him , saying that he's no longer a mathematician but rather a numerologist .
John Nash is n't a fictional character ...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash
I voted for Prof Calculus but I 'm not sure he was strictly a mathematician .
How about James Harris that guy is unreal .
Would n't you say that " The Doctor " is a fictional character ?
And I have reason to believe that he 's not too bad a mathematician himself !
( But then again is he really fictional ?! )
There is at least another mathematician in another Michael Crichton 's novel : Harry Adams in Sphere ( also a movie ) and his character is important in the plot .
Other side comments :
a ) I concur that this list looks very english literature - centered but it is likely to evolve as more comments and references are made .
Two recent examples of novels with mathematician characters :
- Hans Singer in " Villa des Hommes " by Denis Guedj ( closely copied from Cantor 's character )
- Arthur Seldom in " Crímenes imperceptibles " ( aka " The Oxford Murders " )
b ) John Nash is of course a real person , but his image in the Holywood dramatization of Silvia Nasar 's pseudo biography A Beautiful Mind is a complete fiction who never existed except in the script of the film .
There is a female mathematician in Scarlett Thomas ' Popco .
The main charecter is Alice Butler and her grandmother is portrayed as having been one of the few women mathematicians at Bletchley Park .
There are numerous references to fictional mathematicians and mathematical fiction at http://math.cofc.edu/kasman/MATHFICT/.
I would vote for Professor James Darnley McCorkle in " The Chair of Philanthromathematics " by O Henry .
Verushka Graef in The Steep Approach to Garbadale by Iain Banks .
The interesting about her is that she is interesting .
To the anonymous commenter who said " have you seen the Argentinian movie " Il treno di Moebius " ( " The Moebius train " ) ? "
The answer is that we have tried and tried to see this film but cannot get a copy for public screening in the UK .
It would have been part of the Edinburgh Maths at the Movies Festival last April if it had been possible .
I can't speak for the USA but it 's been seen by very few people in the UK because it 's only ever been screened at few film festivals shortly after release .
This film , however , is based on one of my all time favourite short stories " A Subway named Mobius " by Prof. A.J. Deutsch at Harvard .
It was actually written about the New York subway system .
Tupelo , the topologist who solved the problem , should be on the voting list but I 'm afraid he was originally an English speaking New Yorker .
http://scifipedia.scifi.com/index.php/A_Subway_Named_Mobius
Numbers is a silly show .
More people need to read Asimov 's Foundation series and get to know Hari Seldon .
Lawrence Waterhouse .
Rudy Rucker 's work is stuffed full of fictional mathematicians !
His 2006 book " Mathematicians in love " features Bela Kis and Paul Bridge , postgrads at Berkeley and a higher world of mathematician cockroaches !
My favourite is a much earlier work " White Light " whose hero , Feliz Raymond , stays in Hilbert 's Hotel and visits Cantor 's Continum .
If he was on the list he'd have got my vote .

Griffin and Dr. Henry Jekyll / Edward Hyde
Cat - sized reptiles once roamed what is now the icebox of Antarctica , snuggling up in burrows and peeping above ground to snag plant roots and insects .
The evidence for this scenario comes from preserved burrow casts discovered in the Transantarctic Mountains , which extend 3,000 miles ( 4,800 km ) across the polar continent and contain layers of rock dating back 400 million years .
" We 've got good evidence that these burrows were made by land - dwelling animals rather than crayfish , " said lead researcher Christian Sidor , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Washington and curator at UW 's Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture .

About 245 million years ago , floodwaters likely overflowed river banks in parts of Antarctica , sending water and sand across the landscape and into various animal homes , such as burrows .
No animal bones or remains were found inside the burrows , suggesting the burrow dweller must have escaped the deluge , according to study researcher Molly Miller of Vanderbilt University .
When the waters receded , the sand inside of these burrows hardened into casts .
The largest burrow cast , measuring 14 inches ( 35 cm ) long , 6 inches ( 16 cm ) wide and 3 inches ( 9 cm ) deep , was buried in rock layers of the Wahl Glacier dating back to about 245 million years ago during the Early Triassic period .
" The burrow is an inclined hole and at the end of the burrow the animal would scrape out a larger area and that 's where it would huddle down , " said Miller , a geologist .
Nine smaller burrow casts previously were discovered in the Allen Hills region in southern Victoria Land and date to the early Middle Triassic .
The newly discovered casts predate fossils of tetrapods in the area , pushing back the date for such four - legged vertebrates ( animals with backbones ) living in Victoria Land by at least 15 million years , Sidor said .
" This would be the earliest record of any kind of tetrapod in that part of Antarctica , " Miller told LiveScience .
Burrow dwellers
None of the burrows contained animal remains .
However , the burrows ' sizes and shapes , along with associated scratch marks , are nearly identical to tetrapod burrows found in South Africa also dating to the Triassic .
One of these South African burrows contained a complete skeleton of an extinct mammal - like reptile called Thrinaxodon liorhinus .
The larger burrow from the Wahl Glacier was likely crafted by the same type of animal , Sidor said .
The term " mammal - like reptile " is actually a little misleading .
The animals belonging to this group do have a mixture of mammalian and reptilian characteristics , Sidor said , but the group is actually more closely related to mammals than to reptiles .
And today 's mammals are the living descendants of mammal - like reptiles , he said .
" Thrinaxodon is a distant relative of mammals , " Sidor said .
" It lived in the Early Triassic whereas the first mammals are Late Triassic / Early Jurassic in age .
Thrinaxodon is not related to any specific type of mammals but to mammals in general . "
Based on comparisons with other South African burrows , the researchers speculate the smaller burrows in Victoria Land housed mole - sized reptiles called Procolophonids .
" We have documented that tetrapods were burrowing , making dens in Antarctica , back in the Triassic , " Sidor said .
" There are lots of good reasons for burrowing at high latitudes , not the least of which is protection from the elements . "
Different Antarctica
At the time the ancient animals presumably were excavating their subterranean homes , Antarctica would have been ice - free , with a cool temperate climate , Miller said .
And Antarctica and southern Africa could have shared residents , since during the Triassic , the two regions were connected as part of the supercontinent Pangea .
The Permian - Triassic extinction had just occurred , and so very few tetrapods existed at the time , with just seven tetrapod genera identified in Antarctica .
Today , no land - based animals live in Antarctica , where temperatures stay below freezing and the earth is covered in ice .
( Penguins and seals of Antarctica are dependent on the sea . )
The research , supported by funding from the National Science Foundation , is detailed in the June issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
" After visiting many sunglass displays websites I decided to order from your company .
I ordered one of your rotating sunglass displays .

What I love about WDS is their customer service !
Yaknow that “ Live Chat ” button ?
Well I swear , they have some of the nicest agents !
The first time I ordered from WDS , the lady went out of her way to show me which sunglasses were big sellers , & helped me work out how to get the most out of my investment !
I felt like she was on my team !
I wo n’t order my wholesale sunglasses anywhere else !

I sell sunglasses at Saturday Markets , as a rookie I suffered the unreliable wholesale suppliers , until a friend suggested I try WDS .
Great advice !!
WDS helped me to better understand my potential customer base & even gave me great tips on how to set up my products .
They have very cost effective sunglass displays that really did increase my sales , best of all they are so dependable !

Any apparel retailer knows how hard it is to anticipate what will be â€ œINâ€ this season , thatâ€™s why I love WDS !
I was unsure about which styles to stock but when I called to place my order , their rep .
suggested I go with the classic California Classics , seems they are always in style .
She was right !
I just placed my second order !
Thanks so much WDS !!

When I placed my order with WDS I was surprised how quickly I received my shipment .
When I 've ordered from other wholesale sunglass companies it seemed that I was waiting forever for my order , but not with you guys !
Living outside the US , it can be difficult ordering & receiving , which is why I 'm very happy with WDS .
Keep up the great work !!

In Massachusetts , where his friend and political ally Deval Patrick won the top office by campaigning in an eerily similar fashion to Senator Obama , voters have a Petri dish to examine what the Democratic candidate 's presidency might be like should he win in November .
Joseph Sohm / © Corbis .
All Rights Reserved .
MASSACHUSETTS STATE HOUSE A President Obama could run into the same challenges as Governor Patrick has here .
Comparisons between the two men are in order once again .
Mr. Obama celebrated his 47th birthday in Boston last night at a $ 4 million fundraiser with Governor Patrick at his side .
Like Mr. Obama 's campaign , Mr. Patrick 's was heavy on sweeping rhetoric and increased expectations .
Advised by , among others , David Axelrod , who is also Mr. Obama 's chief strategist , Mr. Patrick offered state voters the prospect of great change .
In the first months of his governorship , Mr. Patrick weathered his worst political problems .
After several months , he stabilized his position by bringing in an experienced team of staffers .
Yet the extraordinary promise his campaign once offered has given way to ordinary political wrangling .
For example , to help pay for his ideas , Mr. Patrick turned to backing the introduction of legalized casino gambling in Massachusetts .
When it looked like the legislature would defeat the gambling effort  which it did  Mr. Patrick quietly headed out of state and scored a book deal in New York .
For Mr. Patrick 's ambitious agenda , which includes all - day kindergarten , to succeed , the state needs revenue .
As a relative newcomer to the State House , where the business of state government takes place , Mr. Patrick has been unafraid to criticize programs that have been political sacred cows .
The best example is that of paying police to do work that can be done by civilians at a cost to government of an estimated $ 100 million a year .
Massachusetts , unlike the other 49 states in America , requires the presence of uniformed police at roadway construction sites .
In March , Mr. Patrick appeared at a press conference with other state leaders to voice his intention to revise this policy .
In the face of sharp opposition from police and public safety unions , the plan seems to have lost steam , but is not dead .
When faced with a battle against legislators , the governor also acquiesced to the legislature in agreeing to a $ 10 - a - month cost of living increase for state pensioners .
He is expected to sign legislation that could cost the state millions over the long run when most current officials are out of office .
The president of a state fiscal watchdog , the Massachusetts Taxpayers Association , Michael Widmer , says the spending on public employees is not sustainable .
Mr. Widmer calls police details " probably the most important symbolic issue as it relates to public dismay with public spending . "
Another area in which Mr. Patrick will expend political capital is education .
Not a proponent of charter schools , Mr. Patrick has unveiled what he is calling " readiness schools . "
Like charter schools , these institutions would operate outside of the usual public school teacher contracts ; unlike them , they would answer to local school committees , not the state .
The author of " The Bluest State " and a WBZ - TV political analyst , Jonathan Keller , cautions that the " readiness schools " are " an anti-charter school tactic . "
Mr. Patrick 's greatest successes are in areas where there is support from the legislature .
Since taking office Mr. Patrick has been a vocal proponent of Massachusetts becoming a national and international center of biotech research .
He pushed for the passage of a $ 1 billion life sciences initiative and was named " Governor of the Year " by the Biotechnology Industry Organization .
His courageous decision to campaign on behalf of a controversial wind farm off the coast of Cape Cod , Cape Wind ( even when it was opposed by Senator Kennedy ) , has looked better with energy costs spiraling upward .
Mr. Patrick believes he can grow jobs in Massachusetts by making the state a haven for clean jobs .
The governor signed his Clean Energy Bill last month , which , among other provisions , ties utility contracts to the funding of local clean energy companies .
Mr. Patrick 's first two years have shown how hard it is to make change happen , an indicator of what things might be like for Mr. Obama .
In addition to a common political consultant , Mr. Axelrod , Messrs .
Patrick and Obama share aspects of their biography ; they are black , youthful men who graduated from Harvard Law School .
Mr. Obama is a resident of Chicago ; Mr. Patrick is Chicago - born .
Mr. Patrick , despite having served as the head of the civil rights division in the Department of Justice , had minimal exposure to state government before he was elected as governor .
Likewise , Mr. Obama has been in federal office since 2005 and never as an executive ; the bulk of Mr. Obama 's experience has been as a community organizer and a senator on the state and federal levels .
Given their similarities , Mr. Obama is likely to find negotiating with the House and Senate leadership , both of whom are from his own party , to be tougher than addressing thousands of enthusiastic Europeans .
It 's easy to imagine an Obama administration that is rocky at the beginning but then settles into the conventional , sometimes grinding , pattern of governing .
" The question I have about both of these guys is what do they really want to do ? " asks Mr. Keller .
" Is it about proving the point by winning the campaign , getting the power , and then engaging in navel gazing and self - adulation or do they really want to change the facts on the ground ? "

Domestic spying lawsuit targets Bush , Cheney , NSA Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 18 , 2008
Print This Email This Privacy advocates are trying to shut down the US government 's " shadow network of surveillance devices " used to spy on its citizens with a lawsuit aimed at President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , the National Security Agency and dozens of current and former government officials .
Plaintiffs who had been pursuing a suit against AT&T have shifted their focus to government officials to circumvent Congress 's grant of immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
A class action lawsuit was filed Thursday by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is continuing to pursue its case against AT&T .
" Today we 've opened a second front in our battle to stop the NSA 's illegal surveillance , " EFF attorney Kevin Bankston told reporters during a conference call Thursday .
Based on news reports and information it obtained from former AT&T employee Mark Kline , EFF alleges a massive surveillance apparatus has been trained on Americans to vacuum up information on virtually every telephone call , e-mail and Internet search to feed a massive database maintained by the NSA .
8 . The core component of the Program is Defendants  nationwide network of sophisticated communications surveillance devices , attached to the key facilities of telecommunications companies such as AT&T that carry Americans 
Internet and telephone communications .
9 . Using this shadow network of surveillance devices , Defendants have acquired and continue to acquire the content of a significant portion of the phone calls , emails , instant messages , text messages , web communications and other communications , both international and domestic , of practically every American who uses the phone system or the Internet , including Plaintiffs and class members , in an unprecedented suspicionless general search through the nations communications networks .
Information on the lawsuit and a link to the 55 - page filing is available on EFF 's Web site .
The lawsuit outlines 17 counts , including alleged violations of the First Amendment , Fourth Amendment , Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other laws .
Additional defendants targeted by the suit include former White House counsel and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , former NSA director and current CIA director Michael Hayden , Cheney chief of staff David Addington , Attorney General Michael Mukasey , former Attorney General John Ashcroft , former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and up to 100 unnamed government or private sector officials who participated in the surveillance .
Bankston said the lawsuit 's aim is to " obtain personal accountability from the architects " of the warrantless surveillance and to say to future government officials , " If you break the law and violate people 's privacy , there will be consequences . "
Bush 's decision to ignore FISA 's warrant requirements and have the NSA turn its surveillance apparatus on Americans after 9/11 was first revealed by the New York Times in December 2005 , leading the president to acknowledge what he called the " Terrorist Surveillance Program " a few months later .
The TSP , as Bush described it , authorized eavesdropping on phone calls in which at least one party was located overseas .
Bankston said the illegal surveillance " absolutely " goes beyond that program , citing admissions from government officials that the TSP was just part of the government 's post - 9/11 surveillance expansion along with subsequent reports in other newspapers outlining government efforts to gather financial records and online transactions to construct data - mining databases .
Whether the latest lawsuit will succeed in ending the NSA 's domestic surveillance programs remains to be seen .
Previous efforts to learn more about or achieve judicial overview of the ultra secret programs have been scuttled through a combination of state secrets and executive privilege claims , and EFF expects to face those same types of arguments this time around .
Congress also has been complicit .
When it adopted several amendments to FISA earlier this summer , the Democratic - led Congress gave in to Bush 's demands that the updated spy law provide immunity for participating telecoms like AT&T .
Bankston said EFF is arguing that the immunity grant itself was unconstitutional and has not given up its original case , Hepting v. AT&T , but the group is pursuing the separate case against the government officials to avoid getting bogged down with the fight over immunity .
The main goal , he said , " is to dismantle the NSA 's nationwide spying network . "

Prerequisites
JRuby 1.1.3 or higher
Java 5 or higher
Windows , Linux , Solaris : Download the JDK directly from Sun's Java SE Downloads page .
I typically download the JDK ( Java Development Kit ) because I find it convenient to have Java sources , compilers , and debugging tools available , but this walkthrough should work with the JRE ( Java Runtime Environment ) as well .
Linux and Solaris users should also be able to use their packaging system of choice to install a JDK .
OS X : The 32 - bit Intel macs can't run the Apple Java 6 , so you 'll want to look at the Soylatte Java 6 build for OS X to get the best performance .
A small warning ... it does n't have Cocoa - based UI components , so it will use X11 if you start up a GUI app .
BSDs : FreeBSD users should check the FreeBSD Java downloads page .
I believe there 's a port for FreeBSD and package / port for OpenBSD but I could n't dig up the details .
We have had users on both platforms , though , so I know they work fine .
Others :
There 's basically a JDK for just about every platform , so if you 're not on one of these just do a little digging .
All you need to know is that it needs to be a full Java 5 or higher implementation .
Rails 2.0 or higher

I 'll update this page ( and it 's equivalent on the JRuby Wiki ) once I know more .
Glass
Fish works just fine as a standalone server , but many users will want to proxy it through Apache or another web server .
Again , this is outside the scope of this walkthrough , but it should be as simple as configuring a virtual host or a set of matching URLs to hit the Glass Fish server at port 8080 ( which is the default port for web applications ) .
For apps I 'm running , however , I just use Glass Fish .

Conclusion
There still seems to be confusion about the relative simplicity or difficulty of deploying a Rails app using JRuby .
Many folks still look around for the old tools and the old ways ( Mongrel , generally ) , assuming that " all that app server stuff " is too complicated .
I figured I 'd post a quick walkthrough to show how easy it actually is , along with links to everything to get you started .
Here 's the full session , in all its glory , for those who just want the commands :
Now , on to the full walkthrough !
None of the steps in the main walkthrough require JRuby , since Warbler works fine under other Ruby implementations .
But if you want to install and test against the JDBC ActiveRecord adapters , JRuby 's the way .
And in general , if you 're deploying on JRuby , you should probably test and build on JRuby as well .
Go to www.jruby.org under " Download ! " and grab the latest 1.1.x " bin " distribution .
I link here JRuby 1.1.3 tarball and JRuby 1.1.3 zip for your convenience .
Download , unpack , put in PATH .
That 's all there is to it .
Most systems already have a JVM installed .
Here 's some links to OpenJDK downloads for various platforms , in case you do n't already have one .
Hopefully by now most of you are on a 2.x version of Rails .
This walkthrough will assume you 've got Rails 2.0+ installed .
If you 're using JRuby , it 's a simple " jruby - S gem install rails " or if you 've got JRuby 's bin in PATH , " gem install rails " should do the trick .
Note that the Warbler ( described later ) should work in any Ruby implementation , since it 's just a packager and it includes JRuby .
The words " Application Server " are terrifying to most Rubyists , to the point that they 'll refuse to even try this deployment model .
Of course , the ones that try it usually agree it's a much cleaner way to deploy apps , and generally they do n't want to go back to any of the alternatives .
Much of the teeth - gnashing seems to surround the perceived complexity of setting a server up .
That was definitely the case 5 years ago , but today 's servers have been vastly simplified .
For this walkthrough , I 'll use Glass Fish , since it 's FOSS , fast , and easy to install .
I 'm using GlassFish V2 UR2 ( that 's Version 2 , Update Release 2 ) since it 's very stable and by most accounts the best app server available , FOSS or otherwise .
Not that I 'm biased or anything .
At any rate , it 's hard to argue with the install process .
1. Download from the Glass Fish V2 UR2 download page .
The download links start about halfway down the page and are range from 53MB ( English localization ) to 93MB ( Multilanguage ) in size .
2 . Run the Glass Fish installer .
The .jar file downloaded is an executable jar containing the installer for GlassFish as well as Glass Fish itself .
The - Xmx specified here increases the memory cap for the JVM from its default 64MB to 256MB , since the archive gets unpacked in memory .
Before the unpack begins , the installer will pop up a GUI asking you to accept the Glass Fish license .
Read the license or not ... it's up to you .
But to accept , you need to at least pretend you read it and scroll the license to the bottom .
The installer will proceed to unpack all the files for Glass Fish into ./glassfish .3 . Run the Glass Fish setup script .
In the unpacked glassfish directory , there are two .xml files : setup.xml and setup-cluster.xml .
Most users will just want to use setup.xml here , but if you 're interested in clustering several Glass Fish instances across machine , you 'll want to look into the clustered setup .
I wo n't go into it here .
The unpacked glassfish dir also contains Apache 's
Ant build tool , so you do n't need to download it .
If you already have it available , your copy should work fine , and the chmod command below -- which sets the provided Ant 's bin scripts executable -- would be unnecessary .
If you 're on Windows , the bin scripts are bat files , so they 'll work fine as - is .
Two items to note : you should probably move the glassfish dir where you want it to live in production , and you should run the installer with the version of Java you 'd like Glass Fish to run under .
Both can be changed later , but it 's better to just get it right the first time .
4 . Start up your Glass Fish server .
It 's as simple as one command now .
Congratulations !
You have installed Glass Fish .
Simple , eh? A few tips for using your new server :
This step is made super - trivial by Nick Sieger 's Warbler .
It includes JRuby itself and provides a simple set of commands to package up your app , add a packaging config file , and more .
In this case , I 'll just be packaging up a simple Rails app .
Note that Warbler works just fine under non-JRuby Ruby implementations , since it 's all Ruby code .
But again , if you 're deploying with JRuby , it 's probably a good idea to test and build with JRuby as well .
And that 's essentially all there is to it .
You will get a .war file containing your app , JRuby , Rails , and the Ruby standard library .
This one file is now a deployable Rails applications , suitable for any app server , any OS , and any platform without a recompile .
The target server does n't even have to have JRuby or Rails installed .
There 's two ways you can deploy .
You can either go to the Admin Console web page , select " Web Applications " from the " Applications " category on the left , and deploy the file there , or you can just use Glass Fish 's command - line interface .
I will demonstrate the latter , and I 'm providing the optional contextroot flag to deploy my app at the root context .
That 's it ?
Yep , that 's it !
If we now hit the server at port 8080 , we can see the app is deployed .
There 's a few things you can do to tweak your deployment a bit .
The first would be to generate a warble .rb config file and adjust settings to suit your application .
In this file you can set the min/max number of Rails instances you need , additional files and directories to include , additional gems and libraries to include , and so on .
The file is heavily commented , so you should have no trouble figuring it out , but otherwise the Warbler page on the JRuby Wiki is probably your best source of information .
And since a lot of people ask how many instances they should use , I 'll provide a definitive answer : it depends .
Try the defaults , and scale up or down as appropriate .
Hopefully with Rails 2.2 this will no longer be needed , as is the case for Merb and friends .
The other tweak you 'll probably want to look into is using the JDBC - based ActiveRecord adapters instead of the pure Ruby versions ( or the C - based versions , if you 're migrating from the C - based Ruby impls ) .
This is generally pretty simple too .
Install the JDBC adapter for your database , and tweak your database.yml .
Here 's the commands on my system :
And the modified database .
yml file :
Now repackage ( " warble " command again ) , redeploy , and you 're done !
Hopefully this walkthrough clears up some confusion around JRuby on Rails deployment to an app server .
It 's really a simple process , despite the not - so - simple history surrounding Enterprise Application Servers , and Glass Fish almost makes it fun :)
Rwanda already holds the world record for highest proportion of female MPs Rwanda will be the first country where women will outnumber men in parliament , preliminary election results show .
Women have taken 44 out of 80 seats so far and the number could rise if three seats reserved for the disabled and youth representatives go to females .
Rwanda , whose post - genocide constitution ensures a 30 % quota for female MPs , already held the record for the most women in parliament .
The ruling party coalition won 78 % of seats in Monday 's vote .
Indirect elections for women 's quota seats took place on Tuesday and votes for two youth representatives and a disabled quota seat are taking place on Wednesday and Thursday .
It is the second parliamentary elections since the genocide of 1994 when some 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by Hutu militias in just 100 days .
80 - SEAT PARLIAMENT
Elected seats : 53
* RPF : 42 seats , 78.76 % of the vote
* Social Democratic Party : 7 seats , 13.12 % of the vote
* Liberal Party : 4 seats , 7.5 % of the vote Quota seats : 27 ( women 24 , youth 2 , disabled 1 )
Women total : 44 seats , 55 % of parliament Preliminary results Rwanda National Electoral Commission President Paul Kagame was instrumental in establishing the Tutsi-led 's Rwanda Patriotic Front ( RPF ) - the rebel force which took power and ended the genocide .
The BBC's Geoffrey Mutagoma in the capital , Kigali , says the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party have conceded defeat .
In the outgoing parliament , 48.8 % of MPs were women - the world 's highest rate .
It is now set to be at least 55 % .

Cliff Harris , the man behind one - man UK computer game development shop Positech , wondered recently why people were pirating his games .
So a few days ago , Harris posted on his blog asking people to tell him why they downloaded his games without paying .
Harris said his only motive was to learn about why people do it , and promised to “ read every single [ email ] , and keep an open mind . ”
He promised not to rat anyone out for pirating .
Harris ’ blog post got 206 comments and hundreds of emails — long ones , he said .
“ Few people wrote under 100 words .
Some people put tolstoy to shame .
It seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question , ” he said .
Today , Techdirt noticed that Harris had posted his promised summary and response .
So why do people pirate software ( specifically games ) ?
Money – “ A LOT of people cited the cost of games as a major reason for pirating .
Many were kids with no cash and lots of time to play games , but many were not , ” wrote Harris .
Positech ’s games are priced between $ 19 - 23 , and Harris said that he was surprised that so many people thought that was too high .

Quality – “ Although there were many and varied complaints about tech support , game stability , bugs and system requirements , it was interesting to hear so many complaints about actual game design and gameplay , ” Harris said .
Many people agreed that though today ’s games look fantastic , they “ got boring too quickly , were too derivative , and had gameplay issues . ”
Another quality complaint : Demos are too short and people feel that they ’re often not representative of the final product .

DRM – “ People do n’t like DRM , we knew that , but the extent to which DRM is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood .
If you wanted to change ONE thing to get more pirates to buy games , scrapping DRM is it . ”

Ease – Writes Harris : “ Lots of people claimed to pirate because it was easier than going to shops .
Many of them said they pirate everything that ’s not on [ Valve ’s ] Steam .
Steam got a pretty universal thumbs up from everyone . ”
( Harris said that he would love to get his games on Steam , but it ’s not open to everyone . )

Because I Can – 5 % of the replies , said Harris , came from people who admitted that stealing games online was easy to do because it was easy to get away with .
To his credit , Harris did just what he said he would and considered the responses he fielded .
He plans to make a number of changes , including ditching DRM completely , creating longer game demos , considering a drop in price ( though he seems most hesitant about that change ) , and working harder to create higher quality games .
“ I ’ve gone from being demoralized by pirates to actually inspired by them , and I ’m working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished , ” he wrote .
One of the lessons to be learned from Harris , beyond the interesting look into the reasons why people pirate software , is the value of having a good corporate blog .
We wrote last week that properly done a corporate blog can have tremendous value .
Harris ’ Positech blog proves that .
By opening the channels of communication with his customers and users , Harris was able to get honest feedback that he is putting to good use to make himself more money and make his customers happier .

NEW YORK ( AP ) --
A report on three heart transplants involving babies is focusing attention on a touchy issue in the organ donation field :
When and how can someone be declared dead ?
For decades , organs have typically been removed only after doctors determine that a donor ’s brain has completely stopped working .
In the case of the infants , all three were on life support and showed little brain function , but they did n’t meet the criteria for brain death .
With their families ’ consent , the newborns were taken off ventilators and surgeons in Denver removed their hearts minutes after they stopped beating .
The hearts were successfully transplanted , and the babies who got the hearts survived .
” It seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations , ” said Dr. Mark Boucek , who led the study at Children ’s Hospital in Denver .
” Recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs .
And we had children dying whose family wanted to donate , and we were n’t able to do it . ”
House Republicans take to floor of empty chamber for continued drill - here push David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : White House wo n't aid GOP display
While most of their colleagues in the House of Representatives had already gone home for a five - week break Monday , a group of House Republicans returned to the floor of the adjourned chamber to demand that Congress open more of the nation 's coastlines to oil drilling .
Following a dramatic demonstration last Friday , in which GOP lawmakers refused to leave the House floor after a vote to adjourn for Congress 's annual August recess , several conservative Republicans returned to the Capitol to continue their demonstration .
" What you are about to witness is the beginning of a sustained effort to demand that Speaker Pelosi bring this Congress back to Washington DC and give us an up - or - down vote on an energy bill that includes more access to American oil , " said Rep. Mike Pence ( R - IN ) during a brief press conference before the lawmakers stormed the floor .
As on Friday , the lights were dimmed , the microphones were off and there was no TV coverage as Republican lawmakers delivered impassioned speeches to tourists in the visitors ' gallery .
Many visitors were also allowed onto the House floor - a very rare ticket - to get a better view .
Pence , who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee , and his colleagues targeted Pelosi exclusively during an excerpt from the conference aired on MSNBC Monday morning .
Left out of their criticism Monday morning was another prominent politician who had the power to order Congress back to Washington : Republican President George W. Bush .
Pence did send a letter to Bush last week demanding the president exercise his power to convene a special session of Congress , but such a move seems unlikely .
Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) , who also returned to the Capitol Monday , called for Bush to convene a special session in an interview on Fox News Monday morning .
The president 's unwillingness to subject lawmakers to Washington 's infamous August heat and humidity in an ostensible bid to lower prices at the pump stands in stark contrast to his outright demand last year that Congress not be allowed to adjourn for recess until it passed a law expanding the government 's domestic spying authority .
Apparently , in the Bush White House , warrantless wiretaps trump preventing $ 5 - a - gallon gas .
Bush , who saw gas prices go from $ 1.44 a gallon at the beginning of his first term to nearly $ 4 a gallon today , continues to place the blame for high prices squarely at Democrats ' feet .
In his weekly radio address Saturday , the president continued to blame Congress for preventing domestic drilling , but he gave no indication that he'd act to call lawmakers back into session .
A White House spokesperson did not immediately return RAW STORY 'S request for comment on Bush 's refusal to act .
Later in the day , the White House said that a special session " wo n't make a difference " and reiterated the blame - Democrats line the administration has pushed for months , according to The Hill .
 We do n't have plans to call Congress into session -- it wo n't make a difference if Democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up - down vote ,  said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
To be sure , even drilling proponents acknowledge opening the coasts alone wo n't be a panacea toward cheaper gas , but they argue it 's important for America to show the world its willing to take advantage of the resources at its disposal .
Democrats say the impact of drilling would be to drop mere pennies from the price of a gallon of gas , and even those effects would be a decade or more away .
Pelosi is standing firm against more drilling , although both presidential candidates -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama -- are shifting from their own previous opposition and indicating more willingness to consider offshore drilling .
Polls have indicated that Americans also are becoming more receptive to domestic drilling as the price of gas increases .

In politic speak framing means " constructing a schema of interpretation . "
So , for example , we know that at 72 John McCain is old compared to Barack Obama .
Old age can either be interpreted as a liability  decrepit , inflexible , out - of - touch  or an asset  mature , experienced , ready to lead .
Similarly , when compared to McCain , 47 - year - old Barack Obama is young , which can either be a liability  immature , inexperienced , wet - behind - the - ears -- or an asset  not part of the Washington establishment , energetic , thinks outside the box .
McCain 's strategy is to make the election hinge upon age and claim Obama is not ready to become President .
Rather than tout his own bona fides , McCain chose to go negative .
He contends the Illinois Senator is immature because he 's a flip - flopper , lacks substance , and is a manufactured celebrity  like Paris Hilton .
The Arizona Senator 's ads describe him as experienced , resolute , a known commodity , while Obama is portrayed as inexperienced , erratic , and unknown .
At it 's starkest , the comparison is between McCain pictured as a strong , solid , man and Obama depicted as a weak , inconsistent , boy .
A tactic that subliminally plays to racism .
McCain 's negative ads have reduced Obama 's lead and made the race perilously close in swing states .
Nonetheless , the Illinois Senator 's relatively young age can be framed as a positive , serve as a stark contrast to " politics as usual " and a symbol that he represents all Americans not just the rich and powerful .
Obama should continue to tie McCain to George Bush and the Washington establishment : argue McCain has the wrong kind of experience and has consistently shown bad judgment .
However , Obama has to be careful not to personally criticize McCain , as this would reduce Obama 's appeal as a different sort of politician and it would feed racism with images of a young black man berating an older white .
Rather than age , Obama must emphasize character .
Someone close to Obama , preferably his choice for Vice President , needs to go after McCain 's character and depict his age as a liability .
These attacks should point out the obvious : McCain deserves the label flip - flopper far more than Obama , as the Arizona Senator has changed his position many more times .
McCain should be called on his both his distortions of Obama 's positions , " whoppers , " and his vapid positions on major issues , " deceptions . "
Thematically , these charges can tie to a simple frame : McCain represents the old politics .
Republicans will continue to circulate false charges against Obama , such as his being a Muslim .
Democrats need to counter with their own attack ads : McCain is unstable ; he has a terrible temper and is an untreated victim of post - traumatic - stress - disorder .
McCain , who married into millions , can be depicted as elite and out - of - touch : he does n't understand that regulating tire pressure improves fuel efficiency because he 's always transported in limousines .
Finally , McCain 's bona fides as a Christian can be questioned .
He 's an unstable deceiver .
Although the main 2008 frame will be age , two others will be used : continuity and scope .
At a subliminal level , McCain is running with the Bush ideology .
While the bulk of his advertisements have been negative , the few positive ads have emphasized neo-conservative themes : stronger military , weaker government , lower taxes , and reduced entitlements .
McCain 's position on Iraq , and on foreign policy in general , is to let the military decide what 's best .
His answer to the budget deficit is to cut governmental services , under the pretense of reducing waste .
His response to rising gasoline prices is to eliminate the gas tax and his response to the recession is to reduce corporate taxes .
The Obama campaign can use McCain 's meager policy offerings as evidence that he represents failed Bush policies and that he 's tired : a 72 - year - old geezer , lacking the energy to respond creatively to America 's challenges .
The final political frame is scope : short - term focus versus long - term vision .
Like most conservatives , McCain 's perspective is inherently tactical .
His position on Iraq is governed solely by security gains attributable to the surge ; he shows no consciousness of the continuing political morass .
In contrast , Obama looks at the total picture and asks what 's in America 's overall security interests .
Looking at rising gasoline prices , McCain sees only the near term  drill everywhere and suspend the gasoline tax ; Obama thinks strategically  we have to reduce our oil dependency and this can help alleviate our financial woes , reduce global warming , and improve America 's competitiveness .
The fact that John McCain has decided to run a negative fear campaign does n't mean that Barack Obama has to stoop to the same level .
But it does suggest the Illinois Senator has to recognize the frames McCain is using and bend them to his own purposes .
Over and over Obama has to sate the obvious : McCain represents the old failed politics of George Bush ; while Obama stands for meaningful change -- he 's not a good old boy .

I did n't have a chance to get to this the other day .
Mukasey is headed for trouble as outlined by Chairman Waxman in this video .
He warns the Attorney General of a Scheduled Contempt Vote over Cheney :
Download Download ( rough transcript )
Waxman ; ... I have tried to investigate what really happened and the White House has resisted oversight every step of the way .
The committee 's inquired has tried to penetrate the cloud surrounding VP Cheney 's conduct .
But today the President has asserted executive privilege and is withholding from the committee and the American people key evidence about the VP Cheney 's actions .
During our investigation we have learned that Mr. Libby told the FBI that it was possible that the Vice President instructed him to leak Miss Wilson 's identity .
That would be an extraordinary breach of trust .
There is a key document that could explain what the VP knew and what he did .
The report of the VP 's interview with officials working from the FBI working for Mr. Fitzgerald .
If there is one document that could pierce the cloud hanging over the VP , that is it .
Mr Mukasey decided that a different rule should apply to Republican Presidents than to Democratic Presidents .
The claim of executive privilege is ludicrous .
The President 's actions have darkened the cloud over the VP and left important questions unanswered .
As the committee considers its next steps , I hope the President and Vice President will also consider theirs .
Congress and the American public are entitled to know what role the President and Vice President in the despicable outing of Miss .
Wilson
AG Janet Reno provided this committee --- the FBI interviews of both President Clinton and VP Gore a decade ago so what 's the deal ?
Waxman is trying to find out what Cheney said to the FBI and is not too happy that Mukasey is blocking access to it .
It sure looked like Scooter Libby was getting ready to hang Cheney out to dry unless Bush stepped in and gave him a get of jail card for free .

Cheney Authorized Leak Of CIA Report , Libby Says
Vice President Dick Cheney directed his then - chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , on July 12 , 2003 to leak to the media portions of a then - highly classified CIA report that Cheney hoped would undermine the credibility of former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson , a critic of the Bush administration 's Iraq policy , according to Libby 's grand jury testimony in the CIA leak case and sources who have read the classified report ... read on
The Gavel : " Chairman Waxman writes Attorney General Mukasey that the Oversight Committee will vote to hold him in contempt unless the Attorney General produces a copy of the report of the FBI interview of Vice President Cheney in the investigation of the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson , a covert CIA agent . "
Here 's the pdf of the letter he wrote Mukasey .
Mr. Fitzgerald removed any doubt about this important point last week .
He wrote the Committee that " there were no agreements , conditions , and understandings between the Office of Special Counsel or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and either the President or Vice President regarding the conduct and use of the interview or interviews . "
This should get real interesting soon .
VANCOUVER - U.S. army deserter Robin Long is slated to be deported back to his army base in Fort Knox , Ky. , today , which would make him the first resister to the U.S. war effort in Iraq to be sent out of Canada .
Madam Justice Anne Mactavish of the Federal Court of Canada cleared the way for the deportation late yesterday , dismissing a last - ditch attempt to delay the process while the 25 - year - old pursued further appeals .
" I was just shocked at some things in [ the ] ruling , " Bob Ages , a spokesman for an informal group called Vancouver War Resisters Support Campaign , told reporters outside the courtroom .
" It just flies in the face of everything that we and every Canadian know about the reality of what is going on . "
Mr. Ages said the court misunderstood the situation facing Mr. Long upon his return .
" I do not think there is any doubt someone being up in Canada , and a vocal opponent to the war , will be treated harshly by the American military ... there is no question he will be court - martialed and will receive severe punishment . "
Mr. Long 's deportation would be a " terrible precedent for Canada , especially given our history of providing sanctuary for war resisters , over 100,000 draft dodgers and deserters during the Vietnam era , " he said earlier to reporters .
" This will be the first time Canada played gendarme to the American military , " Mr. Ages said , appealing to Prime Minister Stephen Harper or Immigration Minister Diane Finley to intervene .
Members of the support group were to meet at the Peace Arch border crossing this morning to protest the deportation .
The war resisters support group is aware of about 50 deserters in Canada , Mr. Ages said , although the group has been told that " hundreds " are living underground in Canada .
Mr. Long , who fled to Ontario in 2005 , had signed up to join the U.S. Army in July , 2003 .
He believed at that time that his country was justified in going to war in Iraq , his lawyer Shepherd Moss said at the court hearing to halt the deportation .
Mr. Long intended to train as a tank commander .
" He wanted to go to defend his country , " Mr. Moss said .
His perspective changed while in training at the army base at Fort Knox .
After hearing that weapons of mass destruction had not been found in Iraq , Mr. Long thought the U.S. had no reason for being at war .
Also , he was troubled by evidence of abuse of Iraqi detainees that came out in May of 2004 , Mr. Moss said .
Mr. Long concluded the abuse was systemic and condoned by the U.S. administration , Mr. Moss said .
After some soul - searching , Mr. Long decided he would not go to Iraq and would not participate or be complicit in what he believed were war crimes , the lawyer said .

Mr. Long fled to Ontario , but moved to B.C. last summer .
He sought to be accepted as a refugee in September , 2006 .
His application for refugee status was denied on Feb. 15 , 2007 .
An application for leave to appeal the decision was turned down .
In a final attempt to stay in Canada , Mr. Long applied yesterday for a stay of the removal order in order to allow him further judicial appeals .
Mr. Long was not in court for the hearing yesterday .
He was in custody at a location outside Vancouver after failing on two previous occasions to report to authorities when he was required .
Caroline Christiaens , a lawyer with the federal Department of Justice , told the court that Mr. Long voluntarily joined the army , was not deployed to Iraq and did not apply to be recognized as a conscientious objector while in the United States .
No evidence was submitted on what Mr. Long would be required to do in Iraq , whether he could have requested an alternative assignment or what would happen if he was sent back to the United States , she said .
If Mr. Long was returned to the United States and prosecuted as a deserter , he would have access to due process in a military court , she added .
Judge Mactavish said Mr. Long had to provide " clear and non-speculative evidence " that he would suffer irreparable harm if he were not allowed to stay longer in Canada .
Mr. Long asserted he would face significant jail time and suffer adverse consequences as a result of a dishonourable discharge from the military .
The vast majority of American deserters have not been prosecuted for desertion , according to evidence before the court , the judge stated in a four - page decision .
Judge Mactavish also stated that Mr. Long did not provide evidence to show he would be singled out for harsh treatment by the U.S. military because of the publicity associated with case .
The United States has a sophisticated military - justice system that respects the rights of service personnel , she said .
The court heard that Mr. Long would likely be returned to his army unit , which would mete out whatever punishment he would receive .
Spokespersons from Citizenship and Immigration Canada did not respond to phone calls late yesterday from The Globe and Mail .

Leaderless Counterterrorism Strategy
The “ War on Terror , ” Civil Liberties , and Flawed Scholarship
By Chip Berlet Chip Berlet is Senior Analyst at Political Research Associates and a member of the PublicEye editorial board .
He is authorwith Matthew N.Lyons of Right - Wing Populism in America : Too Close for Comfort and a frequent contributor to Talk2Action and Huffington Post .
A collection of supporting text , documents , images , and bibliographic citations is online here .
The effectiveness of counterterrorism efforts by the Bush Administration is compromised by flawed analyses based on sloppy scholarship by Marc Sageman and Bruce Hoffman — two leading experts heavily relied on by policymakers .
The resulting programs of government surveillance and computerized data - collection are unnecessarily undermining the civil liberties of millions of Muslims and Arabs living in this country , as well as the rights of all Americans .
Accurate descriptions of targeted terrorist formations and potential terrorists , especially their ideology and methods , are crucial for effective government efforts to understand , predict , and prevent acts of domestic terrorism while abiding by Constitutional safeguards .
This is because police and intelligence agencies embrace different investigative techniques with different levels of government intrusiveness depending on how they perceive the configurations of potential terrorist cells and movements .
Sageman and Hoffman are currently embroiled in a well publicized dispute over whether future acts of domestic terrorism by Islamic militants , such as those carried out on September 11th , will be generated by the international Qaeda net­work ( Hoffman ) or homegrown terrorism planned by Muslims living in the United States ( Sageman ) .
The dispute gained public attention when Hoffman negatively reviewed Sageman ’s recent book , Leaderless Jihad : Terror Networks in the Twenty First Century , in the prestigious journal Foreign Affairs .
Hoffman ’s book Inside Terrorism was published in 1998 and revised and expanded in 2006 .
Hoffman complained that Sageman ’s bookwas a “ brusque dismissal of much of the existing academic literature on terrorism in general and terrorist net­works in particular , ” and “ employs historically groundless parallels . ”
Sageman responded in a following issue .
The debate then was covered in the New York Times and other publications .
Both Sageman ’s and Hoffman ’s books examine how social movements are built , how terrorism is justified within small groups , and how people in activist underground cells can reinforce a decision that vio­lence or terrorism is justified and necessary .
Critical praise for Sageman ’s Leaderless Jihad as groundbreaking and innovative seems to be inversely proportional to the reviewer ’s knowledge of social movement theories developed over the past thirty years .
Behind the scenes , Hoffman ’s analysis is favored by many analysts inside the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies , while the work of Sageman and other researchers affiliated with the New York Police Department is favored by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , chaired by Joe Lieberman , the Connecticut Independent .
Lieberman is a supporter of Republican Presidential - hopeful John McCain and has launched a cam­paign to pressure the federal government to adopt a more hard - line policy toward the threat of domestic terrorism .
Not coincidently , this helps McCain and applies pressure on Democratic Presidential hopeful Barack Obama to move to the political right on this and related issues such as U.S. pol­icy in the Mideast .
It also feeds a wave of Islamophobia sweeping the country .
A central aspect of the analyses by Sage - man and Hoffman involves examining the intersection of religiously motivated violence , insurgent right - wing movements in the United States , and an underground cell structure called “ Leaderless Resistance . ”
Yet their research into this area is woefully inadequate and at times simply not accurate .
They also fail to adequately distinguish between radical ideas and violent methods , which raises serious First Amendment issues .
In fairness to Hoffman , the flaws in his book are confined to one area of analy¬sis , while Sageman ’s Leaderless Jihad lacks the citations generally considered appropriate in scholarly work , and in two instances constitute intellectual plagiarism .
A growing environment of flawed and superficial research has created a series of problems for public policy analysts studying terrorism , including : Pointless polarization of debate into two camps when there are numerous other valid analytical interpretations
Failure to adequately distinguish radical ideologies from violent methods
Flawed and sometimes woefully inaccurate information about right - wing violence in the United States
Misreading of the concept of “ Leaderless Resistance ”
Misapplication of contemporary social movement theories , and superficial analysis of the role of religion in political struggles and violence .
NEW - The “ War on Terror , ” Civil Liberties , and Flawed Scholarship A collection of online resources for the " Leaderless Counterterrorism Strategy " article in the Public Eye magazine Marc Sageman and Bruce Hoffman are two leading counterterrorism experts embroiled in a titillating public dispute .
But what about the intrusive and sweeping government investigative techniques justified by their flawed analyses about " leaderless " cells threatening America ?
And how does this play out with the NYPD using Sageman 's work in advising police on security for the national political conventions in Denver and Minneapolis ?

Marc Sageman Marc Sageman ’s first book , Understanding Terror Networks , published in 2004 , was full of accurate and nuanced analyses of the role of social movement dynamics in the creation ofterror cells , especially among Muslim émigrés .
Sageman is a sociologist and psychiatrist who in 1984 joined the Central Intelligence Agency , working on the Afghan Task Force for a year before spending 1987 to 1989 in Islamabad coordinating support for the Afghan Mujahedin .
Sageman left the CIA in 1991 .

Sageman currently is a senior fellow at the Center on Terrorism , Counter - Terrorism , and Homeland Security of the Foreign Policy Research Institute , and a senior associate of the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Sageman has guided the anti-terrorism policies of the NYPD for several years , and in July 2008 was named the Police Department ’s “ Scholar - in - Residence . ”
The Foreign Policy Research Institute ( FPRI ) and the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) are centers of right - wing militarist analysis , with FPRI representing old hardline conservative militarists and CSIS allied with the militarists of the neoconservative movement .
Both sectors of the Right are in a coalition backing aggressive U.S. foreign policy in the Mideast by the Bush Administration a coalition that is sometimes at odds with more pragmatic and diplomacy - oriented forces in the State Department , Central Intelligence Agency , and Department of Homeland Security .
Bruce Hoffman Bruce Hoffman has more mainstream credentials .
Between 2004 and 2006 Hoff man was the Scholar - in - Residence for Counterterrorism at the Central Intelligence Agency .
Hoffman has held the Corporate Chair in Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency at the RAND Corporation , and served in 2004 as Acting Director of RAND ’s Center for Middle East Public Policy .
During the period Hoffman was at RAND , his colleagues John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt originated and developed an analysis of what they called “ Netwar , ” which overlaps with and complements the concept of Leaderless Resistance .
Hoffman is currently a professor at Georgetown University in Washington , D.C. , affiliated with the Security Studies Program at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service .
Terrorism , Religion , & Violence G iven the role ofreligious and secular ideological beliefs in acts ofviolence and terrorism during the past twenty years , a thorough public debate over scholarly theories and public policy assessments is needed to ensure public safetywhile protecting civil liberties .
A central question in this regard is the role of the concept of Leaderless Resistance in assisting right - wing insurgency , violence , and terrorism , such as the rightist bombing ofthe federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 .
Does Leaderless Resistance lead to Leaderless Jihad ?
The terms “ Leaderless Resistance ” and “ phantom cells ” refer to spontaneous , autonomous , unconnected underground cells organized by insurgents seeking to carry out acts ofviolence , sabotage , or terrorism against a government or occupying military force .
As scholar Simson L. Garfinkel points out , the term is sometimes used too loosely “ to refer to networked organizations with hub - and - spoke architecture .
Such terminology is incorrect . ” 1 Garfinkel , author of Database Nation , wrote one of the first major studies of Leaderless Resistance in 2003 , and is now an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School .
Garfinkel argues that Leaderless Resistance “ applies specifically to groups that employ cells and that lack bidirectional vertical command links — that is , groups without leaders .
” 2 Leaderless resistance is widely discussed among U.S. right - wing insurgents , many with ties to militant religious ideologies , and this form of underground cell struc¬ture is frequently discussed among gov¬ernment analysts and policymakers investigating ways to combat domestic terrorism .
Like many other scholars and journalists , neither Sageman nor Hoffman conveys an accurate picture of the history of Leaderless Resistance .
The concept of Leaderless Resistance as a series of unconnected autonomous underground cells was developed by anticommunist theoretician Ulius Louis Amoss in 1953 to encourage resistance to Soviet repression in Eastern Europe .
“ Pete ” Amoss worked for the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) during World War II , which later was reorganized in the postwar period as the Central Intelligence Agency .
Amoss , who had established a private group called International Services of Information ( INFORM ) , warned that traditional hier¬archical underground cells organized by the CIA in Eastern Europe were being penetrated and liquidated by Soviet and Eastern Bloc counterintelligence operations .
In 1961 , anti-Castro Cuban exiles and their allies with close ties to the CIA airdropped leaflets over Cuba .
The leaflets used the concept of Leaderless Resistance and called for the creation of “ phantom cells ” ( celulasfantasmas ) .
There is no apparent connection between Amoss and the leaflets , according to Michael Paulding , who is writing a book on an early OSS figure and has studied Amoss and his work .
Amoss died in November 1961 , a few months after the failed CIA - orchestrated Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba .
Amoss ’s Leaderless Resistance essay was republished posthumously in 1962 in Amoss ’s INFORM newsletter , having been rewritten from the 1953 original by a freelancer , according to Paulding .
The term was repopularized in 1983 by racist organizer Louis Beam in a very dif¬ferent essay that borrowed the title and concept of “ Leaderless Resistance . ”
This essay was reprinted by Beam in 1992.3
In both versions , Beam credits the original idea to Amoss .
Beam is a White supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader tied to neonazi and race hate organizing in the United States .
Sageman and Hoffman both mistakenly suggest that White supremacists originated the idea — Sageman blames Beam , and Hoffman traces it to the White supremacist adventure novel Hunter , William Pierce ’s sequel to The Turner Diaries — before weaving it into claims about the terrorist threat posed by White supremacist insurgents in the United States .
4 Sageman claims that Louis Beam devel¬oped the theory ofLeaderless Resistance “ to continue the right - wing militias fight against the U.S. government . ”
Beam played a role in the development of the militia movement in the early 1990s , but certainly did not develop the concept of Leaderless Resistance for the militias when he wrote the essay in 1983 .
The militias overlapped with the organized White supremacist movement , but according to most scholars , was distinct and independent from it .

Accurate descriptions of target terrorist formations and potential terrorist cells are crucial for stopping actual acts of terrorism .
Hoffman offers no credible evidence that the idea ’s “ impact on the militia movement has been profound . ”
Hoffman is wrong when he asserts Beam ’s version of Leaderless Resistance ( 1983 ) was based on the novel Hunter , which was published in 1989 .
Furthermore , Hunter is primarily about a lone wolf terrorist , although small cells are also mentioned .
This is not just semantics .
Are acts of violence and terrorism in the United States being carried out by right - wing insurgents engaged in “ Leaderless Resistance ? ”
There is little evidence to support this widespread fear .
According to Garfinkel , the clearest examples of Leaderless Resistance in the United States are in the ecological group Earth First ! and several Animal Liberation movements — movements that generally avoid harming people with their acts of vandalism .
Small splinter groups have recently engaged in intimidation against people , but while this is evidence of criminal acts , it does not fit traditional definitions of terrorism .
Almost all incidents reported as examples of Leaderless Resistance by White supremacists in the United States actually appear to have involved small groups of persons with previous ties to other groups promoting armed resistance or violent methodology .
This is not Leaderless Resistance .
There have been examples of “ lone wolf ” terrorism , where individuals act on their own , but these incidents mostly appear to involve persons who were at least briefly involved with existing groups advocating armed resistance or violence .
This is not Leaderless Resistance .
There are a handful of incidents where a debatable argument can be made for Leaderless Resistance cell structure being used by the White supremacist movement , but even these offer dubious lessons for U.S. counterterrorism policy relating to isolated Muslims and Arabs living in the United States .
For example , Timothy McVeigh , who blew up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 , was thoroughly embedded in the Armed Citizens Militia movement for years , but had adopted a neonazi ideology before turning to the methodology of terrorism assisted by a small group of cohorts .
The most plausible explanation for motive was McVeigh ’s anger at the federal government for domestic policies involving what he saw as tyranny and government political repression .
Antiterrorism “ experts ” originally wrongly blamed the blast on Middle Eastern terrorists angry at U.S. foreign policies .
For counterterrorism , the distinction between connected cells , unconnected cells , and a lone wolf activist unconnected to previous group participation is important because different investigative techniques with different levels of government intrusiveness are required depending on the type of target .
Therefore accurate descriptions of target terrorist formations and potential terrorist cells are crucial for stopping actual acts of terrorism .
Sageman writes that :
The leaderless social movement has other limitations .
To survive , it requires a constant stream of new violent actions to hold the interest of potential newcomers to the movement , create the impression of visible progress toward a goal , and give potential recruits a vicarious experience before they take the initiative to engage in their own terrorist activities .
If this is true , I should be able to locate a list of terrorist bombings of U.S. steak ¬houses by vegetarians .
The Internet has helped create and extend numerous leaderless social movements , the vast majority of which have not engaged in violence of any kind , much less terrorism .
Actually , Sageman has borrowed this idea and plagiarized some specific wording from Garfinkel , who wrote in 2003 : Causes that employ Leaderless Resistance do not have these links because they are not organizations :
They are ideologies .
To survive , these ideologies require a constant stream of new violent actions to hold the interest of the adherents , create the impression ofvisible progress towards a goal , and allow individuals to take part in actions vicariously before they have the initiative to engage in their own direct actions .
Garfinkel , however , is defining Leaderless Resistance as specifically referring to “ a strategy in which small groups ( cells ) and individuals fight an entrenched power through independent acts ofviolence and mayhem . ”
This accurately refers to Beam ’s thesis , not generally to all social movements that are “ leaderless ” but not engaged in acts of “ resistance ” in Sageman ’s overbroad derivation .
The Public Eye asked the University of Pennsylvania Press and Marc Sageman to respond to the issue of text lifted from Richard Hofstadter and Simson Garfinkel .
This is the response from Sageman we received by press time : I did read Garfinkel ’s online article .
It was good , but had some flaws .
One of them was the quote he referred to .
Garfinkel refers to an idea .
Ideas do not have any power by themselves .
Ideas did not fly into the twin towers , people did .
I refer to behavior , and use the Skinnerian idea that reinforced behavior is likely to flourish , while lack of reward will extinguish it .
To continue a behavior forever , one needs a randomreinforcement schedule .
If this is plagiarism , so is Garfinkel ‘s claim .
This is one of the basic ideas of behaviorism , and people are free to use them at will .
Each time we see the sun move in the sky , we do not refer to either Ptolemy or Copernicus .
– MARC SAGEMAN
If we understand domestic terrorist ten¬dencies as more properly modeled as an outside contagion , rather than as something spontaneously generated , then it would be more proper to monitor known terrorists , rather than conducting sweeps of all potential terrorists .
Ironically , these techniques are similar to those advocated by Marc Sageman in his first book .
Yet government agencies are reportedly analyzing secret intelligence data scanning for networks , patterns of interaction , etc. in a search for different kinds of underground terrorist cells .
Tracking an actual “ Leaderless Resistance ” cell that is truly spontaneous , autonomous , and unconnected requires an intrusive penetration of a larger community in which these cells achieve some level of anonymity .
Everyone in the community would be suspect until their innocence had been proven .
In other words , how police believe terrorists are organizing affects their counterterrorism tactics .
Garfinkel in 2003 observed that : The U.S. appears to be fighting Leaderless Resistance networks ... with an eradication strategy based on crime - fighting : the goal is to create very high penalties for individuals who participate in direct action .
The danger of this approach is that the eradication effort itself may inad¬vertently serve to attract new recruits to a violent ideology , by making the cause appear a just response to an unjust enemy .
Religious Motivations for Violence Figiously justified violence is at the re of much terrorism carried out in the name of Islam , but neither Hoffman nor Sageman have a firm grasp on the intricacies and nuances of current social science that studies the phenomenon among the Christian Right in the United States ( see sidebar on Hoffman ) .
Hoffman ’s inability to detect the factors making the militia movement distinct from neonazi terrorists is especially troubling in terms of civil liberties because Hoffman exaggerates the role of terrorism in the militias .
Militias are a subset of the broader Patriot Movement , as are the Christian Patriots , which overlap with both the militias and the White supremacist movement .
The White supremacist movement has more of a history ofviolence and terrorism , but with the exception of those eras when the Ku Klux Klan had a mass following , the violence has been carried out by a tiny armed underground linked to the larger social movement .
Sageman tends to dismiss the role of religion in motivating political violence because the terrorists he studied are in his appraisal not religious scholars nor devout .
6
But neither factor is needed for religious belief to be a powerful motivator for a social movement activist to turn to violence in the name of religion .
Among the schol¬ars who have discussed the role of religion in terrorism are Jessica Stern ( Terror in the Name ofGod : Why Religious Militants Kill ) and Mark Juergensmeyer ( Terror in the Mind of God : The Global Rise ofReligious Violence ) .
Sageman ’s claims are a refutation of these works without a detailed discussion of them .
HOFFMAN ’S SLIPS Given Hoffman ’s harsh criticism of Sageman , one would hope that Hoffman ’s own work would stand up to careful scrutiny .
It most areas it does , but not in terms of Hoffman ’s research into the concept of Leaderless Resistance , the history of right - wing insurgent vio¬lence in the United States , or Christian apocalyptic beliefs .
It is this last area where Hoffman seems most confused .
According to Hoffman : Beliefs involving the inevitability of Armageddon are actively encouraged by proselytizers of Dominion theology , the most recent reinterpretation of Christian Identity doctrine circulating among the Christian Patriots .
This statement is just plain wrong .
Beliefs about the “ inevitability of Armageddon ” are spread across Christian evangelical¬ism and are embraced by tens of millions of Americans , most of whom have never been part of the Christian Patriot movement .
Christian Identity , a White racist antisemitic theology , predates Dominion Theology , a term used to refer to either :
• the doctrinaire form of Christian theocracy promoted by the Christian Reconstructionist movement , or
• a tendency among conservative Christian political activists to dominate the electoral system ( usually dubbed Dominionism ) .
In neither case is Dominion Theology a “ recent reinterpretation of Christian Identity doctrine . ”
The rest of the paragraph is a similar mélange of ahistorical data and misused terminology .
While Christian Identity and Reconstructionist Dominion Theology are both apocalyptic in the sense of contemplating the arrival of the prophetic millennial End Times , Identity is premillennial ( which has Christ returning prior to a 1000 - year millennial reign by believers ) while Reconstructionism is postmillennial ( which has Christ returning at the end of a mil­lennium of rule by the Godly ) .
These are important distinctions in Christian theology — and also in predicting how violence or terrorism might emerge from these different theological beliefs .
Premillennial apocalyptic expectation is the core of the White supremacist theology of Christian Identity , but it is also central to the religious beliefs of millions of Protestant evan­gelicals who would be horrified by Christian Identity claims that Blacks are subhuman and Jews are either agents of Satan or his direct descendants .
Hoffman writes that “ in addition to anti-Semitism and racism , Dominionists believe that it is incumbent upon each individual to hasten redemption by actively working to ensure the return of the Messiah , ” Here Hoffman is lumping together millions of politically active evangelicals with racists and antisemites .
In addition , most premillennialist evangelicals are not accurately characterized as Dominionists .
Although Hoffman ’s section on U.S. right - wing terrorism and the role of Christian theology is weak and confused , the other material in Hoffman ’s chapter on “ Religion and Terrorism ” on Islam and other belief systems and cults is more persuasive and well cited , as is the rest of his book .
Not so Sage Scholarship Sageman cites few scholars , which could lead the reader to believe he is a kind of “ leaderless scholar ” whose work in unconnected to that of other social scientists .
As with Sageman ’s exaggeration of Leaderless Resistance as a mode of terrorist organization , the truth is much less spectacular .
Much of Leaderless Jihad draws from sociologists and anthropologists and other scholars who study collective behavior , social movements , organized supremacist groups , religious theology , millenarianism , apocalypticism , and political violence .
Almost none of this work over the past twenty years is cited by Sageman .
Yet Sageman was recently featured in a major profile in the newsletter of the American Sociological Association ... which he wrote himself .
Sageman ’s lack of citations is more than a problem of attribution because it does not allow other researchers to trace the documentation for his numerous uncited claims nor make his readers confident that he is engaging with whole swatches of recent social science research .
This is a serious problem for someone whose work is influencing government policies .
Critical praise for Sageman ’s Leaderless Jihad as groundbreaking and innovative seems to be inversely proportional to the reviewer ’s knowledge of social movement theories developed over the past thirty years .
For instance , Sageman ’s discussion of conspiracism is underdeveloped .
7
He provides no cites to the standard works in the field , which in recent years has explored the role of conspiracy theories in generating narrative stories that can justify the use of scapegoating and violence .
Most egregious is the following : A global conspiracy theory is different .
It is comprehensive in nature and points to the existence of a vast , insidious , and effective international network designed to perpetrate acts of the most evil sort .
This seems quite perceptive , as it should , since the sentence is lifted virtually intact from an early passage and central thesis of Richard Hofstadter ’s classic work , The Paranoid Style in American Politics .
Hoffman notes that in Sageman ’s book “ the reader is told that ‘ until recently , a large part of the literature on terrorism concentrated on definitions of terrorism ’— with the citation justifying this fatuous assertion referencing a book published in 1984 . ”
Sageman ’s explanation ofhow individuals are recruited into dissident social networks and social movements is well - rounded , yet fails to cite the standard sociological works in which those concepts were developed .
8
Is this just scholarly semantic duels and pointless academic nitpicking ?
Sageman discusses “ heroic sacrifice , ” “ martyrdom , ” “ absolute evil , ” and the cre¬ation of a “ personified villain .
” 9
Yet read¬ers might be interested in knowing the underlying scholarly studies that look at dualism , scapegoating , demonization , apocalypticism , millenarianism , and the sacralization of politics . ( I ’ve posted a remedial bibliography online at http//www.publiceye.org/jump/leaderless.html).
Sageman dismisses scholarship on totalitarianism and totalist groups as the “ myth ” of “ brainwashing , ” ignoring the scholarly work of Robert J. Lifton , Charles Strozier , and others on the role of totalist systems in shaping a belief justifying violence and terrorism .
10 Since the 1990s there has been a resurgence of scholarly interest in totalitarian groups , and there is even a scholarly journal of Totalitarian Movements and PoliticalReligionswith articles detailing the relationship to terrorism .
11
In his scathing review ofSageman ’s LeaderlessJihad , Hoffman offers a list of authors who have done significant work in computerized analysis of terrorist groups , and then notes that “ No references to any of these authors of standard studies are found in Leaderless Jihad ’s citations .
” 12 Hoffman puts it bluntly : “ Sageman ’s historical ignorance is surpassed only by his cursory treat¬ment of social networking theory . ”
Sageman describes social movements as not being affiliated with institutions , but there are numerous different types of social movements , many of which interact with institutions or create their own .
Sageman contradicts much social movement scholarship when he claims that social movements “ do not have a formal structure ... [ and ] do not have members but participants . ”
13 Most sociologists rec¬ognize that some social movements have no membership requirements , but many have formal members who often pay dues or agree to at least “ principles of unity . ”
Understanding the ideology , frames , narratives , and recruitment methods of a social movement is important for law enforcement officers concerned about potentially illegal acts yet attempting to work within the legal boundaries set by the First Amendment .
By blurring the distinction between ordinary social movements , gangs , and violent terrorist cells , Sageman provides a justification for federal policy - makers who want to loosen restrictions of the surveillance of political dissidents .
Policy and Civil Liberties Sageman ’s views have been popularized and distorted , most recently by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
It has been holding hearings on Islamic Terrorism for the past year .
In Sageman ’s June 2007 testimony , he declared : “... we must analyze the process transforming normal young Muslims into people willing to use violence for political ends .
The understanding of this process of ‘ rad¬icalization ’ is critical to assessing the threat facing the West and should be the basis guiding our interventions to counter it .... [ T ] hese new groups are physically isolated but connected through Internet forums , inspired by the extremist ideology and hoping that they will be accepted as members of al Qaeda through their terrorist operations .
On May 8 , 2008 a report emerged from the Committee ’s office .
Titled Violent Islamist Extremism , the Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorism
Threat , the report did not represent the views of the entire committee , many of whom were not even aware of the report until after it was issued .
It was primarily prepared by Lieberman ’s staff , and published under his name and that of Republican Susan Collins ofMaine , the ranking minority member of the committee .
The Lieberman / Collins report picked up on Sageman ’s concerns about the Internet , but amplified them into a set of hyperbolic warnings that stereotyped Muslims and fed Islamophobia .
According to the Muslim Advocates , Muslim Public Affairs Council , Council on American Islamic Relations , and the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee :
The report heavily relied upon a widely criticized and deeply flawed New York Police Department study on domestic radicalization that claimed that typical “ signatures ” of radicalization include wearing traditional clothing , growing a beard , or giving up cigarettes , drinking , and gambling .
The advocacy groups also expressed dismay with the fact that the Committee , while citing the value of increasing outreach to American Muslim and Arab - American communities , heard testimony from only one witness from the American Muslim community .
14 A letter signed by over 20 groups warned that : Focusing the discussion of homegrown terrorism on Muslims may actually increase the potential for violent radicalization in the United States .
Many witnesses before the Committee spoke of the growth of Islamophobia and the polarization of the Muslim community as risk factors that raise the potential for extremist violence .
Unfairly focusing suspicion on a community tends to create the very alienation these witnesses said could lead to homegrown terrorism .
15 Ironically , while the Senate committee channeled a distorted version of Sageman ’s work on the Internet in its report , it overlooked some worthwhile recommendations at the end of his recent book .
They include : The United States should reduce the sense of “ moral outrage ” among Muslims by “ withdrawing from Iraq , ” and on the local level showing “ restraint in the aftermath of terrorism operations . ”
Western countries “ should regain the moral high ground and condemn any atrocity or persecution committed by any government , including some of our staunchest allies in the Middle East , often in the name of the ‘ war on terror . ’ ”
• Individuals arrested on suspicion of being terrorists “ are entitled to due process and the impartial application of justice in order to win over the worldwide Muslim community and refute claims that Muslims are treated unfairly . ”
Conclusions Public attention to the dispute between Hoffman and Sageman has focused on who is right orwhether they ’re both partially right — but this is the wrong lesson to take from the debate .
The problem is that they ’re both substantially wrong in ways that jeopardize our safety and our civil liberties .
Flaws and errors in both Sageman ’s and Hoffman ’s analyses are making suspects out of millions of U.S. citizens and noncitizen residents , and justifying increased domestic surveillance on a scale that could dwarf the now million - name - long “ watch list ” for airline passengers .
Furthermore , in some cases there are other antiterrorism policy advisors who are using a superficial read¬ing of Leaderless Resistance , while ignoring some of Sageman ’s more sensible recommendations in his final chapter .
This is what is feeding Senator Lieberman ’s recent overwrought efforts .
The public dispute between Hoffman and Sageman needs to be widened to include a broader discussion of the U.S. “ War on Terror . ”
While public policy attention over the past few years has focused on the polarized positions of Sageman and Hoffman , a broad range of differing ( and often more complex and nuanced ) analyses from a number of scholars is being overlooked by the White House and Congress .
Here I ’m thinking of Jessica Stern , and Fawaz A. Gerges , author of The Far Enemy : Why Jihad Went Global , to name only two .
The work of Hoffman and Sageman also must be closely analyzed and critiqued by social scientists who study religion , violence , state repression , social movements , and collective behavior .
And Sageman needs to be held accountable for his lack of citations .
Is this just scholarly semantic duels and pointless academic nitpicking ?
No .
By failing to fully explore a range of social science research , policymakers are doomed to commit analytical or conceptual errors .
An accurate understanding of social movement boundaries helps predict potential violence within some social movements , while accurately assessing others as simply exercising First Amendment rights .
The level of surveillance and infiltration by government agencies is supposed to be regulated by these considerations .
Drawing distinctions between radical ideology and violent methodology is at the heart of the First Amendment .
In the United States , stopping ideological radicalization is not a job for government agencies .
Antiterrorism policy and civil liberties deeply affects us all — we deserve better .

Ian Clifford wants to start a global revolution by building a practical , everyday car with no gasoline engine , no batteries , and no emissions .
While big Detroit automakers ponder a future plug - in car that goes 40 miles on a battery charge before its gas engine kicks in , Mr. Clifford 's tiny ZENN Motor , a Toronto maker of low - speed electric cars , announced in March that it will build a new highway - speed ( 80 m.p.h. ) model that goes 250 miles on a charge – and can recharge in just five minutes .
Having no batteries , the new " cityZENN " model will use a breakthrough version of a common electrical storage device called an ultracapacitor to store power from a wall socket , the company says .
Fuel costs to operate it would be about one - tenth of today 's gas - powered vehicle .
If that astounding claim is real ( and there are many skeptics ) , it could revolutionize automotive travel by making all - electric cars competitive with gas - powered vehicles and easing the world 's dependence on oil .
" The big problem has always been the battery and its limits , " says Clifford , ZENN 's founder and CEO in a phone interview .
" This new technology is a 180 - degree shift that represents the end of fossil fuel as a transportation fuel . "
That 's because the same ultracapacitor technology could be used across the grid to provide cheap electric storage for wind and solar power , he says .
In turn , this process could power millions of ultracapacitor vehicles with no emissions at all .
With the cars ' fast - charge capability , recharging stations could pop up to help make even longer trips routine .
Ultracapacitors – also called supercapacitors – are more powerful cousins of the basic capacitor .
With activated carbon at their core to act as a sponge for electrons , ultracapacitors can absorb power – or send a charge – far faster than batteries .
They are also far more durable .
First used in the 1960s , ultracapacitors today are widely found in electronic devices such as computers .
In cameras , they retract and expand zoom lens .
Yet the power stored by today 's ultracapacitors is still only about 5 percent as much as a modern lithium - ion battery , far too little to power a car by themselves .
The reported breakthrough was made by ZENN 's business partner EEStor , a Cedar Park , Texas , firm headed by respected computer industry veteran Richard Weir , who 's named on the company 's patent .
The company is now nearing commercial production of its new " electrical energy storage unit " or EESU , Clifford says .
But privately held EEStor has had little to say publicly or to the press – and that secretiveness has inspired incredulity among many debating the topic on Internet forums .
But in a break with that tradition , Tom Weir , the company 's vice president and general manager , responded to e-mailed questions .
" EEStor 's technology has the opportunity to touch every aspect of daily life from very big to very small devices , " Mr. Weir writes .
" We also see a whole new generation of products ... based around our technology . "
Added credibility arrived with the January announcement by Lockheed Martin , the big defense company , of an agreement to use EEStor technology for military and homeland security applications .
It refers to the EEStor " ceramic battery " providing " 10 times the energy density of lead - acid batteries at 1/10th the weight and volume . "
In 2005 , Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sunk $ 3 million into EEStor .
ZENN also invested $ 3 million and will get exclusive rights to retrofit vehicles with the system – and produce new mid-size cars using EESUs .
According to EEStor 's patent application , the breakthrough is based on a technically arduous process of purifying and fabricating units with barium titanate , a material known to retain vast amounts of power .
" The main feature of the EESU is the charge and dis - charge at electric speed , " Weir writes .
" This is a key enabling factor for the advancement of the next generation of vehicles .
Another feature is the amount of power the EESU can store .
Lastly , the EESU is expected to be considered fully ' green . ' "
But some bloggers call the purported breakthrough pure hype , today 's version of " cold fusion , " the still - theoretical energy source announced in 1989 .
At least some analysts and researchers , though skeptical , seem reluctant to dismiss entirely the possibility that EEStor could be onto something significant .
" I 'm sure they do have a technology , but skepticism revolves around the fact that nobody knows much about it , " says Anu Cherian , an analyst who tracks the $ 100 million global ultracapacitor market for Frost & Sullivan , a growth consulting company .
" The ZENN car looks to be an exciting development .
But there 's a lot of hype in the market . "
Other ultracapacitor experts wo n't dismiss EEStor 's claim despite technical challenges .
" It would be unfair to make an analogy between what EEStor is doing and cold fusion , " says Joel Schindall , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who is using nanotechnology to improve ultracapacitors .
" I do n't doubt that they have built a device on a small scale that does store the amounts of energy they are talking about .
I just do n't know if they can manage the process of scaling it up ... for commercial applications . "
Dr. Schindall and his colleagues hope soon to demonstrate a fivefold boost in ultracapacitor energy storage to up to 25 percent of the energy storage capacity of a lithium battery – and someday up to 50 percent – using a different approach to the problem .
Such significant advances would make ultracapacitors viable in vehicles , though they still fall far short of Clifford 's claims about EESU .
Making commercial quantities of EESUs could prove challenging since even tiny impurities and defects in manufacturing could result in " a violent discharge , " Schindall notes .
Safety is a huge issue for energy storage in vehicles whether powered by gasoline , ethanol , hydrogen , batteries – or ultracapacitors .
High - capacity lithium - ion battery research for cars , for instance , is focused on ensuring those devices do n't burst into flames .
EEStor has ensured that its new ultracapacitor will be safe if damaged in a crash by " instantly discharging to ground , " Clifford says .
Skeptics do n't bother him , he says , because " we 've seen this product with our own eyes . "
" We 've had a great 100 - year run with petroleum , " Clifford says .
" But the time has come for all of us to come to our senses now and realize that the electric - powered era for cars has finally arrived . "
Comments from EEStor
Much of the rampant skepticism on the Internet over whether or not EEStor has had a breakthrough in automotive propulsion stems from the company 's reticence to speak or to demonstrate its product publicly .
Only a handful of press releases have been issued since the company was formed , and press reports have rarely included any direct quotes from company managers .
Below are comments from a Monitor e-mail interview with Tom Weir , vice president and general manager , EEStor , Inc .
Can you offer an idea of what your product could do for automotive transportation and a time horizon for development ?
" We see our Electrical Energy Storage Unit , ' EESU , ' enabling the next generation of electric vehicles .
The main feature of the EESU is [ its ability to ] charge and dis - charge at electric speed .
This is a key enabling factor for the advancement of the next generation of vehicles .
Another feature is the amount of power the EESU can store .
Lastly , the EESU is expected to be considered fully ' green . ' "
Some have suggested that ultracapacitors will play more of a supporting role – others that it's a " game changer , " or even world changing .
How would you describe the potential ?
" EEStor 's technology has the opportunity to touch every aspect of daily life from very big to very small devices .
We also see a whole new generation of products and services that [ are ] based around our technology . "
How would you characterize EEStor 's contribution to developing new systems to transmit the energy for automotive propulsion ?
" No comment . "
EEStor has announced passing an evaluation on purity of its production process .
Explain why this is important .
" To be discussed in the near future . "
Why has EEStor been so quiet , some say secretive , about what it is doing ?
" We talk about our achievements through press releases .
We talk with our current customers almost daily .
We will also talk about more things when the time is right . "
Do you see any show stoppers , or is it just a matter of ramping up ?
" With any start - up you have some speed bumps that come up from time to time .
We have no show stoppers . "
Competitors rev their engines
At the North American International Auto Show in January , AFS Trinity created a stir by strutting its " extreme hybrid " plug - in concept vehicle that uses ultracapacitors to boost battery life and get 150 miles per gallon .
The Bellevue , Wash .- based company sees ultracapacitors as a natural fit with new generation lithium - ion batteries that are vital to plug - in hybrids .
Company chairman Edward Furia compares batteries to a long - distance runner ( providing the stamina a car needs over the long haul ) while ultracapacitors are akin to a weight lifter – giving cars that 0 - to - 60 oomph while minimizing impact on the delicate battery .
As oil prices rise , new ultracapacitor research has emerged .
Companies like Maxwell Technologies , Panasonic , Nippon Chemi-Con , and others are working on advanced devices with attributes of both an ultracapacitor and a battery , according to a November report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) .
But the recent focus is only a continuation of a long - term fascination with ultracapacitors in automobiles .
A small fleet of ultracapacitor - powered buses began running in Moscow in 1995 , and some garbage trucks in the US now use ultracapacitors to efficiently absorb energy from braking – and discharge it for acceleration , the IEEE article notes .
Honda 's Dualnote concept car in 2002 also showed off ultracapacitors ' ability to instantly absorb braking energy and then return it in acceleration .
German automaker BMW is also said to be evaluating ultracapacitors in their hybrid vehicles .
The wraparound jacket band on the 20th volume of Hiromu Arakawa 's Fullmetal Alchemist manga will confirm on Friday that a new television anime series is in the works .
A new anime series was a topic of much fan discussion for several months , but it was thrust into a more public spotlight last month when a management document was purportedly leaked from the BONES anime studio .
The document listed Fullmetal Alchemist animator Yasuhiro Irie as " Hagane 2 kantoku " ( Iron / Fullmetal 2 director ) .
After the purported leak , BONES President Masahiko Minami posted an official statement that said that no file with this same formatted information existed within the company .
When asked about the possibility of a sequel to Fullmetal Alchemist or Darker than BLACK ( another BONES anime ) , Minami told ANN , " It has n't been decided yet .
We are interested in doing them .
As original science - fiction works , they were extremely fascinating .
With these kinds of dramatic story lines , I feel that there 's a lot we could do potentially . "
Viz Media will publish the 17th volume of the manga version in North America this October , while Funimation Entertainment released both the first television series and its theatrical movie finale .

( Un ) Settled Science - Hole in the AGWzone Layer !
by James P. Hogan January 14 , 2010
When beliefs that are normally regarded as the province of science become subject to an ideology that decides in advance what answers are required and censors the evidence in ways that steer beliefs toward them , then , regardless of what incidental use might be made of computers , satellites , and other kinds of advanced engineering and technology , what 's going on is n't science .
But most of the world has never learned to tell the difference – or maybe cared that much .
And that 's serious in a society where scientists have come to occupy the position previously enjoyed by the high priesthood , of being revered as the source of true knowledge and providing the justifications for the policies that the governing authority pursues .
The danger is that pronouncements made in the name of science will continue to be unquestioned and used as pretexts for controversial or oppressive rulings long after any grounds on a scientific basis have ceased to exist .
I 'm writing this at Christmas time , 2009 .
We 've just witnessed a circus of deception and foolishness in Copenhagen that marks a new high in the attempted foisting of a politically motivated ideology upon the world in the guise of bogus science .
Fortunately – for the time being at any rate – the canniness of the developing nations in demanding that the supposedly rational West literally put its money where its mouth was by playing out a lemming - like stampede to economic self - destruction brought home the absurdity to a degree that even our scientifically clueless best and brightest could n't buy , and the whole thing largely came to nothing .
Claims that human activity was – or was even capable of – measurably affecting the Earth 's climate made little sense to begin with .
For as far back as patterns can be reconstructed , the climate has always cycled between being warmer or cooler , wetter or drier , stormy or settled , and the changes observed during the industrial era have been well inside the swings that have taken place in the past .
So there 's no reason to suppose that anything , human - induced or otherwise , is affecting the climate abnormally .
Compared to water vapor and the activity of the Sun , carbon dioxide plays a minor role in determining temperature , and the amount generated by Nature dwarfs anything that humans add .
In any case , the times of rising temperature recorded over the ages have all happened first , not the other way around , so increases in CO 2 levels are a consequence not a cause .
And even if humans were having the influence that has been claimed , the results would be overwhelmingly beneficial .
Living things thrive in warmer environments , not frigid ones .
Far more people die in winter from the effects of cold than from heat waves .
Carbon dioxide is plant food , the basis of all life .
Crops and flora of every kind grow more luxuriantly with a richer supply of it .
The big advances in human civilization , reflected in the rise of cultures and times of elevated expansion and exploration , inventiveness , agriculture , artistry , and science , all occurred in warmer climatic periods .
Anyone who is sincere about praising the virtues of a " green " planet should love it .
Shortly before Copenhagen , the suspicions that even superficial consideration of such points should have raised were confirmed beyond doubt with the revelations of collusion , going back years , among a cadre of climate researchers to manufacture a scientific case supporting a quasi-religious world view and presumption of the relationship between man and nature that is being given as the justification for measures that would impose drastic energy cutbacks and costly changes in living standards worldwide .
The practices employed include massaging and falsification of data ; suppression and destruction of conflicting evidence ; rigging of computer models to deliver predetermined results ; withholding of information from independent examination ; the exclusion of dissenters from the official peer review process ; and the intimidation of journals from publishing their objections .
For those who may have missed the controversy going on behind the scenes while the mainstream media are apparently doing their best to play it down , or have just returned from a vacation on Mars , a good overview by Paul Driessen is posted here .
But a couple of examples will give the idea :

The figure above was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in its 1990 maiden assessment and shows the pattern of variation in the Earth 's temperature over the previous thousand years that had been generally accepted up until then , based on data from such sources as tree - rings , lake sediments , ice cores , and historic documents .
It clearly depicts the " Medieval Warm Period " ( MWP ) of 900 –1300 AD , when the Vikings maintained settlements and farms on the green coasts of Greenland and wine grapes grew in Scotland , and the " Little Ice Age " ( LIA ) that followed , centered on 1600 AD , in which winter fairs were held on London 's frozen River Thames , and R. D. Blackmore 's novel Lorna Doone had trees on Dartmoor bursting with sounds like cannon shots under the pressure of internal ice .
These periods are part of a series of natural cycles that go to greater extremes , such as one around six thousand years ago , when the Sahara was grassland watered by rivers , and southern England basked in subtropical luxuriance .
( Humans and polar bears survived just fine . )
Ever since humans began turning applied intelligence in the form of technology to making life more secure , comfortable , and generally less burdensome , there has been a pervasive element among them who took it upon themselves to oppose and condemn what most were inclined to view as a bettering of their condition .
There seems to be something akin to a religious guilt complex at work , in which the seeking of creature comforts and a reprieve from toil and drudgery is seen as sinful , and atonement calls for renouncing the benefits and returning to the rigors of a simpler but more virtuous , soul - cleansing life .
( It 's interesting to note that the guilt tends to be expressed primarily by the more affluent , articulate , and influential , whose own standards will be little affected by the sacrifices demanded of those who are supposed to do the atoning . )
Things reached a crescendo in the later decades of the twentieth century , when soaring productivity and such revolutionary innovations as affordable air travel and communications for the masses , and the prospect of unlimited energy threatened wanton iniquity exploding on a worldwide scale .
Reactions from the righteous came swiftly with the campaigns to demonize DDT , pesticides , fertilizers , chemicals , and nuclear energy , and apocalyptic auguries of planetary destruction from exhaustion of the food supply ( late 1960s ) ; a carbon - burning - induced ice age ( mid 1970s ) ; jetliner exhausts , particularly the SST ( late 1970s ) ; depletion of the ozone layer ( 1980s ) .
But of all the environmental alarms that were sounded and had their day , the banner issue to emerge , behind which all the disparate cohorts of doom and ruin rallied , was global warming .
For anyone with stakes in the manmade disaster business , it had everything going for it : lurid images of polar meltdown , drowning cities , and dried - up farmland ; a threat of global dimensions that demanded coordinated global action , and hence the institution of a global policing authority that had long been the dream of those who would abolish sovereign nation states ; limitless opportunities for tax - funded " further research " and worthy political causes ; and all the usual suspects to blame for opponents of industrial civilization and the Western way of life in general .
Frustrated academics and intellectuals with cravings for recognition but nothing to offer that anyone would vote for at the ballot box or freely spend their money on in the market place could become voices behind the throne and make the world notice them .
Even the villains of the piece had something to gain with the promise of enormous subsidies and tax incentives in return for diverting their efforts into environmentally friendly projects and " alternative " energy sources that had the one common attribute of being utterly incapable of supplying the needs of an advanced , technology - driven society , and likely to price energy – and hence just about everything else – beyond the means of most people in all but approved and rationed amounts .
Moreover , a believable mechanism by which man 's nefarious actions , if left uncurbed , might heat the planet to the verge of spontaneous combustion was right there .
All major industries and large - scale transportation systems depend ultimately on fuel burning , with the consequent release of carbon dioxide ( apart from nuclear , but that had effectively been put on hold for the time being ) .
Carbon dioxide contributes to the " greenhouse effect , " the natural process by which the atmosphere keeps the Earth around 33 °C warmer – and therefore inhabitable – than it would otherwise be at this distance from the Sun .
Provided one did n't look too closely at the numbers , which showed things like CO 2 being a minor greenhouse gas compared to water vapor , and the bulk of it coming from natural sources such as oceanic outgassing , volcanic activity , and the byproducts of life and decomposition , CO 2 could be presented as the principal mover , and human activity as the agency primarily responsible for generating it .
In an age conditioned to accepting anything that comes out of a computer with uncritical awe and bedazzlement – Garbage In , Gospel Out – the next best thing to a infallible papal pronouncement on the veracity of the theory as an article of faith could be produced in the form of complex computer models with the appropriate assumptions and outcome built - in .
It was the perfect formula .
A universal gravy train .
The Great Social Equalizer – although some would remain more equal than others .
The road to power of truly totalitarian dimensions .
. . .
There was only one small thing wrong .
The record of temperatures past said that the Earth had already been through variations greater than anything that could be coaxed out of CO 2 - driven computer models while humans were still depending on sailing ships and water wheels , and nothing remarkable had come of it .
In an article that appeared recently in American Thinker , Marc Sheppard describes the astonishment , in 1995 , of a geophysicist at the University of Oklahoma on receiving an e-mail from a leading figure in climate change research that said , “ We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period . ”
And they did .

This is the version of the temperature record that appears in the IPCC 's 2001 Assessment , and is particularly stressed in the Summary for Policymakers , the highly - politicized synopsis that is all that most of the people making decisions that affect the lives of millions read , and which commands the bulk of media attention .
It 's the curve that has come to be known as the " Hockey Stick , " from its shape of temperatures fluctuating about a fairly level mean implicitly for millennia , and turning upward sharply around the beginning of the twentieth century to mark the commencement of an unprecedented increase coincident with the growth of human population and industrialization .
The construction merges data from a number of sources , applying certain statistical procedures – which in itself is not unusual when normalizing large data sets – and subjecting the result to various " corrections , " said to compensate for biases and drifts .
Challenges from skeptics followed immediately on grounds of both the validity of the data used and the methodology employed .
Since reliable and systematic temperature measurements are not available from before about 1850 , " proxy " figures were used instead for the earlier portion , calculated from such sources as analysis of tree rings and lake - bottom sediments , while actual thermometer figures were used for the more recent period .
But tree rings are affected by rainfall , humidity , diseases , and other factors , and teasing out the effect attributable to temperature is controversial .
Critics contended that the results as presented made the earlier period appear cooler than it was , while the later part did the opposite – all of which , of course , would suit a predetermined agenda for demonstrating recent warming quite well .
The objection to the later thermometer measurements was that they turned out to be based essentially on figures from ground stations , which independent surveys have revealed as being poorly sited to an astonishing degree in locations guaranteed to read high , with nearby air - conditioner outlets , large expanses of concrete and asphalt , parked vehicles , and the like .
In many cases the surroundings have changed with time , so that what the temperature increases recorded over the years and duly fed into the statistical surveys were in fact measuring was local urban development and the expansion of airports , not changes in the climate .
The more rural the ground stations , the less the effect .
Measurements from satellites and balloons , by contrast , showed no consistent warming trend .
A basic principle of science is openness , which requires data and methods to be made available to others so that results can be verified by duplicating them – or else falsified .
The authors of the Hockey Stick refused to disclose their raw data or details of the processing methods and computer codes that they had applied .
One priceless reason , given in response to a request from an Australian scientist , was , “ Why should we . . . when your whole aim is to find something wrong with it ? ” (!)
Nevertheless , a couple of Canadian researchers managed to put the story together through some intricate detective work and demonstrated that the model was rigged to produce a hockey - stick shape – even if fed random data or telephone numbers .
Things did n't end there , unsurprisingly .
Defenders closed ranks to uphold the warming thesis and contest the refutation , and the controversy continues heatedly at present , but you 'd never know it from following the mainstream media or listening to inane assertions that " the science is settled . "
Many in the alarmist camp are reported to be having second thoughts , but the diehards argue that , while the original hockey stick derivation may have had its flaws , other bodies of evidence show that the trend is real nevertheless .
An example that continues to be cited in papers published by major science journals is a collection of tree ring measurements from Siberia that in fact formed one of the data sets incorporated into the initial study .
However , when skeptics finally obtained the original data after encountering strenuous efforts to withhold them , they found that the sample used consisted of just 12 trees selected from a set of 252 – which included 34 from the same geographical vicinity as the selected 12 .
The illustration below shows how much difference the selecting – known as " cherry picking " – made .

The red line is the result obtained with data from just the 12 selected trees – the picture the world is given as proof that we 're melting the Antarctic ice cap .
( Even if it were true , how a rise of 2.5 °C is supposed to melt billions of tons of ice covering an area one and a half times the size of the United States , in places extending as deep as 16,000 feet , at an average temperature of - 60 °C , is never explained . )
The black line shows what happens when the same procedure is applied to the full data set of all 252 trees .
No comment necessary .

Here 's another example , this time from a station at Darwin in Northern Australia .
The red line shows the huge warming reported after " adjustments " to the original data that as far as I can ascertain have never been clearly accounted for .
The unadjusted data , shown in blue , once again actually exhibits cooling .
Taken from Anthony Watts 's site , which also provides a detailed discussion .
James Delingpole of the UK Telegraph gives further examples of similar cases around the world and shows how data from areas that show no warming , or even actual cooling , have been dropped and replaced by extrapolations from surrounding regions , sometimes at considerable distances away , to produce an impression of net overall warming .
In summary , there appears to be substantial evidence , from a number of independent sources , that the data used for the IPCC 's conclusions have been adjusted in undocumented ways , and those adjustments account for practically all the warming we are told has been caused by humans .
So what effect , if any , have humans really had ?
The doctrine reflected in the IPCC 's position is that temperatures have risen through the twentieth century , the prime cause is carbon dioxide produced by humans , and if left to continue , the result will be planetary disaster .
There is little dispute that carbon dioxide levels have increased .
Whether this can unequivocally be attributed to humans in the way that is usually assumed , however , is another question .
Studies of ice cores show that in the natural cycle of things , temperature rises come first by anything from decades to centuries , so much of the increase in CO 2 could well be an effect of recovery from the Little Ice Age .
This is supported by the fact that most of the warming that did take place in the 20th century – around 0.6 °C – took place before 1940 , whereas CO 2 did n't really take off until the postwar growth of industrialization , so it 's difficult to see how the latter could have caused the former .
Reports are available from the times before the issue became a political matter subject to Orwellian rewrite , and independent studies have been conducted based on all the data available today without the unexplained adjustments .
What they show is : Warming from around 1920 to the early 1940s .
( NASA has admitted that 1934 was the US 's warmest year , not 1998 as recently hyped , and that three of the warmest years were before 1940 .
Said to be due to a " mathematical error . " )
Cooling from after 1940 to the late 1970s .
( Most people today will have forgotten , or maybe never knew , that this was when the same science journals and news sources were warning of an end to life as we know it with the imminent onset of a new ice age .
The culprit was fossil - fuel burning , the means this time being particulates in the atmosphere cutting down incoming sunlight .
The solution was the ending of life as we know it by the same kind of taxes , cutbacks , and global policing as are being called for today . )
Warming from the late 1970s to about 1998
No change from 1998 to 2001 , and net cooling since then which pretty much negates the warming experienced in the first part of the century .
Hence , the only period for which both CO 2 and temperature happened to be rising together is the twenty - odd years from the late seventies to the late nineties .
As far as any evidence goes , this is the entire case for manmade global warming and all the panic that has ensued because of it .
We are told that consensus among the world 's scientists has put the subject beyond further debate .
But something that the mainstream media have been largely silent about is that more than 4,000 scientists , including 72 Nobel Prize winners , from 106 countries , have signed an appeal addressed to the world 's leaders expressing grave reservations and calling for policymaking to be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational preconceptions .
“ The greatest evils which stalk our Earth , ” they state , “ are ignorance and oppression , and not Science , Technology , and Industry , whose instruments , when adequately managed , are indispensable tools of a future shaped by Humanity , by itself and for itself . ”
If consensus is to be the measure , then that 's three times the number of experts cited by the UN IPCC ; and even these turn out to be mostly political representatives or graduates in the humanities , with no training in the philosophy or methods of science .
Over 34,000 scientists have signed a petition saying there is no convincing evidence that gases released through human activity pose any threat to the future .
Nevertheless , with eyes and minds fixated on political and ideological goals , and all faculties that might connect with reality apparently on hold , the coterie who would dictate the world 's future met with the intent of agreeing an agenda that would send energy usage and living standards back to levels appropriate to the nineteenth century , while four inches of snow fell outside , and unprecedented early blizzards were blanketing Europe and setting records in the American Midwest .
This at the end of a year that has seen China 's coldest winter in 100 years , Baghdad having its first snow in recorded history , record levels of Antarctic sea ice , and record cold in Minnesota , Texas , Florida , Mexico , Australia , Iran , Greece , South Africa , Greenland , Argentina , and Chile .
But such inconvenient truths as facts do n't matter when you 're pushing an ideology , either because it's what will bring big breaks your way or because you genuinely believe you 're saving the planet .
The great fear underlying it all is the neo-Malthusian specter of overpopulating a world with limited resources and going downhill in an orgy of Mad Max degeneracy and desperation when everything finally runs out .
That 's a legitimate view to hold .
And it might even be correct .
But it 's a social and political issue that should be honestly addressed and argued as such .
Trying to justify a preconceived dogma through phony , trumped - up science is n't the way to go .
The fraud will eventually be exposed , and the main victim will be trust in real science of every kind – both of which are already happening .
I 've written previously on why I believe the fears to be misplaced .
Applying observations drawn from the population dynamics of animals to human societies is to deny the qualities which set humans apart .
Unlike animals , who simply consume resources and react with fixed behaviors to their environment , humans create resources and change their behavior according to the new conditions that they bring about .
A resource is n't a resource until the knowledge and the means exist to make use of it .
New technologies create new resources , and as the record of history shows , always on a scale that dwarfs what went before .
Furthermore , ample evidence exists to show that when human societies reach sufficiently high levels of affluence and well - being , birth rates decline and populations eventually stabilize in ways that Thomas Malthus and his intellectual descendants of present times fail , or refuse , to consider .
Humans do seem to have amazing reserves of tenacity and the ability to muddle through in spite of the odds , however , and a better world will very likely come out of it all one day .
A world with the wisdom to realize that being able to enjoy the natural wonders of our planet and the universe , and at the same time take advantage of the benefits that human ingenuity and creativity make possible are not mutually exclusive .
The inhabitants of that age will maybe look back on the present as a kind of Dark Age – a time when people finally figured out , in the form of science , a dependable way of distinguishing what 's probably true from what probably is n't , and discovered the astounding things that technology is capable of – but then lacked the wit to apply either body of knowledge effectively to the betterment and benefit of all .
I sometimes wonder if a race of super - intelligences exists in some transcendental reality , who in spite of their godlike qualities found themselves bedeviled by the same social and political problems as ourselves , and created the cosmos as a gazillion Petri dishes in a gigantic genetic programming experiment to see if any of the life forms that emerged in it might come up with an answer that worked .
I know it wo n't come as much comfort to those who want to believe that there 's something out there that watches over us and cares , but it seems to me that such an intelligence would do things for its reasons , not what we think ought to be its reasons , and the fate of any particular species in the collection – let alone an individual lost in among it – would not be a matter of any great concern .
Which means it 's pretty much up to us , does n't it ?

@ SomeClass
public void method ( ) {
...
}
I had a friend visit me today .
He 's a Java programmer , but he also knows enough Python , Ruby , JavaScript and Scheme to be dangerous .
I asked him to show me around his code so I could see some modern Java .
I learned Java back in the 1.0 days , but I stopped paying attention back around 1.4 .
Here are some of the things I saw .
Generics are as I expected .
Annotations are interesting .
There was code like : " SomeClass " acts like a " tag " for " method " .
Elsewhere in the code , you can define wrapper methods ( i.e. decorators ) for all the methods that have been wrapped by " @SomeClass " .
Clearly , this was the inspiration for Python 's function decorators .
I had simply never seen them in Java before .
Dependency injection is interesting , as I expected it to be .
In general , you accept parameters for everything you need , and you do n't worry a lot about how things get instantiated .
You avoid using the " new " keyword , and instead let the dependency injection framework instantiate things for you .
This takes care of circular dependencies .
There was a Java file that configured what gets bound to what .
Hence , if I ask for SomeFoo , it 'll give me an instance of the right SomeFooImpl .
Basically , it 's a whole layer to add more dynamism .
IntelliJ was impressive .
I asked him to write a module from scratch so I could see his workflow .
He right clicked and hit " add new class " .
IntelliJ created a file and asked if he wanted to add it to Subversion .
Then he simply started typing in the implementation for the class .
Whenever he typed something like FileWriter , it automatically added the right import line .
Whenever he used a class attribute that did n't exist yet , it showed up in red until he told the IDE to create the attribute .
Then , he had to click on the attribute to add a getter and setter .
I knew that Java IDEs held your hand a lot .
I did n't know that the work flow was to simply start using something and then have the IDE generate the boilerplate for you .
That was interesting .
I liked how nicely he was able to navigate the code base .
Best of all , IntelliJ has really nice Vim keybindings , which he was using .
He showed me Struts 2 and his usage of JSP .
Those were n't all that remarkable or new to me .
I returned the favor by showing him some of the code from my current project .
He said , " Wow , your Python code is really beautiful , " which I took as quite a compliment .
He also said that there was clearly a lot less boilerplate and that more functionality was achieved in fewer lines .
Clearly , a lot of useful code is written in Java .
glassfish HiveDB , and IntelliJ are just a few things that come to mind .
I 'm not going to give up Python anytime soon , but it was nice to get a peek into another world .

2017 : Thudding outside the door of this commentary box as people dash back to their seats .
The players are back too .
We might finish this after all .
2016 : " I 've been keeping up with the tennis on the mobile , while trying to watch my daughter 's ballet show .
I still have the second half to go and appear to missing one of the greatest Wimbledon finals ever .
Still , the ballet show is also great ! ! "
Dad , Harlow , via text on 81111 2014 : " Was watching at the pub in Soho , when they turned it off to screen a short film !
What a crime .
Thank god for the radio . "
Anon via text on 81111 2012 : Boy , even the Voice of Wimbledon is feeling the tension .
Short but sweet , here 's the news : " It is planned to uncover Centre Court with a view to resuming play very shortly . "
2010 : " This is so stressful - still can't decide after four hours who to support .
I want Rog cos of his cardies , I want Rafa cos of the guns .
This is so difficult .
I 'm getting Operation out again ( see 1740 ) although I do n't think my already shaky hand would be able to stand it .
What a game !!!! "
BBC Sport mole 2009 : Just made a dash for the ladies ' and I confirm the rain is still falling - albeit very lightly .
The tent comes up on Centre for all of a minute before it comes down again .
We may be back on very soon .
2001 : " At this very moment Nadal must be thinking he should be at the Champions Dinner .
He was 5 - 2 up in the fourth - set tie - break and it's the first time I 've seen him play with a little bit of nerves .
It 's just an incredible match .
All the drama was in the fourth set .
If anybody ever doubted Federer 's fighting spirit he proved everyone wrong - but I take my hat off to both players . "
Boris Becker on BBC1 1950 : The drama on Centre Court meant thankfully I hardly noticed Jeremy Bates 's glorious run in the Gentlemen 's Senior Invitational Doubles ( with Anders Jarryd ) come to a heartbreaking end .
They lost 10 - 7 on a Champions tie - break to Ken Flach and Robert Seguso .
The mixed doubles final - which was due to follow the men's final on Centre - has now been moved to Court One.
1955 : " This shower has just arrived and it is turning pretty heavy .
Hopefully it will be moving through in 15 or 20 minutes or half an hour at a push so I am still reasonably hopeful that we will get some more play . "
BBC weatherforecaster Alex Deakin at the All England Club Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 2 - 2 Nadal
Federer challenges and is wrong .
Nadal challenges and is right .
A small victory there for the Spaniard and Fed must serve again at 30 - 30 .
He smashes down an ace but then a poor volley allows Nadal back to deuce .
As the rain falls though , Fed decides enough is enough and almost beckons on the court coverers himself .
They oblige and with this match delicately poised , they 're off again .
The match time ticks towards four hours and the clock towards 2000 BST , and with the rain getting heavier , will we see any more play today ?
1947 : " It is just an unbelievable effort from Federer to keep himself in this match .
I can only imagine it must be so difficult for Nadal not to think about those opportunities that he had - 5 - 2 with two serves to come and then two match points but not be able to cross the line . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 2 - 2 Nadal
Chances for Federer but he can't take them , slapping a simple return into the net at 30 - 15 down .
Another return goes into the net and Nadal levels again .
1946 : " I 'm sitting on an aeroplane at Heathrow that has n't taken off yet following on the mobile .
Bet the pilots are watching hence the delay .
Amazing ! "

Federer comes through , but there is no sign of Nadal even thinking about those two missed Championship points .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 -8 ) 1 - 1 Nadal
Not exactly plain sailing for Rafa but he holds to 30 and , much as I hate to the bearer of bad news , the court coverers are poised for action again .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 1 - 0 Nadal
A bit of trouble for Federer at 30 - 30 but a big serve and then a winning volley save him .
1936 : " I would love to know how Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani know Federer ?
Gavin is getting quite animated ! "
Jenni via text on 81111
( Apparently Rossdale is a regular on the tennis circuit at home in California so we presume Gav 's love of tennis could be the common denominator .
Gav , Gwen , Roger and Mirka are all friends and even went to London Zoo together during Wimbledon . )
1933 : " That was absoultely incredible .
Before this match we were talking about the scars from Roland Garros for Federer but now I am asking myself are there any wounds for Nadal ? "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box FOURTH SET Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) Nadal
Unbelievable start .
Rafa 's at net but Fed puts up the lob which the Spaniard stretches to flick back off his backhand side .
Fed 's onto it though and rifles the forehand winner down the line .
It gives him the mini - break but he loses his next two points on serve , putting Rafa in the driving seat at 2 - 1 .
A stunning ace out wide makes it 3 - 1 , and another serve which skips off the line puts Nadal 4 - 1 up .
Federer recovers to 4 - 2 with his 62nd winner of the match but after a punishing rally , he puts a backhand into the trams and Rafa is now two points away at 5 - 2 .
Rafa has two serves to win it , but his first is a double fault .
That 's 5 - 3 .
Federer then forces Nadal to put a backhand into the net and it's now 5 - 4 .
The crowd goes wild as yet another brilliant forehand draws us level at 5 - 5 and an unreturnable serve gives
Fed set point at 6 - 5 .
A long , tense rally ends with a shorter ball for Fed which sits up to be hit - but he belts it into the trams and it's 6 - 6 .
Gasps all round .
A new paragraph is called for ...
Federer challenges a call on a forehand but it 's long and that 's match point - but a big first serve saves it .
Nadal produces the most astonishing forehand pass - sprinting across the baseline and smacking it down the line .
What a way to bring up a second match point , and this time on his own serve .
But Federer responds in kind , sprinting along the baseline and rifling a backhand pass down the line .
Incredible .
A winning forehand makes it set point for Federer on his serve - and Nadal puts a backhand return long .
That is the most remarkable spell of play I have ever witnessed on Centre Court .
Borg - McEnroe all over again ( which I did n't witness by the way ) .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 6 Nadal
Nadal gets the first point again when Federer pounds a forehand wide - but Rafa responds in kind .
A rare error from the Spaniard .
A big first serve and a forehand winner take Federer to 40 - 15 before he plants a difficult half - volley into the net - but Rafa 's next return goes long .
Into a tie - break we go .
I do n't need to tell you , this is huge .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 5 - 6 Nadal
Does Rafa crumble ?
Does he heck .
His serve firing , he races into a 30 - 0 lead and though Federer gets back into the game with a punishing return , he then plants a forehand just wide and Nadal is again a game away .
The tension is almost unbearable - but the players seem to be the calmest people on Centre Court .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 5 - 5 Nadal
Fed 's drop shot is n't good enough and Nadal drop - shots him right back again , with Fed a bit slow on the uptake .
Next he sees a forehand fly past him and it's 0 - 30 .
The crowd sense the importance of the moment and urge the champion on .
He responds with a big first serve and then the familiar serve - forehand combination .
Nadal goes long to give
Fed a game point and the champion delivers yet another forehand sizzler to seal it .
That is astonishing from Fed - and the crowd respond with a chant of " Roger , Roger " etc etc. 1905 : " Nadal has been serving first and has known the importance of holding on to his own service games and Federer is going to have to serve to stay in the tournament . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 4 - 5 Nadal
The wind picks up , first playing havoc with Fed 's timing and then pushing Nadal 's backhand into the trams .
A bit of pressure for Nadal ?
Forget it .
He spanks a rasping backhand onto the opposite line off a testing Federer approach and is quickly back on track .
The Spaniard is one game away ...
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 4 - 4 Nadal
Federer puts a backhand volley into the net to give Nadal hope at 30 - 30 - but the champion angles a forehand away after a big serve and the door closes .
This is so , so tense .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 3 - 4 Nadal
Nadal is immovable .
A love service game and the pressure 's right back on Federer as they sit down at the changeover .
Any let - up from Fed and Nadal will be in .
1856 : " Am working at the Cancer Research UK Race for Life Exeter where it 's tipping it down , checking live text on my phone , just squealed out ' I love Roger ! ' "

" Come on , " roars the champion .
Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 - 5 ) 2 - 3 Nadal
Nadal takes his time before zipping a backhand past a stranded Federer .
Hold to 15 .
The world number one knows he has to keep an incredibly high standard just to stay with Nadal - which he 's doing at the moment .
1843 : Misery for Britain's Jeremy Bates as he ( and Anders Jarryd ) lose the first set of the final of the Gentlemen 's Senior Invitation Doubles 7 - 1 on the tie - break to Ken Flach and Robert Seguso .
Boo. Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 -6 ( 7 -5 ) 2 - 2 Nadal

Astonishing .

You can't take your eyes off it .

I predicted Nadal in four here before the start .
Sticking with it , but not underestimating Federer because Nadal has looked tighter since the rain break . "
hawick on 606 Federer 4 - 6 4 -6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 0 - 1 Nadal
Nadal shrugs off that setback magnificently , holding to 15 .
1832 : " Unbelievable response from Federer - there were the big forehands and the second serve returns and the big inside - out forehand winner and a big ace to finish it off .
He certainly has n't given up this match . "

He gets the first serve into Fed 's backhand , but another game point slips away when Federer whacks a sizzling forehand into the corner .
Nadal survives though when Fed nets a backhand .
1811 : Away we go then .
Nadal will serve to stay in the set .
1805 : " It can be advantageous for Federer .
It 's not the easiest time for Nadal to come out and serve to stay in the third set - although you 'd rather be in Nadal 's shoes at the moment . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box 1804 :
Here they are , Rafa marching on purposefully before wafting his racquet in the air to acknowledge the applause .
Federer looks a bit happier than when we last saw him .
He has a brief chat with the ump before heading out for the warm - up - but he 's gone to the wrong end .
Rafa , after taking a very deliberate sip from each of his water bottles , briefly joins Fed at the same end before the world number one realises his error .
1800 : Hello sun , welcome back .
Ball boys / girls and officials are all back in position .
Just missing a Fedal now .
1759 : " Can you tell them to hold on bit longer ?
I 'm praying it 's a five - set bonanza .
Damn you Silverstone and your traffic .
Ca n't there be an agreement not to have our two biggest summer British events not on the same day ? "
James , Sevenoaks , via text on 81111 1757 : Whoah .
That was quick .
The Voice of Wimbledon gives the crowd a two - minute warning to get back to their seats in time for the start of play .
Cups of teas and buns abandoned all around the grounds as the rush begins .
1755 : A smattering of applause as the covers do indeed come off and the last of the umbrellas come down .
I 'm loathe to put the sun graphic in though - largely because it 's not sunny .
1749 : " It does n't look too bad in the long - term although it has just started to spot so it does n't look too pretty in the short - term .
I think we are going to get another shower in the next 15 minutes or so but looking further afield I can see a little bit of sunshine . "
BBC weather forecaster Alex Deakin at the All England Club 1748 : This is odd .
While the BBC 's weatherman tell us it 's raining , they 're deflating the tent on Centre Court .
Hold your horses fellas .
1746 : " If Fed gets back to win from here , I will rock up to work every day next week wearing the one item in my old man 's wardrobe that most looks like Federer 's shocking woolly cardigan .
In case you 're wondering , it 's my dad 's shocking woolly cardigan ( Yep - the grey one ) . "
BBC Sport's Mark Ashenden
( Not sure if Ash wanted me to publish that but at least now we can hold him to it .
Come on Fed. )
1742 : The Voice of Wimbledon gets a half - hearted cheer for this .
I think it deserves more .
" The rain has eased and we are now about to take the tents down and remove the covers and inspect courts with a view to resuming play shortly after that , weather permitting . "
1740 : " Everyone 's packing up around my ears here .
Hold on , we 've got a final to finish people .
Bizarrely just played the board game Operation ( other nostalgic childhood board games are available ) .
I lost .
God knows what happened to the steady hand I could rely on as a child .
Swear they 've made it more difficult .
Why is BBC Sport 's Sarah Holt here !?!
This is making a bad day even worse . "
BBC Sport mole 1734 : Will Federer get back into this match ?
In their 17 meetings so far , Federer did once come back from two sets down to beat Nadal .
That was in Miami in 2005 , only their second match .
This is a totally different scenario .
Federer has had 12 break points and won one , and saw a 4 - 1 lead slip away in the second set .
A massive psychological blow .
But at least he 's still alive in the match .
If he had n't come back from 0 - 40 down at 3 - 3 , Nadal might already be the champion by now .
1726 : As instructed by the Voice of Wimbledon ( see 1710 ) , I am actually enjoying a cup of tea and a bun .
Lovely .
1723 : " Federer has a majestic record in tie - breaks , and we know he can serve well when he wants to .
That 'll be the key .
I 'm a Nadal fan but there 's no way this match is finishing in straight sets . "
JT_BlueForever on 606
Join the debate on 606 1719 : " Some of the rallies are just mind - boggling .
Sometimes the players are n't even in the picture because they 're being pushed so wide with the angles .
It 's great tennis but in general Federer 's level is not what we 're used to . "
Former champion Boris Becker on BBC1 1710 : " My advice for Laura Robson would be to love what she does , keep her head and eye on the ball and really believe in herself and it shows that she already does . "
Women 's singles champion Venus Williams on BBC1 1710 :
It 's the last day of the Championships so the Voice of Wimbledon has taken the opportunity to build his part a bit .
" We 've been told to expect this rain to last for the next 20 minutes or so although it could be a little longer .
There 's a very good chance of a prolonged dry spell following on so I would suggest a cup of tea and a bun and we should be able to resume play after that . "
Cup of tea and a bun ?
How very English .
1707 : Still raining .
Thank goodness for BBC Sport 's Sarah Holt ... a sentence I never thought I 'd write .
She 's made it back from a trip to the Jorvic Centre to play tea lady for the afternoon .
I 'm gasping for a cuppa too .
1659 : Oof , it is a deluge .
People running for cover everywhere I look .
That rain break came at the worst possible time for our hero Jeremy Bates , who is at game point on his serve as he single - handedly ( with Anders Jarryd ) takes on Ken Flach and Robert Seguso in the Gentleman Senior Invitational Doubles .
The dastardly Americans lead 4 - 3 but it's on serve .
1654 : " I am pretty hopeful we will get the players back on at some point although it has been pretty active in the sky .
There is a risk this donwpour will turn into a thunderstorm but I am hopeful it will only last for 20 minutes or worst case scenario an hour and then it will move through .
This rain could turn pretty heavy any minute now though . "
BBC weather forecaster Alex Deakin at the All England Club 1654 : " This is a big surpise for a lot of people out there .
Federer gets to break point and then seems to get nervous .
Federer looks a bit apprehensive , he 's not playing with his instinct .
He 's too far behind the baseline in my opinion .
He seemed confused in the first set , looked like he was going to win the second and then Nadal rattled off five straight games . "
Former champion Boris Becker on BBC1 1651 : Ah .
The court coverers sprint on in double - quick time and the rain falls on Rafa 's parade .
I sense a deluge - hopefully a brief one .
Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 5 - 4 Nadal
An ace then a double fault - Fed 's first - and it's 30 - 15 .
A backhand over the baseline makes it 30 - 30 and the champion 's in trouble again .
His first serve saves him though .
Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 4 - 4 Nadal
Federer shanks a forehand and Nadal pumps his fist as he holds to 15 .
The Spaniard is very close now - but can he beat the rain as well ?
1645 : " If Nadal had gone on to break there it would be very difficult to see Federer coming back .
You have to take your hat off to him - that was the sign of a champion , five straight points from 0 - 40 to hold his serve . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 4 - 3 Nadal
Nadal 's absolute will to win is draining the life out of Federer .

" Come on Rog , let 's go , big stuff , " says Bush lead singer and husband of Gwen Stefani Gavin Rossdale from the Fed support camp .
Fed was teetering on the brink there but five straight points save him .
It 's still gloomy out there and coats are going on around the stands but it 's not actually raining .
Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 3 - 3 Nadal
Fed earns two more break points , roaring himself on with a " c'mon " .
He makes an absolute hash of a backhand return off a second serve , looking up to his support camp in desperation .
But it 's the same old story on the second - woeful return .
He earns a third break point with a raking forehand but again Nadal hangs on and on a fourth , Nadal pushes Fed back with a sensational backhand onto the baseline .
Nadal survives .
Heartbreak for Federer .
He is now one in 12 on break points .
The court coverers are looming now as darkness descends ...
1617 : " If Federer wins , it 'll have to have been because Nadal bottles it .
And in all honesty , that is looking highly unlikely . "
oligold11 on 606 Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 3 - 2 Nadal
Ed on text wants to know Federer 's unforced errors stats .
He 's made 20 , and 35 winners .

He 's right - by about a millimetre .
None of this will help Federer 's mood .
Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 2 - 1 Nadal
Drama as Federer sends Nadal scampering around the baseline and the Spaniard slips awkwardly - hurting his right knee .
He limps to the chair and immediately calls for the trainer .

A glimmer for Federer at 40 - 30 but he dances around the ball and smacks the return just wide .
Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 1 - 0 Nadal
If he 's going to come back , that 's a good enough way to start .
Love service game .
The crowd seem a bit stunned by all this .
As well as Nadal is playing , we 're just not used to seeing Federer rattled .
It feels a bit uncomfortable .
1610 : " Nadal really is the only guy that can stay in these rallies with Federer and then turn defence into attack . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box SECOND SET Federer 4 - 6 4 - 6 Nadal
Federer braves the net and is rewarded when he dinks a volley into the open court but he nets the next return to make it 15 - 15 .
Federer hauls himself back into it at 30 - 30 with another delicious volley .
Nadal takes his time - and is rewarded with a code violation - but it 's worth his while .

But what 's that ?
Nadal attempts an extremely low - percentage drop shot and not surprisingly , it hits the net .
Break point but though he throws everything into the point , Federer is forced onto the back foot and can't recover , putting a difficult forehand into the net .

At the moment Rafa seems in control . "

The champion looks devastated .
Federer 4 - 6 4 - 4 Nadal
Federer smacks a forehand down the line - but Nadal gets to it and is massively disappointed to see his response go narrowly wide .
Most players would have been pleased to have got there at all .
That 's 30 - 30 but an ace down the ' T ' gives him game point .
But strange times .
Nadal makes two errors in a row and Fed suddenly has a break point .
Another big serve down the middle - unusually to Fed 's forehand - gets him out of trouble .
Federer should have another break point .
He is in the process of putting away a floated response from Nadal when someone in the crowd shouts ' out ' .
Fed puts the volley long and turns and shouts what sounds like " shut up " to the naughty crowd member .
Nadal survives .
1550 : " Am I right in thinking that in previous Wimbledon finals between these two Federer has won the first set each time ? "
yummycrazyrussian on 606

Federer 4 - 6 1 - 0 Nadal
Federer starts the set in style with a love game - his third , by my reckoning .
1526 : " I think I would favour Nadal , He has looked so comfortable from the start .
We know the nature of Roland Garros - we are questioning if there is this scar tissue for Federer and losing the first set it wo n't be easy for him .
A couple of shots in that last game , he had the break points , it was almost as if he did n't have a plan and he played them cautiously . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box FIRST SET Federer 4 - 6 Nadal
Drama , what drama .
Rafa is again peppering the Federer backhand with his serve , but Fed seems to be getting to grips with it .
A backhand volley gives
Fed a glimmer of hope at 15 - 30 and he then saves a set point with a raking backhand down the line .
The world number one punches away a volley to give him a second break point of the match .
He slices a backhand low to Rafa 's forehand and approaches the net - but he can't control the volley off a ferocious response from Nadal .
Rafa 's first ace earns him a second set point but he 's forced into a forehand error .
A gorgeous forehand right into the corner makes Nadal net and it's another break point - but there are sighs all round as he dumps a routine backhand into the net .
Two backhand errors give Nadal the set - but there were signs of hope for Fed.
Federer 4 - 5 Nadal
Another love service game for Fed .
Can he break though ?
Federer 3 - 5 Nadal
New balls , which means a new racquet for Fed .
Same result though .
At 40 -0 , Fed entices Rafa to the net before putting a lob right back over his head but then the top seed slaps a forehand long and it's as you were .
Federer 3 - 4 Nadal
Fed serve - volleys for the first time in the match , bending low to plant the volley into the open court .
That 's 40 - 15 .
Rafa threatens when he gets back to 40 - 30 but makes a rare error to give Fed the game .
A man in the crowd stands up and lifts his arms above his head in what looks like a slow - motion one - man Mexican wave .
Weird .
Federer 2 - 4 Nadal
Fed makes the mistake of not putting his approach shot on the line and Rafa rifles a forehand right past him .
Inevitable .
A hold to 15 for Nadal .
Gwen Stefani , sitting with Fed 's support camp , looks on nervously .
1500 : " Nadal has made his intentions clear and has been so aggressive from the baseline .
If Nadal can get his nose in front and win this set that will put even more doubts in Federer 's mind . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box Federer 2 - 3 Nadal
Blink and you miss it .
A love service game for Fed - which is one service game too late you feel .
The sun is trying its best to join the party .
Federer 1 - 3 Nadal
Interesting .
Nadal sends
Fed from side to side before completely wrong - footing the world number one before two more devastating forehands make it 40 - 0 .
But Fed fights back .
He strokes a delicious backhand onto the line to claw his way back to 40 - 30 and then attacks the net to make it deuce .
Nadal sends a forehand long and it's break point Fed - but the world number one overcooks a forehand .
Couple of deuces but Rafa hangs on to his break .
Tim Henman points out that Nadal put 14 serves in a row onto Fed 's backhand .
1445 : Meanwhile a good day for British sports fans as Lewis Hamilton wins the British Grand Prix at Silverstone .
Hamilton wins British Grand Prix Federer 1 - 2 Nadal
A searching return from Nadal finds
Fed on the back foot and he's in a spot of bother at 15 - 30 .
He brings out a huge second serve to make it 30 - 30 but a backhand into the net gives Nadal the first break point of the match .
Fed drops serve for only the third time in the whole tournament when Nadal 's return skips off the line and Fed 's racquet fails to make contact .
Massive early blow for the champion .
1443 : " Federer has responded in the best way possible to criticism .
Faultless in Halle and now he has been breathtaking in the way he has got to the final here without dropping a set . "
Tim Henman in the BBC commentary box Federer 1 - 1 Nadal
If Federer 's going to have any chance , he 'll probably need to try to finish these points quickly .
He does exactly that , pouncing on a short ball before effortlessly putting away the volley .
Nadal , though , is much improved on serve and that gets him to 40 - 15 before a first double fault holds him up - only briefly though .
Federer 1 - 0 Nadal
If the first point is anything to go by , we are in for an absolute treat .
The players exchange some gorgeous groundstrokes , Fed looking to take the initiative with his forehand before seeing Nadal belt one of his own down the line .
Fed wins the next four though , finishing with a booming first serve .
This crowd is ready to explode .
1435 : ' Fedal ' is under way ...
1434 : The crowd have got their act together and Centre Court is now pretty much full , as is the Royal Box .
This is the most hotly - anticipated match in recent tennis history .
I do n't know about you but I am beside myself with excitement .
1429 : This is the sixth time these two have met in a Grand Slam final - an Open era record .
Federer is aiming to beat Bjorn Borg 's record of five Wimbledon titles in a row .
When Borg got to his sixth final , he was thrashed by second seed John McEnroe ... an omen ?
1427 : Blair Manns , a 13 - year - old representing the British Lung Fundation , performs the coin toss .
Fed gets the first blow in by winning it , and not surprisingly he 'll serve first .
Rafa does his familiar sprint back to the baseline and we 're into the warm - up .
1423 : Manuel Santana - the last Spaniard to win the men's title here in 1966 - shakes Rafa 's hand as the two players come through the green door and out onto Centre Court .
Unusually , Rafa 's wearing a tracksuit top - which tells you all you need to know about the conditions today .
1421 : The pre-match interviews are revealing as always .
" I have to play my best tennis against the best player in the world , " says Rafa .
Roger says : " It might be a tough day with the rain and a tough opponent so it should be interesting . "
1420 : " Bjorn Borg has just caused a stampede in the Broadcast Centre after leaving his interview with Sue Barker .
Pens were flying everywhere and photographs being taken willy nilly .
What a dude though .
Are old tennis players the coolest of old sportsmen ?
See , Mac , Becker , Bjorg , Rusedski , Bates ... "
BBC Sport mole 1416 :
The speed with which the rain went and the sun appeared seems to have caught everyone on the hop .
Centre Court is barely half full .
Not me though .
Tuna baguette consumed , I am ready to go .
By Piers Newbery at Wimbledon
1415 : OK , we 're going to take him at his word and I will hand you over to Caroline for detailed , incisive and baguette - free match coverage .
1412 : The Voice of Wimbledon : " Play will start within the next 10 minutes . "
1410 : " Should n't the man doing the engraving on the board take advantage of this delay and get the ' 2008 R....' bit done now to save time ? "
From wishingandhoping on 606 1407 : The Voice of Wimbledon : " We are beginning the process of uncovering all courts with a view to starting play very shortly , weather permitting . "
I could kiss him .
If he was female and pretty .
1402 : Things are brightening up a bit and there are no umbrellas to be seen on Centre Court at the moment , so fingers crossed .
1359 : " Roger 's handling the pressure unbelievably well .
He 's the king of these courts , it 's his home ground .
I think it 's very difficult to pick a winner today .
Federer needs to serve well and if he does I think he 's going to win .
If he does n't , I think he 's going to have a lot of problems . "
Bjorn Borg on BBC One 1354 : " Federer 's trying to catch Sampras at seven Wimbledon titles and he's two from Sampras 's overall Grand Slam record of 14 .
That seemed like a foregone conclusion but I bet he 's starting to think .....
Most great players ' records are top heavy with titles from aged 20 to 26ish .
It then gets a whole lot harder . "
John McEnroe on BBC One 1348 : All this waiting around cannot be doing much for the finalists ' nerves as the world awaits one of the most titanic clashes in tennis history .
Fortunately , Jeremy Bates is an experienced campaigner and should be primed to take out Ken Flach and Robert Seguso in the senior invitation doubles final .
With Anders Jarryd .
They are due second on Court One , but who knows ?
1343 : " Cen , I 'll take that challenge !
1520 for the final to start . "
From Jenni via text on 81111 1340 : " What is the latest on the weather , still inconclusive ?!
Do we expect something to happen on court 1400 UK time ?
Thanks . "
From Pimbo on 606 ( Officially no play at 1400 BST , hopeful for 1430 - 1500 ) 1335 : " Piers , i'm following the live text in Hong Kong , awaiting the start of the final and if it's any consolation it 's chucking it down here as well . "
From whistlerst on 606 ( Strangely , it is ) 1333 : " Shall we have a spot of ' Guess the Start of the Final ' ?
I 'll go for 1532 ( twas the exact same time when the firemen removed my head from between the railings all those years ago ) . "
From Cen via text on 81111 1330 : " I agree with Aliah ( see 1303 ) , grand prix very exciting so far , lewis showing amazing moves to now be in the lead , so rain , rain stay at wimbledon until after it's finished ! "
From Vicky , Letchworth , via text on 81111 1325 : Well , I 've managed to sprint to and from the Broadcast Centre restaurant in the pouring rain and have returned with two slightly damp tuna baguettes for myself and BBC Sport 's Caroline Cheese .
And another pudding .
For me .
With the rain pouring down , the restaurant is packed and it 's standing room only as the soggy hordes watch the Grand Prix .
Watching intently from a prime spot is Andrew Castle .
You have to get up really early to get ahead of him .
1318 : " After two weeks of having to sit with the likes of Jeremy Kyle sapping my resolve on the TV in front of me while we wait for tennis to start , a bored flick through the TV channels this morning found two rogue music channels !
Huzzah .
Flagging morale was boosted immeasurably by those saucy pop sirens Girls Aloud , before Mika , the Scissor Sisters and a look out of the window brought the party atmosphere crashing back down .
Grrrrr. Bring on the roof ! "
BBC Sport Mole 1310 : " Any sign of sir Cliff at the courts ?
Rain delays and a stirring singalong rendition of Living Doll will brighten up my Sunday no end ! "
From fsjm33 on 606 ( I 'm sure the Mole would oblige ) 1305 : " I 'm praying for rain then dry after 3 pm so that we get a great British GP and hold off the mother of all tennis finals at Wimbledon to follow it !
Asking too much ? "
From Aliah , addicted to BBC live updates , via text on 81111 ( We can be contacted , gratis , via 606 remember ) 1300 : Should we ever get any play , some famous faces will be venturing out into the Royal Box .
Bjorn Borg is back to see if Federer can break his five - in - a - row mark , while Manuel Santana will be hoping Rafa can become the first Spaniard to win the men's title since he managed it in 1966 .
But both men will surely be giddy as school girls to be in the presence of London Mayor Boris Johnson , while Dame Maggie Smith and former champions Stan Smith and Billie Jean King are also in attendance .
And a Thomas Hitzlsperger , although presumably not the ' Hammer ' of Aston Villa , Stuttgart and Germany fame .
1250 : Here he is again , the kindly Voice of Wimbledon : " These light sh> owers are due to continue until around 1400 - 1430 BST this afternoon and then it is expected to remain cloudy but with some sunny spells , but with the possibility of one or two heavy showers , so we remain optimistic that the situation will improve later on . "
1246 : " If Nadal 's going to do it , it has to be this year - he has to take advantage of any possible effect the French Open may have had on Federer . "
From yummycrazyrussian on 606 1240 : Well , I have so far demolished a chocolate bar masquearding as a cereal bar , and a pudding posing as a healthy rice - based snack .
If they do n't start playing tennis soon I 'll be on to the brandy and cigars .
However , the rain is still falling and the lucky ticket holders are having to make do with taking photographs of each other under umbrellas at the moment .
Grim .
1232 : " How can anyone suggest that Nadal is the unquestionable number one ?
He is the king of clay , plays much better on grass , but the guy has yet to reach the final at the Australian Open , not to mention the US Open where he only got to the quarter - finals once . "
From csaba via text on 81111 1228 : Apparently , there is a Grand Prix on today , and it's in Britain !
Rain does not stop motor racing , so while waiting for the real sport to begin you could follow my colleague Sam Lyon as he charts the progress of some space rockets with wheels around a field in Northamptonshire .
Maybe Lewis Hamilton could become the new Laura Robson .
Hurry back though ....
Live - British Grand Prix 1220 : " Watching Wimbledon takes me back to when we were students working as waiters .
Phil Butler took a bowl of strawberries up to Billie Jean King who was commentating at court 18 .
Her face was a picture when he asked her if it was her first time at the Championships .
Great memories . "
From Paddy via text on 81111 1218 : " Piers , do n't you think the Voice of Wimbledon deserves a graphic ? "
From anon via text on 81111 ( I fear that would ruin the magic ) 1213 : Right , here 's the deal .
Should the final be held over until Monday becuse of rain , tickets for Sunday will not be vaild - the normal refund policy simply takes effect .
That means we will have an empty Centre Court for a Monday final , no ?
No .
At the risk of causing gridlock in south west London , tickets for Roger Federer against Rafael Nadal will be available on a first come , first served basis to those who queue .
Wait for it , wait for it .... before you start grabbing tents out of the shed and legging it to the car , there is every chance that the match will be completed today , although probably after several interruptions .
Here are the details on the Wimbledon rain policy ...
Wet weather policy ( official website ) .
1206 : " I managed to get hold of tickets last night , I just want it to stop raining !!
What 's the likelihood of play ?
If there is none , is it a free for all tomorrow ? "
From SA via text on 81111 ( Er , you 're not going to like this but explanation to follow .... )
1201 : Just to confirm , play is officially meant to get under way now with the girls ' doubles final on Court Two , and the wheelchair doubles final on Court Three .
But it 's raining .
1200 : " Nadal has just had to leg it for cover and end his practice session on court 19 due to a torrential downpour .
Anyone see the pictures of Nadal 's entourage carrying a load of Kit Kat chunkys ( other chunky chocolate based confectionary are available ) for him ?
What sort of a diet is that ?
I might eat one in his honour now .
Mind you they probably cost about £ 2.50 at Wimbledon 's prices .
Crisps cost £ 3.50 !
£ 3.50 !
We 're in the middle of a credit crunch for heaven 's sake . "
BBC Sport Mole 1153 : As the rain falls gently onto Centre Court , we are already misty - eyed about Laura Robson 's glorious victory in the girls ' singles yesterday .
For Britain .
She 's only 14 , you know .
Here 's what 1978 junior champion Tracy Austin says about our girl .
" In Britain you guys tend to build someone up so quickly because you have so many expectations , so what 's most important now is for her mum , her dad , her agent to try to keep her life as normal as possible , not do too many interviews .
Give her time for her game to gel and come together .
She 's only 14 and her parents have to help her out .
I went through it and agents were all over me .
I hope she does well because she 's a great personality . "
1149 : Even the soothing Voice of Wimbledon cannot disguise the facts as he welcomes us to a " rather damp start to the day " .
He adds : " The foreacast is not without hope , with showers predicted between now and 2 pm , followed by sunshine and the risk of showers , coupled with a fresh south - westerly breeze . "
1141 : " Nothing against Federer but I want Nadal to win today .
I love watching Federer and I was wishing he would win French to win all 4 majors , and for the same reason I want Nadal to win today because he 's been in 2 losing finals and came so close last year , but my heart says Nadal my head says Federer .
Let 's hope this is sublime . "
From lionrustbucket on 606 1136 : Rog and Rafa are now out on the practice courts , the Swiss facing serves from a left - hander on Court 17 and the Spaniard , fresh from nearly two hours of practice yesterday , steaming around Court 19 as if he 's playing the final itself .
And with the rain just starting to fall , it may be the closest he gets today .
But enough of that negativity ...
1130 : " I 've just had a chat with a steward and he tells me you can get a ground pass into the All England Club for £ 8 today and there is virtually no queue .
And after 5 pm , you can get in for £ 5 . "
BBC Sport 's Ian Westbrook 1122 : " It 's not easy to forget a defeat like the one Federer had at Roland Garros in a hurry , but the best way to do it is to get out on the court and get some wins under your belt and that 's exactly what he has done .
I do n't really think he can feel any better about his game than he does right now .
He has been flawless . "
Henman on Federer v Nadal 1116 : " I think if Nadal wins the French and Wimbledon , then in everybody 's mind he 's the number one in the world , " says former champion and BBC analyst Boris Becker .
1108 : " Extremely excited about today 's final as long as the rain does n't spoil it .
Nervous looking groundstaff are bowling tennis balls to each other and one young whippersnapper is demonstrating how to bowl a Doosra .
Impressive .
Still no sign of the 99 p cricket bat I brought in the other day though , fuming about that .
Anyhow , the brass band have set up , packed up , then set up again and have now disappeared .
Might be one of those days .
High hopes for some A - grade celebs showing up today "
BBC Sport Mole 1102 : Had the All England Club heeded my advice and played the men's final in Peckham at 7 am this morning , we would already be looking back on a classic encounter and hailing our new / old men 's champion .
But they did not .
As a result , we could be in for a frustrating afternoon .
The covers are across on Centre Court and the skies look threatening .
The weather forecast from BBC Breakfast News says : " It does look like we 'll see a rain delay at Wimbledon first thing , then it's a mixture of sunshine and showers , so we could see intermittent play after a delayed start . "
1100 : This is it , people .
The final day of a fantastic fortnight and the best is still to come .
Roger Federer versus Rafael Nadal for the heavyweight championship of the ( tennis ) world .
Kick - off is at 1400 BST , but we 'll be knee deep in analysis and inane chat between now and then .
-
We 'll be here throughout the day to bring you the latest news from around the All England Club , both on the courts and off , so whether you 're settling down at home , stuck in the office or queuing on Church Road , send us your thoughts .

What are these ?
Will International Law Reach Bush ?
Q : What do Radovan Karadzic , former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , and George W. Bush have in common ?
A : Each lives under the slowly growing shadow of a body of international criminal law .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
This law is evolving towards the ultimate goal of holding even the most powerful leaders personally accountable for crimes committed by the State .
It is manifested in international agreements and statutes such as the Geneva Conventions , case law , two ad hoc war crimes tribunals ( Yugoslavia and Rwanda ) , and a permanent International Criminal Court .
Radovan Karadzic , former Bosnian Serb President , has been arrested and now awaits trial in The Hague before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( I.C.T.Y. ) on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
Dominique de Villepin is one of 33 French military and political leaders who have recently been accused in a report released by the Rwandan government of arming and advising Hutu leaders in the genocide and crimes against humanity of 1994 .
( At the time Rwanda was a French client state and de Villepin was chief aide to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe .
The 500 - page report , based on a two - year investigation , accuses both men of crimes including enabling the genocide by violating a United Nations Security Council Arms Embargo against Rwanda . )
George W. Bush in March 2003 ordered “ Operation Shock and Awe ” ( though officially dubbed “ Operation : Iraqi Freedom ” ) – the unprovoked invasion and occupation of Iraq – presenting the world with a clear prima facie case of aggression .
Aggression , in the words of the judgment delivered at the first Nuremberg Trial , is “ the supreme international crime ” because it unleashes all the other devastation and inhumanity of war .
Personal accountability by state leaders for the crime of aggression – initiating an unprovoked war – is the most profound as well as the most difficult goal of the continuing evolution of international criminal law .
For this reason , and because President Bush is head of the world ’s most powerful state , clearly the shadow of the law is at present less ominous to him than to Karadzic or perhaps to de Villepin .
But there is no statute of limitations for any of these crimes .
Things change over time , often unpredictably .
And the international community has been working steadily towards this difficult goal for decades .
No doubt the work will continue .
Nuremberg Precedent
Although the effort to hold leaders personally responsible for crimes of state goes back to the late 19th century , the first significant watershed was the 1946 judgment of the first Nuremberg trial .
A panel of judges from the U.S. , U.K. , France and the Soviet Union held German leaders personally responsible and punished them for crimes of state , including aggression .
The roots of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals are largely in Nuremberg as are those of the International Criminal Court , although neither ad hoc tribunal charter included aggression .
One of the most significant achievements of the Yugoslavia Tribunal was the first ever indictment of an acting head of state , Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , for crimes committed while still in office .
According to the I.C.T.Y .
Web site , “ the question is no longer whether leaders should be held accountable , but rather how can they be called to account . ”
A major problem with the two courts was that they were each temporary responses to a specific set of separate circumstances which had considerable legal overlap .
The ad hoc approach was clearly limited by issues of logistics , expenses and repetition , many of which could have been more effectively addressed by a permanent court .
The achievements of the two tribunals as well as their limitations gave new impetus to the decades - old effort to establish a permanent International Criminal Court .
On July 17 , 1998 , the great majority of countries of the world voted in Rome , 120 to 7 with 21 abstentions , to establish the International Criminal Court .
With the signature and ratification of 60 states the International Criminal Court came into being on July 1 , 2002 .
Six years later , as of last June 1 , 106 countries have ratified the Rome Statute .
Written into the Statute is a provision for member states to meet seven years after the entry into force ( 2009 ) to consider amendments .
Because the Statute is the result of decades of evolution and five weeks of intense negotiations between 148 countries , it is full of compromises .
Even so , it is remarkable .
Never before has the world community united to create an institution invested with legal authority to write , adjudicate and enforce international criminal law .
And , despite compromises , it is remarkable for the degree to which so many were able to agree on some basics .
Most important among these is a set of “ core crimes ” over which the Court has jurisdiction .
These are : 1 ) genocide , 2 ) crimes against humanity , 3 ) war crimes and 4 ) aggression ( the waging of aggressive war ) .
Conflict over Definition Unfortunately , the Rome conference was unable to agree on a definition of aggression .
Unwilling to leave out “ the supreme international crime ” containing within itself the “ accumulated evil of the whole , ” the conference compromised , including aggression among the ” core crimes ” but leaving it undefined in anticipation of a future amendment defining the crime and setting out conditions for jurisdiction .
One of the weaker aspects of the Statute is , of course , enforcement .
As American Professor Leila Nadya Sadat , a delegate to the Rome conference wrote : “ Here classic paradigms of sovereignty in which each state is master of its territory prevail .
… The I.C.C. ’s ability to effectively enforce international criminal law remains an open question . ”
Unfortunately , a major obstacle to the I.C.C. , enforcement and otherwise , has been the United States .
The U.S. was one of seven countries which voted against the Statute — part of a list which included Iraq , Libya , Israel , Qatar and Yemen .
Despite the vote , President Clinton signed the Statute on Dec. 31 , 2000 .
Less than two years later President George W. Bush “ unsigned it . ”
Other countries such as Russia and Egypt have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute .
Still others such as China and India remain opposed .
If major countries such as Russia , China , India and especially the U.S. ever do decide to join and throw their considerable weight behind the I.C.C. here are a few examples of what the organization may eventually be capable of : --” Treaty crimes ” such as hijacking and narcotics trafficking , while not yet covered by the Statute , are slated to be discussed and possibly defined and amended into the Rome Statue as early as 2009 .
There would be an international institution with the legal power to apprehend , try and punish future Osama Bin Ladens without the catastrophic destruction and waste of war .
-- The genocide visited by Saddam Hussein upon the Iraqi Kurds ( 1984 -1991 ) perhaps could have been stopped , or at least punished upon authorization by the Security Council .
-- There will be a venue for resolving murky situations such as the recent violence in Georgia , where a court of law could be the only place to finally decide if and when aggression and / or other crimes occurred and who was responsible .
-- Assuming that aggression is eventually defined and fully included in the Rome Statute , those who initiate wars of aggression , such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq , will do so knowing there is at least the legal possibility of arrest , trial and prison .
Ironically the United States led the way in establishing the precedent for this when the Allies at Nuremberg tried and punished Germans for aggression and other crimes .
At the moment , the prospect of an American president sitting in the dock of the International Criminal Court seems remote .
It should be remembered , however , that in 1973 , nobody would have believed that 33 years later General Augusto Pinochet would die under house arrest in Chile , facing trial on charges of human rights abuses , including kidnapping and murder , committed during the dark days of Chile ’s military government .
A lot can happen in three decades .
Leaders come and go .
Power ebbs and flows .
National and international perspectives and relationships change .
Imagine the chilling effect the real prospect of arrest , trial and prison for starting a war would have on a head of state considering aggression .
Such a simple and powerful deterrent could move humanity significantly closer to realizing the original vision of the United Nations : a world without war .
There simply can be no lasting peace without justice .
To quote Professor Sadat , “ As humanity struggles to overcome its darkest impulses in this new millennium , impulses that led not only to the slaughter of hundreds of millions during the 20th century , but threaten our very survival , the creation of effective international institutions and regimes is essential … to transform the prohibitions on the commission of genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity and aggression into real tools to deter the cruel and powerful . ”
Next year in New York , the I.C.C. Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression is scheduled to conclude their work on a definition of aggression for inclusion as an amendment to the Rome Statute .
A review conference of the full I.C.C.
Assembly will convene in 2010 to consider this and other amendments .
The work continues .

John McCain does n’t like it when people ask Sarah Palin questions .
And , we ’re learning that just because Sarah Palin says something , it does n’t mean she meant it .
Mean people are sticking microphones in her face — and McCain does n’t like that .
So , he just took back what she said .
Just like that :
Sen .
John McCain retracted Sarah Palin ’s stance on Pakistan Sunday morning , after the Alaska governor appeared to back Sen. Barack Obama ’s support for unilateral strikes inside Pakistan against terrorists
“ She would not …she understands and has stated repeatedly that we ’re not going to do anything except in America ’s national security interest , ” McCain told ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos of Palin .
“ In all due respect , people going around and … sticking a microphone while conversations are being held , and then all of a sudden that ’s — that ’s a person ’s position …
This is a free country , but I do n’t think most Americans think that that ’s a definitve policy statement made by Governor Palin . ”
Saturday night , while on a stop for cheesesteaks in South Philadelphia , Palin was questioned by a Temple graduate student about whether the U.S. should cross the border from Afghanistan into Pakistan .
“ If that ’s what we have to do stop the terrorists from coming any further in , absolutely , we should , ” Palin said .
During Friday night ’s presidential debate in Mississippi , Obama took a similar stance and condemned the Bush administration for failing to act on the possibility terrorists are in Pakistan .
JULY 30 -- Arguing that technology has ensured that " complete privacy does not exist , " Google contends that a Pennsylvania family has no legal grounds to sue the search giant for publishing photos of their home on its popular " Street View " mapping feature .
Responding to an invasion of privacy lawsuit filed by Aaron and Christine Boring , Google has countered that the couple " live in a residential community in the twenty - first - century United States , where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass . "
In a motion to dismiss the Borings 's federal complaint , Google 's six - lawyer team asserts that , " Today 's satellite - image technology means that even in today 's desert , complete privacy does not exist .
In any event , Plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits . "
An excerpt from Google 's U.S. District Court motion can be found here .
The company asserts that the images of the Borings 's Pittsburgh - area residence were " unremarkable photos of the exterior of their home , " and were taken during a " brief entry upon their driveway . "
In their lawsuit , the Borings charged that a Google vehicle - - outfitted with a panoramic camera on its roof -- drove down a private road to take images of their Oakridge Lane home .
In its dismissal motion , Google noted that it intends to prove that there was " no clearly marked ' Private Road ' sign at the beginning " of the Borings 's street .
Google removed its " Street View " photos of the Boring residence and swimming pool after the couple filed its lawsuit in April .

Are you Roman tonight ?
Statue of ' Elvis ' chiselled 1800 years before his birth goes under the hammer
With his dashing chiselled features , swept back hair and perky bouffant the resemblance is unmistakable .
But incredibly this carving of Elvis Presley was created around 1800 years before the King of Rock and Roll first warbled his first note .
The amazing likeness has come to light as part of a sale of ancient antiques by the auction house Bonhams .
Classic Elvis :
The statue bears an unmistakeable resemblance to the real King
The Roman Elvis is in fact a genuine marble acroterion - a kind of architectural ornament often found for decoration on the corners of a sarcophagus , a stone tomb or burial chamber .
The real thing : Elvis in concert in 1968
It forms part of a collection owned by Melbourne - based Graham Geddes - one of the world 's most foremost collectors - which is estimated to sell for more than £ 1 m when it goes on sale in October .
Even the Geddes himself has nicknamed the astounding lookalike ‘ Elvis ’ .
Antiquities specialist Georgiana Aitken added : ' It bears an uncanny likeness to Elvis Presley .
It 's the quiff that does it .
You do some weird and wacky things at the corners of sarcophagi .
' I do n't know what purpose they served and the quiff was not a hairstyle of the day as far as I know . '
The ' Elvis ’ sculpture is 2nd Century AD and is estimated to make £ 25,000 to £ 30,000 .
A spokesman for Bonhams said : " It is perhaps the strangest item in the sale , certainly to modern eyes .
" Fans of the King of Rock 'n Roll , seeing this face from the distant past will be forgiven for thinking that their idol may well have lived a previous life in Rome !
" Looking at this face with its Elvis - like quiff , strong jaw and nose , one is inevitably led to the thought that the human face for all is diversity and subtlety has after all an ability to repeat itself . "
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Joseph Rykwert is one of the world 's leading architectural historians .
He is currently Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture Emeritus and Professor of Art History at the University of Pennsylvania .
He has also authored several highly influential books including " The Idea of a Town " ( 1963 ) and " The Seduction of Place " ( 2000 ) .
Storm clouds gather over Lower Manhattan .
The New York skyline has been imitated in cities all over the world but never bettered .
CNN spoke to Rykwert about how buildings and spaces act as a metaphor for society , our transition from citizens to customers and the challenges facing the built environment in the 21st century .
CNN : What do you mean exactly when you talk about the city and its buildings as a metaphor for society ?
Joseph Rykwert :
One of the obvious things is that when a new big building goes up people immediately find nicknames for it -- the " gherkin " [ 30 St Mary Axe ] and the " testicle " [ City Hall , London ] .
And I 'm told the big new building in Beijing [ CCTV Tower ] by Rem Koolhaas is known as a " crotch " .
So they are usually given nicknames of sexual connotations .
And they 're usually not favorable nicknames because people do n't like anything new .
One of the general considerations about new buildings is that people tend to say that anything new is a monstrosity .
And then after a while they either accept them or they go on thinking that they are monstrosities .
Reactions vary .
This depends to some extent on the quality of the building .
But otherwise , there is that famous passage of Henry James looking at the skyline of New York saying ; whatever it means , it means business .
So that 's certainly what the New York skyline is about -- the enormous energy of American business rising in the way that Chicago did and New York did .
But all that is now over and we no longer think of it in those terms at all .
Skyscrapers no longer have that kind of power .
Partly because there are so many of them and partly because we no longer believe wholeheartedly in the enormous energy of capital and business as a redeeming feature of our lives .
I think we 've grown a bit cynical about it , have n't we ?
CNN : What is your assessment of the increasing prevalence of barriers and CCTV in public buildings and spaces today ?
JR : I think it is a tragic development .
I think it cuts a swathe out of public space .
In a way , I think the American Embassy in London led the way but other institutions have followed .
It has blocked off a bit of London .
Whether embassies are entitled to do that or not , I do n't know .
But it certainly presents itself as a fort or a castle .
That 's the metaphor that occurs to one going past it .
In a way , it suggests foreign domination in a way that embassies never did before .
There are other embassies on the square and they are very modest by comparison .
The growth of security areas is something which is a reflection on our society .
We are a frightened lot in a way that the people of the 1920's and 1930 's were not .
This is not a British phenomenon , it is worldwide .
You find gated communities in India and China perhaps even more than you do in England .
Partly , of course , it 's a feature of the unadvertised growing inequality in our society .
But obviously it is a symptom of fear .
It 's also paralleled by the growth of the great commercial shopping centers which also cut up public space .
Behavior has to be conformable , conforming to .
Everybody has seen The Truman Papers .
I think that kind of conformity is something that is imposed by turning the citizen into a customer .
CNN : Do you think that this is set to continue ?
JR : I hate prophesizing but I can tell you that I hope it does n't .
I do n't know what will happen .
But at the moment London is building the biggest commercial center in Europe , in Shepherds Bush .
It is going to be gigantic .
What it will do to the neighborhood I do n't know .
We shall see how it prospers .
If it does n't bring in the profits expected , then it will have a sort of blight effect on the area which is absolutely terrifying .
If it is successful , and I suspect it will be , then it will certainly suck up a great deal of the energy that 's going round in Shepherds Bush and make it unattractive .
CNN : Do gated communities and the like have any historical precedent ?
JR : Well , tyrants always build castles to keep themselves safe in but on the whole citizens did n't .
There 's always been the sense that the more public the space the more safe it is .
We can't really pretend that the desire for safety is our invention .
But the desire for cutting off areas of the city because the city is generally seen as unsafe is a late 20th century phenomenon .
CNN : Are mixed - use areas are key to a city 's success ?
JR : Mixed use is what cities are all about .
If you do n't have mixed use you do n't have cities .
In the 1960 's local authorities [ in London ] believed that high rises were the answer to popular housing .
Only in one or two cases were there attempts made to make high - density low - rise housing .
The most remarkable example of this was the Brunswick Estate .
It is two stepped blocks of housing with a commercial area in between .
It 's very high density and was abandoned for a while because of rather peculiar renting and commercial considerations .
About four or five years ago it was revitalized and now it 's buzzing .
CNN : How do you view the increasing trend towards building " green " skyscrapers ?
JR : I am all for greening tall buildings but I 'm also very keen to note that greening a building does n't cope with the problem of the tall building in the texture of the city .
I know that Mr Livingstone [ former London mayor ] was very keen on them but if you look at the ways tall buildings come down to the ground , it is always problematic .
It has never been entirely resolved .
It was fine in Chicago in The Loop when the buildings , as it were , absorbed the street .
But even in New York it became problematic and in London even more so .
CNN : When did it start to become a problem in New York ?
JR : If you look at the entrance halls of the skyscrapers of the 1920's and 1930's they are very welcoming .
They are public spaces with enormous amounts of display and marble and so on .
They were havens off the street .
If you look at skyscrapers built in the 1960s onwards , they become tighter and tighter , less and less magnificent , as it were , towards the street , and more security bound .
I think there is a change there in the way that the relationship to the street is perceived which is very radical .
CNN : What 's your opinion on the rapid growth in places like Dubai ?
What sort of signals are they sending out ?
JR : They 're trying to send out the signal that they are doing something else .
But , in fact , what they are showing us is that they are doing exactly the same .
So I think it 's a rather peculiar message .
They are now trying to import cultural institutions to make the places vibrant in the way that western cities are but I do n't quite see that it is going to work .
I could be entirely wrong , but it seems to me that this is a very artificial growth in many ways .
Like all new cities of this kind -- like Brasilia , for instance -- they depend on a separate serving space with very low paid operatives of many kinds -- cleaners , builders and so on .
Brasilia is surrounded by a sea of these settlements .
Even a place like Celebration [ in Florida ] is dependent on a nearby low income village where all the service people live .
There is always a kind of parody of the servant 's space and the serving space and when the serving spaces overflow you have social problems of a major kind .
CNN : So movements like " New Urbanism " are n't the way forward in your view ?
JR : I 'm afraid it 's part of the great move to make citizens into customers .
They actually say so explicitly that they are not about citizenship they are about commerce .
And when you go to Celebration it 's very obvious because the town hall is rather small and relatively insignificant whereas the real estate office is a big tower .
It 's very striking .
The metaphors are very clear .

A sense of movement is often the differentiator between Flash - heavy web sites and standards - based sites .
Flash interfaces have always seemed more alive — responding to the user ’s interactions in a dynamic way that standards - based web sites have n’t been able to replicate .
Article Continues Below
Lately that ’s been changing , of course , with a resurgence in dynamic interface effects , helped along by JavaScript libraries that make it easy — libraries such as Prototype , Scriptaculous , Moo , YUI , MochiKit ( and I could go on ) .
It ’s high time to revisit the CSS Sprites technique from four years ago , and see if we ca n’t interject a little bit of movement of our own .
The examples below demonstrate inline CSS Sprites2 , the technique we ’ll be covering in this article :
Enter the jQuery #section2
So here ’s the first caveat : we ’re going to lean on jQuery to make this happen .
j Query is a maturing JavaScript library that does the same neat stuff as all the other JavaScript libraries , and it has an additional advantage that lends itself particularly well to extending CSS Sprites : jQuery allows us to select elements on a page using a CSS - like syntax that we already know .
We must note the non-trivial extra kilobytes that the library will add to your initial page loads .
An external JavaScript file is cacheable , of course , so it ’s a one - time - only hit the first time a user comes to your site .
The most compact version of jQuery weighs in at 15 k .
It ’s unavoidable overhead , and that may be a cause for concern .
If you ’re already using jQuery on your site for other purposes , the overhead is a non-issue .
If you ’re interested in adding it solely for this technique , consider the file size and decide for yourself whether the effect is worth it .
( Since Google is now hosting jQuery , you could link to their version of the library , as we do in these examples , and hope that many of your users will already have that URL cached in their browser . )
As for other JavaScript libraries ?
There ’s absolutely no reason why you could n’t or should n’t use them ; consider this article an open invitation to port this technique to your library of choice — and link to your port in the comments .
Basic HTML and CSS setup#section3
The first thing we want to do is create a default , unscripted state for users without JavaScript .
( We read Jeremy Keith ’s article from a few years back and are now big fans of unobtrusive DOM scripting , naturally . )
We already have a CSS - only method for rollovers , so let ’s begin by building our navigation to function with a basic CSS Sprites setup .
And because we ’re lazy , we wo n’t build the rollovers a second time , we ’ll just reuse this foundation later and add the jQuery on top of it .
We ’ll get to that in a bit .
I ’ll leave the hows and whys of CSS Sprites to the original article , but there are a few things to clarify below .
Let ’s start with the HTML .
Pay close attention to this structure — we ’ll refer back to it a lot :
< ul class= " nav current - about " > < li class = " home " >< a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li class= " about " >< a href= " # " > About </a></li> < li class=" services " >< a href= " # " >
Services </a></li> < li class=" contact " >< a href= " # " >
Contact</a></li> </ul >
Each class serves a purpose : the containing ul has a class of nav that allows us to target it in our CSS ( and later JavaScript , ) as well as a second class of .current - about that we ’ll use to indicate , within the navigation , which page or section of the site we ’re currently viewing .
Each li element has its own unique class , which we ’ll also use for targeting .
So far so good .
Our navigation ’s markup is a simple and accessible HTML list , and we have enough classes to get going with our Sprites :
.nav { width : 401 px ; height : 48 px ; background : url(../i/blue-nav.gif ) no -repeat ; position : absolute ; top : 100 px ; left : 100 px ; }
We ’ve set the position value to absolute to change the positioning offset to the li , instead of the body element .
We could have used relative instead , to accomplish the same thing while leaving the .nav element within the document flow .
There are reasons to do it either way , but for now we ’ll stick with absolute .
For more on this absolute / relative tossup , see Douglas Bowman ’s article on the subject .
The meat of our Sprites technique is in applying a background image to each of the nav items , and absolutely positioning them within the parent ul :
.nav li a:link , .nav li a :visited { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; height : 48 px ; text - indent : - 9000 px ; overflow : hidden ; } .nav .home a:link , .nav .home a :visited { left : 23 px ; width : 76 px ; } .nav .home a:hover , .nav .home a : focus { background : url (../i/blue-nav.gif ) no -repeat - 23 px - 49 px ; } .nav .home a:active { background : url (../i/blue-nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 98 px ; }
We ’re going a bit further than the original article and defining : focus and : active states .
The former is a minor addition to trigger the hover image when an anchor is subject to either the : hover or : focus states .
The latter adds a new state when the user clicks on a nav item .
Neither is essential , although it ’s a good idea to define them both .
The overflow : hidden ; rule is new too — it ’s just there to prevent some browsers from extending a dotted outline from the element ’s position all the way off the left side of the screen to the negatively - indented text .
Example 1 : Basic CSS Sprites setup .
That gets us to our real starting point — a working Sprite - enabled navigation menu , complete with currently - selected navigation items .
And now to extend it .
Initializing in jQuery#section4
Note that everything below will be placed inside a jQuery function that ensures the code runs only once the document is fully loaded .
The code snippets you see below all assume they ’re running inside this function , so if you encounter errors , remember to check their placement :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { // everything goes here} ) ;
Since the Sprite menu is our fallback state when JavaScript is disabled ( if we ’ve done it right ) , we ’d better get rid of those CSS - applied background images on hover , because we ’ll create our own in the script below :
$ ( ".nav " ) .children ( " li " ) .each ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .children ( " a " ).css ({backgroundImage :" none " } ) ; } ) ;
On the first line , we ’re querying any elements with a class of nav and attaching a new function to each child li element they contain .
That function is on the second line , and it queries the this object for any a child elements .
If it finds them , it sets the CSS background - image property to none .
Given the context , this means the li elements that the function is running on .
Example 2 : Disabling CSS hovers with jQuery .
That works … but we also lose our currently - selected item in the process .
So we need to throw in a check to see which item we ’ve identified with the current - ( whatever ) class we applied to the parent ul , and skip that one from our background image removal .
The previous snippet needs to be expanded a bit :
$ ( ".nav " ) .children ( " li " ) .each ( function ( ) { var current = " nav current - " + ( $ ( this ) . attr ( " class " ) ) ; var parentClass = $ ( " .nav " ) . attr ( " class " ) ; if ( parentClass != current ) { $ ( this ) .children ( " a " ).css ({backgroundImage :" none " } ) ; } } ) ;
The second line now creates a variable called current that uses each li ’s class in sequence to create a string that should match the parent ul ’s classes , if that particular li is the currently - selected item .
The third line creates a second variable which reads the actual value directly from the ul .
Finally , the fourth line compares the two .
If they do n’t match , only then do we set the background - image property of the a element .
This skips the change in background image for the currently - selected item , which is exactly what we ’re shooting for .
Attaching the events #section5
Now we need to attach a function to each of the li elements for every interaction event we want to style .
Let ’s create a function for this , called attachNavEvents :
function attachNavEvents ( parent , myClass ) { $ ( parent + " . " + myClass).mouseover( function ( ) { // do things here }).mouseout( function ( ) { // do things here }).mousedown(function ( ) { // do things here }).mouseup( function ( ) { // do things here } ) ; }
This function takes two arguments .
The first is a string containing the literal class of the parent element , complete with preceding period , as you ’ll see when we call it below .
The second is a string containing the class of the particular li to which we ’re attaching the events .
We ’re going to combine both of those on the first line of the function to create a jQuery selector that targets the same element as the CSS descendant selector of , for example , .nav .home .
( Which element depends on the arguments we ’ve passed to the function , of course . )
Because jQuery allows us to chain multiple functions on a single object , we ’re able to create all the event - triggered functions at the same time .
Chaining is a unique jQuery concept .
It ’s a bit tricky to wrap your mind around — it ’s not essential to understand why this works , so if you ’re confused , just take it for granted that it does work , for now .
Now we ’ll attach these functions to every item in our navigation .
The following is a verbose way — we ’ll optimize it later — but for now , let ’s run the function on every li .
For arguments , we ’ll pass the parent of each , as well as the li ’s own class :
attachNavEvents ( " .nav " , " home " ) ; attachNavEvents ( " .nav " , " about " ) ; attachNavEvents ( " .nav " , " services " ) ; attachNavEvents ( " .nav " , " contact " ) ;
This does n’t do much yet , but we ’re about to fix that .
Example 3 : Basic script setup for events .
The theory #section6
I ’m going to explain what happens next up front .
Stay with me — it ’s important to understand what ’s going on here because you ’ll need to style the elements we ’re manipulating .
For each of the links , we ’ll create a brand new div element inside the li we ’re targeting , which we ’ll use for our jQuery effects .
We ’ll apply the nav image to this new div using the same background - image rule we used for the a element inside the shared parent li .
We ’ll also absolutely position the div within the parent .
It ’s more or less a duplicate of the existing a element in our CSS Sprites setup .
Through trial and error , I ’ve found that this new div creation proves less glitchy than directly applying the jQuery effect to the existing elements — so it ’s a necessary step .
The style for this div must already exist in the CSS .
We ’ll create a new class for this li ( .nav - home ) , based on the class of the targeted li ( so it does n’t conflict with anything else we ’ve created so far ) , and add the style :
. nav - home { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 23 px ; width : 76 px ; height : 48 px ; background : url (../i/blue-nav.gif ) no -repeat - 23 px - 49 px ; }
The practice #section7
Now it ’s time to add the effects .
When the mouseover event is triggered , we ’ll create the div element and give it the previously - mentioned class .
We need it to start out invisible before fading in , so we ’ll use the jQuery css function to set a CSS display value of none .
Finally we ’ll use the jQuery fadeIn function to fade it from hidden to visible , and pass an argument of 200 to that function to specify the duration of this animation in milliseconds ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
function attachNavEvents ( parent , myClass ) { $ ( parent + " . " + myClass).mouseover( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .before ( ' ' ) ; $ (" div.nav - " + myClass).css ( {display :" none " } ) » . fade In ( 200 ) ; } ) ; }
Then , we perform the same in reverse on the mouseout event — we ’ll fade out the div .
Once it ’s finished fading , we ’ll clean up after ourselves by removing it from the DOM .
This is how our attachNavEvents function should look :
function attachNavEvents ( parent , myClass ) { $ ( parent + " . " + myClass).mouseover( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .before ( ' ' ) ; $ (" div.nav - " + myClass).css ( {display :" none " } ) » . fadeIn ( 200 ) ; }).mouseout( function ( ) { // fade out & destroy pseudo - link $ (" div.nav - " + my Class ).fadeOut( 200 , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .remove ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ; }
And that ’s pretty much it for the hovers :
Example 4 : Scripted hover events .
We ’d better do something about the mousedown and mouseup events too , if we had previously defined a change for the :active state in the CSS .
We ’ll need a different class from the hovers so we can target it uniquely in the CSS , so let ’s change the class on mousedown .
We ’ll also want to revert it on mouseup to restore the : hover state , since the user may not have moved their mouse away from the nav item .
Here ’s what the revised attachNavEvents function now looks like :
function attachNavEvents ( parent , myClass ) { $ ( parent + " . " + myClass).mouseover( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .before ( ' ' ) ; $ (" div.nav - " + myClass).css ( {display :" none " } ) » . fadeIn ( 200 ) ; }).mouseout( function ( ) { $ (" div.nav - " + my Class ).fadeOut( 200 , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .remove ( ) ; } ) ; }).mousedown(function ( ) { $ (" div.nav - " + my Class ) .attr ( " class " , " nav - " » + myClass + " - click " ) ; }).mouseup( function ( ) { $ (" div.nav - " + myClass + " - click " ) . attr ( " class " , » " nav - " + my Class ) ; } ) ; }
We can reuse the hover div style , by slightly modifying the background position to adjust which part of our main Sprite image is showing on click :
.nav-home , .nav - home - click { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 23 px ; width : 76 px ; height : 48 px ; background : url (../i/blue-nav.gif ) no -repeat - 23 px - 49 px ; } .nav- home - click { background : url (../i/blue-nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 98 px ; }
Now we ’ve got the hovers , the currently - selected nav item , and click events all worked out :
Example 5 : Putting it all together .
Other considerations #section8
We ’re not limited to the fade effect either .
jQuery has a built - in slideUp / slideDown function we can use as well ( which is shown in the second example at the top of this article ) .
Or , we can get really fancy and create custom CSS - defined animation effects using the jQuery animate function ( as shown in the third example ) .
A word of caution about animate — the results can be a touch erratic , as you may have noticed in the example .
Cross - browser functionality is a bit of a freebie ; jQuery works across most modern browsers , so everything you see here works in IE6 + , Firefox , Safari , Opera , etc .
We ’ve also accounted for multiple graceful degradation scenarios .
If a user has JavaScript turned off , they get basic CSS Sprites .
If they ’ve disabled JavaScript and CSS , they get a basic HTML list .
And , we get the other benefits of CSS Sprites too , since we ’re still using a single image for all the various navigation states and effects .
Though it ’s not required , it ’s strongly suggested that you embrace subtlety ; animation speeds of more than a few hundred milliseconds may be fun to begin with , but they will quickly grate on the nerves of those who use the site you ’re building after the novelty wears off .
Err on the side of quicker animation speeds , rather than slower .
One potential glitch you might run into is when other text on the page seemingly “ flashes ” during animations .
This is a complicated issue that has to do with sub - pixel rendering common in modern operating systems , and the best fix seems to be to apply a just - slightly - less - than - opaque opacity value to force a particular text rendering mode .
If you add this to your CSS , the flashing should clear up at the expense of regular anti-aliased text instead of sub - pixel anti-aliased text :
p { opacity 0.9999 ; }
In the demos this is applied to p , but that caused a conflict with the A List Apart CMS .
But we can apply this rule to any element on the page , so let ’s pick something innocuous .
Packaged to go#section9
You do n’t actually need to remember any script in this article , since there ’s a pre-built function awaiting you in this final example .
Using the JavaScript in the HTML file as a reference , you only need to edit a single line of JavaScript to apply Sprites2 to your site :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { generateSprites ( " .nav " , " current - " , true , 150 , " slide " ) ; } ) ;
The generateSprites function takes five arguments :
The primary class of your parent ul , including the period .
The prefix you ’re using for selected items , e.g. , for a selected class of selected - about , use selected - as the value .
A toggle to indicate whether you ’re styling the : active state .
Set it to true if you ’ve defined the :active state and jQuery equivalents in your CSS , otherwise set it to false .
The animation speed , in milliseconds .
e.g. , 300 = 0.3 seconds .
Your preferred animation style , as a string .
Set to “ slide ” or “ fade ” , it defaults to the latter .
Example 6 : One easy line of script to modify , thanks to the pre-built function .
You will still need to position and style the various scripted elements in your CSS , so feel free to use the CSS file examples in this article as a reference .
During the writing of this article , a similar technique was written up elsewhere , albeit without our nice CSS Sprites fallback .
We also discovered a very different animated jQuery menu that you may find useful .
When World Service correspondent William Reeve dived under his desk in Kabul to avoid shrapnel from the US missile that had landed next door , some think it marked a turning point in war reporting .
The US had scored a direct hit on the offices of the Qatar - based TV station Al - Jazeera , leading to speculation that the channel had been targeted deliberately because of its contacts with the Taliban and Osama bin Laden .
If true , it opens up a worrying development for news organisations covering wars and conflicts : now they could be targeted simply for reporting a side of the story that one party wants suppressed .
Nik Gowing , a presenter on BBC World , was determined to get the issue raised at last week 's News World conference in Barcelona .
While news executives spent most of the four - day event beating themselves up over how they had covered the September 11 disaster and its aftermath , Gowing and a number of fellow journalists wanted to alert their bosses to what they felt was a disturbing shift in US policy .
Gowing 's argument was that Al - Jazeera 's only crime was that it was " bearing witness " to events that the US would rather it did not see .
Indeed there is no clear evidence that Al - Jazeera directly supported the Taliban - simply that it enjoyed greater access than other stations .
Certainly , Al - Jazeera reflects a certain cultural tradition : but only in the same way that CNN approaches stories from a western perspective .
Gowing demanded that the Pentagon be called to account for the destruction of Al - Jazeera 's Kabul office .
Journalists now appeared to be " legitimate targets " , he said .
" It seems to me that a very clear message needs to go out that this must not be allowed to continue . "
It has to be stressed that the Pentagon denies the charge .
Indeed , few senior news executives were prepared to go on the record and give credence to the theory .
But it is not the first time journalists have been deliberately targeted : Serb television was bombed during the Kosovo conflict because it was seen as an agent and advocate of state terrorism .
The situations are somewhat different ( although not by much , some would argue ) .
Al - Jazeera is not an agent of a state , and few ( except perhaps the US military ) would claim that it is an agent of Bin Laden .
But the fact that Al - Jazeera has reported in such depth the other side of this conflict is troubling to the authorities .
" Al - Jazeera has been providing some material that has been very uncomfortable , " Gowing said at News World .
He believes that the western military forces are prepared to target journalists if they get in the way .
He said that representatives of the British special forces had told him : " When a war is not declared , journalists are legitimate targets where they are inconvenient . "
Ron McCullagh , of the independent production company Insight News , was another of those exercised by the implications of the incident .
Other news organisations , by treating Al - Jazeera in a semi- detached fashion , had not helped : at the start of the war the BBC had described it as a " pro-Taliban broadcaster " , McCullagh said .
" This was a very dangerous thing to do .
It could be used as an excuse for bombing them . "
Al - Jazeera certainly believes it was a target .
Speaking on the telephone to News World from Qatar , its chief editor , Ibrahim Hilal , said he believed that its Kabul office had been on the Pentagon 's list of targets since the beginning of the conflict , but that the US did not want to bomb it while the broadcaster was the only one based in the city .
By last week , however , the BBC had reopened its Kabul office under Taliban supervision , with the correspondents William Reeve and Rageh Omar .
On Monday , Al - Jazeera executives in Qatar called their correspondent in Kabul and told him to leave , because they feared for his safety after the Northern Alliance took over .
But after assurances from the Alliance that he would be safe , the reporter , Tasir Alouni , decided to stay .
He did not tell Qatar of his decision - that night , his office was bombed .
At the time , Reeve was being interviewed on BBC World from his bureau in the same street .
Pictures of him diving under his desk to avoid fall - out from the blast have been widely shown on BBC TV .
Hilal said he believed the attack was deliberate and long - planned .
US officials have criticised Al - Jazeera 's coverage of the bombing campaign as inflammatory propaganda .
The station reaches more than 35 m Arabs , including 150,000 in the US .
" I still believe the decision to exclude our office from the coverage was taken weeks before the bombing , " Hilal said .
" But I do n't think they would do that while we were the only office in Kabul . "
He claimed that US intelligence forces routinely monitored communications between Qatar and Kabul - a recent videotape of a Bin Laden statement was played out by satellite to Qatar from Kabul , but not broadcast until seven days later .
Yet , before it was shown , Washington knew of its existence and demanded the right to broadcast a response .
The US would have known , therefore , that Al - Jazeera had ordered its Kabul correspondent to leave , but would not have realised he was still in the city .
If the correspondent had died , there would have been an outcry , and the disaster would have been compounded if Reeve had been seriously injured or killed .
Speaking to the conference from the US military 's central command centre in Florida , spokesman Colonel Brian Hoey denied that Al - Jazeera was a target .
" The US military does not and will not target media .
We would not , as a policy , target news media organisations - it would not even begin to make sense . "
He said that the bombing of Serb television in Belgrade during the Kosovo conflict was a different issue - the targets in question " appeared to have government facilities associated with them " .
Col Hoey said the Pentagon did not have the location co-ordinates of the Al - Jazeera office in Kabul even though the broadcaster said it had passed them on , several times , via its partner CNN in Washington .
The situation is still confused .
Al - Jazeera has a conspiracy theory that it cannot prove , but of which it is genuinely convinced .
Wars are organised chaos and , however much it likes to suggest that it is capable of precision bombing , it is clear that the US has got little idea of what has and has not been hit in this instance .
What can't be disputed is that Al - Jazeera was hit , and the bomb almost took out the BBC , too .
Target or not , the avoidance of the death of an independent journalist by a US bomb appears to be ascribed to a combination of sticky tape on Reeve 's window and a large measure of good fortune .
“ Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence . ” - Eric Fromm
It struck me recently that a lot of people think they know what ’s wrong with this world , and it also struck me that they ’re all wrong .
Seriously — almost every political and religious group , every opinionated person , every publication with an opinion , has said at one time or another what they think is wrong with this world .
Conservatives think that we ’ve become a welfare state ( giving too many handouts to the poor ) , while many liberals think we ’ve allowed too much corporate welfare ( and I tend to agree with this more — we give billions to corporations and much less to the poor and sick ) .
Others think that abortion is the problem , others think it ’s declining morals , others think it ’s infidels , and others say it ’s infidelity .
Other things that are wrong with this world , depending on the group : the media , young people , environmentalists , McDonald ’s , criminals , gays , black people , white people , foreigners overrunning our country , bigots , radicals , the Establishment , poor people , corporations , lazy people , evil people , Fox News , the Internet … the list could go on and on , obviously .
So what ’s really wrong with the world , in my opinion ?
Not a thing .
The Prevailing World-view
It seems to be a prevailing world - view that the world is messed up , that there are just a few things wrong with it , and if we could only get those things to change , the world would be great .
If we could just educate people and get them to realize what ’s wrong with this world , things could change .
This type of view of the world — and like I said , I think it ’s the prevailing view — stems from an ideal that many people have in their heads of what the world should be like .
They might not realize they have that ideal , but it ’s there .
And the world will never reach this Platonic ideal , because it ’s just this image of perfection that does not match reality .
Reality and this ideal are incompatible .
So What ’s Wrong With That ?
Nothing ’s wrong with that , actually .
That ’s how most people are , and I do n’t think I can change that , nor would I want to .
I thought it would be an interesting discussion , though , because I think this discrepancy between what people think the world should be and what the world really is can cause unhappiness .
If you want the world to be completely vegetarian and kind to animals , and it is n’t and wo n’t be in the foreseeable future , you will most likely be unhappy .
If you want the world to go back to how it was during your childhood , or during your parents ’ generation , and it is n’t likely to do so , you ’re not gonna be happy .
The same is true of any of our ideals — do you have an ideal spouse ?
An ideal child ?
An ideal friend , mother , co-worker or roommate ?
It ’s very possible that you do , and also very possible that the reality of the people in your life do n’t meet these ideals .
That might cause you to be unhappy with them .
When reality does n’t meet ideals — and it rarely does — we become unhappy .
So What ’s the Alternative ?
I ’m not proposing that you , or anyone else , change your world - view .
If you , or anyone else , is happy with that world - view , do n’t change it .
But there is an alternative , and I ’m not saying it ’s better .
It ’s the world - view I try to have : instead of having an ideal , stop looking for perfection .
Accept the world as it is , and love it for what it is .
Accept people as they are , and love them .
That ’s not easy , even if it sounds trite and commonplace .
If you have n’t tried it , I recommend you do , because 1 ) it wo n’t be easy ; and 2 ) it could open your eyes to the pre-conceived ideals you did n’t realize you had .
What would be the result of this alternative world - view ?
Well , I think you ’d be happier , if only because you did n’t see the world as a fundamentally flawed or evil place , and began to see the good in the world .
This , however , is open to individual interpretation , and your own experience is likely to be different than mine .
Does this mean that we should give up on trying to make positive changes in the world ?
Should we stop trying to make the world a better place ?
Nosireebob !
Do n’t ever stop trying to do good things !
Even if the world is already a good place , we can always find happiness and satisfaction in trying to do good , in trying to make people ’s lives better .
But what about all the evil and suffering in the world ?
Should we accept and love that as well ?
That ’s the toughest part , I think .
It ’s hard to accept that people are dying of diseases and famine and war and murder and abuse , and perhaps impossible to love that aspect of the world .
You do n’t have to love it , but it helps to try to really understand it .
Why does this happen ?
What are the deeper reasons ?
At the hear of the deepest reasons is humanity — we are all flawed creatures in some way , and that ’s what makes us human and beautiful .
Why would someone commit violence , for example ?
Because they are evil ?
There are numerous reasons , but at the heart of it is probably that this person was hurt , abandoned , abused , or neglected in some way , at some point in his life .
That person needs our compassion more than anyone .
And if we try to understand this person , or understand the heart of any violence in the world , then we can better apply the love and compassion that ’s need to heal this pain and make the world a better place .
Like I said , this world - view is n’t easy .
It requires a lot of compassion , and therefore a lot of understanding and patience and a willingness to open your heart in a way that the prevailing world - view does n’t .
However , I think it ’s worth the effort — at least , it has been in my life .
I do n’t claim to be perfect , and I admit that I fail all the time .
I judge others , and condemn things , along with everyone else .
But when I catch myself at that , and really examine the reasons why , I begin to see that I am making quick judgments , and not really trying to understand things .
When I reverse that , and try to find the compassion needed , it changes me — in a wonderful way .
How to Love the World as It Is
So let ’s say that you ’d like to try this world - view .
You ’d like to love people , and the entire world , as it is , and not as you ’d like it to be .
How do you go about doing that ?
There are six things I recommend doing :
1. Stop looking for perfection and ideals .
Realize that you have an ideal in your head , and that it is probably incompatible with the world .
It might be an ideal about a person , or about how things should be .
The world , and people , are not perfect .
Stop looking for perfection , and realize that it is already here .
2. Observe .
Instead of looking at this ideal picture in your head , look at what ’s really there .
What is the world really like ?
What are people really like ?
The only way to know this is to observe .
Listen to people .
Look at the world around you .
Gather data , from reality .
3. Understand .
Now that you have this data , start asking questions .
Why are people the way they are ?
Why did someone do what they did ?
Why does this problem really exist ?
Do n’t stop at the first answers you come up with — dig deeper , and deeper , until you really understand something .
Seek to understand before you judge , in all situations .
Sometimes that will require imagination — you wo n’t be able to really know the root of something unless you personally investigate everything , but instead sometimes you can try to imagine what made a person the way they are , or a situation what it is .
“ To understand everything is to forgive everything . ” – Buddha
4. Accept .
Once you ’ve observed and begun to understand , accept that this is the way the world is .
This is who the person is .
The world is n’t going to meet any ideal — it is what it is , and while it will always change , it probably wo n’t change to meet your ideal .
The person in question is exactly the same — they wo n’t meet your ideal , but are who they are .
Accept this as fact .
5. Love and compassion .
Once you ’ve accepted things or people as they are … try to find it in your heart to love them , as they are .
The way to do this is to see the good in everything and everyone , and if you ’ve sought to really look and understand , you will find good in everything .
When you see bad things , understand that this is because of suffering , and have compassion and seek to end that suffering .
6. Enjoy life .
The world is a wonderful place once you ’ve accepted it for what it is and sought to love it .
People are wonderful creatures , full of life and creativity and messiness and uniqueness .
Accept this , understand it , love it .
And enjoy this gift we ’ve been given , for it is incredible .
And perfect , just as it is .
“ Have compassion for all beings , rich and poor alike ; each has their suffering .
Some suffer too much , others too little . ” – Buddha

McCain will stay away from Hill today
John McCain is in Washington all day today but staying away from Capitol Hill as negotiations on the $ 700 billion bailout enter a critical phase .
Senior campaign adviser Mark Salter says McCain is busy making calls from his Arlington , Va. , campaign headquarters to key members of Congress , but will not make any special trip to Capitol Hill , as he did Thursday when negotiations got under way .
McCain is staying away " because he can effectively do what he needs to do by phone , " Salter said , according to a press pool report .
" He ’s calling members on both sides , talking to people in the administration , helping out as he can . ’’
Security guards contracted by the DHS threw a woman out of a Social Security office in Van Nuys for wearing a t - shirt that read " lesbian.com . "
He claimed that " The Rules and Regulations Governing Conduct on Federal Property " gave him the right to throw her out for wearing a t - shirt with the word " lesbian " on it .
As she headed for a line to pick up a Social Security card for her son , Gilbert was stopped by a guard who said her T - shirt , naming an educational and resource Web site for gay women , was offensive .
She said the guard , who works for a private company hired by the Department of Homeland Security , demanded that she leave the building or face arrest .
Troops and militants are blamed for civilian deaths
At least 250 Afghan civilians have been killed or wounded in insurgent attacks or military action in the past six days , the Red Cross says .
It has called on all parties to the conflict to avoid civilian casualties .
Nato said separately that more than 900 people including civilians had died in Afghanistan since the start of 2008 .
On Monday a suicide bombing in Kabul killed more than 40 people , while officials say two coalition air strikes killed dozens at the weekend .
The issue of civilian casualties is hugely sensitive in Afghanistan .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly urged foreign forces to exercise more care .
' Constant care '
The statement released by the International Committee of the Red Cross say that civilians " must never be the target of an attack , unless they take a direct part in the fighting " .
More and more civilians are being killed in Afghanistan
The organisation 's chief representative in Kabul , Franz Rauchenstein , made his findings public following Monday 's suicide car bomb attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul and reports that a US - led coalition air strike had killed members of a wedding party in the east of the country .
" We call on all parties to the conflict , in the conduct of their military operations , to distinguish at all times between civilians and fighters and to take constant care to spare civilians , " Mr Rauchenstein said .
His report said that parties to the conflict " must take all necessary precautions to verify that targets are indeed military objectives and that attacks will not cause excessive civilian casualties and damage " .
The statement also expressed concern " about the reportedly high number of civilian casualties resulting from the recent [ coalition ] air strikes in the east of the country " .
The Taleban has denied involvement in Monday 's bombing , which killed 41 people , while the US - led coalition has disputed claims that its recent airstrikes killed civilians .
Mr Karzai has ordered an investigation into one of the bombings , in eastern Nangarhar province .
Locals there said at least 20 people had been killed on Sunday at a wedding party .
US forces rejected the claims , saying those killed were militants involved in previous mortar attacks on a Nato base .
The UN said recently that the number of civilians killed in fighting in Afghanistan had jumped by nearly two thirds compared to last year .

As it turns out , there is a way to render the most vocal Obamamanic speechless :
Ask if the possibility – however slight , however remote – of their candidate losing is something that may have ever , for the briefest moment , crossed their mind .
“ I had n’t even thought about it , ” says Brooklynite Jeff Strabone , who has gone so far as to adopt Obama ’s middle name , Hussein , as his own .
( “ I thought , ‘ Let ’s make it an asset – like , “ I am Spartacus ! ’ “ ) .
Strabone was planning to keep the Hussein through election day , but if Obama loses , “ I may have to keep it a little longer . ”
Also , he would cry : “ That ’s what I ’ll do .
It would mean the country wants to go backwards , towards fear , anti-intellectualism .
I do n’t know . . .
I do n’t even want to think about it . ”
“ It ’s funny – I had n’t even thought about it once , ” says Jake Abraham , who has produced events for the Obama campaign .
“ It ’s totally possible – we ’re often in the situation where the Democrat loses .
George Bush was a terrible , terrible president .
But Karl
Rove was very sly , and he put together a very mannered strategy that worked .
There are plenty of uninformed voters out there , and all you have to do is scare them . ”
It may not take much .
According to a recent Newsweek poll , those white voters most reluctant to vote for a black man are , shockingly , in the 18 - 29 age group .
“ I would imagine that those voters are , for the most part , uneducated , ” says Michael Fauntroy , author of “ Republicans and the Black Vote . ”
Fauntroy subscribes to the conventional wisdom that Obama ’s only two obstacles are inexperience and race , with only one of those issues up for discussion .
“ The media does n’t want to talk about race because you could inflame the issue , ” he says .
“ The GOP does n’t want to have this discussion either .
No one wants to have it . ”
Fauntroy believes that the Bradley effect , by definition unquantifiable , may be responsible for Obama ’s inability to break open a wider lead against McCain in the polls .
“ I think the election is Obama ’s to lose , ” he says .
“ Some people feel he slayed the most important dragon you could slay , and that ’s Hillary Clinton .
So if he loses , the millions of people who have always felt that their vote does n’t matter , that have been energized by Obama – they will be out of the process for decades , I think .
Because they will feel that the process does n’t work . ”
On the critical issues driving this election – the economy , the Iraq war , health care – more registered voters agree with Obama .
He also possesses those rare , esoteric qualities that tend to be underestimated and tend to predict victory : charisma and optimism .
“ When you ask most Americans who the best American presidents were , they say , ‘ Washington , Lincoln , FDR ’ – and then they add Kennedy and Reagan , ” says presidential historian Robert Dallek .
As with Obama , “ those two gave the country hope and inspired so many people – JFK with the New Frontier and Reagan with Morning in America .
Obama has had this meteoric rise because he has been able to capture people ’s desire for hope . ”
As with the 1932 election – when anti-Hoover , anti-GOP sentiment was at its apex – “ this election is about George W. Bush , ” says Dallek ( who predicts an Obama victory by the slimmest of margins ) .
“ It ’s a repudiation of this presidency , the war , the state of the economy . ”
But curiously , a recent
Fox poll showed that among registered voters , McCain and Obama were nearly tied – yet 51 % of those same voters expect Obama to win the presidency .
That perception gap between the number of people who will vote for him versus the number of people expected to vote for him could lead to a disappointing November .
“ If Obama loses , it will deepen the cynicism and frustration of Democrats in general and particularly his supporters , ” Dallek says .
“ And I think there will be a feeling that race sunk him . ” Fauntroy agrees .
Though he , too , thinks an Obama defeat unlikely , he fears it would crush the black community .
“ The African - American voters I know have so much emotionally invested with Obama ; there are so many disaffected voters who have put their hopes and dreams on him , ” he says .
“ It would confirm the suspicions that so many African - Americans have , that white America will not accept black people .
Especially because Obama is the least threatening black man you could ever . . .
If he ca n’t win , who can ? ”

In a recent LRC blog post , it was suggested that in the midst of our current credit crisis — where the Fed is trying all sorts of tricks to prevent Wall Street traders from looking down and realizing they ran off the cliff months ago — the prudent thing to do is become debt - free .
Pay off your credit cards , and do n’t even take out a mortgage , if you can avoid it .
This will not only help you personally to weather the upcoming storm , but it will also annoy the ruling elites , which is itself something most LRC readers would value at least at $ 20,000 .
I generally endorse this analysis ; it is certainly more sensible than the Hank Paulson recommendation , which — as best I can tell — runs something like this : " Hey everyone , go buy some stuff at the mall , stop trying to sell your house , and stop shorting US stocks ! "
In particular , in the bust phase of a Fed - induced business cycle , the best thing people can do to alleviate the crisis is to save more .
This will render the low rates during the boom phase less fictitious than if people continue with their original saving rate .
( Of course , you should n’t save more just to " ease the recession . "
The purpose of the economy is to deploy resources in the way that best satisfies consumer preferences .
If you do n’t want to save more , then do n’t do it out of some sense of duty . )
Notice that this analysis is the exact opposite of the Paulson doctrine , especially when discussing the " stimulus " checks .
Having said all this , it does not follow that you should pay down your dollar - denominated debts .
I personally just moved some of my credit card debt ( partly a remnant from grad school days ) onto a card that is giving me 0 % through August 2009 , with a 3 % transfer fee .
I have a pretty high income — the vast right - wing propaganda machine pays well , my friends , you should look into it — and so they gave me a large line of credit .
Now let ’s say next month my wife and I are responsible and come up with $ 5,000 with which to pay down credit card balances .
As long as I can move my balances to cards rolling over at low rates ( like , zero ! ) , even counting the transfer fee I would do much better using that $ 5,000 to buy some Krugerrands .
I personally think it is entirely possible that any of the following will happen within the next twelve months :
Israel and / or the US will bomb Iran , in which case oil shoots to at least $ 175 / barrel and gold shoots to at least $ 1200 / oz .
Year - over - year consumer price inflation ( even by the official measures ) exceeds 10 percent .
Gold rises at least 15 percent during this period .
The Federal Reserve runs out of Treasurys and so ca n’t " sterilize " the massive loans it has been making to banks ( see chart below ) .
Bernanke has to decide whether to discontinue the life support , or start expanding the money supply like crazy .
He opts for the latter , and the dollar gets pummeled in the foreign exchanges .
Gold soars .
In light of these possibilities , building up a decent position in hard money ( i.e. gold ) seems pretty smart , especially if the Fed will debase the currency .
That ’s the beauty of it :
Yes , in nominal terms your credit card balances will rise by a certain amount ( depending on your credit rating and the deal you can get ) , but in real terms your debt can actually shrink .
Your salary will go up due to the printing press ( albeit not as much as milk prices , perhaps ) so that it will be easier for you to pay the ( slightly higher ) balances a year from now , versus paying them down today with your current salary .
For those wishing to read about even more exotic moves , like taking out the equity in your US - based house , and then using the freed up dollars to buy foreign assets , I highly recommend Peter Schiff ’s book .
Final warning : Naturally credit cards are the work of a top demon , if not the devil himself .
I wish I never started using them .
But the point is , if you have strong willpower , it might actually make sense for you to divert your savings to other areas , rather than paying down dollar - denominated debts .
POSTSCRIPT : This is completely unrelated to the above article ( or is it ? ) , but I have just watched the documentary Why We Fight , which is a scathing analysis of the military - industrial - Congressional complex .
It is very well done , weaving together expert commentary from Chalmers Johnson , LRC ’s own Karen Kwiatkowski , and even Gore Vidal , along with " regular guy " commentary from a retired cop whose son died on 9/11 , and a mixed - up kid who joins the military .
There are also interviews with Richard Perle and William Kristol , and great footage of Don Rumsfeld at press conferences .
Especially for younger viewers ( like me ) who grew up with a huge standing army and multibillion - dollar " defense " expenditures , I highly recommend it .
There ’s a little lefty confusion about the nature of capitalism ( versus the much ballyhooed democracy ) , but other than that it ’s really well done .

Question
I am finding myself strongly attracted to a man .
I feel I know him very well .
The strange thing is , I 'm happily married .
This attraction is a total surprise .
Could this man be from a past life ?
Community Answer
It is possible .
You may have enjoyed a past life with this man .
But do n't think that makes the choices you have made in this life previous to meeting him invalid .
Often , we meet up with the same people because we are bonded in some way , or have something to teach each other .
Look at the circumstances of your current life , and any issues that you have been dealing with , and ask yourself if meeting this man answers a question , helps with an issue , or makes you look at things a different way .
It is also is a chance to perhaps not repeat a similar mistake .
The same choices will often pop up for us in different lives , giving us the chance to either experience it again , or make a different choice .

A New York Post account ...
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson on Wednesday said the United States needs a regulatory overhaul , similar to changes made to the system after the Great Depression .
“ It ’s clear there have been some regulatory breakdowns , ” Donaldson said at a CFA Institute conference in New York .
“ As we move forward , the structures need to be changed ... we have to have really serious examinations of our regulatory institutions and their mandates . ”
Donaldson , who was chairman of the SEC from 2003 through 2005 , said the current market turmoil should result in careful changes being made to the system as the structure of U.S. markets has changed drastically since the main U.S. securities law , the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , was put into effect .
“ As demand for regulation increases , which it is and will , I think we really have to figure out the structure , ” Donaldson said .
“ The institutions of regulation ... these were all products of the 1929 crash and depression . ”
In that era it “ was easy to tell what is a bank , ” Donaldson said , but new and more creative areas of financing have changed that .
For example , the credit crisis has brought billions in government support to financial companies that were not traditional banks , like investment bank Bear Stearns , insurer American International Group and mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
After the $ 85 billion bailout of AIG this week , Donaldson said the insurance industry was ripe for a new kind of regulation .
“ One of the longer term problems , if you will , is the insurance industry being regulated by state regulators , ” Donaldson said . ” It ’s a long - term situation , very difficult to change , but I think any sort of reorganization has to bring some new thoughts on how to coordinate the regulation of that industry . ”
However , Donaldson suggested any overhaul should be pursued after the political tensions from the U.S. presidential election have passed .

While the country waits anxiously for Congress and the White House to agree on a plan to prevent economic collapse , others on the hill are already searching for whom to blame .
House Oversight Committee Democrat Henry Waxman has already summoned the former chief of Lehman Brothers , the failed investment bank whose collapse stunned the nation last week , to testify under oath before his committee next week .
And late today , Waxman publicly blasted the former Wall Street titans for not cooperating with requests for documents and emails , saying Lehman 's counsel has told the committee " although these documents did exist at one time , they were typically " discarded . " "
" It is difficult to understand how Lehman Brothers is unable to produce a single internal document that went to or from the CEO 's office over the past six months , " the letter stated .
" It is also difficult to understand why there is no log , file , or other record documenting where these internal documents went . "
Lehman Brothers did not immediately return a call from ABC News seeking comment .
Separately , an audit requested by Republican Senator Charles Grassley was released Friday , offering a highly critical report of the Security and Exchange Commission 's own leadership .
The audit said officials failed to act in the face of potential red flags or take action against Bear Stearns ' " concentration of mortgage securities , high leverage , shortcomings of risk management in mortgage - backed securities and lack of compliance with the spirit of certain " international standards .
" It is indisputable that the CSE program failed to carry out its mission in its oversight of Bear Stearns , " the report said .
" The audit found that procedures and processes were not strictly adhered to . "
Grassley responded Friday said the report is " another indictment of failed leadership . "
All this comes before an agreement on how to save the nation 's economy has even been settled .

Hubble Space Telescope images of the young star cluster NGC 3603 showing the position of the newly - weighed most massive star " A1 " and its companion " C " .
Astronomers have confirmed the weight of the most massivestar in the galaxy .
This behemoth , estimated to be roughly 116 times the mass ofthe sun , dwarfs mostother stars in the galaxy .
In fact , the next most massive star is about 89 solar masses , and it is a gravitationally bound sister to the record setter .
The next most massive ever weighed is 83 solar masses .
Theory holds that stars can be up to about 150 solar masses .
Discovery of the record - setting stars were first announcedlast year .
The new measurements are rough , and the stars might turn out tobe considerably heavier or lighter .
" A star having a little over a hundred times morematerial in it than the sun is rare , " said researcher Anthony F. J. Moffatof the Universit ? de Montr?al .
" For every star like it you get tens ofthousands of stars like the sun formed .
So finding them is hard .
That ?s whyvery few have been known and measured . "
Moffat , with Olivier Schnurr , Jules Casoli and Andr?-NicolasChen ? and Nicole St - Louis of the Universit ?
de Montr?al used measurements fromthe European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope in Chile , and infraredimages from the Hubble Space Telescope to refine estimates of the two giantstars ' masses .
By measuring how the stars orbit around each other , theresearchers were able to calculate each one 's mass , though the level ofuncertainty is still quite high ( the larger weighs 116 plus - or - minus 30 solarmasses , while the smaller weighs 89 plus - or - minus 15 solar masses ) .
Theastronomers hope to refine these calculations even further with futureobservations .
The heavyweight binary , called A1 , is in the star clusterNGC 3603 , which lies in the Carina spiral arm of the Milky Way , around 20,000 light - years away from our solar system .
The two A1 stars are thought be " Wolf - Rayet " stars , which are very hot , heavy and evolved stars that appear to be losing alarge amount of mass in a stellar wind , similar to our sun 's solar wind , butstronger .
These stars are so large and luminous that the pressure of theiroutward - pouring radiation outweighs the inward pull of their gravity , somaterial is constantly being blown away into space .
These stars can lose a significant portion of their mass ?
ten of percent of their total bulk ?
to this process over their lifetimes .
Themore massive a star is , the shorter its lifetime , since it tends to burnthrough itself quicker .
These very huge stars only live for 2 to 3 millionyears before dyingin supernovae explosions .
Now that the researchers have found that the massive starsin A1 are Wolf - Rayet stars , it may help them locate similar finds .
" We 're on to something new , that the most massive starsare probably like this , " Moffat told SPACE.com " This is a newrevelation , I think .
We should look for Wolf - Rayet stars like this . "
Confirming the mass of these gigantors is important becausetheories of star formation predict the existence of extremely massive starsweighing up to 150 times the mass of our sun .
Besides these two , though , noother stars yet discovered have come close to that upper range .
The same research team previouslyannounced the discovery of this system in 2007 , but the research had notbeen published yet in a peer - reviewed journal .
In the meantime , they havefurther refined the measurements , and have recently detailed their findings inthe September 2008 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the RoyalAstronomical Society .

Advertisement Pressure is building on Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej , amid spiralling protests against his rule .
Activists who had been holed up in the main government complex for almost four days spilled out to surround police headquarters before being dispersed .
Outside Bangkok , strikes in support of the protests have disrupted travel .
The head of the army dismissed rumours of a coup , but called on the government to negotiate with protesters , which the authorities have so far refused to do .
The army will not stage a coup .
The political crisis should be resolved by political means
Gen Anupong Paochinda
Q&A : Bangkok protests Rifts behind the political crisis Profile : Samak Sundaravej
The protests are being led by a conservative group called the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) .
They say Mr Samak is a puppet of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted by a military coup in 2006 and is now in exile to avoid facing trial over corruption charges .
According to the BBC correspondent in Bangkok , Jonathan Head , the position of Mr Samak , who had hoped he could tough out these protests , now looks precarious .
The prime minister has said he might declare a state of emergency if the situation worsens .
Protests spread
In a matter of hours , the tables have turned against Thailand 's embattled prime minister , our correspondent says .
Earlier this week Mr Samak was praised for his restraint in dealing with the PAD , which has been occupying his office compound since Tuesday .
But he suddenly found his position weakened late on Friday when the police pulled back and the triumphant protest leaders were left in control of the complex .
See a map of key protest areas in Bangkok About 2,000 of them then besieged the city 's police headquarters .
Police fired what appeared to be tear gas on the crowds , and they dispersed shortly afterwards .
One correspondent reported seeing several protesters vomiting .
Demonstrations are also said to have taken place at two major airports in the south of the country .
At Phuket airport , tourists shut in by protesters had to struggle over the perimeter fence ( pic courtesy of BBC reader Simon Luttrell ) Phuket and Krabi airports have closed , and there were reports of blockades in Hat Yai .
Reports suggested protesters were planning to mount similar actions at Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in the north .
Some rail workers have gone on strike in support of the protests , and to demand better work conditions , disrupting services on lines from Bangkok to the country 's north - east .
And union leaders - including those from flagship airline Thai Airways - have called for workers to join in the stoppage .
Precarious Rumours of an impending coup have been circulating in Thailand throughout the week , our correspondent says .
KEY EVENTS
Sept 2006 : Bloodless coup by military sees PM Thaksin Shinawatra removed from office April 2007 : New military - drafted constitution approved Dec 2007 : General election won by People Power Party ( PPP ) , seen as reincarnation of Thaksin 's now banned Thai Rak Thai party Jan 2008 : Samak Sundaravej chosen as PM Feb 2008 : Thaksin returns from exile May 2008 : PAD protests against Samak begin July 2008 : Thaksin goes on trial for corruption ; his wife is found guilty of fraud .
By mid-August the family has fled to the UK August 2008 : PAD protests escalate
For three days Gen Anupong has deliberately kept his forces above the fray .
But on Friday he decided it was time to step in - insisting the military would not mount a coup , but also calling on the government to negotiate with protesters .
" The army will not stage a coup .
The political crisis should be resolved by political means , " he said , according to AP news agency .
The military 's involvement is an indication of the seriousness of the current situation - and correspondents say that some senior military officers are believed to be pressing the prime minister to offer his resignation .
Anti-Thaksin
This crisis began on Tuesday , when thousands of PAD supporters took to the streets of Bangkok and forced their way into government buildings and a state TV station .
Nine PAD leaders now face charges of insurrection for these actions , a crime that could potentially carry the death penalty .
The PAD was originally formed in the months before the 2006 coup , to demand Mr Thaksin 's resignation .
It has re-emerged now that the country is being led by his former ally Mr Samak .
It has a passionate following in various parts of the country , especially Bangkok , and some powerful backers among the elite , our correspondent says .
But it has little support in most of rural Thailand , which voted strongly for Prime Minister Samak , and Mr Thaksin before him .

What are these ?
PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans who watched the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 gave Barack Obama the edge over John McCain as having done the better job in the debate , by a 46 % to 34 % margin .
These results are based on a special USA Today / Gallup poll conducted on Saturday , Sept. 27 , the first day after the debate .
The questions about the debate were asked of a random sample of 1,005 national adults as part of the Gallup Poll Daily tracking program on Saturday .
Of the total sample of adults , 63 % said they had watched the debate .
Of the 37 % that did not watch the debate , 12 % said that they had seen , heard , or read news coverage of the debate , and the rest said they had neither seen the debate nor news coverage thereof .
The data show a predictable pattern of response from Republicans and Democrats .
Seventy - two percent of the former and 74 % of the latter said that their party 's candidate did the better job in the debate .
This reinforces the conventional wisdom that many viewers watch a debate through their preexisting perceptual framework and end up with nothing more than reinforcement for what they believed before the debate began .
But among the crucial group of independents who watched the debate -- those most likely to actually be swayed by what transpired , Obama won by 10 points , 43 % to 33 % .
Not only did Obama win the debate among debate watchers , they say that their attitudes towards the Democratic candidate also improved as a result .
Thirty percent of debate watchers said they came away with a more favorable image of Barack Obama , while just 14 % said they had a less favorable image .
On the other hand , John McCain did not fare as well .
Just as many watchers said that they developed a less favorable image of John McCain -- 21 % -- as said they gained a favorable image of McCain as a result of the debate .
Although the debate was supposed to deal with foreign policy , the first portion of the questions asked by moderator Jim Lehrer focused on the economy and the financial bailout plan being negotiated by Congress .
This economic focus appears to have been positive for Obama ; debate watchers ended up with more confidence in Obama 's ability to deal with the economic problems facing the country , rather than less confidence as a result of the debate .
By contrast , 37 % of debate watchers said that the debate gave them less confidence in John McCain on economic matters rather than more .
Debate watchers saw little difference between the two candidates on national defense and foreign policy as a result of the debate ; both Obama and McCain appeared to have come away with slightly improved images on foreign policy .
Finally , by a fairly substantial margin , debate watchers said that Obama was the candidate who offered the best proposals for change in the debate , by a 17 percentage point margin over McCain .
Implications
History shows that " winning " the first presidential debate does not necessarily translate into winning the election .
Ross Perot , Al Gore , and John Kerry are among those who were seen by debate watchers in quick reaction polls as having done the better job in the first debate of their campaign year , and all eventually lost their elections .
There are two presidential ( and one vice presidential ) debates yet to come , and much can change .
The most important indicator of the impact of the debate may be trends in overall candidate support , where , at the moment , Obama leads McCain .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,005 national adults , aged 18 and older , and 701 people who watched the Sept. 26 presidential debate , conducted Sept. 27 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points , and for the sample of debate watchers , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum sampling error is ± 4 % . .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as this one , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .

And who out there does n’t like the sound of “ toxic debt ” in our budget ?
Now that we ’re about to be the proud owners of hundreds of billions or even a trillion worth of rubbish from Wall Street , a very small details are coming out .
It ’s still debatable whether we ’re actually paying an inflated or fair price or if we will ever see the dreamy returns ( 12 % over two years , hooray ! ) on our AIG bailout .
( People are hearing what they want to hear on AIG and I remain unconvinced so far . )
Democrats have thrown in a good issue to this bailout debate , which is that we ought to control the level of executive compensation for firms involved in this oh - so - sweet , lifestyle saving deal .
That ’s not a bad starting point , but hello , has anyone looked at annual compensation throughout those companies ?
I have repeatedly said we are funding their lifestyle and yes , even if we cut back the money at the top , the money being made in this industry is well above the norm .
What part of “ they made a killing by selling trash ” are people not understanding here ?
Even fresh out of school youngsters with no experience are easily raking in $ 150,000 + because there was so much profit from selling trash to the world .
Why should everyone in America , who just financed tax cuts for the wealthiest and who fund oil - rich Iraq and who bailed out Freddie , Fannie and AIG , also continue to fund this money craze on Wall Street ?
This lifestyle of luxury goes so much deeper so let ’s quit pretending that we do n’t have any say in this , because we do .
We effectively own Wall Street ’s future so let ’s debate this through while we have their attention and some control .
I ’m not comfortable with former Goldman Sachs executive Hank Paulson making these decisions .
He ’s a Wall Street insider who has a soft spot for his friends .
He ’s not an elected official and should not make this call .
I understand that greed is what makes Wall Street tick and to a large degree I ’m fine with that .
When proper oversight is present , the system generally works well for the US .
However , when that greed becomes our collective problem , this is a completely different story .
It is more than fair to ask “ what are we getting out of our bailout and toxic debt purchase ? ”
Rushing through this process to save their sorry asses is no excuse .
The taxpayers of America have saved the day for the Wall Street spongers and free market phonies so now could not be a better time to have this discussion .
Asking for our fair share back makes sense , but so does altering this dysfunctional system that is dragging us all down .
I was invited by Conor McBride to give a talk MSFP 2008 in Reykjavik .
I 've put the slides online here .
While rehearsing I wrote a ' script ' that I 've put here .
That 's not actually what I said but I felt I needed to write something out beforehand just so I could make sure I had an appropriate amount of material .
Apologies for the silly chatty style in a written document but that 's the sort of thing that came to mind while sitting in a hotel room .
I got to meet in person a bunch of people whose papers I 'd read including Thorsten Altenkirch , Tarmo Uustalu and Jeremy Gibbons .
I had an opportunity to explore around Reykjavik so I also put some photos online , including a terrible one of Conor and Tarmo Uustalu ( sorry ! ) .
By curious coincidence I bumped into , and got to hang out with , an old work colleague as well as a friend of the person who sits one office down from me at work , and Eben Moglen .
Small world .
Many parents were appalled when we saw on our television screens a video of workers abusing a downer cow with electric shocks because the cow was too sick to stand up .
We were even more horrified to learn that meat from that cow had gone into lunches served by the federal School Lunch Program .
The scandal at the Hallmark / Westland plant in Chino , Calif. , has sparked interest in the current trend of securing local meat from sources that are grass - fed , organic and come from animals raised humanely .
Our kids deserve the safest meat in their food .
Sadly , Congress is now considering squashing such efforts to get local foods into the School Lunch Program .
In June , the House Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee , at the behest of Representatives Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . ) and David Obey ( D - Wisc. ) , said it was considering a provision that would force schools to buy meat for the School Lunch program from sources enrolled in the federal government ’s National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) .
The NAIS is hugely controversial among family farmers like me .
The U.S. government wants us to inventory , identify and track the movement of all agriculture related animals .
Step one is a premise registration where a federal ID number is assigned to our farm .
The second step involves tagging each of our animals with Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags .
And finally , we must report to the government any planned movement of our animals .
These onerous and far - reaching conditions have spawned a revolt among many of us seeking to provide high quality , safe food for consumers and our communities .
Most animal disease occurs in factory farm operations where thousands of animals are confined in filthy conditions .
Yet perversely , factory farms are allowed to have one group ID number , while my 60 cow grass - based dairy must have individual RFID tags that cost $ 3 each in Wisconsin , even with government subsidies .
Then I will be forced to purchase a $ 1,000 electric wand in order to be able to read the tags and report animal movements to the government .
Animals from horses to alpacas to llamas are covered under the NAIS and no one is exempt .
Little wonder that so many farmers across the United States have expressed their anger at this Big Brother program that threatens to put us all out of business .
Here in Wisconsin , considered a “ model ” state for the NAIS program , premise ID has been made mandatory .
I received a letter in February 2007 stating that if I did not comply with the Wisconsin law , I would lose my milk producer license .
Folks showing alpacas at breeding shows have been required to chip their animals for $ 35 apiece .
Instead of cracking down on the industrial livestock operations that are the source of most animal diseases or dealing with the surge in foreign animal imports from countries with Foot and Mouth outbreaks thanks to our free trade agreements , Congress is instead thwarting efforts to provide local , sustainable sources of food to schools .
Tying the NAIS to the School Lunch Program will prevent family farmers from accessing this important market .
In the wake of the Hallmark / Westland recall , many school districts began seeking local sources of meat and attempting to get more organic and grass fed beef into schools .
Those farm - fresh options will now be limited if Congress chooses to link the program to NAIS .
Wisconsin family farmers have further reasons to be suspicious about the use of NAIS to contain animal disease .
Currently , the premise ID database in Wisconsin is run by a private nonprofit called the Wisconsin Livestock Identification Consortium ( WLIC ) .
A look at the board of the WLIC shows it to be a who ’s who of corporate agribusiness interests , including Cargill , the Wisconsin Pork Association , and Wisconsin Cattlemen ’s Association .
None of these groups has ever shown much interest in food safety or more regulation over our meat processing plants .
The WLIC membership shows no less than four radio ID tag companies .
Is NAIS really about consumer safety or fattening the profits of corporate agribusiness and electronic tag companies ?
The more our state and local governments coerce me into joining , the more I ca n’t help but be suspicious .
Consumers desiring food from local food sources instead of factory farms should be equally troubled .

This piece is provoked by Ryan Daigle ’s What ’s New in Edge Rails : Simpler Conditional Get Support ( ETags ) .
I think it ’s an important subject .
I realize that many readers here understand what ETags are and why they matter , and will see right away how the API Ryan describes fits into the picture .
If you do n’t , and you build Web apps , it ’s probably worth reading this and following some links .
Caching in General ·
If , every time a browser processed a URI beginning http ://... , it actually fired off a GET at a server , and if , every time a GET hit a server , the server actually recomputed and sent the data , the Web would melt down PDQ .
There is a lot of machinery available , on both the client and server side , to detect when the work of computing results and sending them over the network can be avoided .
Normally , we use the term “ caching ” to refer to all this stuff .
There is browser caching and expiration dates and cache - control headers , which are worth implementing but I ’m not going to cover here .
And on the server side , there are a variety of caching tools , of which memcached is the best - known example .
If You Must Ask · Even with all the caching , there are lots of occasions when a Web client has to fire off that GET , and it gets through to your server - side application code .
But that does n’t necessarily mean you have to compute and transmit .
If the server discovers that whatever the URI identifies has n’t changed since that client last fetched it , the server can send an ( essentially ) one - line response labeled with the HTTP Status Code “ 304 Not Modified ” .
This saves network bandwidth , because you do n’t retransmit the whole resource representation , and if it ’s done cleverly , may save a whole bunch of computation and I /O for the server .
Time - stamping ·
The most obvious way to accomplish this is for the client to send an HTTP If - Modified - Since header containing the date the URI was last fetched .
This works just fine , particularly for a resource which is a static file ( in fact , popular Web servers have this built right in ) .
But sometimes a single time - stamp is n’t enough information for a server to figure out whether the client needs a fresh copy of whatever it ’s asking for .
ETags are for this situation .
The way it works is , when a client sends you a GET , along with the result you send back an HTTP header like so :
ETag : " 1cc044-172-3d9aee80 "
Whatever goes between the quotation marks is a signature for the current state of the resource that ’s been requested .
Here ’s an example : Suppose you ’ve got some sort of social - networking Web app , and a user asks to see her profile page .
The way the page looks depends on a few things :
Who the user is .
Whether the app has been updated ( i.e. new templates , stylesheets ) since the last fetch .
Whether the profile has been updated since the last fetch .
The first you know , and it should n’t be tough to make the second available to application code ; you could have an app- version global , or store it in your database , or just have a file somewhere that gets updated so you can check its timestamp .
As for the third , this requires that you have a version number or update - timestamp field associated with the user profile , which you probably already do .
So what you do is turn those three things into a signature ( probably by concatenating them and hashing the string ) and sending the ETag header along with the profile page .
Then , when the client wants to look at the profile page again , it sends an HTTP header along with the request like so :
If - None -Match : " 1cc044-172-3d9aee80 "
When you see this , you have a quick glance at the user id , app version , and profile version , recompute the signature , and if it matches , you just send back a 304 Not Modified and your job is done .
( the header is called If - None - Match because the client can send a bunch of different ETags along ; but I ’ve never seen anyone do that ) .
In many cases , this is going to be a lot less computing than fetching the profile information out of the database tables and re-running the template to create the HTML you were going to send along .
When This Matters ·
This matters if your Web app is maxed on some combination of CPU and database , and a noticeable proportion of requests do n’t really need a page - rebuild , and your existing caching and last - modified setup is n’t getting the job done .
This is n’t going to be true of all Web apps , nor even of all Web apps that are suffering from overload .
But my feeling , on surveying the landscape , is that there are a lot of apps out there where smart ETagging could cut the CPU load and database traffic down by a few percentage points , and those percentage points are damn precious in a server that ’s breathing hard in public .
This is particularly likely to be true if your Web app is written in a language that is n’t the world ’s fastest ( like Rails ) , and has an elaborate , complex object - relational mapper ( like Rails ) , and was built in a big hurry to meet a perceived need , without much pre-optimization ( like a lot of Rails apps ) .
I ’m impressed by the response.etag and request .
fresh ?
API Ryan Daigle describes ; it ’s typically - elegant in the Rails style : “ Tell us what matters and we ’ll do the housekeeping ” .
I ’m sure that other Web frameworks offer similar tools ; perhaps readers might contribute pointers below ?
Further Reading ·
The trade - offs around this , like the trade - offs around everything having to do with Web - app performance , are complicated .
I wrote about this subject before ( essentially requesting exactly what Edge Rails now has ) in On Being for the Web .
The comments to that piece are erudite and instructive , and link to lots of valuable primary materials :
Sexist - and rich ?
Men who grow up thinking women should stay at home may be labelled " old- fashioned " - but could end up well ahead in the salary stakes .
A US study , published in the Journal of Applied Psychology , suggests that they will consistently out - earn more " modern - thinking " men .
On average , this meant an extra $ 8,500 ( £ 4,722 ) a year .
One UK psychologist said men inclined to wield power in their relationships might also do this at work .
It could be that more traditionally - minded men are interested in power , both in terms of access to resources - money in this case - and also in terms of a woman who is submissive
Dr Magdalena Zawisza
Winchester University
The study , carried out by researchers at the University of Florida , was conducted on a large scale , with 12,686 men and women interviewed in 1979 , when they were aged between 14 and 22 , and three times in the following two decades , the last time in 2005 .
The researchers asked them whether they believed a woman 's place was in the home , or whether the employment of women was likely to lead to higher rates of juvenile delinquency .
Predictably , more men tended to hold these views than women , although the gap has narrowed significantly over time .
However , when the men were asked about their salaries , another gap emerged , with those holding " traditional " views earning significantly more .
Conversely , women who held the opposite view did earn slightly more , on average $ 1,500 ( £ 833 ) more than women with " traditional " views .
Dr Timothy Judge , one of the researchers , said : " More traditional people may be seeking to preserve the historical separation of work and domestic roles - our results prove that is , in fact , the case . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
There are also a lot of men who have gained good positions and are not sexist Jhonsie , Exeter Dr Magdalena Zawisza , a psychologist from Winchester University , said that there were a number of theories which might explain the difference .
She said : " It could be that more traditionally - minded men are interested in power , both in terms of access to resources - money in this case - and also in terms of a woman who is submissive .
" Another theory suggests that employers are more likely to promote men who are the sole earner in preference to those who do not - they recognise that they need more support for their families , because they are the breadwinner . "

OWEN SOUND , ONT .
–Just hours before he was savagely attacked by a pack of thugs here , a Toronto man had complained to police he was being harassed and accused of being a rapist .
When a 17 - year - old girl later confronted him on a downtown street and made similar allegations , the man was attacked by as many as six youths and young men who stabbed him twice in the chest , once in the back , hit him with a piece of lumber and , according to a witness , " beat the crap out of him . "
The 42 - year - old Toronto man is black .
His attackers are white .
But Deputy Chief Bill Sornberger of Owen Sound police said the Wednesday night attack was n't racially motivated .
" He was absolutely innocent , simply in the wrong place at the wrong time , " Sornberger told the Star .
" He was a victim of mistaken identity . "
The man , who lives in Etobicoke , has been working with the local hydro authority in recent weeks , staying in Owen Sound Sunday to Thursday , Sornberger said .
" He 's just a decent guy up here to do a job and make a living , " he said .
The victim has asked police to withhold his name .
Owen Sound Mayor Ruth Lovell was on her way to visit him in hospital last night .
Hints in the local media yesterday that the attack might have been racially motivated spread through this Georgian Bay community like wildfire .
" It 's embarrassing , " said book - shop owner Bea Miller , on the eve of a weekend emancipation festival to mark the end of slavery .
" We 're the last stop on the Underground Railway .
We 're just a normal little tourist town , a hockey town .
Every town wants a great reputation and we do .
We do n't want this kind of thing happening .
But every town , small or large , has people who will cause problems . "
Delia Burtwistle , 41 , watched the attack about 11:30 p.m. from her apartment overlooking the downtown four corners at 2nd Ave .
W. at 10th St. W .
" I saw about five guys beating on a black guy with a 2 - by - 4 , " she said .
" They had him right up against a van , beating the crap right out of him . "
Two of the attackers were also stabbed , one on the hand , another on the leg near his groin .
Police arrested four youths , including the 17 - year - old girl , who face charges ranging from assault to assault with a weapon .
Sornberger said the attack occurred as the man left a coffee shop where he had been accused of being a rapist just hours earlier .
" It upset him so much he called us , " the deputy said .
" He was quite upset and affronted by the whole thing .
He asked if a rapist was at large in the community .
We sent an officer down there to try and sort it out . "
But the man was confronted again as he crossed the main intersection .
" It was n't who he was , but he fit a description of a man , " Sornberger said .

Supporters of failed presidential candidate Ron Paul snapped up more than 6,000 tickets to a two - day alternative to the National Republican Convention .
The tickets to the Rally for the Republic went on sale at 11 a.m. Friday through Ticketmaster .
Six hours later , 6,217 were sold .
Organizers hoped to boost interest in their rally with record single - day sales , similar to Paul 's online collection of $ 4.3 million in one day for his failed presidential campaign .
The sum was the largest Internet fundraising amount in a single day by a GOP candidate .
The Rally for the Republic , inspired by Paul 's message of limited government and strict following of the Constitution , is being held at Minneapolis ' Target Center Aug. 31 - Sept.
2 . The center seats between 13,000 to 15,000 people .
Jesse Benton , a spokesman for the rally , said the group wants to sell the maximum possible seats .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama has drawn larger crowds in his campaign , but Benton said packing the Target Center would be a true boost for the group .
The rally will feature such events as the Ron Paul Nation Celebration and a Campaign for Liberty Leadership Summit .
" We think being able to pack Target Center sends a message this movement has legs and that there is going to be strong presence in Minneapolis to celebrate traditional Republican and American principles , " Benton said .
Ticket sales continue through Sept. 1 or until they are sold out .

The Libertarian National Committee ( LNC ) continues to be in a fierce deadlock today over how to address the growing controversies surrounding their party 's U.S. presidential nominee , former congressman Bob Barr .
Many libertarians have spoken out against Barr since his last minute refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul 's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington , DC last Wednesday .
One faction of the 17 - member LNC , led by at - large representative Dr. Mary Ruwart — who lost the Libertarian Party 's presidential nomination to Barr at the National Convention in May by only a few votes — is supporting a resolution to apologize to Paul .
This is being countered by another faction led by Treasurer Aaron Starr , who favors a resolution to chastise Paul for not endorsing Bob Barr and “ splitting the Freedom Movement . ”
The motion supported by Starr was made available online Tuesday night .
It can be read in its entirety below .
Starr's Motion
The Libertarian National Committee is disappointed to learn that you have recently urged those in the freedom movement to vote for the likes of Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney and Chuck Baldwin , none of whom truly grasp the meaning of Liberty .
More than before , we remain committed to our nominees for President and Vice President , Bob Barr and Wayne Root .
We believe both of them boldly present the ideals of limited government , lower taxes , lower spending , and more freedom to the American people .
We invite you to restore your commitment to Liberty by supporting the only candidates on the ballot this year who understand the Constitution and are prepared to restore our republic to what the Founders believed .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Do you agree with Aaron Starr 's motion to chastise Ron Paul for not endorsing Bob Barr ?

You wo n't hear this theory on CNBC
by Jeremy Hooper
In the past , we 've seen the American Family Association take far too much credit for affecting the bottom line of a company that they are in the process of boycotting .
We especially saw them do this with Ford Motors , a company they started boycotting well after the business was in a financial yucky period .
With every negative cash flow report from the company , the AFA would pipe in and say , " See that , see that -- the company 's collapsing because they enjoy gay people . "
The truth , however , was that company decisions , a changing market , and a whole host of consumer issues were really putting the company in financial straits , and the AFA 's boycott , while possibly causing a few peeps to choose Toyota instead , was mainly convenient timing for the " pro-family " side .
Well now the Liberty Counsel 's Mat Staver has vaulted this unwarranted credit - taking concept to a whole new level .
In a new press release wherein he lashes out against Google for coming out in support of marriage equality , Mat goes so far as to blame gay support for factoring into the high profile collapse of two banks :
" Companies that promoted anti-family policies have learned the hard way that such policies are bankrupt .
K- Mart learned its lesson several years ago .
Washington Mutual and Wachovia , both of which actively promoted the homosexual agenda , have come to realize that anti-family policies will bankrupt the bottom line . "
Yea , you know , because there 's nothing else going on in the world that 's affecting business .
Forget what Suze Orman or Jim Kramer have to say .
Forget checking out the Wall Street Journal .
Mat Staver has it all figured out for you .
Those pesky gays have led to the the collapse of two major banks , and we will use our demonic presences to collapse Google as well .
BWAA HA HA HA HA !
But if you think this credit - taking is egregious , be sure to keep an eye out for Staver 's forthcoming press releases :
" The brothers Lehman ?
Total gay ' mos ! "
" Fannie and Freddie would be fine if only they were attracted to each other " and " AIG = Armageddon In Gayness "
Google Comes Out of The Closet And Blasts California Marriage Amendment [ Liberty Counsel ]
Your thoughts
" both of which actively promoted the homosexual agenda , have come to realize that anti-family policies will bankrupt the bottom line . "
Duh .
Those businesses which promotes discrimination AKA the " anti-ALL - families agenda " in the year 2008 deserves to fizzle out and go extinct .
If you welcome ALL to your business , as clientele AND employees , then you 're less likely to bankrupt yourself .

I think that Fannie is having an incestuous relationship with Ginnie Mae !
And , Farmer Mac has had his way with the whole clan !
Along with just about every slack - jawed , back - woods , inbred , xenophobic politician from the Deep South !
Ginnie and Farmer have sure been around , but so far ( knock on wood ) , the venereal disease spreading through the GSEs and Wall Street has n't claimed them as victims .

I read two stories about companies adopting Open Source this week which give some interesting food for thought when juxtaposed .
The first is a blog post on C|Net from Matt Asay titled Ballmer :
We 'll look at open source , but we wo n't touch where he writes
Ballmer lacks the imagination to conceive of a world where Microsoft could open - source code and still make a lot of money ( He 's apparently not heard of " Google . " ) : No. 1 , are our products likely to be open - sourced ?
No .
We do provide our source code in special situations , but open source also implies free , free is inconsistent with paying for lunches at the partner conference .
( Applause . )
But at least he 's willing to work with those who do grok that the future of software business ( meaning : money ) is open source :
The second is an article on InfoWorld by Paul Krill entitled Sun lays off approximately 1,000 employees which contains the following excerpts
Following through on a restructuring plan announced in May , Sun on Thursday laid off approximately 1,000 employees in the United States and Canada .
All told , the company plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 1,500 to 2,500 employees worldwide .
Additional reductions will occur in other regions including EMEA ( Europe , Middle East , Africa ) , Asia -Pacific , and Latin America .
Reducing the number of employees by 2,500 would constitute a loss of about 7 percent of the company 's employees .
...
He also addressed the question of whether Sun should abandon its new strategy of giving away its software .
Sun will not stop giving it away , according to Schwartz , citing a priority in developer adoption .
When it comes to the financial benefits of Open Source , you need to look at two perspectives .
The perspective of the software vendor ( the producer ) and the perspective of the software customer ( the consumer ) .
A key benefit of Open Source / Free Software to software consumers is that it tends to drive the price of the software to zero .
On the other hand , although software producers like Sun Microsystems spend money to produce the software they cannot directly recoup that investment by charging for the software .
Thus if you are a consumer of software , it is clear why Open Source is great for your bottom line .
On the flip side , it is n't so clear if your primary business is producing software .
Matt Asay 's usage of Google as an example of a company " making money " from Open Source is a prime example of this schism in perspectives .
Google 's primary business is selling advertising .
Like every other media business , they gather an audience by using their products as bait and then sell that audience to advertisers .
Every piece of software not directly related to the business of selling ads is tangential to Google 's business .
The only other software that is important to Google 's business is the software that gives them a differentiated offering when it comes to gathering that audience .
Both classes of software are proprietary to Google and always will be .
This is why you 'll never find a Subversion source repository on http://code.google.com with the source code behind Google 's AdSense or Adwords products or the current algorithms that power their search engine .
Instead you will find Google supporting and releasing lots of Open Source software that is tangential its core business while keeping the software that actually makes them money proprietary .
This means that in truth Google makes money from proprietary software .
However since it does n't distribute its proprietary software to end users , there is n't anyone complaining about this fact .
Unlike Google , Sun Microsystems does n't really seem to know how they plan to make money .
There is a lot of data out there that shows that the Sun Microsystems ' model of scaling services is dying .
Recently , Kai Fu Lee of Google argued that scaling out on commodity hardware is 33 times more efficient than using expensive hardware .
This jibes with the sentiments of people who work on cloud services at Microsoft and Amazon that I 've talked to when comparing the use of lots of " commodity " servers versus more expensive " big iron " server systems .
This means
Sun 's hardware business is being squeezed because it is betting against industry experience .
Giving away their software does not fix this problem , it makes it worse by cutting of a revenue stream as their core business is turning into a dinosaur before their eyes .
The bottom line is that giving something away that costs you money to produce only makes sense as part of a strategy that makes you even more money than selling what you gave away ( e.g. free T - shirts with corporate logos ) .
Google gets that .
It seems Sun Microsystems does not .
Neither does Matt Asay .

The Answer is a New York City Cab .
I F-ing Hate NY Cabbies
NY cabbies suck .
And if I could come up with a way to put them all out of business , I would .
Anything that makes their jobs harder , I 'm all for it :
Bigger fare increase that 'll lower their tips - do it .
Make them all install expensive GPS systems - excellent idea .
Replace them all with robots - I 'm in favor .
Now you 're probably thinking , " What in the world could make him hate cabbies so much ? "
Well , there are many reasons .
For starters , if you live in a borough of New York City , there 's a 90 % chance that the cab you get into does n't know how to get to where you want to go , even though that ’s the only thing they actually have to know !
Learning your way around a city is not rocket science -- buy a damn map .
Another great reason to hate New York cabbies is that they drive like they 're insane .
I have personally witnessed at least three cabs run down people on their bikes .
I 've been in a cab when they went the wrong way down a one way street , jumped out in traffic , cut off another cab , and then cursed out the other cab for having the nerve to honk at them .
But two reasons for hating New York City cabbies really jump to the forefront : I live in Brooklyn and I am black .
For those of you who do n't live in NYC , it 's a fact of life that cabbies hate black people .
But that 's common knowledge for the most part .
What most people outside of New York do n't know is that they also hate going to Brooklyn .
Now , if you happen to be a black person trying to go to Brooklyn , well , then you 've hit the daily double !
I 've had cabbies just drive on by me .
I 've had them start to pull over to let me in , get a clearer view of me , and then speed off .
I 've had them pull up to me , roll down the window a crack to ask where I 'm going ( which is illegal by the way ) , and then speed off when I tell them The BK .
I 've also had them tell me that they are suddenly no longer in service .
I 've even had one pretend his cab broke down a block from where he picked me up .
Whenever I tell this to my white friends , they are amazed , shocked , outraged , etc... , that this still happens in America .
Unfortunately , I 'm used to it .
My fondest memory though , is when this Arab dude picked me up in his gypsy cab in Manhattan .
Normally I do n't do gypsy cabs ( those unmarked black cabs ) , but it was late , and it's not like I was having any luck with the regular yellow cabs .
After I got in and told him where I wanted to go , he refused to go anywhere until I paid him up front .
He also locked the doors so I could n't jump out and run away without paying .
Normally , I would not have let this slide , but as I mentioned , it was late and I just wanted to go home .
So I paid the man and sat back for a quiet ride home .
However , it was not to be .
I guess he was afraid he had offended me , so he decided to explain why he asked me to prepay : basically because black people are all thugs .
I mean , I looked nice enough , but he could n't take a chance , right ?
We like to skip out on fares .
We 're loud .
And if we actually do happen to stick around to
pay the fare , we skimp on the tip .
Now white people , they are n't great either , he continued .
They start wars , they do n't care for the poor , and are basically the devil .
But there 's one major difference : they tip well .
So in the end , that makes up for everything .
I mean , homeboy was really feeling like he was dropping some knowledge on me .
Meanwhile , I 'm just sitting in the back , saying nothing .
Now , I 'll be the first to admit that there are pieces of truth to every stereotype .
I 'm sure he's had some bad run-ins that caused him to develop this particular philosophy .
But what exactly did he hope to gain by tell ME all of this ?
As time has gone on I 've learned to work the system a bit .
If you can hop in the cab before you tell them where you 're going , the cabbie is stuck with you ( a method employed by my white brethren who also live in the BK ) .
Another tactic , if there happens to be a white girl around , I 'll use her to hail the cab , and then jump in ... and we 're going to Brooklyn , bitch !
I also make sure to tip well in the hopes of encouraging return trips to the boroughs .
And if it 's raining , well , I 've actually never caught a cab in the rain ; I 'm pretty sure it 's impossible .
So the subway it is ( MTA , do n't think you 're off the hook .
You 're on my list as well ) .
Now , after saying all of this , I do understand that every cabbie in NY is not like this , and that I 'm using a broad brush to paint them all the same .
There are some good ones out there that are getting lumped in with the rest .
But here 's the thing : I do n't care .
The majority of them drive like madmen .
The majority wo n't drive to the boroughs , and if they will , they do n't know their way around .
The majority look at me like some thug that 's going to rob them .
The majority wo n't pick me up .
Hence , I can only guess that the majority f-ing hate me .
And as such , I f-ing hate them back , because is n't that the American way ?
Oh , and my friend who was dropping knowledge on me during the ride home ?
Well , he did n't get a tip that night .
Ever heard of self - fulfilling prophecy ?
Many presidents leave office less popular than they arrived , but with time , they generally gain in public esteem .
Jimmy Carter made a name for himself as a humanitarian and peace advocate .
George H.W. Bush 's handling of the first Iraq war looks wiser all the time .
Even Richard Nixon was rehabilitated into a savvy world statesman .
Has any former president done so much to damage his own reputation after leaving office ?
Republicans always disliked - - or detested - - him .
But today , even many Democrats grind their teeth at the mention of his name .
He seems to be trying to fuel the growing antipathy .
Yesterday , in an interview , he refused to say he thinks Barack Obama is ready to be president .
How 's that for a gracious loser ?
Clinton also said that despite the criticisms he got from black leaders during the primary campaign , " I am not a racist . "
No , he 's not -- though it 's a testament to his recent political ineptitude that someone with his record would feel the need to say that .
But as he watches his party prepare to nominate a talented and eloquent African - American for the presidency , all he can apparently think about is his resentment that Democrats passed on his wife .
You would expect him to feel great pride in this historic candidacy .
But only if you forget that Bill Clinton 's first and last priority is not his country but himself .
Lehren aus der Bankenkrise : Der absehbare Kollaps
Banken sind weder produktiv noch innovativ .
Sie verleihen Geld .
Gewaltige Renditen sind nur mit dem Aufbau von Kettenbriefsystemen zu erzielen .
Warum immer die Finanzmärkte ?
Warum platzt so selten eine Spekulationsblase am Kartoffelmarkt ?
Warum verkalkulieren sich Maschinenbauer selten so , dass der Staat helfen muss , weil sonst das gesamte marktwirtschaftliche System gefährdet ist ?
Was treibt Scharen scheinbar seriöser Banker und Börsianer dazu , so riskante Geschäfte zu machen , dass sie hinterher alle wie dumme Kinder im Brunnen liegen und nach dem Staat um Hilfe schreien ?
Die Erklärungen sind relativ einfach .
Zunächst muss man zur Kenntnis nehmen , dass das Finanzsystem fundamental anders funktioniert als die normalen Gütermärkte .
Der berühmte Liberale Friedrich August von Hayek hat die Überlegenheit des marktwirtschaftlichen Systems immer damit begründet , dass hier Millionen von Marktteilnehmern zusammentreffen , die alle über unterschiedliche Informationen verfügen , die der Markt dann in einen einheitlichen Preis für ein Gut verwandelt .
Keine Regierung dieser
Welt sei zu einer solchen Effizienz in der Lage .
Die Kapitalmärkte aber funktionieren anders als der Handel mit Kartoffeln und Maschinen .
Dort kommt bei den " wirklich großen Spielen " um Zinsen , Wechselkurse , Aktien , Hauspreise und Rohstoffe eine Handvoll privilegierter Akteure zusammen , die alle nicht mehr wissen , als jede gut informierte Abteilung eines Ministeriums oder einer Zentralbank wissen kann .
Alle sind ferngesteuert von ein paar Informationen , die für jeden zugänglich permanent über die Bildschirme jagen und von allen Beteiligten in ähnlicher Weise gedeutet werden .
Wenn also bestimmte Ereignisse eintreten wie beispielsweise eine Rohstoffpreishausse , dann springen fast alle Spieler gleichzeitig auf diesen Zug und versuchen sich eine goldene Nase zu verdienen .
Das geht genau so lange gut , bis sie den Preis weit weg von dem
Wert getrieben haben , den die reale Welt , also die richtigen Menschen , zu zahlen in der Lage sind .
Dann aber kollabiert das ganze Spielsystem .
Dieses Spiel wird dadurch noch absurder , dass die gierigen Finanzmarktzocker und ihre Banker alle paar Jahre auf die grandiose Idee kommen , man könne die eigenen Gewinne dadurch so richtig in die Höhe jubeln ( auf Herrn Ackermanns berühmte 25 Prozent Eigenkapitalrendite etwa ) , indem man den Großteil der Spekulation mit Schulden finanziert .
Man leiht sich also zu dem Geld , das man ohnehin schon in der Tasche hat , noch viel mehr Geld dazu und investiert es in Anlagen , die eine etwas höhere Rendite erbringen als der Zins , den man den anderen Banken oder den braven Anlegern zahlt .
Das ist der große Hebel , mit dem Banken , Hedgefonds und sogenannte Private - Equity - Fonds die Rendite auf das Eigenkapital in ungeahnte Höhen treiben können , wenn sie nur genügend Kredit bekommen .
Würden alle Spekulanten mit dem geliehenen Geld lediglich ins Spielkasino gehen , wäre der Spuk schnell zu Ende .
Die extrem einfallslose Methode , die Renditen zu hebeln , funktioniert für das gesamte globale Finanzsystem nur dann eine Weile , wenn alle Spieler bestimmte Objekte finden , bei denen sie sich mit einer gewissen Plausibilität einreden können , sie würden hohe Renditen bei geringem Risiko bieten .
So ein Objekt war der amerikanische Häusermarkt in den letzten zehn Jahren .
In den Zwanzigerjahren des vergangenen Jahrhunderts übernahmen diese Rolle Aktien neu aufgekommener Konsumgüterhersteller und in den Neunzigerjahren Aktien der Telekommunikation .
Sehr oft sind es Währungen , bei denen die Regierungen den Kurs stützen oder die Zinsen hochhalten .
Auch Unternehmen mit hohem Eigenkapitalanteil zu kaufen ist beliebt , weil man die Rendite allein dadurch hochjubeln kann , dass man Eigenkapital durch Schulden ersetzt .
Letzteres tun sogenannte Private - Equity - Firmen , also Unternehmen , die genau das Gegenteil dessen tun , was ihr Name sagt ; sie vermindern nämlich systematisch das Eigenkapital , statt solches zur Verfügung zu stellen .
Sobald die Märkte ein solches Objekt der Begierde identifiziert haben , wird eine Art Kettenbriefmechanismus in Gang gesetzt , bei dem jeder versucht , nicht der Letzte in der Kette zu sein .
So primitiv ist das und doch kurzfristig so profitabel .
Solange man willfährige " Wissenschaftler " hat , die nichts anderes tun , als die " unbestreitbare Effizienz der Kapitalmärkte " zu loben , solange man Politiker hat , die vor Hochachtung vor den " Werteschaffern " in den Banken in die Knie gehen , solange man eine Öffentlichkeit hat , die sich gerne einreden lässt , man bräuchte eigentlich nicht mehr zu arbeiten und könne mit einem schnellen Geschäft an den Finanzmärkten quasi ohne Risiko reich werden , solange man eine öffentliche Diskussion in den Medien hinbekommt , die den Leuten weismacht , ihre Rente könnte nur mit dem großen Spiel an den Finanzmärkten sicher gemacht werden , so lange wird es immer wieder große Krisen geben .
Was wir nämlich endlich begreifen müssten : Banken produzieren nichts .
Die Volksverdummung beginnt schon damit , dass man das , was Banken ihren Kunden anbieten , als " Produkte " bezeichnet .
Das klingt gut und seriös und vor allem so , als seien Banken ebenso innovativ wie Produktionsunternehmen und würden alle paar Wochen ein " neues Produkt " auf den Markt werfen .
Banken machen aber immer das Gleiche : Sie leihen Geld über relativ kurze Fristen und verleihen es über längere Fristen .
Dabei ist
Geld zu verdienen , weil die Zinsen für lange Fristen meist höher sind als die für die kurzen .
Dabei geht man aber auch ein Risiko ein , weil die pünktliche Rückzahlung von Krediten an die Banken über lange Fristen nie so sicher ist wie die kurzfristige Verpflichtung der Banken gegenüber den Einlegern .
Insgesamt ist es ein Geschäft , aber sicher kein Bombengeschäft , bei dem man systematisch und auf längere Zeit Renditen von 25 Prozent erzielen könnte , wie noch immer von der größten deutschen Bank angestrebt .
Ging man in der guten alten Zeit zu einem Bankschalter , hatte man regelmäßig feuchte Hände .
Der Mensch hinterm
Tresen , der damals " Bankbeamter " hieß , hatte nämlich keineswegs im Sinn , uns die Freuden des Finanzlebens darzubieten , sondern war nur darauf aus , die Gefahren zu beschwören , die allenthalben lauern .
" Das ist nichts für Sie " , wäre uns bei allen Anlagen beschieden worden , die in irgendeiner Weise mit den wirklichen Finanzmärkten zu tun hatten .
Noch schlimmer natürlich , verbunden mit hochnotpeinlichen Befragungen , war es , wenn man Geld wollte .
Wenn ein Anleger in den letzten Jahren zur Bank ging , begegnete er trendigen Damen und Herren , die ihm mit allem Charme der Welt eines ihrer neuesten " Produkte " verkaufen wollten .
Sollten es denn 13 Prozent Rendite mit argentinischen Langläufern sein oder doch vielleicht gleich 23 Prozent mit einem ordentlichen Aktienfonds ?
Auch derjenige , der Geld brauchte , hatte es bei den modernen Banken leicht .
Nichts mit hochnotpeinlicher Befragung und Sicherheiten .
Einen maßgeschneiderten Finanzierungsplan hatte das junge Bankteam sofort für das junge Unternehmen - mit dem schnellen Gang zur Börse als Krönung .
Hatten uns nicht die Wirtschaftspolitiker über Jahrzehnte gepredigt , dass diesem Land der Mut zum Risiko und damit das Risikokapital fehlt ?
Das ist nun zu Ende und das ist gut so .
In großen Teilen der Finanzwelt war jedes Gefühl dafür verloren gegangen , dass das " Spiel " mit den ersparten Geld von Menschen , die nicht verstehen , was auf den Finanzmärkten geschieht , nicht nur moralisch verwerflich ist , sondern auch wirtschaftlich in eine Krise führen muss , sobald die Wetten in großem Stil nicht aufgehen .
Das aber ist immer dann der Fall , wenn irgendwo ein Schock ausgelöst wird , wenn sich die Konjunktur zu überhitzen droht und die Zinsen von den Notenbanken hochgezogen werden - oder wenn die reale
Welt einfach nicht mehr mitkommt beim finanziellen Roulette .
Was ist zu tun ?
Die raschen Interventionen der Zentralbanken waren zwar angebracht , weil sonst weit größere Schäden gedroht hätten .
Aber das darf nicht heißen , dass der Staat , nachdem er wieder einmal Banken und andere Spekulanten vor dem Schlimmsten bewahrt hat , zur Tagesordnung übergeht .
Damit provoziert er nur die nächste Krise , weil die Spieler im Kasino dann damit rechnen , dass es schon nicht so schlimm kommen wird .
Wer , wie die Deutsche Bank , mit 25 Prozent Rendite protzt , dem muss man auch abverlangen , dass er 25 Prozent Verlust hinnimmt , ohne nach dem Staat zu schreien .
Schreit er doch und kann der Staat nicht einfach die Augen zumachen , weil eine erhebliche Ansteckungsgefahr für gesunde Institute droht , muss der Staat dem " Institut " schon lange vorher auf die Finger klopfen , nämlich dann , wenn es mit seinem Renditeziel in aller Öffentlichkeit protzt .
Zum anderen muss die Politik beginnen zu verstehen , dass die großen Spiele , die da rund um den Globus gespielt werden , für die reale Wirtschaft vollkommen nutzlos sind .
Dass die Hypothek eines amerikanischen Häuslebauers noch 23 - mal auf den internationalen Finanzmärkten in der Form irgendwelcher " Produkte " verscherbelt wurde , war ja sogar schädlich für das amerikanische Häuserbauen .
Es schien nur eine Zeit lang den Markt zu beflügeln , weil man die Häuslebauer im Unklaren über ihre Zinsbelastung gelassen und die Anleger hinsichtlich der zu erzielenden Rendite systematisch getäuscht hat .
Spiele am Devisenmarkt sind in aller Regel unmittelbar und in massiver Weise schädlich für die reale Wirtschaft , weil sie die Wechselkurse ebenso systematisch in die falsche Richtung treiben .
Kredit für die wirklich investierenden Unternehmen können auch Banken schaffen , die sich solcher Kasinoaktivitäten vollständig enthalten .
Man sollte nicht vergessen , dass es zu Zeiten des deutschen Wirtschaftswunders noch selbstverständlich war , das Zinsgebahren der Banken streng zu kontrollieren .
Auch ein Land wie China hat sein noch größeres Wirtschaftswunder bei strenger Kontrolle des Staates über Soll - und Habenzinsen geschafft .
Begreifen kompetente Wirtschafts - und Finanzpolitiker nun solche Zusammenhänge wieder , ist es ein Leichtes , die eklatanten regulatorischen Lücken zu schließen .
Auch die Lücken in der internationalen Finanzaufsicht sind offensichtlich .
Die besten Vorschriften über die Hinterlegung von Bankaktivitäten mit Eigenkapital , wie sie beispielsweise bei der Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich formuliert werden , nutzen nichts , wenn die Einschätzung von Risiken allein einer kleinen Gruppe von Ratingagenturen überlassen wird , die wiederum wegen Unfähigkeit oder Unwissen die wildesten Derivatkonstruktionen mit hohen Qualitätsmerkmalen versehen .
Auch hier müssen die staatlichen Organe selbst Hand anlegen und dafür sorgen , dass solche Ratings von nicht interessengebundenen Institutionen wie einer Finanzaufsicht kritisch überprüft und nötigenfalls korrigiert werden .
Jedes medizinische oder chemische Produkt wird von staatlichen Aufsichtsbehörden genehmigt , nur " finanzielle Massenvernichtungswaffen " ( Warren Buffet ) darf jeder vertreiben , ohne dass der Staat einschreitet .
Schließlich muss das größte Kasino , dasjenige , in dem internationale Währungen gehandelt werden , schlicht geschlossen werden .
Es geht weniger denn je an , dass der wichtigste Preis einer Volkswirtschaft , der Wechselkurs , den kurzfristigen Gewinninteressen internationaler Spekulanten und Finanzhaie überlassen wird .
Insgesamt gesehen ist es einfach : Finanzmärkte braucht man , aber man muss sich darüber im Klaren sein , dass sie massiv reguliert werden müssen .
Denn sie erzeugen gefährliche Spielzeuge , indem Leute in ihrer Gier nach kurzfristigem Gewinn auf unverantwortliche Weise mit dem Geld anderer Leute spekulieren in der Hoffnung , dass es genügend Dumme auf der Welt gibt , die nicht merken , wie sie von smarten Bankern über den Tisch gezogen werden .
In Zukunft muss jedes Prahlen mit extremen Renditen von der Finanzaufsicht , den Finanzministerien und den Zentralbanken sofort zum Anlass genommen werden zu prüfen , zu wessen Lasten die übermäßigen Gewinne des betreffenden Finanzinstituts gehen .
Auch für die Gehälter von Vorständen und Aufsichtsräten müssen staatlicherseits Grenzen gesetzt werden , weil es ja offensichtlich ist , dass diese Vorstände und Aufsichtsräte systematisch eine Beteiligung des Staates an den Verlusten erwarten .
Wäre das nicht so , würden sie viel gründlicher prüfen , woher ihre Gewinne kommen und mit welchen Risiken sie behaftet sind .

Example Problem :
Find the greatest common divisor ( GCD ) of two integers , m and n .
Euclid's Algorithm : while m is greater than zero :
If n is greater than m , swap m and n .
Subtract n from m. n is the GCD Program ( in C ) : int gcd ( int m , int n ) /* precondition : m> 0 and n>0 .
Let g=gcd ( m , n ) . */ { while ( m > 0 ) { /* invariant : gcd(m,n) =g */ if ( n > m ) { int t = m ; m = n ; n = t ; } /* swap */ /* m >= n > 0 */ m -= n ; } return n ; } ©

The greatest common divisor ( GCD ) of [ ] and [ ] is [ ] .
trace : Correctness
Why do we believe that this algorithm devised thousands of years ago , is correct ?
Given m>0 and n>0 , let g = gcd ( m , n ) .
( i) If m=n then m=n=gcd ( m , n ) and the algorithm sets m to zero and returns n , obviously correct .
( ii ) Otherwise , suppose m>n .
Then m=p×g and n=q×g where p and q are coprime , from the definition of greatest common divisor .
We claim that gcd ( m - n , n ) =g. Now m- n=p×g-q×g= ( p-q ) g.
so we must show that ( p - q ) and q are coprime .
If not then p-q=a×c and q=b×c for some a , b, c> 1 . But then p=q+a×c=b×c+a×c=( a+b ) ×c and because q=b×c , p and q would not have been coprime ... contradiction .
Hence ( p - q ) and q are coprime , and gcd ( m - n ,n ) =gcd ( m , n ) .
( iii ) If m<n , the algorithm swaps them so that m>n and that case has been covered .
So the algorithm is correct , provided that it terminates .
Termination
At the start of each iteration of the loop , either n>m or m≥n .
( i) If m≥n , then m is replaced by m-n which is smaller than the previous value of m , and still non-negative .
( ii ) If n>m , m and n are exchanged , and at the next iteration case ( i ) will apply .
So at each iteration , max ( m , n ) either remains unchanged ( for just one iteration ) or it decreases .
This cannot go on for ever because m and n are integers ( this fact is important ) , and eventually a lower limit is reached , when m=0 and n=g .
So the algorithm does terminate .
Testing Having proved the algorithm to be correct , one might argue that there is no need to test it .
But there might be an error in the proof or maybe the program has been coded wrongly .
Good test values would include : special cases where m or n equals 1 , or
m , or n , or both equal small primes 2 , 3 , 5 , ... , or
products of two small primes such as p1×p2 and p3 ×p2 ,
some larger values , but ones where you know the answers ,
swapped values , ( x , y ) and ( y , x ) , because gcd ( m , n ) =gcd(n , m ) .
The objective in testing is to " exercise " all paths through the code , in different combinations .
Debugging code be inserted to print the values of m and n at the end of each iteration to confirm that they behave as expected .
Complexity
We are interested in how much time and space ( computer memory ) a computer algorithm uses ; i.e. how efficient it is .
This is called time - and space - complexity .
Typically the complexity is a function of the values of the inputs and we would like to know what function .
We can also consider the best - , average - , and worst - cases .
Time
The time to execute one iteration of the loop depends on whether m>n or not , but both cases take constant time : one test , a subtraction and 4 assignments v. one test , a subtraction and one assignment .
So the time taken for one iteration of the loop is bounded by a constant .
The real question then is , how many iterations take place ?
The answer depends on m and n .
If m=n , there is just one iteration ; this is the best - case .
If n=1 , there are m iterations ; this is the worst - case ( equivalently , if m=1 there are n iterations ) .
The average - case time - complexity of this algorithm is difficult to analyse .
Space
The space - complexity of Euclid 's algorithm is a constant , just space for three integers : m , n and t .
We shall see later that this is ` O ( 1 ) ' .
Exercises Devise a quicker version of Euclid 's algorithm that does not sit in the loop subtracting individual copies of n from m when m >>n.

Ubuntu users who could n’t stand the idea of a EULA ( End User License Agreement ) for the popular Firefox Web browser are going to get their way .
The Mozilla Foundation ‘s chairperson , Mitchell Baker , has agreed to entirely remove the Firefox EULA .
In her blog , Baker wrote , “ We ’ve come to understand that anything EULA - like is disturbing , even if the content is FLOSS ( Free / Libre / Open Source Software ) based .
So we ’re eliminating that .
We still feel that something about the web services integrated into the browser is needed ; these services can be turned off and not interrupt the flow of using the browser .
We also want to tell people about the FLOSS license — as a notice , not as as EULA or use restriction .
Again , this wo n’t block the flow or provide the unwelcoming feeling that one comment to my previous post described so eloquently . ”
What this new way of telling people about Firefox ’s license , the MPL ( Mozilla Public License ) , will be has n’t been determined yet .
“ We ’re still working on this .
There ’s been a bunch of helpful feedback .
We appreciate this .
We think we ’ve integrated the feedback into something that ’s a good solution ; different from out last version in both its essence and its presentation and content . ”
She added that this new “ solution ” should be made public sometime today , September 17 .
This EULA fight began when Mozilla issued Firefox 3.02 with a new EULA that rapidly drew fire from Ubuntu users .
Mark Shuttleworth , founder of Ubuntu , urged users to calm down while Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , and Mozilla worked on the problem .
Baker quickly tried to get on top of the problem by issuing a proposed revision to the EULA .
When this version also drew far more complaints than praise , Baker and the rest of the Mozilla leadership decided to abandon entirely a EULA approach and take a different approach .
While it still is n’t entirely clear what this will be , simply dropping any sign of a EULA will likely go a long way to calming upset Ubuntu Linux users .

World 's most famous chip maker , Intel , celebrates its 40th birthday .
Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce were the two physicists that set up the company back in 1968 .
The term Intel derives from " Integrated Electronics " .
" When we introduced the microprocessor no one could have predicted that the market for PCs would be greater than 350 million units a year .
Over the next 40 years
Intel technology will be at the heart of breakthroughs that solve the big problems of health and environment .
For Intel this is just the beginning of its journey , " stated Paul Otellini , the company 's president and CEO .
Intel looks forward to mark its anniversary with a huge online mural project pleading for art and writing contributions from kids in over 70 of the company 's clubhouse centers worldwide .
More than 500 submissions express the thoughts on what children expect from computers in the next four decades .
Intel 's representatives hope that the project will sketch out the company 's altruistic efforts and outline its impact on the computer industry .
" As an industry , we have a responsibility to fulfill these expectations .
By providing opportunities for young people in underserved communities to learn technology literacy and problem - solving skills , we hope to secure the next generation of innovators , thought leaders and role models , " stated the company 's senior vice president for corporate social responsibility , Bruce Sewell .
In the meantime , Dr. Pat Gelsinger , the senior vice president and co-general manager of Digital Enterprise Group ( the company 's biggest business group ) , in a post on his blog , wrote about the biggest achievements of Intel over the last four decades .
Some of the most impressive moments for Gelsinger include the launch of the 32 - bit processor , the support of the CISC platform , as well as the attempts to keep software compatibility with each new generation chip .
He also mentioned about the company 's multi-core processors , saying that Intel had to scramble after initially beating around the bush with its bets regarding the achievement of higher clock speeds .
" In an ISSCC paper in 2001 we predicted a power wall with a famous picture of die thermal densities equal to that of a nuclear reactor or the surface of the sun – clearly we needed to change and our answer was the " Right Hand Turn .
While we saw this fundamental shift , we were one generation too late and attempted to extend the Pentium IV but luckily , we recovered quickly with our focus on energy efficient performance with Centrino and our great Tick - Tock execution " said Mr. Gelsinger .

As chief executive of Hewlett - Packard from 1999 to 2005 , Carly Fiorina was the most powerful woman in corporate America .
She also became one of the most celebrated and criticized when she was fired from that job in February 2005 in a battle with Hewlett 's board — and with tech venture capitalist Tom Perkins in particular — after a controversial merger with Compaq Computer .
( She recounted that corporate melodrama in her bestselling memoir Tough Choices . )
Now , at a mere 53 , Fiorina is polishing her distinguished résumé with a heavy dose of political activism .
She is a top presidential campaign surrogate for presumptive Republican nominee John McCain and chairman of Victory ' 08 , the Republican National Committee 's fundraising and get - out - the - vote arm .
She is , of course , frequently mentioned in the media as a possible McCain running mate , but in an interview with Portfolio.com , she sounded more like an aspiring Treasury secretary .
Lloyd Grove : Every so often you might be unable to resist putting on your McCain surrogate hat , but I was hoping to talk to you just as a businesswoman and as Carly Fiorina , independent thinker .
Carly Fiorina :
Well , for better or for worse , I usually am .
L.G. : OK , good .
So let me ask :
Who and / or what is to blame for the souring economy , the bear market and $ 140 - plus oil — the folks in charge ?
C.F. : Well , I do n't think any president is responsible for any one of those things , and that 's not a partisan comment – just like I do n't think we can blame Bill Clinton for the tech boom and bust .
So I do n't think you can blame George Bush for the credit boom and bust .
But I think what we 're seeing right now is very similar to what we saw in the tech boom and bust .
We saw a whole set of financial instruments and financial institutions rush into the real estate market with a new and innovative set of credit instruments , and those credit instruments drove a huge upswing in growth in that part of the market .
But they were also poorly understood , they were n't particularly transparent , people began to forget about risk , and the boom cycle inevitably became a bust .
But the consequence of that bust has created a tightening of credit across the board .
A tightening of consumer credit , a tightening of credit to small businesses , a tightening of credit generally , because these financial institutions — not to get too complicated here , but because they 're bound by mark to market accounting — they are in essence writing down their assets as the market falls , causing them to be more cautious .
They mark more assets down , I mean we 're in kind of a self - perpetuating cycle here .
And I do n't think that has anything to do with which political party is in office , and I do n't think it has anything to do with who is the president of the United States .
L.G. : So you think this was just led essentially by greed on Wall Street ?
C.F. : Well , I think there was a situation where there was greed on Wall Street , there was a lack of transparency around a new set of financial instruments , there were a whole new set of financial instruments , there were a whole new set of financial players who were less regulated than banks , and all that together created a situation , which now is rippling through the economy .
L.G. : Who would you blame ?
I know a number of people have blamed Alan Greenspan for not doing something about this when he had the chance .
As you know , he 's been on a very active rehabilitation tour .
C.F. : I think it 's a little bit of Monday - morning quarterbacking .
L.G. : What 's wrong with that ?
C.F. : I think it 's hard to second - guess all of the decisions that are getting made when you do n't have all of the same information , or are not in the same context .
But there 's no question that a period of easy money made certain risks look more attractive , and less risky than perhaps they should 've .
But , again , you go back to the tech boom and bust , part of that was how much was invested in telecommunications build - outs , and you had the same kind of thing — a lot of money chasing the opportunity to make more money , and people forgot basic elements of risk .
I do n't know how well you covered that or whether you remember much about it .
L.G. : [ Laughs ]
I remember putting money into AOL .
C.F. : Exactly .
So much the same kind of cycle unfortunately , but all of these cycles are worse and worse because our economies are more interconnected .
And in this particular case , the financial instruments that were being used , when I say they lacked transparency , people did n't understand all the connections .
Now , by the way , let me quickly say , there is a role for government in getting out of this — and so what a President McCain would do , what a President Obama would do , what Congress has done so far on a bipartisan basis , I 'm not suggesting that there is nothing that can be done or should be done .
But the cause of it fundamentally is not political , I do n't believe .
L.G. : Gotcha .
Now , in February 2003 , before we went into Iraq , people were worried that the price of oil was skyrocketing to $ 35 a barrel .
C.F. : I know .
That 's incredible , is n't it ?
L.G. : So tell me what your analysis of that is .
C.F. : I think there are a couple of things .
First , I think clearly the demand for oil is skyrocketing , driven in large measure , but not completely , by the burgeoning economies in China and particularly in India .
And there seems to be no abatement to that demand .
Still , that rise in demand may explain why oil has risen from $ 35 a barrel , but it does n't explain why the price of a gallon of oil has doubled in the past 12 months .
For that , I think we have to look to a weak dollar , and people moving investment into commodities like oil ; to some degree of speculation in that move .
And I think we need to look on the margins to global unrest and concern .
I do n't think it 's the Iraq war , however .
L.G. : You do n't ?
C.F. : No , I do n't , because I think there was basically very little supply coming out of Iraq in 2003 .
I do n't think in 2003 that people were counting on a big supply of oil coming out of Iraq .
Perhaps they were in 2004 , but I do n't really think so .
L.G. : How much would you attribute the weakness of the dollar to the government fiscal policies that we 've been subjected to ?
C.F. : See , I happen to have a slightly different point of view than some do .
I think a strong dollar is the result of policies , but I do n't think the strong dollar is in and of itself a policy .
So what do I mean by that ?
I think a strong dollar results from a belief that the U.S. dollar is a good investment .
Where does that belief come from ?
I think bolstering free trade is a boon to the dollar .
I think interest rates relative to other interest rates are a boon to the dollar .
So a period of long easing or rapid easing is not helpful to a strong dollar actually , although it may be helpful to economic growth in the short term .
And , most importantly of all , I think our pro-growth policies , if people believe that the U.S. economy is creating jobs and growing , then the dollar is likely to be stronger .
If they do n't believe that , it 's likely we could be weaker .
And , of course , as you know , a weak dollar is not all bad – export growth in our economy is one of the real highlights .
L.G. : Sure .
Let me ask you sort of a dumb question , maybe .
C.F. : I doubt it .
L.G. : Well , you mentioned whether Clinton can be blamed for the tech boom and bust , but obviously under Clinton and the Republicans who controlled Congress , there were budget surpluses , and the economy was pretty strong through the latter part of his term .
Republicans are supposed to be the party of fiscal responsibility , and your candidate has railed against this , but why do you think that is ?
That under the Democrats , the fiscal policy seems to be more responsible , and under Republicans , particularly these last seven and a half years , it has been sort of crazy .
C.F. : I think you 've said a lot there .
L.G. : More than I should have .
C.F. : No , no .
Fiscal policy is not just , or even not even principally , the purview of the president .
There is Congress involved , and you 're absolutely right that a Democratic president , Bill Clinton , and every Republican in Congress came to a set of agreements to balance the budget .
That agreement was noteworthy , but it took both parties to play .
You 're also correct that it is a Republican Congress , and a Republican president , George Bush , who saw the greatest increase in government spending since the Great Society .
L.G. : Why is that ?
C.F. : Because they made the wrong choices .
L.G. : I do n't know how long you 've identified yourself as a Republican .
C.F. : Well , I 've been a Republican for all of my voting life .
L.G. :
When you joined up , did you think this was going to be a party of conservative stewards of the budget ?
C.F. : Yes , and I think it's one of the reasons why Republicans are losing congressional seats , because people are angry over the fact that government spending is out of control .
I think it 's one of the reasons that Bush 's popularity is low .
Clearly the war is driving as much if not more of that , but yes , I think there are people who are surprised and disappointed that a Republican president and a Republican Congress have in fact driven a huge spending increase .
I 'm talking about a domestic spending increase .
Now , I will quickly say that those domestic spending increases have gotten very broad bipartisan support .
So if you look at the farm bill , for example , I mean it 's a tribute to pork .
And everyone , including Obama but excluding McCain , signed onto the farm bill .
McCain voted against it .
He has voted against every one , he does n't believe in farm subsidies – particularly to millionaire farmers .
L.G. : What are they growing in Arizona these days ?
C.F. : Oh , I have no idea .
L.G. : I assume that the agricultural output of Illinois is higher than it is in Arizona .
[ The Illinois agriculture industry is more than twice the size of Arizona 's , according to government statistics . ]
C.F. : Yeah , but look , now I 'm going to say what I really believe , but you may interpret it as a surrogate remark .
It 's the reason why I became a surrogate .
John McCain actually does do what he thinks is right , even when it's to his political peril .
I can remember being asked to go into Iowa in December , just before the caucuses , and just after he'd announced his opposition to ethanol subsidies .
He knew what that would do to him .
But he does n't believe in them .
And he has a track record to back it .
So I think that his strident conviction that pork - barrel spending is wrong is backed up by a 20 - year record .
He 's never asked for an earmark in 20 years — not once .
There is no other member of Congress , Democratic or Republican , who has that record .
Only John McCain has that record .
Nobody else has come close .
L.G. : Why do you think Obama is out - raising McCain , not only on Wall Street but in Silicon Valley ?
C.F. : Well , it 's interesting .
The last set of numbers that came out , he is n't out - raising McCain anymore .
So for a long time , absolutely right , he was out - raising him in places like New York and Silicon Valley , and he may still be in those two particular locales .
So I 'm not trying to avoid your question , I 'll come back to it .
But on the other hand , if you look at the numbers that just got published for Obama and McCain for this past month , they 're dead even .
L.G. : Because I was just looking over a piece in the Daily News suggesting that , for instance , on Wall Street , McCain raised something like $ 5 million within a certain period and Obama raised over $ 8 million in the same period .
C.F. : Yeah , from the trend looking backward you are correct .
As a business person , I tend to look forward .
And if you look at the trends over the last , call it three months , what you see is McCain 's money trending upward , Obama 's take trending downward , and in the month of June , they crossed .
L.G. :
If we 're talking about fundraising , it looks like the R.N.C. [ Republican National Committee ] is doing pretty well .
In contrast to the D.N.C. , particularly .
C.F : That 's right , the R.N.C. is doing very well .
The R.N.C. is out - raising the D.N.C. eight to one .
All that money matters , it counts .
Now that Barack Obama has made a decision to forgo public financing , he has to raise more money in each of the subsequent four months than he 's ever raised before .
L.G. : Do n't you think , as someone who is used to looking forward and looking at numbers and dealing with money , that Obama 's decision was entirely rational and understandable ?
C.F. : Well , if I set aside the fact that he absolutely changed his position .
I find it – " disingenuous " is a kind word .
L.G. : Take off that surrogate hat , now .
C.F. : No , no , this is not a surrogate hat .
I would 've found it much more acceptable had Barack Obama come forward and said , " You know what ?
I 'm going to change my mind and I 'm going to change my mind because it's to my advantage to change my mind .
I 've raised a lot of money , and I want to spend a lot of money . "
But what he did instead was say , the reason why I 'm changing my mind is ... "
L.G. : Because " the system is broken . "
C.F. : Correct .
I mean , please , that to me was disingenuous .
I know why he changed his mind .
He changed his mind because he 's raised so much money and he wants to spend a lot of money .
My only point is , having made that decision , he has to raise much more money in the next four months than in any of the previous months .
It 's a tall order .
I think there 's clearly been a downside to his credibility in terms of how he explained it .
I guess I would just say , they must have incredible confidence in their ability to raise money , and from what I 've seen over last couple months , I do n't know where that confidence comes from .
L.G. : Let 's switch gears here .
Do you still root for Hewlett - Packard ?
C.F. : Of course .
I still own their products .
L.G. : Did you enjoy the ride back up on the stock ?
C.F. : Oh , well I knew the ride was coming .
L.G. :
So you held on , obviously did n't get rid of your stock at whatever it was , $ 12 , when you were fired .
C.F. : No , absolutely not , and it was n't $ 12 then .
It was twice that .
( These days Hewlett is trading at around $ 43 . )
You know , I knew what was coming at Hewlett - Packard .
My choices and my leadership had been completely validated by what happened from the moment I left .
And by the way , the best legacy of a leader is what happens after they go .
That 's how you know the kind of foundation they put in place .
So I still root for them .
I 'm very proud of them .
I have a lot of friends there , and I 'm extraordinarily pleased .
L.G. :
Why is it that a nice person like you is still ...
C.F. : Oh God , I 've been through that so many times .
Read my book .
L.G. : You saw this New York Times piece recently where Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at the Yale School of Management called you a " street bully . "
C.F. : Yeah , well , Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is someone I 've never met .
I 've never talked with him .
That 's been his point of view for eight years , and he 's never changed .
I have no idea why he thinks that .
I can just tell you that would 've been his quote in 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2004 , and now , 2008 .
So I 'm not terribly concerned what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld thinks because I do n't think he 's influenced by the facts here , and I do n't know what his ax is to grind .
L.G. : You 're a high - tech person , and I just went on Facebook to see if I could find you and somebody named Carly Fiorina seems to have joined , like , four days ago .
Was that you ?
C.F. : Nope , not me .
It was not someone on my behalf that I 'm aware of .
L.G. : OK , so you 're not a member of Facebook .
C.F. : No .
L.G. : You 're on the Fox Business Network still ?
C.F. : No . I suspended that agreement .
It was a conflict to do this .
L.G. : Do you have any thoughts of why Fox Business has n't gotten a bit more traction than it has ?
C.F. : I think when you 're doing something like that , you have to take the long view .
I think that Rupert Murdoch clearly is taking the long view .
He is building a business franchise with that channel , with the Wall Street Journal .
I have no doubt that it will be very successful , but I think you can't expect a brand - new channel to get it all done in less than 12 months , which is about what we 're talking about .
L.G. : It 's so high - profile , there 's no shortage of people that would want to throw brickbats at them .
C.F. :
There are a lot of people who want it to fail .
L.G. : [ Laughs ]
By the way , do you feel any kinship at all with any of these high - profile women on Wall Street who have been very publicly defenestrated , like Zoe Cruz at Morgan Stanley and Erin Callan at Lehman Brothers and Sallie Krawcheck at Citigroup ?
C.F. : Well , look , men and women get fired .
I think everyone in business or in politics , man or woman , understands that at the top , it 's a rough game .
But I think it 's also undeniably true that women in positions of authority are characterized differently , scrutinized differently , talked about differently , than are men .
So I have no information to make a judgment about how or why they were fired .
I would only observe that women are always talked about differently .
I have great empathy for Hillary Clinton .
L.G. : Indeed , I noticed that some of the ways your situation at H.P. was characterized treated your conflict with ( then Hewlett - Packard director and later chairwoman ) Patricia Dunn as something out of that Clint Eastwood women 's boxing movie .
Is that a fact of life now in corporate America and in the media ?
Do you think we 'll ever get beyond that ?
C.F. : Well , I do n't think that 's a fact of life in corporate America .
I think women at the top of any field are still relatively rare .
I mean , if you just look at the data in corporate America today , 16 percent of the senior officers and board members are women .
That number has n't budged in five years .
So it 's still quite rare , and it 's clearly quite rare in politics as well .
So when something is unusual , as women are in positions of authority , it gets scrutinized more , differently , the standards are different .
That 's just true , and I think we have n't moved beyond that completely yet .
The media is a big part of it , no question .
L.G. : Hillary pointed out that toward the end of her race , she felt there was a lot of gender bias , particularly on some of the cable networks — and you agree with that analysis ?
C.F. : I do n't know how you can disagree .
I think we have come to the point where we know , thankfully , that racism is unacceptable .
I do n't think we have come to the point where we understand that sexism is unacceptable .
You know ?
When male anchors can jokingly say , and everybody gets the joke , " Well , Hillary is going to lose because she reminds people of their first wife , " or when detractors hold up signs that say , " Iron my shirt , " I mean , that 's just not acceptable .
L.G. :
So do you think if you talk like that enough and get enough attention for it , maybe you will peel off some Hillary votes for McCain ?
C.F. : Well , you know , this is not a political comment .
I think women recognize and understand what goes on with other women , and we empathize .
L.G. : Let me ask one last question .
I 'm just fascinated that your Stanford thesis was on the medieval practice of trial by ordeal .
C.F. : I know , is n't that wild ?
L.G. : Have you gone back to look at it ?
C.F. : Oh yeah , occasionally .
I have n't done it in quite a number of years .
But I 'll tell you something even crazier .
I went back and read text in the original Greek and the original Latin , I really got into it .
It was interesting , I found it intellectually challenging .
L.G. : And it 's had some kind of application to modern times , obviously .
C.F. : Well , I would n't go that far .
L.G. : Did you ever read Sex and the Single Zillionaire ?
( A cheesy novel , featuring scenes of sadomasochism , by Silicon Valley billionaire Tom Perkins , Fiorina 's nemesis on the Hewlett - Packard board of directors . )
C.F. : I did not .
My husband read a few chapters .
L.G. : Did he give it a review ?
C.F. : Um ... I guess his overall thinking was , " too much information . "

The snake is small enough to curl up on a US quarter
The world 's smallest snake , averaging just 10 cm ( 4 inches ) and as thin as a spaghetti noodle , has been discovered on the Caribbean island of Barbados .
The snake , found beneath a rock in a tiny fragment of threatened forest , is thought to be at the very limit of how small a snake can evolve to be .
Females produce only a single , massive egg - and the young hatch at half of their adult body weight .
This new discovery is described in the journal Zootaxa .
The snake - named Leptotyphlops carlae - is the smallest of the 3,100 known snake species and was uncovered by Dr Blair Hedges , a biologist from Penn State University , US .
" I was thrilled when I turned over that rock and found it , " Dr Hedges told BBC News .
" After finding the first one , we turned hundreds of other stones to find another one . "
In total , Dr Hedges and his herpetologist wife found only two females .
Defining species Dr Hedges thinks that the snake eats termites and is endemic to this one Caribbean island .
He said that , in fact , three very old specimens of this species were already in collections - one in London 's Natural History Museum and two in a museum in Martinique .
However , these specimens had been misidentified .
The snake 's habitat is usually under rocks eating termites Dr Hedges explained the difficulty in defining a new species when the organism is so small .
" Differences in small animals are much more subtle and so are frequently over - looked , " he said .
Modern genetic fingerprinting is often the only way to tell species apart .
" The great thing is that DNA is as different between two small snakes as it is between two large snakes , allowing us to see the differences that we can't see by eye , " explained Dr Hedges .
Researchers believe that the snake - a type of thread snake - is so rare that it has survived un - noticed until now .
But with 95 % of the island of Barbados now treeless , and the few fragments of forest seriously threatened , this new species of snake might become extinct only months after it was discovered .
Smallest of the small
In contrast to other species of snake - some of which can lay up to 100 eggs in a single clutch - the world 's smallest snake only produces a single egg .
" This is unusual for snakes but seems to be a feature of small animals , " Dr Hedges told BBC News .
By having a single egg at a time , the snake 's young are one - half the length of the adult .
Dr Hedges added that the snake 's size might limit the size of its clutch .
" If a tiny snake were to have more than one offspring , each egg would have to share the same space occupied by the one egg and so the two hatchlings would be half the normal size . "
The hatchlings might then be too small to find anything small enough to eat .
This has led the researchers to believe that the Barbadian snake is as small as a snake can evolve to be .
The smallest animals have young that are proportionately enormous relative to the size of the adults producing the offspring
As in the case of Leptotyphlops carlae , the hatchlings of the smallest snakes are one - half the length of an adult
The hatchlings of the biggest snakes on the other hand are only one - tenth the length of the adult producing the offspring
Tiny snakes produce only one massive egg - relative to the size of the mother .
This is evolution at work , says Dr Hedges
The pressure of natural selection means the size of hatchlings cannot be smaller than a critical limit if they are to survive

What are these ?
KABUL , Afghanistan -- Noor Ahmad Gayezabi said a silent prayer while watching the small family TV with his 13 - year - old son .
" Help Nikpai .
Help Nikpai . Help Afghanistan . "
Then he watched his country win its first - ever Olympic medal .
Rohullah Nikpai defeated world champion Juan Antonio Ramos of Spain on Wednesday to earn the bronze medal in the men's under 58 - kilogram taekwondo competition , sparking applause , wide smiles and laughter in homes , restaurants and ice cream parlors around the country .
Rohullah Nikpai of Afghanistan said he hoped his bronze medal in taekwondo -- the first Olympic medal ever won by his country -- can serve as a message of peace for his war - torn country .

" When I saw that he won , I jumped up and hugged and kissed my son , " Gayezabi said .
" I was crying . "
President Hamid Karzai immediately called to congratulate Nikpai .
He also awarded him a house at the government 's expense , said Humayun Hamidzada , the president 's spokesman .
" I hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war , " Nikpai said .
The victory led all of Afghanistan 's evening newscasts .
" I am so happy .
I cannot express my feelings in words , " said Mohammad Akbar , 33 , who watched on a TV at his Kabul pharmacy .
" While I was watching the match I was clapping I was so happy . "
Nikpai , who is 21 , started learning the Korean martial art when he was 10 because his brother had found a club in Kabul to train .
Not only was it an escape from the daily rigors of life in a country that not been at peace since the 1970s , he turned out to be good at it .
Exceptionally good .
When Gayezabi met Nikpai , they were both living at a refugee camp in Iran during the years of war that embroiled Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s .
The two competed together on a refugee taekwondo team .
Nikpai came to Kabul four years ago , Gayezabi said .
In the mornings he lifted weights and in the evenings he practiced martial arts .
In between he earned money cutting hair as a barber .
With success came better training conditions .
After being selected for the national team six months ago , he was able to use a special gymnasium .
But in a country where sports take a distant place behind the realities of war , few resources are dedicated to training athletes .
" My training situation is a lot like the situation in my country , " Nikpai said .
" It 's not good . "
Gayezabi had a lucky few hours of electricity that allowed him to watch his former teammate 's victory .
He feared he would only be able to listen on the radio since Kabul averages about four hours of municipal electricity a day .
" I was crying because I was remembering back when we were both on the Afghan refugee taekwondo team in Iran , " Gayezabi said .
Only four Afghan athletes came to Beijing , representing a country that had never won an Olympic medal and is sinking ever deeper into war as the Taliban insurgency escalates .
Sprinter Robina Muqimyar -- who in 2004 broke the gender barrier on the Afghan Olympic team -- was last in a field of 85 women in the 100 meters , with a time of 14.80 .
She ran with a scarf covering her head .
Teammate Massoud Azizi finished 76th in the men's 100 .
He trains in Kabul 's National Stadium , where the Taliban once staged regular public executions , wearing jogging shoes because his spikes wo n't dig into the track 's cracked , concrete surface .
But Nikpai , who is 21 , has claimed a spot among his sport 's elite .
Afghanistan will get another chance at a medal in taekwondo .
Nesar Ahmad Bahave is competing in a heavier weight class .
Hussein Rachmati , a taekwondo teacher who works in the gym where Nikpai trains , said Nikpai prepared for the Olympics with a Korean teacher .
He placed second in the World Taekwondo Federation 's qualifying event in Vietnam last year .
Afghans gathered around an ice cream shop TV in Kabul broke out in wide smiles and passed around congratulations to one another after watching Nikpai 's win , said Abdul Wafi , a 28 - year - old university student .
" It is wonderful that an Afghan athlete can win a medal in the world Olympics , " said Wafi .
" It is a great achievement for Afghanistan . "
The top U.N. official in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said the Olympic win shows that Afghanistan can compete on the global stage against the world 's best athletes .
" Young people should draw hope and inspiration from this Olympic win , " Eide said in a statement .
" Today , Afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination , commitment and hard work of its most precious resource -- the young people of Afghanistan . "
Along with the president 's offer of a house , Nikpai 's bronze medal comes with a cash prize .
Ehsanullah Bayat , chairman of the Afghan Wireless Communication Company , earlier announced that he would award any Afghan athlete who won an Olympic bronze $ 10,000 , along with $ 50,000 for a gold medal and $ 25,000 for a silver , said Khalid Andisha , a spokesman for AWCC .
" It is a great victory for Afghanistan , " said Mohammad Sukran , an 18 - year - old student .
" In a country like Afghanistan , the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting .
This is finally good news for Afghanistan . "
THE first thing to greet a visitor to the Oslo headquarters of Schibsted , a Norwegian newspaper firm , is its original , hand - operated printing press from 1856 , now so clean and polished it looks more like a sculpture than a machine .
Christian Schibsted , the firm 's founder , bought it to print someone else 's newspaper , but when the contract moved elsewhere he decided to start his own .
Although Schibsted gives pride of place to its antique machinery , the company is in fact running away from its printed past as fast as it can .
Having made a loss five years ago , Schibsted 's activities on the internet contributed 35 % of last year 's operating profits .
News of Schibsted 's success online has spread far in the newspaper industry .
Every year , says Sverre Munck , the executive vice - president of its international business , Schibsted has to turn away delegations of foreign newspaper bosses seeking to find out how the Norwegians have done it .
“ Otherwise we 'd get several visits every month , ” he says .
The company has used its established newspaper brands to build websites that rank first and second in Scandinavia for visitors .
It has also created new internet businesses such as Sesam , a search engine that competes with Google , and FINN . no , a portal for classified advertising .
As a result , 2005 was the company 's best ever for revenues and profits .
Unfortunately for the newspaper industry , Schibsted is a rare exception .
For most newspaper companies in the developed world , 2005 was miserable .
They still earn almost all of their profits from print , which is in decline .
As people look to the internet for news and young people turn away from papers , paid - for circulations are falling year after year .
Papers are also losing their share of advertising spending .
Classified advertising is quickly moving online .
Jim Chisholm , of iMedia , a joint - venture consultancy with IFRA , a newspaper trade association , predicts that a quarter of print classified ads will be lost to digital media in the next ten years .
Overall , says iMedia , newspapers claimed 36 % of total global advertising in 1995 and 30 % in 2005 .
It reckons they will lose another five percentage points by 2015 .
Even the most confident of newspaper bosses now agree that they will survive in the long term only if , like Schibsted , they can reinvent themselves on the internet and on other new - media platforms such as mobile phones and portable electronic devices .
Most have been slow to grasp the changes affecting their industry — “ remarkably , unaccountably complacent , ” as Rupert Murdoch put it in a speech last year — but now they are making a big push to catch up .
Internet advertising is growing rapidly for many and is beginning to offset some of the decline in print .
Newspapers ' complacency is perhaps not as remarkable as Mr Murdoch suggested .
In many developed countries their owners have for decades enjoyed near monopolies , fat profit margins , and returns on capital above those of other industries .
In the past , newspaper companies saw little need to experiment or to change and spent little or nothing on research and development .
Set in print
At first , from the late 1990s until around 2002 , newspaper companies simply replicated their print editions online .
Yet the internet offers so many specialised sources of information and entertainment that readers can pick exactly what they want from different websites .
As a result , people visited newspaper sites infrequently , looked at a few pages and then vanished off to someone else 's website .
Another early mistake was for papers to save their best journalists for print .
This meant that the quality of new online editions was often poor .
Websites hired younger , cheaper staff .
The brand 's prestige stayed with the old medium , which encouraged print journalists to defend their turf .
Still today at La Stampa , an Italian daily paper owned by the Fiat Group , says Anna Masera , the paper 's internet chief , print journalists hesitate to give her their stories for fear that the website will cannibalise the newspaper .
For most newspaper companies in the developed world , 2005 was miserable
For the past couple of years , however , newspapers have been thinking more boldly about what to do on the internet .
At its most basic , that means reporting stories using cameras and microphones as well as print .
The results can be encouraging .
America's Academy of Television Arts & Sciences has introduced a new Emmy award for news and documentaries on the internet , mobile phones and personal media players .
Five of the seven nominations for this September have gone to reports by nytimes.com and washingtonpost.com .
It also means being more imaginative .
In the late 1990s , the early years of the Wall Street Journal 's website , one of the paper 's journalists came up with the novel idea of posting online a 573 - page document that backed up an article .
“ It was n't the most compelling content , ” remembers Neil Budde , its founding editor and now general manager of news at Yahoo ! , an internet portal .
But it was a start .
Now newspapers have a better idea of what works online .
This is not always traditional journalism as taught in journalism school .
Brian Tierney , who became owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer after Knight Ridder sold it last year , noticed that a popular item on the paper 's website has been a video of Mentos mints causing a 2 - litre bottle of Diet Coke to explode into the air .
“ We should do more of that , ” he says .
More newspaper companies are likely to treat their websites as a priority these days .
“ Before , newspapers used their second - and third - rate journalists for the internet , ” says Edward Roussel , online editorial director at Britain 's Telegraph Group , “ but now we know we 've got to use our very best . ”
Many companies are putting print journalists in the same room as those who work online , so that print writers are working for the website and vice versa .
Some insist that this is a mistake .
“ It is completely wrong not to separate web and paper operations , ” says Oscar Bronner , publisher of Der Standard , a daily paper in Austria .
Print journalists do n't have time to reflect and analyse properly if they also have to work for the website , he argues .
Running to stand still
How impressive are the results of these online experiments ?
At lots of newspaper companies , internet advertising is growing by at least 30 % a year , and often more .
At la Repubblica in Italy , for instance , the paper 's website gets about 1 m visitors a day , nearly double the circulation of the printed paper .
The value of online ads grew by 70 % in the first half of 2006 .
For the first three months of 2006 , the Newspaper Association of America announced that advertising for all the country 's newspaper websites grew by 35 % from the same period in 2005 , to a total of $ 613 m .
But to put that in perspective , print and online ads together grew by only 1.8 % , to $ 11 billion , because print advertising was flat .
At almost all newspapers the internet brings in less than a tenth of revenues and profits .
At this point , says Mr Chisholm , “ newspapers are halfway to realising an audience on the internet and about a tenth of the way to building a business online . ”
The big problem is that readers online bring in nowhere near the revenues that print readers do .
All but a handful of papers offer their content free online , so they immediately surrender the cover price of a print copy .
People look at fewer pages online than they do in print , which makes web editions less valuable to advertisers .
Gavin O'Reilly , president of the World Association of Newspapers in Paris , says that print readers are much more valuable than online readers , who use newspaper websites in a “ haphazard and fragmented way ” .
Vin Crosbie , of Digital Deliverance , a consulting firm , recently estimated that newspapers need between 20 and 100 readers online to make up for losing just one print reader .
Many newspaper bosses would say this is too pessimistic : one British paper , for instance , reckons that one print reader is worth ten online .
But even that is a daunting multiple .
Newspapers today concentrate on only two parts of the market for internet advertising .
They earn little or nothing from internet search , which is bigger than either display or classified ads .
Especially in America , newspapers rely heavily on classified ads online and have fewer display ads , says Mr Crosbie .
Elsewhere , the pattern may be reversed , but newspapers still lack a broad base of internet - advertising revenue ; for instance , Juan Luis Cebrián , chief executive of Grupo PRISA , the owner of El Pais , says the Spanish newspaper is enjoying strong growth in display advertising , but has few online classified ads .
On the other hand , newspapers ' websites have higher profit margins than print does , because they have no newsprint or distribution to pay for .
The Wall Street Journal is one of the few papers that charges for its content online .
Others may follow suit , especially if growth in advertising slows .
The online business model is still in flux , argues Richard Zannino , chief executive of Dow Jones & Company , publisher of the Wall Street Journal .
The average price of ad space in the printed paper is now only three times higher than on Wall Street Journal Online , says Mr Zannino , compared with six to seven times for the industry as a whole in America .
He expects the relative price of an internet ad to rise .
The secret of making money online , according to Schibsted , is not to rely on news aggregators like Google News and Yahoo !.
Three - quarters of traffic to the websites for Schibsted 's VG and Aftonbladet comes through their own home - pages and only a quarter from other websites .
“ If visitors come from Google to stories deep in the paper and then leave , ” explains Mr Munck , “ Google gets the dollars and we get only cents , but if we can bring them in through the front page we can charge € 19,000 [ $ 25,000 ] for a 24 - hour banner ad . ”
In spite of this , most newspapers still depend on news aggregators .
Readers online bring in nowhere near the revenues that print readers do
The danger for newspapers is that all their efforts on the internet may only slow their decline .
Doing the obvious — having excellent websites and selling ad space on them — may not be enough .
The papers with the best chance of seeing their revenues grow are those experimenting with entirely new businesses online and off .
Some are launching profitable new ventures that are only indirectly related to journalism .
Schibsted , for instance , has started an online slimming club , called Viktklubben.se , using its Aftonbladet newspaper brand .
Viktklubben.se charges its 54,000 members € 50 each every three months .
The Telegraph Group in Britain uses the Daily Telegraph to sell readers everything from goose - down pillows to Valentine 's Day topiary baskets to insurance .
The division now contributes close to a third of the firm 's total profits , according to an executive at the company .
“ Newspapers will have to get into new businesses and extract more value from their audience , ” says Paul Zwillenberg , global head of media and entertainment at OC&C Strategy Consultants in London .
Examples like these are fairly rare , though .
Most newspaper companies still insist that producing high - quality journalism and distributing it in new ways will be enough to keep them growing .
It 's the journalism , stupid
Consultants advising newspaper groups argue that they need to adjust their output .
Research into the tastes of mainstream newspaper readers has long shown that people like short stories and news that is relevant to them : local reporting , sports , entertainment , weather and traffic .
On the internet , especially , says Mr Chisholm , they are looking to enhance their way of life .
Long pieces about foreign affairs are low on readers ' priorities — the more so now that the internet enables people to scan international news headlines in moments .
Coverage of national and international news is in any case a commodity often almost indistinguishable from one newspaper to the next .
This impression is exacerbated as papers seek to save money by sacking reporters and taking copy from agencies such as Reuters .
“ Our research shows that people are looking for more utility from newspapers , ” says Sammy Papert , chief executive of Belden Associates , a firm that specialises in research for American newspapers .
People want their paper to tell them how to get richer , and what they might do in the evening .
Few newspaper companies like to hear this and they tend to ignore the research they have paid for .
Most journalists , after all , would rather cover Afghanistan than personal finance .
But some are starting to listen .
Gannett , the world 's biggest newspaper group , is trying to make its journalism more local .
It has invested in “ mojos ” — mobile journalists with wireless laptops who permanently work out of the office encamped in community hubs .
Morris Communications , based in Augusta , Georgia , recently launched a new home - delivered free paper for Bluffton , a fast - growing area of Beaufort , South Carolina , called Bluffton Today , with a page of national news , one of international and the rest “ hyper- local ” .
Its website has pictures and blogs from readers and detailed community information .
“ Back in the 1940s and 1950s papers used to be full of what we call ‘ chicken - dinner news ' — the speakers at civic clubs and whose daughter won a blue ribbon in canoeing , ” says Will Morris , the firm 's president .
“ But then newspapers started to lose touch with their readers . ”
The more adventurous newspaper companies , like Morris Communications , are showing themselves willing to embrace content and opinions from readers .
Rather like OhmyNews , a Korean “ citizen - journalism ” operation that many people think heralds the future for news - gathering , Schibsted exhorts its readers to send information and photographs .
When a mentally disturbed man ran amok and killed people on a tram in Oslo in 2004 , it was a reader with a mobile - phone camera who sent VG its front - page picture of the arrest .
At Zero Hora , a Brazilian paper owned by RBS Group , the circulation department asks 120 readers what they think of the paper every day and Marcelo Rech , the editor , receives a report at 1 pm .
“ They usually want more of our supplements on cooking and houses and less of Hizbullah and earthquakes , ” says Mr Rech .
Still more changes to the content and form of newspapers are likely as businesspeople gain power at newspaper firms .
“ You wo n't be able to have many sacred cows ... Newspaper companies will have to become more commercial , ” says Henrik Poppe , a partner in McKinsey .
Some leading titles , including the Wall Street Journal , have recently decided to put advertisements on the front page for the first time .
For the moment , the trend towards greater commercialism is most evident in America , but is likely to spread elsewhere as newspaper companies struggle financially .
At the Philadelphia Inquirer , Mr Tierney , a former advertising executive , shocked people by announcing that he would bring in an advertising person to redesign the paper — traditionally a task strictly for editorial .
In future , businesspeople are likely to insist that newspapers adopt practices that are already standard in other industries .
Mr Tierney , for instance , says it is unreasonable to expect everyone from the age of 18 to 88 to buy the same product .
The industry needs to sell papers for different age and demographic groups , he says .
The most shocking development for traditional newspapers has been the wild success of free dailies , which like the internet have proved enormously popular with young people .
Roughly 28 m copies of free newspapers are now printed daily , according to Metro International , a Swedish firm that pioneered them in 1995 .
In markets where they are published , they account for 8 % of daily circulation on average , according to iMedia .
That share is rising .
In Europe they make up 16 % of daily circulation .
Metro calculates that it spends half the proportion of its total costs on editorial that paid - for papers do .
In practice that means a freesheet with a circulation of about 100,000 employing 20 journalists , whereas a paid - for paper would have around 180 .
Metro's papers reach young , affluent readers and are even able to charge a premium for advertising in some markets compared with paid - for papers .
“ The biggest enemy of paid - for newspapers is time , ” says Pelle Törnberg , Metro 's chief executive .
Mr Törnberg says the only way that paid - for papers will prosper is by becoming more specialised , raising their prices and investing in better editorial .
People read freesheets in their millions , on the other hand , because Metro and others reach them on their journey to work , when they have time to read , and spare them the hassle of having to hand over change to a newsagent .
Some traditional newspaper firms dismiss free papers , saying they are not profitable .
Carlo De Benedetti , chairman of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso , publisher of la Repubblica , for instance , says that Metro loses money in Italy and that other freesheets are struggling .
Globally , however , Metro has just become profitable .
Consultants say that lots of traditional newspaper companies are planning to hold their noses and launch free dailies .
In France , for instance , Le Monde is planning a new free daily , and Mr Murdoch 's News International is preparing a new free afternoon paper for London , to be launched next month .
Deciding whether or not to start a freesheet , indeed , perfectly encapsulates the unpalatable choice that faces the paid - for newspaper industry today as it attempts to find a future for itself .
Over the next few years it must decide whether to compromise on its notion of “ fine journalism ” and take a more innovative , more businesslike approach — or risk becoming a beautiful old museum piece .
