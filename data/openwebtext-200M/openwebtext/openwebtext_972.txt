We ’ll see how Obama ’s vast plans play out .
We ’ll see what unexpected nightmares , bigger than the swine flu , materialize on his watch .
The 100 Days celebrations could not fade soon enough , because neither he nor the country should be lulled into resting easy .
There are at least two toxic fiefdoms to keep the president and us awake at night : Pakistan and Wall Street .
Both could wreak further untold catastrophe .
Obama has control over neither , and in the case of the financial sector , he is fielding a team dominated by Robert Rubin protégés whose wisdom remains , to put it generously , unproven .
But if those are the obvious hotspots for this presidency , there is also the domestic political culture to worry about .
The Republican Party has collapsed , and that is not a good thing for the country or for Obama .
We need more than one functioning party , not just to ensure checks and balances and pitch in ideas at a time of crisis , but to temper this president ’s sporadic bursts of overconfidence and triumphalist stagecraft .
No one is perfect .
We must remember that there is also an Obama who gave us “ You ’re likable enough , Hillary , ” a faux presidential seal and a convention speech delivered before what Sarah Palin rightly mocked as “ Styrofoam Greek columns ” hauled out of a “ studio lot . ”
That Obama needs a serious counterweight in the political arena .
But the former party of Lincoln and liberty has now melted down to a fundamentalist core of aging , rural Dixiecrats and intrusive scolds  as small as 20 percent of the populace in the latest polls .
Its position on the American spectrum of ideas is somewhere between a doomsday cult and Scientology .

Arlen Specter ’s defection is the least of the Republicans ’ problems , a lagging indicator .
Though many characterize his departure as a “ wake - up call ” for the party , it ’s only the most recent of countless wake - up calls the party has slept through since 2006 .
That was the year that Specter ’s Pennsylvania Republican colleague in the Senate , Rick Santorum , lost his seat by a margin of more than 17 percentage points .
Despite that rout and many more like it of similar right - wing candidates throughout America , the party ’s ideological litmus test is more rigid than ever .
The G.O.P. chairman , Michael Steele , and enforcers of Republican political correctness like William Kristol and the blogger Michele Malkin jeered Specter and cheered his departure .
A laughing Limbaugh seconded e-mail from listeners commanding Specter to “ take McCain with you  and his daughter . ”
You ca n’t blame the president if he is laughing , too .
As The Economist recently certified , the G.O.P. is now officially in the throes of “ Obama Derangement Syndrome . ”
The same conservative gang that remained mum when George W. Bush praised Putin’s “ soul ” and held hands with the Saudi ruler Abdullah are now condemning Obama for shaking hands with Hugo Chávez , “ bowing ” to Abdullah , relaxing Cuban policy and talking to hostile governments .
Polls show overwhelming majorities favoring Obama ’s positions .
But his critics have locked themselves in the padded cell of an alternative reality .
Not long before The Wall Street Journal informed its readers that 81 percent of Americans liked Obama , Karl Rove wrote in its pages that “ no president in the past 40 years has done more to polarize America so much , so quickly . ”
From derangement it ’s a small step to madness .
Last week , the president of a prime G.O.P. auxiliary , the Concerned Women for America , speculated that the president ’s declaration of “ a state of emergency about the flu was a political thing ” to push through Kathleen Sebelius ’s nomination as secretary of health and human services .
At those tax - protesting “ tea parties ” on April 15 , signs and speakers portrayed Obama as a “ fascist , ” a “ socialist , ” a terrorist and Hitler .
Republican governors have proposed rejecting stimulus money for their states ( only to fold after constituents rebelled ) or , in the notorious instance of Rick Perry of Texas , toyed with secession from the union .
DiFi on State of the Union , stating , " .... we do n't have the votes ... "
Will she get with the program and work to get the damn votes !!!
Especially with California , this state has 18 % of its residents UNINSURED .
I do n't think Democrats in D.C. understand something , the something is that if you do n't work with Barack Obama for public option in the health care bill , there are some Democrats who will go DOWN in 2010 .
I hope these D.C. , out of touch , blowhards understand this .
After the CBS / NYT poll came out that over 70 % want a public option , Feinstein and the rest need to get with the program .
And for Grassley to state , our budget is trillions in deficit spending , where was HE AT during the BUSH REGIME ???
And the debt to the Chinese ?
Ask the former Bush Administration , who put this country in more debt than any former adminstration ever had .
nuff said .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Given the sad fate of General Motors , Fannie Mae , Bear Stearns and scores of other companies that fell on hard financial times , it 's a smart time for a best - selling business writer to pen a book titled " How the Mighty Fall . "
And that 's just what Jim Collins has done .
Collins is an acclaimed management guru who earlier wrote " Good to Great " and was co-author of " Built to Last , " which have sold seven million copies combined .
In his latest cautionary tale , Collins concludes that there are more ways for a company to fall than to become great .
Or as Tolstoy wrote in " Anna Karenina : " " All happy families are alike ; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way . "
Still , just about all failed companies go through most or all of five stages of decline defined by Collins :
Stage 1 is hubris born of success .
The company 's people become arrogant , regarding success as virtually an entitlement .
The company 's people become arrogant , regarding success as virtually an entitlement .
Stage 2 is the undisciplined pursuit of more -- more scale , more growth , more acclaim .
Companies stray from the disciplined creativity that led them to greatness in the first place , making undisciplined leaps into areas where they cannot be great or growing faster than they can achieve with excellence , or both .
Companies stray from the disciplined creativity that led them to greatness in the first place , making undisciplined leaps into areas where they cannot be great or growing faster than they can achieve with excellence , or both .
Stage 3 is denial of risk and peril .
Leaders of the company discount negative data , amplify positive data and put a positive spin on ambiguous data .
Those in power start to blame external factors for setbacks rather than accept responsibility .

Those in power start to blame external factors for setbacks rather than accept responsibility .
Stage 4 is grasping for salvation .
Common " saviors " include a charismatic visionary leader , a bold but untested strategy , a radical transformation , a " game changing " acquisition or any number of other silver - bullet solutions .
Common " saviors " include a charismatic visionary leader , a bold but untested strategy , a radical transformation , a " game changing " acquisition or any number of other silver - bullet solutions .
Stage 5 is capitulation to irrelevance or death .
Accumulative setbacks and expensive false starts erode financial strength and individual spirits to such an extent that leaders abandon all hope of building a great future .
In some cases their leaders just sell out .
In other cases the institution atrophies to utter insignificance .
Collins identifies 10 companies that took at least one tremendous fall at some point in their history , but recovered .
They are : Xerox XRX , +1.49 % , Nucor NUE , +1.60 % , IBM IBM , +1.30 % , Texas Instruments TXN , +1.40 % , Pitney Bowes PBI , , Nordstrom JWN , +3.39 % , Disney DIS , - 0.31 % , Boeing BA , +3.43 % , HP HPQ , +1.48 % and Merck MRK , +1.22 % .
Still others never recovered .
Take the case of giant A&P .
Collins writes , " A&P 's arrogant stance that 'we will continue to keep things just the way they are , and we will be successful because -- well , we 're A&P ! ! ' left it vulnerable to new store formats developed by companies like Kroger KR , +0.90 % . [ A&P executives ] failed to ask the fundamental question , Why was A&P successful in the first place ?
Not the specific practices and strategies that worked in the past , but the fundamental reasons for its success ?
It retained its aging Depression - generation customers but became utterly irrelevant to a new generation . "
Eventually , shaken out of its torpor by fierce new competitors , A&P GAP , - 0.10 % converted more than 4,000 stores to a format called WEO , ( Where Economy Originates ) , driving down prices to regain market share in a desperation move described by one industry observer as a Kamikaze dive .
The move proved catastrophic to profitably .
Then A&P abandoned the strategy and hired a charismatic savior from the outside who produced a brief return to profitability , only to resign when A&P collapsed yet again into a string of losses . "
From 10,000 stores in 1955 and sales that ran more than $ 1 billion above its nearest competitor , the company ran less than 500 outlets in 2008 .
Wal - Mart WMT , +2.72 % avoided such problems , thanks largely to the self - deprecating , low profile David Glass , who followed founder Sam Walton as CEO .
As Collins writes , " [ Glass ] learned from Walton that Wal - Mart does not exist for the aggrandizement of its leaders ; it exists for its customers .
Glass fervently believed in Wal - Mart 's core purpose ( to enable people of average means to buy more of the same things previously available only to wealthier people ) . "
Too much growth
On the other hand , look at the terrifying demise of Rubbermaid NWL , +1.84 % , the housewares products company that aimed to introduce more than one new product every day -- and proved only that a company can grow too fast .
" As Rubbermaid realized too late , innovation can fuel growth , but frenetic innovation -- growth that erodes consistent tactical excellence -- can just as easily send a company cascading through the stages of decline . "
Newell Co. acquired Rubbermaid in 1999 .
Also , discontinuous leaps into areas for which you have no burning passion is undisciplined .
David Packard , co-founder of Hewlett - Packard , had the insight that a great company is more likely to die of indigestion from too much opportunity than starvation from too little .
Finally , take the case of Ames , the small town retailer .
Collins writes , " Ames hired CEOs and jettisoned CEOs , and hired new CEOs , at one point churning through three management teams in 33 months -- lurching from strategy to strategy , program to program , looking for a fundamental transformation . "
The company ultimately failed .
" The signature of mediocrity , " Collins concludes , " is not an unwillingness to change .
The signature of mediocrity is chronic inconsistency . "
Ever wonder a Flight Data Recorder generally known as “ black box ” how it ’s look like ?
and how they work ?
Well .. I did .
So , I did a small research on this & found out more interesting facts about different types of Flight Data Recorders and their history .
There are mainly two types , one is Flight Data Recorder ( FDR ) used for record specific aircraft performance parameters & the other is Cockpit Voice Recorder ( CVR ) used for records conversation in the cockpit , radio communications between the cockpit crew and others ( including conversation with air traffic control personnel ) , as well as ambient sounds .
In some cases , both types have been combined into a single unit .
First Generation Foil Recorders
Efforts to require crash - protected fl Foil Recorderight recorders date back to the 1940s .
The introduction of Flight Data Recorders ( FDR ) , however , experienced many delays .
That ’s because technology could not match the design requirements of a unit that could survive the forces of an aircraft crash and the resulting fire exposure until 1958 , when the world authorities approved a minimum operating requirements for an FDR .
Second Generation Tape Recorders
Flight data alone could not provide all accident information needed by the investigators .
An advanced technology covering the recording of Tape Recordersounds in the cockpit , crews ’ conversation , air traffic control communications and aircraft noises was needed .
This started a second generation of recorders that used magnetic tape as the recording medium .
Third Generation Solid State Recorders
The Solid State Flight Data Recorder ( SSFDR ) became commercially practical in 1990 .
“ Solid State ” referSolid State Flight Data Recorders to storage of data in semiconductor memories or integrated circuits , rather than using the older technology of electromechanical methods of data retention .
Since the solid state memory does not require scheduled maintenance or overhaul , there are potential cost savings to the operator .
Next Generation Flight Recorders
The FDR and CVR are two of the greatest safety inventions of the commercial airline industry .
What improvements are on the horizon ?
Within the next few years , some form of cockpit video recorder that can store video images in solid - state memory and in conjunction with voice recording will be developed .

As teen flirtation and sexual experimentation enter the digital age , man -bites - dog stories about adolescent exhibitionists being charged as kiddie pornographers may soon seem no more newsworthy than reports of cops breaking up a kegger .
But one group of Pennsylvania parents is pretty sure their daughters are n't sex offenders — and with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union , they 're suing to force a zealous county district attorney to back off .
In what 's becoming a familiar pattern , Tunkhannock School District officials confiscated a student 's cell phone late last year , and discovered an array of photographs of local girls in various states of undress — photos that male students had apparently been trading and collecting more avidly than Pok�mon cards .
Duly horrified , Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick decided he had to protect these young women ... by threatening to prosecute them for " sexual abuse of children . "
In a letter sent to parents in February , Skumanick declared that both the boys caught swapping the photos and the girls who'd been photographed would have to submit to a reeducation program or risk being charged with a felony .
In addition to accepting six months probation , the students would have to pony up $ 100 for a five - week , ten - hour program that would , among other things , help them " gain an understanding of what it means to be a girl in today 's society . "
The parents of most of the 20 or so students involved readily assented .
But the parents of Marissa Miller and Grace Kelly were less than scandalized when they saw the snapshot for which their daughters had posed : both were shown wearing opaque white bras no more revealing than a bikini top — one on the phone , the other flashing a peace sign .
Skumanick averred that it was nevertheless child pornography because the girls were posed " provocatively . "
The pseudonymous Nancy Roe was a bit more exposed in her photo , which showed her fresh from the shower with a towel wrapped around her torso , below her breasts .
But her mother doubted whether a bit of nudity was all it took to make a picture " pornographic . "
The ACLU shared the parents ' skepticism — though they 've had to rely on second - hand descriptions so far .
Skumanick wo n't show the photos to anybody else , including the parents ' lawyers , for fear of becoming a kiddie - porn " distributor " himself .
In a lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of the mothers of the three girls , the civil liberties group argues that photos merely showing minors in their underwear or topless so clearly fall outside the statutory definition of " pornography " that Skumanick could not possibly have any " reasonable expectation of obtaining a conviction . "
Rather , the mothers charge that Skumanick is using a frivolous threat of prosecution to bully parents into accepting his childrearing " assistance . "
The plaintiffs are asking a federal district court to issue declaratory ruling that the photos are protected speech , not obscenity , and to enjoin Skumanick 's threats as a violation of their parental rights .
Though the core of the ACLU 's argument is simply that the photos do n't fit any reasonable definition of porn , the filing also notes that there 's something perverse about planning to charge girls as accomplices in the creation of kiddie porn for the " crime " of allowing themselves to be photographed .
While some similar cases involved students who sent pictures of themselves to boyfriends , it 's not clear in this case whether the girls in the photos ever themselves possessed or distributed the pictures .
Perhaps understandably , the ACLU filing does n't broach the harder question of whether it makes any sense to wield laws designed to protect children from exploitative pedophiles against adolescents sharing racy photos with each other .
Recent surveys show that some 20 percent of teens have done precisely that , either via the Internet or cell - phone cams .
The courts have traditionally recognized several legal justifications for criminalizing the possession and distribution — as opposed to the creation — of child porn .
There 's the state 's interest in protecting the minor depicted from further exposure , of course , and the desire to deprive pedophiles of images that can be shown to future victims in order to weaken their resistance .
But at the core of the Supreme Court ruling that upheld child porn laws against a First Amendment challenge , New York v. Ferber , was the assumption that child porn would nearly always be the byproduct of an initial act of exploitation of a child by an adult .
Criminalizing possession of the product was meant to undermine the market for its creation .
In a more recent case , Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , the court found that " virtual " child porn — that is , the sort created without the use of actual children — could not be criminalized consistent with the First Amendment .
While " sexting " obviously does involve actual minors , the grounds on which the Court distinguished its holding in this case from Ferber seem relevant .
In Ferber , the majority found , the " production of the work , not its content , was the target of the statute . "
Distribution or possession of the work was subject to penalty because there remained " a proximate link to the crime from which it came . "
When teens produce the work themselves — either alone or , depending on state law , with a partner roughly the same age — there may not be a distinct " crime from which it came . "
It 's easy enough to understand the desire to deter " sexting " : when those images do get into the wild , as they all too easily do , they tend to spread with incredible speed , making an immature lapse of judgment a potentially permanent burden .
On the other hand , the seven - year prison term that would accompany a conviction seems fairly burdensome too .
And the girls would still find their photos plastered on the Internet : on Pennsylvania 's registered sex offenders website , along with residence and employment data .
An initial hearing in the suit is scheduled for Thursday afternoon .
It remains to be seen whether the public attention the case is garnering will affect Skumanick 's bid for reelection in May .
At last year 's Akademy the vision of the Social Desktop was born and first presented to a larger audience .
The concept behind the Social Desktop is to bring the power of online communities and group collaboration to desktop applications and the desktop shell itself .
One of the strongest assets of the Free Software community is its worldwide community of contributors and users who belief in free software and who work hard to bring the software and solutions to the mainstream .
You can find more of this conceptual background on Frank Karlitschek 's slides from his keynote at Akademy 2008 .
A core idea of the Social Desktop is connecting to your peers in the community , making sharing and exchanging knowledge easier to integrate into applications and the desktop itself .
One of the ideas Frank addressed was to place a widget on the desktop where users can find other KDE users in the same city or region , making it possible to connect to these people , to contact them and to collaborate .
If a user is starting KDE for the first time he has questions .
At the moment a lot of the support for KDE users is provided through forums and mailinglists .
Users have to start up a browser and search for answers for their questions or problems .
The community is relatively loosely connected , it is spread all over the web , and it is often hard to verify the usefulness and accuracy of the information found somewhere out on the web .
Although is works relatively well for experienced users , beginners often get lost .
Access to a lot of user - generated information offers a great way to provide online community support .
This user - generated content comes from openDesktop.org right now and there is work going on integrating the KDE Forum as knowledge Base as well , so people can help each other via the web , and application developers transparently integrate this knowledge into applications and the desktop .
Open Collaboration Services
OpenDesktop.org is a reference implementation of the Open Collaboration Services ( OCS ) API .
Open Collaboration Services API allows to exchange data relevant to the Social Network between the site and clients , such as other websites and applications or widgets running locally on the user 's machine or mobile device .
These services are :
Person allows to retrieve data sets of other people
allows to retrieve data sets of other people Friend is used for handling friendship relations between people .
It can be used for retrieval of your own friends and those of others , to invite persons as a friend and manage these invitations

It can be used for retrieval of your own friends and those of others , to invite persons as a friend and manage these invitations Message is used for exchanging messages with other users

It 's basically " What is going on in my social network ? "
provides a record of activities , such as adding content .
It 's basically " What is going on in my social network ? "
Content includes listing and getting for example themes and wallpapers , content that is shared on the site
includes listing and getting for example themes and wallpapers , content that is shared on the site Knowledge Base offers a way to get help about a specific topic .
This can be used to integrate community support into applications
openDesktop.org is also the combined portal to KDE - Look.org and KDE - Apps.org .
openDesktop is an online social network , including content sharing .
You can upload and download new wallpapers , themes , but also other content for application , such as dictionaries , and of course new Plasma widgets .
Purchase of offering of content will be enabled in openDesktop in the future , so app store functionality can be integrated as well .
Start of a KDE implementation
During the openSuse hack - week , Cornelius Schumacher has written a small library and a test application to interact with openDesktop.org .
This OCS client libary wraps the webservice calls and XML handling into a Qt / KDE style API .
The library is built to be used asynchronous , so the interaction on the network which can cause delays .
This helps keeping applications that are using the network responsive .
Sebastian Kügler has been working on integrating Open Collaboration Services into Plasma by writing a dataengine and a basic applet .
Plasma applets use this dataengine to visualise data , the dataengine makes it easy to query for this data , also from applets written in JavaScript , Python and Ruby and other languages .
A screencast shows how the mechanism is used in Plasma .
Ogg / Theora Version
The openDesktop Plasmoid is a first basic applet using these services on the desktop .
As an applet , it sits on your desktop or dashboard and displays information related to your friends .
It also allows you to find people in your vicinity .
The applet using a geolocation Plasma service to find out the current location and queries people near this location through OCS .
The plasmoid displays those people and allows getting in contact with them , currently in a very basic way by pointing the web browser to the right page .
The dataengine and the applet aim at being released with KDE 4.3 this summer in a release early , release often fashion for people to play with the technology and give feedback for further improvements .
Ideas
We invite people to work with us on the community integration of the social desktop .
There are many ideas , often not hard to implement , as they can also be written in JavaScript , Python and Ruby using Plasma 's strong scripting capabilities .
Show what my KDE friends are doing at the moment - People love to see what is going on in their KDE friends network , did they post a new entry on their weblog ?
Where are they hanging out ?
More examples are
A friend of mine posted a new blog entry
A friend of mine uploaded a new application or wallpaper on KDE - Look.org
A friend of mine is going to the Linux User Group meeting tomorrow .
There is an update for an application I am fan of .
A friend of mine committed a new feature in the KDE SVN
Someone was on my profile page and offered me a KDE related job
A friend of mine is now a fan of " Amarok "
Another interesting area of research is using the Semantic Desktop 's concepts to build this network .
According to Richard Dale , FOAF ( Friend - of - a- Friend ) is an interesting ontology to investigate , others are SIOC for blogging info ,
SCOT for tags that are connected to semantic web ontologies , rather then just being names and DOAP as description of a project .
Using data from Akonadi to support the dataset on the social desktop , and the other way round seems like another candidate , updating the location of a contact in Akonadi based on the data from the OCS service seems like an obvious candidate for a nice improvement .
In general , there are very strong connections between the local address book and people you interact with on social web services .
The ground work for an online knowledge database has already been laid by Marco Martin .
He added support for Knowledge Base to the ocs dataengine , writing an applet on top of it is now relatively easy .
It would be great to have a plasmoid where users can directly query an online knowledge base system .
For bonus points , add support for posting questions .
So join the fun and help us putting the community into the applications and the desktop .
You can find us on the Social Desktop mailing list .

The Environmental Protection Agency will announce today that it is granting California ’s request to impose tough restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks -- reversing the Bush administration ’s position and opening the way for the state to take the lead on global - warming policy .
California developed the standards in 2004 but was barred from implementing them .
EPA officials say granting California the waiver from federal standards gives the state wide latitude to promulgate stricter rules , restoring a 40 - year interpretation of the Clean Air Act .
“ It preserves California ’s role as a leader on clean air policy , ” particularly on motor vehicles , EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in an interview .
“ It feels good to know that we are able to move past -- address -- this issue , responding to the president ’s call . ”

President Obama had criticized the Bush EPA ’s denial and , shortly after his inauguration , ordered the agency to revisit it .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called the decision a “ huge step for our emerging green economy that will create thousands of new jobs and bring Californians the cars they want while reducing greenhouse gas emissions . ”
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , a longtime advocate of the waiver , said the EPA did “ what is right for the people of California , the environment and the many states in the union that intend to follow California ’s lead in cleaning up tailpipe emissions . ”
But critics said the EPA should not give up federal control of climate policy .

“ California already has experience in adopting differential regulations for gasoline and electricity , ” said Scott Segal , an attorney for Bracewell and Giuliani in Washington , which represents utilities and refiners on climate change policy .
“ In each case , the results have been high prices for consumers , small businesses , schools , hospitals and industry .
The precedent set here for cars could be just as damaging . ”
Today ’s decision sets the stage for the proposed national vehicle emissions standards that Obama announced in May : New cars and trucks sold in the U.S. will be required to improve their fuel efficiency gradually over the next seven years , reaching an average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 -- a 40 % improvement over the current 25 mpg level .
The federal government agrees to adopt California ’s standards as its own , and the state agrees not to toughen the standards before 2017 .
Automakers agree to drop lawsuits against California ’s standards .
Agreement on the national standards came after intensive negotiations between the administration , California , environmentalists and the auto industry .
In the future , California could petition the EPA to set even stricter emissions standards , which probably would be granted on the legal grounds that the administration reaffirmed in granting this request .

“ Congress recognized that California could serve as a pioneer and a laboratory for the nation in setting new motor vehicle emission standards , ” Jackson wrote in today ’s decision .
“ Congress intentionally structured this waiver provision to restrict and limit EPA ’s ability to deny a waiver , and did this to ensure that California had broad discretion in selecting the means it determined best to protect the health and welfare of its citizens . ”
The original Clean Air Act , passed in the 1960s , included a provision that allowed California to seek permission to set its own tougher standards .
Other states could adopt California ’s rules or stick with the federal government’s .
Spurred by a 2002 state law , California adopted standards for tailpipe emission of greenhouse gases , which scientists blame for climate change .
The state petitioned to enforce them under the Clean Air Act , and a dozen other states lined up to adopt them .
But late in 2007 , President Bush ’s EPA denied the request -- the first time in more than 50 instances that the agency had rejected an entire set of proposed California standards .
Advertisement
Stephen L. Johnson , EPA administrator at the time , said California had failed to demonstrate that the standards were necessitated by “ compelling and extraordinary conditions ” as required by law , because global warming was not an extraordinary threat to the state compared to the country as a whole .
Obama ’s EPA disagreed .
Jackson , the current administrator , said today ’s decision stemmed from a careful reading of the Clean Air Act and EPA history .
“ This decision was based entirely on the law , ” she said , “ and not at all on politics . ”
Longtime advocates of the waiver cheered Monday night .
Advertisement
State Sen. Fran Pavley ( D - Agoura Hills ) , who wrote California ’s 2004 emissions law , took a break from state budget negotiations to share a celebratory bottle of non-alcoholic Pinot Noir with colleagues .
“ For our state , it ’s quite a victory , ” she said , “ and for the coalition we had working on this bill back when global warming was n’t the issue of the day . ”

The Obama administration marked with little fanfare a major milestone in its bank rescue effort  its decision on Tuesday to let 10 big banks repay federal aid that had sustained them through the worst of the crisis  as policy makers and industry executives focused on the challenges still before them .
“ This is not a sign that our troubles are over , ” President Obama said .
“ Far from it . ”
While the announcement had been expected for weeks , the official word put the administration ’s imprimatur on a corps of big banks considered healthy enough to extricate themselves from Washington ’s grip .
The bank holding companies , among them American Express , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley , plan to return a combined $ 68.3 billion .
That represents more than a quarter of the federal bailout money that the nation ’s banks have received since last October , when many feared that failures might cascade through the industry .
But the decision to allow the banks to exit the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , also ushered in a new , and potentially risky , phase of the banking crisis .
Letting the lenders out now  earlier than many had envisioned , and without the industry reforms some consider necessary to prevent future crises  raises many sobering questions for policy makers , bankers and taxpayers .

Apparently Mike Arrington ( TechCrunch ) was on the “ B ” list for review copies of the Palm Pre and decided to be huffy with Leo , who let him have it back .
At some point people need to realize that Mike Arrington is indeed a douche .
He once stiffed us at Cranky Geeks , never showed up and never apologized or even bothered to call .
It was pretty amazing , unprofessional and inconsiderate .
This BS about Leo slanting his opinion based on having a loaner is laughable .
What irks me most about this guy is his constant assertions that he gets never - ending death threats .
Why ?
For what ?
I do not want to trivialize death threats as I have had them when writing Op - Eds for a daily newspaper and reporting on gun control and Middle East politics .
I ’ve never gotten any for writing about tech .
And I did n’t hole up when I got them years ago for other commentary .
So what is this all about Mike ?
The casinos have repeatedly asked for a reprieve , proposing a regulatory body to cut down on abuses , and lately pointing out that the ban would create hardships for workers during the crisis .
The industry has also said it pays more than $ 1 billion a year in taxes .
But Mr. Putin and his protégé , President Dmitri A. Medvedev , have not yielded .
“ The rules will not be revised in any way , ” Mr. Medvedev said last month , “ and there will be no backsliding , although various business organizations have been lobbying for precisely this . ”
The gambling industry here does not have the loftiest of reputations , and many Russians will not grieve for it .
Still , many of the 40 or so casinos in Moscow sought in recent years to behave more respectably , even as hundreds of slot - machine parlors retained a seedy , enter - at - your - own - risk feel .
The gambling industry says the ban will leave more than 400,000 people without work in Russia , at a time when it has been hard hit by the economic downturn : the World Bank predicts the economy will contract by 7.9 percent this year .
The government has put the figure at 60,000 people , though industry analysts say that is absurdly low .
Storm International , a gambling conglomerate controlled by a British expatriate , Michael Boettcher , said that until recently , it alone employed 6,000 people at Shangri - La and several other casinos in Moscow .
Casinos in Russia are now to be confined to the Altai region of Siberia ; the coastal area of the Far East , near the border with North Korea and China ; Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania ; and the Azov Sea region in the south .
Until casinos open there , Russia will be one of the few countries in Europe without them , though underground ones are likely to be established .
After the law passed , federal officials and casino executives seemed certain that it would be watered down , which is apparently why neither the casinos nor the four regions did anything to prepare .
“ You know , in our country , the decisions are made by only one person , ” said Samuil Binder , deputy executive director of the Russian Association for Gaming Business Development .
He was referring to Mr. Putin .
After the Soviet Union ’s fall in 1991 , gambling sprang up everywhere in Russia , from first - class locations in Moscow to side - alley hangouts in the provinces .
The crazy - quilt growth was something of a metaphor for capitalism here , full of possibilities and schemes and corruption .
Most of us are familiar with James Dobson 's Focus on the Family outfit , since they 've played a major role in promoting the religious right 's positions for the past decade and more nationally : " The group supports the teaching of " traditional family values " .
It advocates school sponsored prayer and supports corporal punishment .
It strongly opposes abortion , so - called militant feminism , homosexuality , pornography , and pre-marital and extramarital sexual activity . "
Now , Michael Reynolds at JulyDogs has a series of posts detailing how FoF 's influence is spreading south of the border too -- and it is n't pretty :
On Saturday an internal intelligence report on La Familia from the Mexican justice department surfaced in Milenio , bringing the news that the faith - based cartel grounds its indoctrination program on the writings of macho Christian author and veteran Focus On The Family senior fellow John Eldredge , who now heads Ransomed Hearts Ministries in Colorado Springs .
There are four separate references to Eldredge in the Mexican intelligence memo on La Familia .
The cartel has conducted a three - year recruitment and PR campaign across Michoacan featuring thousands of billboards and banderas carrying their evangelical message and warnings .
La Familia is known for tagging its executions and other mayhem as “ la divina justica ” –divine justice .
The report says La Familia leader , Nazario Gonzalez Moreno aka El Loco o More Chayo ( ” The Craziest ” ) has made Eldredge ’s books required reading for La Familia and has paid rural teachers and National Development Education members to circulate the Colorado - based evangelical ’s writings throughout the Michoacan countryside .
Reynolds goes on to cite Christian blogger Tim Challies :
John Eldredge became a major player in the evangelical world with the release of The Sacred Romance which he co-authored with Brent Curtis ( who has since died ) .
Following The Sacred Romance he wrote Wild at Heart , Waking The Dead , The Journey of Desire and more recently , Epic .
I have read all of these except for Waking The Dead and The Journey of Desire .
Eldredge ’s books are targeted primarily at men and his writings have great appeal for men , many of whom feel that society has forced them to be like Mr. Rogers – harmless and just a little effeminate .
Eldredge encourages men to be real men – to head to the wilderness and be the rugged warriors we all want to be if we look deep inside ourselves .
Eldredge continually writes about William Wallace of Braveheart or Maximus , the main character in Gladiator – real manly men . ”
As Reynolds explores in two follow - up posts , the way this has translated on the ground in Mexico is a wave of violence directed against not merely rival drug gangs , but also anyone who fails to live up to its version of " masculine Christianity " :
“ La Familia does n’t kill for money , does n’t kill women , does n’t kill innocent people .
It only kills those who deserve to die .
Everyone should know this : Divine justice . ” –message left with five severed heads on the dance floor of the Sol y Sombra nightclub in Uruacan , Michoacan , September 6 , 2006 .
...
From all available information so far , it appears that La Familia has developed into a faith - based right - wing populist social movement emanating from and orchestrated by an organization that happens to be a well - armed , well - financed violent criminal enterprise .
... La Familia is strongly pro-family ( and all that that implies ) and requires its members to abstain from alcohol and drugs .
There is an indoctrination program all La Familia recruits must go through that inculcates “ personal values , ethical and morlal principles consistent with the purposes of the organization . ”
Last year La Familia brought in two motivational speakers to lecture its members .
The group is hierarchic and maintains a strict top - down emotional control of its members .
Think of Jim Jones ’ People ’s Temple , only with more money and firepower and you get the idea .
So maybe Tony Perkins ' bashing of Dr. George Tiller just prior to his assassination was not an accident after all .
Just do n't tell Glenn Beck or Michelle Malkin .
Their heads will explode .
When asked about the 17,000 extra troops the United States will be sending to Afghanistan this year as part of President Obama ’s long - touted “ surge , ” Afghan President Hamid Karzai declared that while the soldiers were welcome to protect the borders and try to provide better security they were , in his estimation , “ seven years too late . ”
“ We kept requesting .
It did n’t happen .
I wish these troops have arrived at that time , ” the Afghan president said in an interview on NewsHour , adding that he had been requesting more troops since 2002 .
Karzai also embraced reports that President Obama is soon to come out with a new regional strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Karzai said he hoped “ it will be one that will go with the reality on the ground , ” and said it was his desire to see more effort go into strengthening the Afghan government ’s police and military forces .
Much of the coverage of the current political storms in this country gives the impression that it all takes place in isolation from the rest of the world .
It is consequently refreshing to read George Monbiot pointing out that " the revolutions and reforms experienced by almost all other developed countries have been averted in Britain by foreign remittances .
The social unrest that might have transformed our politics was instead outsourced to our colonies and unwilling trading partners . "
In the days when colonialist ideals were unblushingly stated and upheld by Britain 's government and business interests alike , Cecil Rhodes readily admitted that it was precisely this " outsourcing " of social unrest that was the underlying goal of his enterprise in Africa .
He recalled how in 1895 , he witnessed a meeting of the unemployed in East London , where " wild speeches " called for " bread ! bread ! " .
This led him to conclude that the only way to save this country from " a bloody civil war " was to " acquire new lands to settle the surplus population , to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factory and the mines .
If you want to avoid civil war , you must become imperialists " .
Well , you can't become imperialists nowadays , or not of the old colonialist type anyway .
Rhodesia has long since become Zimbabwe , and , as Monbiot shows , the chickens are now coming home to roost .
Social unrest will , from now on , " transform our politics " .
Monbiot cites a number of authors who have addressed this issue ( Hamza Alavi , Ralph Davis , Eric Hobsbawm , John Newsinger and Mike Davis ) .
However , he leaves one rather obvious omission , namely , Lenin , who , some months before the 1917 October revolution in Russia , memorably quoted Rhodes 's words in his pamphlet , Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism .
Rhodes 's frank admission of his motives fitted neatly into Lenin 's argument that the contradictions underlying capitalism in its imperialist phase are ultimately insoluble and must inevitably end in its overthrow – an argument of increased force today when the former colonies have long been advancing towards greater levels of independence .
Lenin also ridiculed the idea that imperialism had overcome its contradictions and that a less conflictual " ultra - imperialism " had emerged – that being a buzzword of his day , just as " globalisation " is of ours .
Monbiot concludes that " the government can no longer insulate us from reality " .
But his prescriptions for what we are to do are limited in the extreme .
To find how our " small , densely populated country which produces very little supports itself " , he recommends the works of Joseph Stiglitz , author of such works as Globalisation and its Discontents and Making Globalisation Work .
It is ironic that these are precisely the works that have been endlessly quoted by Gordon Brown , who liberally peppers his speeches with remarks about the " discontents " of globalisation and his " determination to make globalisation work " .
The following comment from a November 2006 speech to the CBI , in particular , could almost have been taken word for word from Stiglitz :
Globalisation is a fact and here to stay .
The real question not whether it exists or not , but whether it is well managed or badly managed , and one of my themes today is that it is for us to be evangelists for globalisation , taking on the anti-globalisation and protectionist forces who fail to recognise today 's economic truth that free trade , open markets and flexibility are preconditions of modern economic success across our global economy .
Well , does globalisation work ?
Surely the evidence of recent months is that it does not and cannot .
Indeed , it is more reasonable to conclude that it is precisely by seeking to sustain the illusion that globalisation can work that the government has done most to " insulate us from reality " .
The Imperial March on a floppy disk is still cool and all , but this video takes the concept to a whole new level .

Big Ideas ( do n't get any ) [ vimeo ]
Thanks Michael Jackson , but stay the f*** away from my kids
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The titans of Wall Street may not have done a bang - up job of running the American financial sector over the past few years , but would a bunch of politicians in Washington , DC , do any better ?
We ’re probably about to find out — and to understand how we got here , and why it suddenly does n’t seem like such a bad idea , you ’ve got to start at the beginning .
The very beginning .
In America , it ’s the stock market that gets all the headlines .
If you ’re sentient enough to fog a mirror , you know that stocks have dropped by half in the past 18 months .
It ’s been a disaster for 401 ( k ) s and pension funds across the country .
But the fact is that this is a sideshow .
The total size of the US equities market — the value of every single share of stock traded on US exchanges — is about $ 10 trillion .
The size of the US credit market is more than $ 30 trillion .
What ’s more , credit is more important than equities .
As the saying goes , credit is like oxygen :
You do n’t realize how much you need it until it ’s gone .
When credit dries up — as it has recently — the economy grinds to a halt .
But why has credit dried up ?
Let ’s back up again .
The main providers of credit are banks , and the amount of money they can lend depends on two things : their capital stock and their capital ratios .
Say that you and some friends decide to start a bank and you pitch in $ 1 billion to get things rolling .
That ’s your capital .
And say that your bank makes a profit of $ 1 billion for nine years in a row .
Your capital is now $ 10 billion .
The amount you can loan out depends on your capital ratio , a number that ’s set in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
If you ’re required to have , say , a 5 percent capital reserve , that means your loan portfolio can be as high as 20 times your capital .
That ’s $ 200 billion — and if you fudge things a bit , say through the creative use of off - balance - sheet vehicles , maybe you can loan out as much as $ 300 billion .
If the average return on your loan portfolio is 5 percent , that means you ’re making about $ 15 billion per year with only $ 10 billion of your own money at stake .
Not bad .
But then a crash comes .
Homeowners start defaulting on their loans , and you have to write off the losses .
That cuts into your capital ; plus , with the economy falling , it ’s prudent to reduce your leverage .
Instead of 30 - to - 1 , maybe you ’ll cut back to 20 - to - 1 .
The end result is that you ’re lending way less money than you used to .
This is , roughly , what ’s been happening to the global financial system .
Loan losses have reduced capital .
Everyone is hoarding money .
It ’s called deleveraging , and in plain English it means that credit markets are broken .
But things can still get worse .
What happens if your capital is wiped out completely by loan losses ?
Then your bank is insolvent .
The lights are still on , people still come to work , and bills still get paid , but there ’s no lending at all .
And without lending , you are n’t really a bank .
You ’re a zombie .
So is the American banking system insolvent ?
It ’s probably pretty close .
But this does n’t mean that every bank is insolvent .
It just means that the overall average is neutral : Some banks are doing fine , while others are deeply in the hole .
And the ones who are in the hole , which include some of the country ’s biggest , need to be dealt with .
But how ?
We could , of course , simply let the bad banks fail .
But that ’s what the government allowed to happen to Lehman Brothers last September , and the results were catastrophic .
Markets went wild , credit froze , and there was a run on money market funds that stopped only when the Fed stepped in to guarantee them .
When a really big bank fails — and some of the banks currently in trouble are a lot bigger than Lehman — it can cause a cascade of defaults that ignites a global firestorm and destroys entire economies .
So no matter how appealing it sounds on poetic - justice grounds to let the banks that got us into this mess simply go under , the infuriating fact is that we simply can’t afford to let that happen .
Aside from allowing banks to fail , then , there are four main options .
The first is to muddle through .
The US banking system is still profitable , after all , and this means that over time insolvent banks will build their capital base back up and start lending again .
Unfortunately , “ over time ” could mean years , and nobody wants a broken banking system for that long .
( Japan tried this after its banking crisis of the early ’90s , and the result is popularly known as the “ Lost Decade . ” )
Option No. 2 is for the government to set up what ’s called a “ bad bank ” that buys up the banking system ’s “ toxic waste , ” loans that have gone bad and are likely to get even worse , eating up bank capital along the way .
Unfortunately , the reason this stuff is called “ toxic ” is because the eventual losses from these loans are impossible to forecast .
Are they worth 70 cents on the dollar ?
Fifty cents ?
Twenty cents ?
Nobody knows , and without knowing that , it ’s impossible to buy them up .
There ’s still a plan on the books to attempt the purchase of toxic assets , but most observers give it little chance of success unless it ’s so heavily subsidized by the government that it amounts to little more than a massive giveaway .
That leads us to option No. 3 : recapitalization .
Last year , after former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson realized that buying up toxic waste would n’t work , he decided to provide direct capital infusions to banks .
The idea here is simple :
If the banks do n’t have enough capital , then give them some more .
Even with big losses , if you give them enough , then they ’ll be able to lend money once again .
One problem , though :
There ’s no reason for taxpayers to simply give money to banks .
We need to get something in return .
But what ?
Paulson ’s answer was preferred stock , a weird hybrid entity that counts as equity but is really just a thinly disguised loan .
There ’s nothing inherently wrong with that , except that Paulson bought the shares on giveaway terms .
Take Goldman Sachs , for example , which received $ 5 billion in new capital from Warren Buffett last September .
In return Buffett received a dividend yield of 10 percent per year and , according to an analysis by Bloomberg , warrants worth $ 3.6 billion .
And Paulson ?
He gave Goldman $ 10 billion a month later , and in return received a dividend of 5 percent for the first five years and warrants worth less than $ 1 billion .
Eight other big banks got similar terms at the same time .
It was a sweetheart deal deliberately designed to not put additional stress on the banks , but the flip side is that taxpayers got robbed .
Simon Johnson , a former research director for the International Monetary Fund , said at the time that the transactions were “ just egregious . ”
Paulson seemed to be spending more time figuring out how to spend taxpayer dollars in ways that would n’t offend the delicate sensibilities of the folks getting the checks than he was in getting a good deal for the taxpayers .
But the reason for those easy terms is n’t hard to figure out .
Basically , if Paulson had paid any more , he would have owned several of the banks he gave money to .
Take Citigroup .
So far they ’ve received two capital injections from the government worth a total of $ 45 billion .
But that ’s more than the entire bank is worth .
As I write this , Citigroup stock is trading for less than $ 2 ; you could buy up the entire bank for less than $ 10 billion .
But Paulson did n’t want to own Citi , and the only way to make sure he did n’t was to give it money on such absurdly favorable terms that $ 45 billion only bought a small share of the company .
That ’s good news for Citi and the other banks that got easy money from the government , but both politicians and the public have gotten tired of such handouts .
So , finally , this brings us to option No : 4 : temporary nationalization .
Here , the big problem is , since the banks have n’t exactly been honest about their books , how do you decide which ones are insolvent and which can keep going on their own ?
Assessing the capital position of a big bank with a complex balance sheet is a notoriously tricky task , as much art as science , and shareholders and creditors have a legitimate beef if the government takes over a bank and wipes out their investment when the bank might still be solvent and able to grow out of its problems on its own .
John Hempton , a former bank executive and Australian treasury official , suggests a solution he calls “ nationalization after due process ” :
A third party is hired to comb the bank ’s books , and if they ’re found to be undercapitalized they ’re given a chance to raise the needed capital privately from investors .
If investors are n’t willing to pony up even knowing the bank ’s position , then it ’s nationalized , and shareholders can’t complain that they were n’t given a fair chance to save their investment .
This specific idea might or might not work , but certainly some kind of consistent , transparent system is needed to make the process fair and acceptable .
Sweden , for example , which went through a housing bubble followed by a banking crisis in the early ’90s , created a Bank Support Authority that forced banks to fairly account for their losses without the smoke and mirrors common to internal accounting .
Two were eventually taken over .
President Obama clearly has considered the Swedish experience : “ They took over the banks , ” he said on Nightline last month , “ nationalized them , got rid of the bad assets , resold the banks , and a couple years later , they were going again .
So you ’d think looking at it , Sweden looks like a good model . ”
Yet , he went on , the United States has a “ different set of cultures ” than Sweden , and Americans would find nationalization a hard pill to swallow .
Unsaid but implicit in Obama ’s statement , though , is that Americans could likely be persuaded to accept nationalization if they understand that all the alternatives are worse .
In fact , this may have been exactly the point of the bank rescue plan Obama ’s treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , announced shortly after that interview .
A key element of the plan involves a mandatory “ stress test ” for the country ’s biggest banks , which sounds remarkably similar to Hempton ’s third - party auditor and Sweden ’s Bank Support Authority .
It could turn out to have been a smart PR move as much as anything :
Get everyone talking about the stress tests , worrying about the stress tests , gossiping about the stress tests — and by the time the results become public , it ’s hard to imagine any recourse other than nationalization for the banks that do n’t pass .
The stress test is also a way to address both of the two big problems with nationalization .
Not only can it fairly decide which banks are solvent and which ones are n’t , but it also addresses the dreaded “ contagion ” problem :
Since investors are wiped out when a bank is nationalized , the mere fear of nationalization can scare private investors away from every bank , even the good ones .
But if stress tests are done on every bank and the bad ones are all nationalized at once , the good banks are freed from fears that they might be next on the government chopping block .
And in truth , nationalization is more than the least worst option :
It actually has a lot of benefits .
It allows rapid reorganization and write - down of debts without the associated chaos of a bank failure .
It wipes out shareholders and forces creditors to take a haircut , just as in a normal bankruptcy .
And unlike endless capital injections in return for small stakes , it ’s a fair option for American taxpayers , who deserve to own more than just a minority share if they ’re investing more than the bank is worth in the first place .
Nationalization also solves the problem of valuing toxic assets :
The government can simply sit on the stuff until the market turns up and then sell it off for the best price it can get .
There ’s no need to immediately value it at all .
Most important , with the full faith and credit of the United States government behind them , nationalized banks can be recapitalized and made into functional credit providers again .
And as soon as they ’re back on their feet , they can be sold back to the private sector , as happened in Sweden .
Taxpayers will still lose a lot of money on the deal — there ’s really no way of avoiding that at this point — but nationalization keeps those losses lower than any of the alternatives .
And there ’s one more thing about nationalization to keep in mind :
We already do it all the time .
The FDIC now takes over small banks every week , and among bigger institutions the government has already effectively nationalized Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and insurance giant AIG .
And for the most part , life goes on as usual .
If Citigroup or Bank of America were taken over , the board of directors would be dissolved , some of the senior staff would be replaced , shareholders and bondholders would take a hit , and the bank would continue running as normal except with a stronger capital base and government guarantees behind it .
Then , in a few years , it would be refloated and put back in private hands .
It ’s not as scary as it sounds .
As finance blogger Steve Waldman has put it , “ real capitalists nationalize . ”
The fundamental principle of a free market system is that ownership and control of failed enterprises should reside in the hands of whoever buys up the corpse .
If that ’s the government , then that means nationalization .
This may be why temporary nationalization has won the support not just of mainstream economists like Nouriel Roubini and Paul Krugman , but of no less a free market acolyte than former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan .
“ It may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring , ” he told the Financial Times in February .
“ I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do . ”

Genius recluse , über - perfectionist , lapsed Marxist , Luddite ; like the legendary directors of Hollywood 's Golden Age , Hayao Miyazaki 's intimidating reputation is almost as famous as his movies .
Mostly , though , Japan 's undisputed animation king is known for shunning interviews .
So it is remarkable to find him sitting opposite us in Studio Ghibli , the Tokyo animation house he co-founded in 1985 , reluctantly bracing himself for the media onslaught that now accompanies each of his new projects .
Once a well - kept secret , Miyazaki 's films are increasingly greeted with the hoopla reserved for major Disney releases .
Spirited Away , his Oscar - winning 2001 masterpiece , grossed more in Japan than Titanic and elevated his name into the pantheon of global cinema greats .
Time magazine has since voted him " one of the most influential Asians of the last six decades " .
Anticipation then is high for his latest , Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea , which has taken $ 160 m ( £ 107 m ) in ticket sales and been seen by 12 million people in Japan alone since last summer , and is now set for release this summer in the United States and Europe .
Miyazaki's 10th movie , the story of a young goldfish that longs to become human , is another chapter in his lifelong struggle to interpret the world of children , explains the director , who says Ghibli has recently built a crèche for its staff where he spends a lot of his time .
" I look at them and try to see things as they do .
If I can do that , I can create universal appeal . "
The relationship is two - way , he says .
" We get strength and encouragement from watching children .
I consider it a blessing to be able to do that , and to make movies in this chaotic , testing world . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Humans face a basic choice between love or money , he believes .
" A five - year - old understands that in a way an adult obsessed with the economy and share prices cannot .
I make movies that can be understood by that five - year - old , and to bring out that purity of heart . "
A stiff , avuncular presence in his tweed suit and maths teacher 's glasses , Miyazaki is clearly uneasy dealing with the media circus .
It 's unlikely the 68 - year - old has heard of British pop group Blur , but he would undoubtedly agree that Modern Life is Rubbish .
His movies are paeans to the natural world and coded warnings about its perilous state ; in a recent interview he fondly speculated on a natural disaster that would return the planet to its pristine state .
He spends years buried away in this wood - panelled refuge in a leafy Tokyo suburb , painstakingly bringing his creations to life .
The director was reportedly obsessed for months , for instance , over the colour and texture of the sea - waves that wash Ponyo ashore , where she is found by a five - year - old boy .
Once the creative process is complete , he has little interest in what happens , moans Ponyo's producer and Miyazaki 's long - time collaborator Toshio Suzuki .
" He gets engrossed in each movie , then when they 're finished he just forgets them and moves on , " Suzuki says
The director has " absolutely no sentimentality " for the finished product .
" It does n't matter how hard he works or how wonderful the movie is .
He does n't even like talking about them afterwards .
My job is to clean up his mess .
To be honest , he 's a pain in the ass !
But life is always interesting . "
Having experimented with digital and CG technology on Howl 's Moving Castle , Miyazaki has gone back to basics for Ponyo , which is made up of a stunning 170,000 individual hand - painted frames .
He says he has seen none of the landmark digital animations of the past two decades , including Toy Story and Pixar Studio 's recent smash Wall .E , despite being friends with Pixar 's creative director John Lasseter .
" I can't stand modern movies , " he winces .
" The images are too weird and eccentric for me . "
He shuns TV and most modern media , reading books or travelling instead .
It is no surprise to find that the multimillionaire director 's car , parked outside the Ghibli studio , is an antique Citröen CV , an icon of minimalist , unfussy driving .
Ghibli 's creative engine house is a reflection of its founder 's preoccupation with authenticity and distrust of popular culture .
New talent ( the studio has just added another 150 animators to its 270 full - time staff ) is tested out in a sort of animation boot camp , where the use of cell phones , blogs , iPods and other electronic devices is forbidden .

" Young people are surrounded by virtual things , " he laments .
" They lack real experience of life and lose their imaginations .
Animators can only draw from their own experiences of pain and shock and emotions . "
He is known to lecture constantly on the need to find harmony between the human hand , eye and brain , and the ever - expanding computer toolbox .
Ponyo , he says , is partly about living without technology .
" Most people depend on the internet and cellphones to survive , but what happens when they stop working ?
I wanted to create a mother and child who would n't be defeated by life without them . "
In a world groaning with increasingly sophisticated movie - making technology , Ghibli 's brand of old - fashioned craft looks as vulnerable as a vintage Rolls - Royce on a highway of speeding cars .
Miyazaki himself compares what he does to old clog ( geta ) makers in downtown Tokyo , now almost extinct , but much prized by aficionados .
Miyazaki understands that his style could become obsolete , claims the Ghibli president , Koji Hoshino , but he does n't care .
" If the audience disappears , that 's the end of his dialogue with them .
He 's not afraid of it .
He 's fully aware that this is an old - style operation and that 's why he decided to do a totally hand - drawn animation with Ponyo . "
As both he and Suzuki admit , however , Miyazaki 's uncompromising approach is expensive .
" We 've been doing this for 20 years , and each movie costs more than the last , " says Suzuki .
Although the director 's son , Goro Miyazaki , has also recently made his first film , Tales from Earthsea , the studio is still overwhelmingly dependent on the sparse output of its founder .
One flop , unlikely as that may be , could devastate the small company .
Enter Hoshino , who has been poached from the rival Disney empire , where he toiled for 15 years .
But Ghibli's new boss denies that his arrival signals an attempt to recast Miyazaki's Roller as a sleek American sports car .
" Miyazaki worked in the US in the early 1980s and came back saying , ' Forget it , I 'm not going to work like that ' , " says Hoshino .
" But what Disney is good at is exploiting every bit of commercial opportunity .
[ Ghibli ] has done almost nothing in merchandising outside Japan , so we 'll be looking at that , along with foreign distribution . "
Hoshino says a recent tie - up with long - time Steven Spielberg collaborators Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall is an example of the " much more aggressive and open - minded " tack the studio needs to take .
" I do n't shut the door on digital technology either .
Just because Ponyo was 100 - per cent drawn does n't mean we 're stuck with that approach .
My job is to come up with the best approach to make the most of Ghibli and try to come up with those untapped opportunities . "
Where does this leave the studio's maestro ?
It is hard to resist the image of a very Miyazaki-ian wilful child , struggling to remain unspoiled as the grubby workings of the real world begin to encroach .
It 's a theme explored in the story of the boy Sosuke , left , and Ponyo , the girl - fish whose rage and rebellion against the world result in a devastating storm .
" Ponyo 's rebellion is dangerous , but that 's part of life , " explains the director .
" Humans have both the urge to create and destroy . "

Go into the average newspaper office and you 'll find the reporters staring at Sky News or the BBC or Al - Jazeera International .
But visit the studios of Sky News , the BBC or Al - Jazeera International , and you 'll discover that all the journalists there are reading newspapers .
Its an odd form of osmosis which - being an old - fashioned reporter – I 'm not very happy about .
I still believe , along with an encouraging number of young Arab and Israeli reporters , that we 've got to be out on the streets , just as I was when I started in journalism in the Blyth office of the Newcastle Evening Chronicle .
So Fisk was prowling the streets of Cairo this week , hunting for Obama and Lady Hilary .
A colleague gave me Obama 's detailed schedule , and there was the key : " 11.50 am : POTUS and Sec of State Clinton tour mosque . "
Poor old Obama , I thought .
Surely he did n't deserve to be reduced to a codename like POTUS – until dimwit Fisk realised this stood for " President of the United States " .
How very American .
The Sultan Hassan mosque was just below the citadel and with my faithful driver Amr ( the Egyptian equivalent of my even more faithful driver Abed in Beirut ) , we swept through the police - heavy streets of Cairo to track down the POTUS and his lady .
So empty were the drab boulevards of downtown Cairo that we drove at 60 mph .
I should add that Amr comes from the Citadel area of Cairo and knew every back street to avoid the thousands of cops thronging the usually filthy highways of this raving hot city .
And we got there .
The mosques and the great Citadel of the Mamlukes baked in the noontime sun and around them lounged or stood to attention or snooped thousands of uniformed or plain - clothes mukhabarat security police .
They stood in the street , they stood atop 13th century mosques with rifles , they sat glowering in tea -shops .
They had emptied the place of real people , genuine Egyptians , and had " become " Cairo .
The plain - clothes lads - no women , of course – were all dressed in horrible 1970s suits with gun butts protruding from the bottom of their jackets .
Each wore an outrageously florid tie of indeterminate quality .

" You can not stay here , " one of them muttered at me – I had planned to hide in a local tea - house until I discovered that all the tea - drinkers were cops – " and anyway , they 're going through the other gate " .
Thanks mate .
And sure enough , round the corner were a hundred more officers .
There were police generals and police colonels and police captains and a vast horde of black uniformed security men ( all standing to attention with their backs to the road ) .
One of the generals had so much sparkling braid on his hat that I feared it might fall off because of the weight of gold .
And they were cheerful .
This foolish , obviously mad Englishman , wandering around in the midday sun , was a source of amusement to these bored men .
I 've come to see the POTUS , I explained .
One of them examined my press card .
" Fisk ! , " he shouted .
" I read what you write about us . "
This was not great news since I had n't been terribly kind about his president of late – but I think he was lying .
He did admit to me , though , that those ghastly police ties were all bought by the authorities .
I had thought as much .
I found only one other journalist there , a friendly Egyptian photographer for Reuters who helped to talk me through the last checkpoints until there we were , bang in front of the entrance to the mosque .
" They 're on their way ! " one of the thugs shouted .
And a swishing convoy of black limousines was suddenly upon us , three of them sporting huge American and Egyptian flags .
There were 32 security vehicles in all , some of them with Egyptian gunmen leaning half out of the window with their rifles .
A glimpse of the POTUS was enough , a lithe , athletic , tall figure beside a dumpy little old lady – that 's what happens when the " Sec of State " wants to appear alongside her boss – and they were gone , followed by a trail of hop - skip - and - jump White House press corps girls and boys trying to keep up .
Above them all , on the mosque walls , were massive , ancient gashes in the stones , shellfire from a much earlier age .
Did the Egyptians , I wonder , tell the POTUS who performed this sacrilege ?
For the culprit was another young and powerful Western leader , fascinated by the Middle East : Napoleon Bonaparte .
Only when I left did I see the Egyptians behind the police lines , old ladies with birds in wooden cages , a broken cripple with a wooden stick , Dickensian urchins without shoes , scarved girls licking ice - creams .
And I began to have my suspicions .
These people were no threat to the POTUS and the little American lady .
Indeed , I felt sure they would have been grateful for that strong handshake which is so willingly bestowed upon safe , blue - eyed Germans and Brits .
And I rather suspect the POTUS would like to have met these poor people .
It was the police who would have disapproved .
Not to mention the President of Egypt .
So the POTUS had been – to use Churchill 's fine description of Lenin as the Germans passed him through their land to infect Russia with Bolshevism – sealed off like a bacillus .
The POTUS was n't being protected from danger , I was sure .
He was being protected from the words these Egyptians might utter , from their views of the Arab world , of Egypt , from their views , perhaps , on the nature of democracy amid all these cops and security lads .
They might have spoken of corruption and nepotism and violence .
But the POTUS never saw them .
Anyway , he had too tight a schedule : there were words to utter across town , about human rights and justice in what he called " the timeless city of Cairo " .
Timeless yes .
And its people silent .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N said a contract to build the first two production models of the U.S. Navy 's new twin - engine E - 2D Advanced Hawkeye command and control aircraft was worth $ 432 million .
The fixed - price contract , which contains an incentive fee , includes funding for two production aircraft and will finance the acquisition of long - lead items for two more , the company said in a statement .
The Navy awarded Northrop the contract on Monday after the program passed a major milestone review , allowing Ashton Carter , the Pentagon ’s chief arms buyer , to approve the start of low - rate production of the plane , which acts as a type of digital quarterback , for the Navy .
Northrop won an initial $ 1.9 billion contract to design and develop the plane in August 2003 .
“ This contract award confirms that the E - 2D Advanced Hawkeye design is stable , and we have the critical manufacturing processes in place to produce and deliver a high - quality , reliable weapons system to the warfighter , ” said Jim Culmo , Northrop vice president in charge of the program .
Culmo said Northrop was on track to deliver the first pilot production aircraft in 2010 .
The E - 2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft are equipped with an advanced Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.
N radar that will pick up smaller targets at a greater range than currently deployed systems .
Once fielded , it will join the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter and EA - 18G Growler on Navy carriers .
The Navy said Carter signed an acquisition decision memorandum on June 11 allowing continued work on the program after cost increases triggered a review that could have led to its cancellation .
Carter also approved low - rate production , which allows a ramp - up in manufacturing of a new weapon system , giving the program time to iron out any production problems before it moves into full - rate production .
The Navy said a rigorous review of the program showed cost increases could be mitigated by buying the aircraft at a more efficient rate .
It said it was also pursuing cost - cutting initiatives , including possible multi-year procurements .
The current plan calls for the Navy to buy two aircraft in both fiscal years 2009 and 2010 .
It plans to buy 75 aircraft overall .

Neo-colonial tool serving geopolitical interests

Former Haitian Minister of Defence Patrick Elie asks , " Who is protecting the rights of the people of Iraq , killed by the bombs of those who would grant themselves the ' responsibility to protect ? "
Originally published May 13 , 2006 , updated September 2006 .
GlobalResearch.ca
In a recent appearance at McMaster University , former Haitian Minister of Defence Patrick Elie was asked by a member of the World Federalists NGO to support Canada 's new ' Responsibility to Protect ' ( R2P ) doctrine .
The ' R2P ' doctrine , developed by , among others , Michael Ignatieff , is that other countries should intervene in the politics of a sovereign country if they perceive instability or a human rights crisis .
Elie , who spoke at McMaster University early in March , acknowledged the need to protect people whose human rights come under attack .
But since the ' R2P ' doctrine is coming largely from the developed Western nations , many of which are violating human rights at this very moment , Elie asked , " Who is protecting the rights of the people of Iraq , killed by the bombs of those who would grant themselves the ' responsibility to protect ' ? "
In asking this question , Elie pointed out the dissonance between countries that are waging illegal wars on the one hand and painting themselves as ' responsible ' for the ' protection ' of those in the ' failed states ' of the Third World on the other .
Do the terms ' humanitarian intervention ' and ' responsibility to protect , ' invoke soldiers from Ethiopia coming to the US to arrest George Bush for war crimes and the highest rate of imprisonment in the world ?
Implicit in the doctrine is that white colonial powers will be the ones doing the ' protecting . '
Recently , news outlets , celebrities and government figures have made efforts to draw attention to Sudan and its endangered population of refugees .
Many have mobilized in favour of a ' humanitarian intervention ' involving Western troops invading for the stated purpose of helping the innocent victims of what is said to be government - sponsored aggression .
The fact that similar calls have not been made for nearby Congo , where millions have died in an ongoing civil war , however , calls into question what is driving the calls for ' humanitarian ' invasion of Sudan , justified by the Responsibility to Protect .
The Jerusalem Post reported that , " the [ Save Darfur ] coalition , which has presented itself as 'an alliance of over 130 diverse faith - based , humanitarian , and human rights organizations , ' was actually begun exclusively as an initiative of the American Jewish community . "
The embarrassed organizers of the recent Darfur rally in the US were forced to admit their failure to include other American ethnicities and organizations , such as the NAACP and the Africa Action group , and actually struggled to find a single Darfuri or Muslim speaker .
Christian fundamentalists have also been a key force in the coalition .
According to the Washington Post from April 27 , " Last week , after an inquiry from the Washington Post , [ Christian evangelist group ]
Sudan Sunrise changed its web site to eliminate references to efforts to convert the people of Darfur " .
Beyond the religious groups , who play a subsidiary role , the idea of Western intervention into Darfur is primarily an initiative of the US State Department .
Sudan 's oil - rich South Darfur and South Sudan regions make it the second - largest oil producer in Africa and its strategic location places the country at the gateway to the Middle East .
Perhaps crucially , Sudan has been using its oil money for projects that break with the dictates of the International Monetary Fund .
According to John Laughland , " Darfur is a region which is rich in oil and through which pipelines are to be constructed . "
The main investor in the Sudanese oil industry is the China National Petroleum Company , and China is Sudan 's biggest trading partner .
While there are numerous foreign oil companies present in Sudan , it is precisely in Southern Darfur that the Chinese National Petroleum Company has its concessions .
USAID , the American humanitarian agency , has helpfully provided a map of Sudan showing exactly where the oil concessions are .
China invested $ 300 million to expand Sudan 's largest refinery and now buys two - thirds of Sudan 's oil .
Well - known academics such as Noam Chomsky and Michel Chossudovsky have investigated a key feature of US policy in the MiddleEast : to deny oil to competitors , especially China .
Toronto Sun columnist Eric Margolis argues that the US is interested in nearby Chad 's oil as well .
The US Congress has allocated $ 500 million for military assistance to African governments , including Chad's , whose military has been engaged in conflict with Sudan .
Former US President Jimmy Carter has said that
The people in Sudan want to resolve the conflict .
The biggest obstacle is US government policy .
The US is committed to overthrowing the government in Khartoum .
Any sort of peace effort is aborted , basically by policies of the United States ... Instead of working for peace in Sudan , the US government has basically promoted a continuation of the war .
In 2001 , the US House of Representatives ' ' Sudan Peace Act ' provided $ 10 million in assistance to the National Democratic Alliance , described by US Sudan - specialist Stephen Morrison , the head of the Sudan project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , DC , as essentially a Darfuri rebel front group .
Further support for Carter 's claims comes from Enver Masud , who refers to a Washington Post article investigating how in 1996 , the US sent nearly $ 20 million in surplus US military equipment to Ethiopia , Eritrea and Uganda to topple the government of Sudan .
General Wesley Clark discovered that elements in the Pentagon have a five - year campaign to target certain regimes , and Sudan is number seven on the hit - list .
In his book , Winning Modern Wars , he writes :
As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001 , one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat .
Yes , we were still on track for going against Iraq , he said .
But there was more .
This was being discussed as part of a five - year campaign plan , he said , and there were a total of seven countries , beginning with Iraq , then Syria , Lebanon , Libya , Iran , Somalia and Sudan ...
He said it with reproach -- with disbelief , almost -- at the breadth of the vision .
I moved the conversation away , for this was not something I wanted to hear .
And it was not something I wanted to see moving forward , either ...
I left the Pentagon that afternoon deeply concerned .
Attacks on Sudan are nothing new .
The US under Bill Clinton bombed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan , claiming it was used to produce WMDs .
It was later revealed that US missiles had actually destroyed the largest producer of anti-malarial medicines in Africa .
The US has funded insurgencies in Sudan ever since the country moved away from the control of Western powers in the late 1970s , especially the rebel Sudan People 's Liberation Movement and Army [ SPLM / A ] group .
The late leader of the SPLA , John Garang , allied himself with the Christian - right .
Republican - right leader Senator Bill Frist once visited the disputed South Sudan and was photographed with Garang .
The US Christian - right is using the alleged oppression of Christians in the predominantly Muslim south to advocate a 19th century - style colonial intervention .
In negotiations with the Sudanese government , Garang managed to secure Kosovo - style autonomy for areas of southern Sudan .
As part of a US plan for balkanization , Sudan now has been strong - armed into accepting the unusual arrangement of a vice - president from Darfur and a vice - president from Southern Sudan .
Garang 's widow is now meeting with US leaders , including Frist , for further independence negotiations .
According to some observers , the US keeps Sudan in a perpetual state of war by making sure at least one rebel group is on the move while another is engaged in peace talks .
The recent round of " Save Darfur " demonstrations have taken place during a time of negotiations between government and rebel groups and are further destabilizing the country .
Yoshie Furuhashi explains , " The timing of the [ April 30 ] rally was perfect , designed to coincide -- and scuttle -- the Abuja peace negotiations between the rebels and Khartoum brokered by the African Union , whose deadline is midnight today .
And sure enough , the rebels rejected the peace deal . "
The US needs rebel groups to win bigger victories , if it is to reverse China 's current advantageous position in Sudan .
Meanwhile , George W. Bush himself has encouraged activists who are calling for ' humanitarian intervention ' in Darfur .
In May , the New York Sun reported that Bush endorsed the Save Darfur rally and met with several activists .
" For those of you who are going out to march for justice , you represent the best of our country , " Bush was quoted as saying .
In an editorial , the Sun wrote that leftists who support intervention in Darfur but oppose the invasion of Iraq or military aid to Israel are maintaining a double - standard .
" Mr. Bush is way ahead of the leftist Darfur advocates because he supports freedom and democracy and opposes terrorism everywhere -- not only in Darfur , but also in Iraq and Iran and Israel . "
In order to gain support for a US military intervention , including NATO intervention as suggested by President Bush , corporate media outlets downplay the violence of , and refusal to sign peace accords among , the rebel insurgency and instead covers Sudan 's civil war as if it is a one - sided human rights crisis , with the Sudanese government as the " bad guys . "
This lopsided picture has also been adopted by many progressives .
Far worse conflicts in Africa , such as the travesty in the Congo where millions have been killed , are ignored in favour of Darfur .
As in Kosovo , all this coverage is designed to make Canadians think that by putting Western boots on the ground , we can avert a humanitarian catastrophe .
Edward Said has explained that colonialism is not just the occupation of territory , but it requires a state of mind as well ; a state of mind which , " includes ideas that certain people and certain territories require and beseech domination . "
Elie 's comments and the focus of politicians and government officials on Darfur show that Westerners tend to believe that if a white , developed country is sending troops to the Third World , it must be for a good cause .
But can we imagine an atrocity grave enough to justify a Brazilian invasion of Southern Ontario ?
Until we can , many argue that the ' Responsibility to Protect ' exists as simply an expanded means for the West to control the affairs of other countries , particularly Sudan .
If you ’re seriously interested in ensuring that your website is performing well in search results , it ’s important to understand how Google sees subdomains .
According to Google , they treat domains and subdomains the same , but those who practice SEO know that there is a difference .
Before we take a deep dive into this topic , let ’s first look at what Domains are so that we are all on the same page .
What are domains and subdomains ?
Domain names are the three - part , unique and human - friendly internet addresses of websites .
They usually have an extension , a domain name and finally an optional subdomain .
First of all , know that the HTTP :// part of a URL is not part of the domain name , but it ’s referred to as the ‘ protocol ’ .
Let ’s get deeper into the domain topic .
A top - level domain ( TLD ) is the name for the suffix that is located at the end of a domain name .
For example , you may see these terms :
· .com
· .edu
· .net
· .info
· .am
Although you may be familiar with most of the TLDs that are listed above , you may be surprised to know that there are now over one thousand TLDs from which website owners can now choose .
These TLDs can be very descriptive and include names such as :
· .book
· .dog
· .clothing
· .am
· .uk
· .dk
The last couple of TLDs in the above list are country related , and you may know them as country code top - level domains – otherwise known as ccTLDs .
About domain names
After the top level domain , there is the domain name .
They are purchased from registrars such as Go Daddy and represent the specific address or unique location of the website .
For example there is :
www.seo-scoop.com
https://moz.com
www.xxxx.gov
Search engines do use any keywords that are used in domain names as part of their ranking system – which is why you ’ll see domain names using keywords such as www.london-dentist.com.
However , you do still need to consider whether you should optimise your root domain for SEO purposes .
Google ’s algorithm does penalise domains that are keyword stuffed .
Root domain
Originally named for DNS ( domain name servers ) the root domain is a combination of the top - level domain ( otherwise known as an extension ) and the unique domain name .
It also happens to be the highest pages in the hierarchy of your website and will usually go to your homepage .
Other pages and subdomains can be built off your root domain .
Root domains are unique , and no two websites can have the same root domain .
Subdomains
Finally , we are in the subdomain section .
These are the 3rd level of the hierarchy of a domain and are usually added to the beginning of a domain name .
For example , ‘ http://shop.vodafone.co.uk/’ is a subdomain of vodafone.com root domain .
Subdomains are free to create as part of any root domain and separated by a full stop .
The two most common subdomain selections are :
www.seo-scoop.com
seo-scoop.com
these two subdomains can also cause canonicalization errors too .
The SEO best practices for domains
Choose a branded domain name Use broad keywords or risk go Do n’t use hyphens if you can help it Go for .com rather than any other suffix
Using a branded part - match domain avoids an “ exact match domain ” .
Google no longer gives preference to exact match domains and it is no longer advised to use one because it ’s very difficult to avoid over optimisation .
Example “ seoagency.co.uk ” is an exact match .
This means we can’t easily use branded anchor text which would be “ SEO Agency ” as that ’s a keyword .
Instead , a part - match domain would be best .
For example “ rocketseoagency.co.uk ;
So returning to the original question , despite Google claiming that they treat subdomains the same as a domain , even adding www puts your site into subdomain world .
Each subdomain should be treated the same way that Disney treats their subdomains – like a separate business with their own relevant links .

The Paradise on Earth : Bora Bora
Bora Bora is an island in the Leeward group of the Society Islands of French Polynesia , an overseas collectivity of France in the Pacific Ocean .
The island , located about 230 kilometres ( 140 mi ) northwest of Papeete , is surrounded by a lagoon and a barrier reef .
In the center of the island are the remnants of an extinct volcano rising to two peaks , Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu , the highest point at 727 metres ( 2,385 ft ) .
The original name of the island in the Tahitian language might be better rendered as Pora Pora , meaning “ First Born ” ; an early transcription found in 18th - and 19th century accounts , is Bolabolla ( or “ Bollabolla ” ) .
The major settlement , Vaitape is on the western side of the island , opposite the main channel into the lagoon .
The products of the island are mostly limited to what can be obtained from the sea and coconut trees , which were historically of economic importance for copra .
A Pandemic Emergency Committee meeting in Sydney has left Australia 's influenza alert at the contain level , despite the World Health Organisation declaring the swine flu virus a global pandemic .
Victoria 's alert level was upgraded to ' modified sustain ' last week .
More than 1,300 people have been confirmed as having swine flu in Australia ; six people diagnosed with the virus are in hospital but underlying medical conditions may have exacerbated the virus 's effect on them .
Health Minister Nicola Roxon says there is no need to cancel sporting events and other public gatherings .
" If the disease develops differently in the future , if it mutated into a more deadly disease , we would of course look at our advice and see if extra steps need to be taken , " she said .
" But we are a long way from that in terms of the virulence of the disease and we certainly have no advice that that is necessary . "
Ms Roxon says the Government will spend $ 4 million to ensure GPs are ready to respond to a pandemic .
" Our GPs are very highly skilled and highly trained and already have a lot of this information , but we 're responding to requests that our GPS would like more information , " she said .
" It is about ensuring that those people who have to provide the frontline care are provided with up - to - date information about swine flu . "
Anthony Steen says he " over - reacted " David Cameron says he has warned Conservative MP Anthony Steen he will be expelled from the Parliamentary party if he steps out of line again .
Mr Steen has apologised for an interview in which he said critics of his expenses claims were simply " jealous " of his country house .
Tory leader Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4 it was " an appalling thing to say " .
He said the Totnes MP - who has said he is standing down at the next election - was on a final warning .
" I gave him a very clear instruction after that interview - one more squeak like that and he will have the whip taken away from him so fast his feet wo n't touch the ground , " Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's the World at One .
" It was a completely unacceptable interview .
It was a completely unacceptable thing to say .
He 's announced his retirement from Parliament . "
I 've got a very , very large house .
Some people say it looks like Balmoral
Anthony Steen
Martha Kearney : MP a scapegoat ?
Mr Cameron - who earlier held a public meeting in his Witney constituency to address concerns over the expenses scandal - added that it was " incredibly frustrating when people say things like that " .
He added that if Mr Steen said anything like it again " or close to it " he would be kicked out of the Parliamentary party .
The Tory leader was reacting to an interview with Mr Steen that was broadcast on Thursday 's World at One , in which he was tackled about Daily Telegraph reports he had claimed more than £ 87,000 over four years for the home .
' Deeply upset '
Mr Steen , a 69 - year - old former barrister claimed ministers had " mucked up the system " by introducing the Freedom of Information Act.

He added : " I 've done nothing criminal , that 's the most awful thing , and do you know what it 's about ?
Jealousy .
" I 've got a very , very large house .
Some people say it looks like Balmoral .
It 's a merchant 's house of the 19th century .
It 's not particularly attractive , it just does me nicely . "
However , in a statement on Thursday , he apologised for his comments , saying they were " inappropriate " .
Mr Steen said he had been " deeply upset with the situation which resulted in me overreacting " .
He said : " I am sorry that in the heat of the moment I said inappropriate things that were n't as measured as I would have liked about the Freedom of Information Act , which I entirely support . "
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague described Mr Steen 's comments as " ridiculous " .
' Made nothing '
Mr Steen has said he will stand down at the next election .
Two other Tories and one Labour MP have said they will do the same .
The warning from Mr Cameron comes as Labour MP Ian Gibson was referred to a party panel to decide whether he should be deselected .
The Daily Telegraph said he claimed for a flat in which his daughter lived rent - free .

Mr Gibson has already said that he is ready to stand down if voters in his Norwich North constituency want him to , although he insists he stuck to the rules .
The Telegraph says Dr Gibson sold the London flat to his daughter and her partner for less than he paid and well below the market value .
He is reported to have sold the flat to them in April for £ 162,000 , despite having bought it for £ 195,000 in 1999 .
Dr Gibson has insisted he acted within the rules and " made nothing on the house whatsoever " .
But when asked if he would stand down if constituents wanted that to happen , Dr Gibson replied : " Of course you would do that .
It 's only your constituents who matter . "
He is the fourth MP to be referred to the special panel set up by Labour 's ruling National Executive Committee to consider allegations of excessive claims .
' Letter and spirit '
Also published in the Telegraph are financial details of the Tory MP for St Albans , Anne Main .
The paper alleges Mrs Main 's daughter has lived at her second home rent - free for up to three years .
Mrs Main told the paper she had done nothing wrong .
Tory MP Peter Luff has also said he believes he kept to the rules , after reportedly claiming £ 17,000 on home items over four years .
I think people are seriously beginning to crack
Nadine Dorries MP
MP 's fears of expenses ' suicide ' Activists ' feared MP visit anger '
Mr Luff told the newspaper he believed he had acted within the " letter and spirit of the rules " but would repay any money if his judgement was proved to be wrong .
With MPs returning home for the bank holiday weekend - some to face angry constituents - Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries has claimed politicians are the victims of a " witch hunt " and said she feared an MP could commit suicide .
" I think people are seriously beginning to crack , " she said .
" There is serious concern that this has almost got to the point now which is almost unbearable for any human being to deal with . "
A Conservative Party spokesman said her comments " in no way reflect the views of the party at large " .
Sir Peter Viggers - the Tory MP who announced he will stand down at the next election after it was revealed he claimed a £ 1,645 " duck island " on expenses - refused to speak to reporters who confronted him .
A public meeting is to be held in Bracknell later to decide the future of Conservative MP Andrew MacKay .
He quit as parliamentary aide to David Cameron over what the party said was an " unacceptable " expenses claim .

Time Travel Theories
Traveling through time is currently only possible in science fiction .
Unfortunately , time travel is not represented clearly or consistently , therefore time travel is very confusing to the average person .
However , I am here to help clarify time travel a bit .
Basically , there are two theories to time travel .
First , consider the most basic timeline as a straight path with no time traveling , such as this example .
Figure # 1
The first concept of time travel is that there is only a single possible timeline .
In this timeline , all time travel to the past has already occurred , including time travel or time jumps starting from the future .
Here is a visual illustration of this first theory .
Figure # 2
This simple single timeline theory is actually very complicated , because this theory allows for time paradoxes .
For instance , the most famous example of a time paradox is for a time traveler to go back in time and somehow prevent their existence from happening , such as killing their own parent before their parent has any children .
As a result , the time traveler would not have been born , and thus the time traveler could not have prevented their existence from occurring .
If this happens , then time has run into cause and effect loop that never resolves itself .
This loop is often called a time paradox .
In my opinion , either paradoxes must be resolvable or traveling back through time is impossible under this simple single timeline theory .
On the other hand , there is a split timeline theory that can handle time paradoxes .
In this theory , whenever a time traveler travels backwards through time , a new timeline is immediately created .
Here is an illustration of this second theory .
Figure # 3
Under this new theory , each timeline will never intersect .
Going back to the example where the time traveler went back in time to kill one of their ancestors , Timeline # 1 would be the timeline when the time traveler was born and traveled back through time .
Timeline # 2 would be the timeline when the time traveler was not born and thus did not travel through time .
As a result , there is no paradox .
It is assumed that the first timeline , Timeline # 1 , would continue to exist after the initial time travel starts .
At least until the very end of time or the end of the universe .. or both .
It is also assumed that it would be impossible to jump from one timeline to another .
For instance , if a time traveler jumped back in time to a point before the two timelines split , then a new third timeline would be created and time travel into the future would be on this third timeline instead of either the first or second timelines .
As a result , this time traveling theory could yield an infinity number of timelines while never having any time paradoxes .
Therefore , anyone traveling back in time would not be able to return to their original time in their original timeline .
So the only possible " safe " time traveling would be into the future , and then traveling back in time to the original point in time when the person originally left to travel into the future .
Even if new timelines are created in this scenario , the first new timeline should be nearly identical to the original timeline , so the time traveler would not perceive any changes .
Of course all of these examples are just thought experiments , since time travel is currently not possible .
However if it will be possible to travel back through time from the future , then all time travel to our past would have resulted with the creation of other timelines .
Thus , this timeline would be oblivious to all future time travel into our past , since they only occured in the past of other timelines .
There could be only two ways that we could observe time travelers in our past or present .
First , we are on a timeline created after time travel completed , however those time travellers would not be from our future .
These time travelers would be from the future of a different timeline .
Second , time travel from the past to the present ( i.e. traveling forward through time ) could also be observable , assuming no new splits in our timeline were caused by time travel into our past .
Or else , time travel is not possible and will never be possible .

In this artist 's depiction of how experimentalists could create true muonium , an electron ( blue ) and a positron ( red ) collide , producing a virtual photon ( green ) and then a muonium atom , made of a muon ( small yellow ) and an anti-muon ( small purple ) .
The muonium atom then decays back into a virtual photon and then a positron and an electron .
Overlaying this process is a figure indicating the structure of the muonium atom : one muon ( large yellow ) and one anti-muon ( large purple ) .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
True muonium , a long - theorized but never - seen atom , might be observed in future experiments , thanks to recent theoretical work by researchers at the Department of Energy 's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Arizona State University .
True muonium was first theorized more than 50 years ago , but until now no one had uncovered an unambiguous method by which it could be created and observed .
" We do n't usually work in this area , but one day we were idly talking about how experimentalists could create exotic states of matter , " said SLAC theorist Stanley Brodsky , who worked with Arizona State 's Richard Lebed on the result .
" As our conversation progressed , we realized ' Gee …we just figured out how to make true muonium . ' "
True muonium is made of a muon and an anti-muon , and is distinguished from what 's also been called " muonium " — an atom made of an electron and an anti-muon .
Both muons and anti-muons are created frequently in nature when energetic particles from space strike the earth 's atmosphere .
Yet both have a fleeting existence , and their combination , true muonium , decays naturally into other particles in a few trillionths of a second .
This makes observation of the exotic atom quite difficult .
In a paper published on Tuesday in Physical Review Letters , Brodsky and Lebed describe two methods by which electron - positron accelerators could detect the signature of true muonium 's formation and decay .
In the first method , an accelerator 's electron and positron beams are arranged to merge , crossing at a glancing angle .
Such a collision would produce a single photon , which would then transform into a single true muonium atom that would be thrown clear of the other particle debris .
Because the newly created true muonium atoms would be traveling so fast that the laws of relativity govern , they would decay much slower than they would otherwise , making detection easier .
In the second method , the electron and positron beams collide head - on .
This would produce a true muonium atom and a photon , tangled up in a cloud of particle debris .
Yet simply by recoiling against each other , the true muonium and the photon would push one another out of the debris cloud , creating a unique signature not previously searched for .
" It 's very likely that people have already created true muonium in this second way , " Brodsky said .
" They just have n't detected it . "
In their paper , Lebed and Brodsky also describe a possible , but more difficult , means by which experimentalists could create true tauonium , a bound state of a tau lepton and its antiparticle .
The tau was first created at SLAC 's SPEAR storage ring , a feat for which SLAC physicist Martin Perl received the 1995 Nobel Prize in physics .
Brodsky attributes the pair 's successful work to a confluence of events : various unrelated lectures , conversations and ideas over the years , pieces of which came together suddenly during his conversation with Lebed .
" Once you pull all of the ideas together , you say ' Of course !
Why not ? '
Brodsky said .
" That 's the process of science — you try to relate everything new to what you already know , creating logical connections . "
Now that those logical connections are firmly in place , Brodsky said he hopes that one of the world 's colliders will perform the experiments he and Lebed describe , asking , " Who does n't want to see a new form of matter that no one 's ever seen before ? "

LOUISVILLE , Ky. 
Sometimes this game brings you to tears .
Sometimes it feels right to be wrong .
And always it is better than O.K. when the tears streaming down your face are caused by a man in a black cowboy hat and an almost handlebar mustache , a Cajun jockey with more horse than book sense and a scrawny $ 9,500 gelding .
Chip Woolley , Calvin Borel and Mine That Bird , an improbable  no , impossible  50 - 1 long shot , did just that Saturday , running away with the 135th running of America ’s greatest race , the Kentucky Derby .
Horse racing has had some bad big days recently .
Last year , the filly Eight Belles was euthanized on the racetrack after finishing second here .
When the 2006 Derby winner Barbaro broke down in the Preakness , he brought greater public attention to the sport ’s safety and welfare issues .
Early Saturday it appeared to be more of the same : I Want Revenge , the morning - line favorite , came up lame in his left front ankle and was scratched .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A blaster gun used by actor Harrison Ford to hunt down and kill futuristic humanoids in 1982 sci- fi film “ Blade Runner ” will be put on the auction block in an upcoming sale of Hollywood memorabilia .
The blaster gun that actor Harrison Ford carried in the movie " Blade Runner " is shown in this undated publicity photo released to Reuters April 9 , 2009 .
The gun , used to hunt down and kill futuristic humanoids in 1982 sci- fi film " Blade Runner " , will be put on the auction block in an upcoming sale of Hollywood memorabilia .

Auctioneer Profiles in History expects about $ 3 million in total sales from the auction , which will include the collection of horror and science fiction promoter Forrest Ackerman and an animation puppet used in director Tim Burton ’s 2005 movie “ Corpse Bride . ”
The “ Blade Runner ” blaster , with an estimated sales price of between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 , comes from Hollywood marketer and producer Jeff Walker , and Profiles in History called it the “ holy grail ” of sci - fi weapons .
The movie , directed by Ridley Scott , takes place in the year 2019 when Rick Deckard ( Ford ) is reluctantly drawn back to being a “ blade runner ” who tracks down and kills humanoid “ replicants ” that are revolting against real humans .
The movie was a critical success , but failed to ignite a great deal of excitement at box offices , earning just under $ 33 million .
On video and DVD , however , it has gained a large following and become a cult classic .
Other items from Walker ’s “ Blade Runner ” collection being sold include costumes that Ford wore in the 1982 movie .
Ackerman , who edited the now defunct magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland and spent a lifetime collecting props from science fiction and horror movies , died in December at age 92 .
Items to be sold from his massive collection include a ring worn by actor Bela Lugosi when he played Count Dracula on screen , and a monocle that director Fritz Lang used when he made the 1927 science fiction movie “ Metropolis . ”
Other items include actress Rita Hayworth ’s dress from 1946 movie “ Gilda . ”
Profiles in History will hold its spring sale April 30 and May 1 in Calabasas , California , allowing participants to bid live online from anywhere in the world .

Megan
Fox wo n't kick her horse .
Greg Williams
She 's just sort of tapping it , using her Ugg - booted right foot to give it a nudge with her heel .
But to Bandit ( that 's the horse ) , this is more of a suggestion , and what this horse needs right now is a command , a firm whack on the undercarriage with both heels that says " Stop screwing off ! " — and this Fox is either unwilling or unable to give .
Greg Williams
So we 're gonna pause here for a minute or two , just a few hundred feet up the Topanga Canyon horse trail we 're ascending , until Bandit can behave .
Greg Williams
It 's sunny but still mild for L. A. , so Fox is wearing an open yellow cardigan over her black tank top .
Her jeans , waist - baring low - riders , were rolled up just beyond her calves until Michael ( our serene and tan guide for the day ) mentioned she might want to roll them back down to avoid " chafing " — the kind of advice you do n't ignore .
Greg Williams
She 's got a self - professed weakness for eye makeup , but she 's not wearing much now , just a little mascara .
Today 's look is all - natural — though liberal cleavage and the " Brian " hip tattoo that occasionally peeks out above the waistband of her black underwear prevent it from being remotely wholesome .
Greg Williams
" If you 're a real wimp with him , " Michael is explaining , " he 's gonna keep taking advantage of you . "
Dominance over horses is established in the first ten minutes of the ride , which means Fox has about one minute left to show Bandit who 's boss .
" Do n't worry , there 's no way you 're gonna hurt him , " Michael says .
Definitely not with the little love kicks she keeps delivering .
Greg Williams
It 's hard to hold this unwillingness to kick Bandit against her , because it is , after all , kicking an animal , but also because she 's clearly freaked out — " terrified " is how she puts it — being in the saddle for the first time .
" I have a healthy fear of horses , " she said when she was introduced to Bandit , and considering he 's a thousand - pound brown beast and she 's a five - four , hundred - pound twenty - two - year - old actress , this was odd only because the riding lesson was her idea .
She wanted to learn , she said , but really she just wanted an escape .
Greg Williams
" You are catching me at a really vulnerable point in my life , " she says , alluding to the recent breakup with her boyfriend of four and a half years .
She 's moving out of their home and being chased by an ever - growing pack of camera - wielding bruisers as she tries to get her personal life under control .
" I 've never really lived as an adult by myself .
Like , I 've never even bought my own dishes . "
That 's all about to change .
So yeah , Fox is spooked , and Bandit is n't really helping .
Greg Williams

Greg Williams
The Smoke House , an old - school barbecue restaurant in Burbank , is dim , quiet , and pretty much empty except for Megan Fox tucked into a red vinyl booth in a corner .
It 's the day after the ride , and she 's wearing the same kind of snug , low - cut tank top , this time in white , framed by a gray cardigan , the sleeves pushed up to reveal the Marilyn Monroe tattoo on her right arm .
( She plans on sleeving the whole limb in the next year . )
Greg Williams
She 's sipping hot tea and picking at a basket of bright - orange garlic bread as she finishes an entry in her journal , which she calls her " book of feelings , " fully aware of how corny that sounds .
" Whenever I 'm just sitting and thinking and feeling , I write it out , " she says .
" Sometimes it 's an angry anti-man poem , and sometimes I 'm just being funny and cute .
Some of it is really disturbing , some really insightful , and some just bullshit .
Sometimes I 'll just rant about something someone does on a plane .
Or about an interview on a horse . "
She 's joking — hopefully .
It 's hard to tell .
She 's more relaxed than yesterday but not exactly at ease , occasionally bringing her intertwined hands over her head in a stretch or rubbing her own neck , working out some kinks .
It 's been one of those weeks .
" I do n't know how I feel or think about anything right now , and I feel like I 'm under a microscope .
Normally I love playing the game , but that 's when I 'm in an assertive place .
I 'm not there right now . "
All the attention on her love life has got her rattled , wondering if it 's time to start watching her words more carefully , to start " acting like an adult " in interviews .
" Because of some things I 've said , some jokes I 've made , I 've got this wild , crazy reputation .
Like I 'm into sex with knives , " she says , laughing at the thought .
" People assume that I 'm really promiscuous .
There 's a difference between being very sexual and being promiscuous .
I 'm not promiscuous .
I 'm extraordinarily sexual within a monogamous relationship .
Nothing 's off - limits .
But that has nothing to do with experiencing a lot of people .
I 've only had two boyfriends my whole life . "
The recent breakup with actor Brian Austin Green , whom she 'd been dating since she was eighteen , helps explain the twenty or so paparazzi who now wait outside ( and will continue to wait for the next few hours ) to see whom she leaves with .
She has no problem with attention — " mass validation " is how she jokingly refers to it — but this is too much too soon and in danger of overshadowing a career that 's just getting started .
Fox moved out to L. A. five years ago , when she was seventeen .
She was born in Tennessee , but after her parents divorced , her mom and new stepdad relocated the family to Port St. Lucie , Florida , where she was enrolled in a strict Christian high school .
" They had right - wing conservative teachers teaching Bible class , " she says .
" They 'd tell us how abortion was wrong , how evolution was wrong , how sex was wrong .
I hated school . "
She wanted to act — has for as long as she can remember — so she left school ( she later got her degree ) and moved out to L. A. with her mom .
Three months later , she landed a part in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen with Lindsay Lohan , then a guest spot on Two and a Half Men spent mostly in a bikini , followed by the short - lived Kelly Ripa sitcom Hope & Faith .
But odds are you 'd never heard of Megan Fox until last summer , when she starred as tan - and - toned high school gearhead Mikaela Banes in Transformers , a role she reprises this month in Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen and that mostly entails , as she puts it , " a lot of running and screaming — you sort of have to let the acting aspect go , because it 's just not there .
People come to see the effects and the robots and the explosions . "
Which is not entirely fair .
They also come to see Megan Fox in a half shirt bending over a ' 76 Camaro , an image your fourteen - year - old cousin has as his screensaver , and not because of the car .
" I know I 'm seen as a sex object , " she says .
" I 'm just really confident sexually , and I think that sort of oozes out of my pores .
It 's just there .
It 's something I do n't have to turn on . "
Which is obvious when you 're watching her eat the barbecue - chicken platter at the Smoke House .
She 's not licking her fork seductively , or smearing barbecue sauce all over her face , or dripping mashed potatoes down her chest , or doing any of the things she 's asked to do time and time again in photo shoots .
She 's not even using her bare hands .
She 's simply a twenty - two - year - old girl eating some chicken , so it 's really not her fault if watching this makes you feel as if you should be paying for the privilege .
" I do n't get it , " she says .
" I do n't find food sexy , and I do n't see the connection between food and sex . "
Obviously she has n't been watching the right people eat .
" If you know how to take control of it , then it can be powerful , " she says of being a sex symbol .
" But I have no idea how to handle it yet , how to deal with it .
I do n't want to have to be like a Scarlett Johansson — who I have nothing against — but I do n't want to have to go on talk shows and pull out every single SAT word I 've ever learned to prove , like , ' Take me seriously , I am intelligent , I can speak . '
I do n't want to have to do that .
I resent having to prove that I 'm not a retard — but I do .
And part of it is my own fault . "
If that 's true , it 's because of a few tantalizing stories she 's told the press , or maybe those seven artfully placed tattoos , not because she prances around L. A. like Kim Kardashian .
In fact , Fox is a homebody who prefers to watch hours of Animal Planet rather than go to bars or clubs , and she tries to avoid the Hollywood scene as much as she can .
" When I go to a party , I always feel like I 'm chum .
Like my agent is just chumming the waters until I 'm circled by all these dudes . "
Awards shows , after parties , any kind of large social gathering — they all make her anxious .
Before she walks a red carpet , she gets a nice buzz going ( even though she 's not much of a drinker ) , smokes a few cigarettes ( even though she quit two years ago ) , and tries to get quickly in and out as she parries the inevitable come - ons from colleagues hopped up on their own egos .
" Actors are n't necessarily the most intelligent guys you 're ever gonna come across , " she says .
" They 're so easily manipulated that if you have any sort of control over your own sexuality , they 're just fucked . "
Such was the fate of one up - and - coming Irish actor who hit on her as she was smoking a cigarette alone after an awards show .
" He was like , ' Cigarettes ?
Do you have an addictive personality ?
Well , what else are you addicted to ? ' " she says .
" Like , I 'm unaware that he wants me to say , ' Sex .
I 'm addicted to sex , I just can't get enough .
I just really want a daddy , can you be my daddy ? ' "
She played with him for a bit , gave him a little string — then " cut him off at the knees . "
Maybe it 's the third herbal tea , but Fox is starting to relax , and with this comes a glimmer of her more unfiltered self , the one she was so worried would get her into trouble : not some cliché wild child but someone more engaging than that .
When she lets her guard down , Fox is gossipy and outspoken .
And funny .
Of course , beautiful women always think they 're funny , because men laugh at everything they say .
Fox could tell a knock - knock joke and every man within earshot would keel over with laughter .
But Fox is actually funny .
Get her going and she 'll deliver a blue monologue that sounds as if it were lifted out of a Judd Apatow stoner flick .
Confess you 've never seen High School Musical , for example : " Wait , what ? " she says , raising her voice .
" Okay , well , let me tell you what it 's really about .
High School Musical is about this group of boys who are all being molested by the basketball coach , who is Zac Efron 's dad .
It 's about them struggling to cope with this molestation .
And they have these little girlfriends , who are their beards .
Oh , and somehow there 's music involved .
You have to get stoned and watch it . "
Fox is funny like your fat friend Phil is funny : dry , dirty , sarcastic — a little bit mean .
" People are not used to seeing starlets have a sense of humor , especially an off - center , foul sense of humor , " she says .
" I think it would be different if I were a guy .
Seth Rogen can say whatever he wants and people know it 's a joke . "
Fox is obsessed with how she 's perceived .
She wo n't look at her own press — not because she does n't care but because she cares too much .
Looking at a sexy photo spread she 's in or a critical blog post will make her physically ill .
" Because I 'm young and female , people want me to be like some Disney Channel , supersafe , sex - before - marriage - is - bad , Taylor Swift , I - date - someone - with - a- promise - ring , bullshit girl . "
Which would mean watering down the Megan Fox now in full swing at the Smoke House , the unrestrained woman who seems to have a polemicist 's position on everything from Superman ( " I just think he 's a lame superhero .
He 's not interesting .
He 's not dark .
He 's just kind of a douchebag . " ) to sex : " I think people are born bisexual and then make subconscious choices based on the pressures of society .
I have no question in my mind about being bisexual .
But I 'm also a hypocrite : I would never date a girl who was bisexual , because that means they also sleep with men , and men are so dirty that I 'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man . "
She makes this last statement , one she knows will get bolded and underlined and hyperlinked into oblivion , near the end of lunch , after the plates are cleared and the family - dinner crowd is starting to pour in .
It 's as if she 's reached her own internal conclusion about whether she 's going to self - censor for them and for all of us .
Then she sums it up easily enough : " Fuck it . "
It 's the choice she must have made at some point yesterday , too .
There were those initial rough spots when Bandit was taking advantage of her — so much so that Michael the guide had to hop off his horse , grab a six - foot length of heavy rope out of his saddlebag , and tether Fox 's animal to his own .
( At least , he said it was because Bandit was misbehaving . )
But that setup was n't needed for long .
Halfway up , she got the hang of it , comfortable enough to make small talk , about horses , naturally , but this afforded some surprising information , like the fact that Fox knows the name of Gandalf 's horse in The Lord of the Rings , a trilogy she 's seen " a billion times " because
Fox is n't just a fanboy 's wet dream but a fanboy herself .
" If I were to get typecast in comic - book movies for the rest of my life , that would be okay . "
The pervasive rumors that she 'll be playing Wonder Woman or inherit Lara Croft 's bodysuit from Angelina Jolie are " complete Internet bullshit , " but she is currently shooting Jonah Hex , a bloody western comic - book adaptation with Josh Brolin .
In September , she stars in Jennifer 's Body , a horror parody by Diablo Cody , as the man-devouring zombie captain of a high school flag team .
After Transformers came out ,
Fox passed on a bunch of challenging scripts because she was scared she was n't good enough or the roles seemed laughably implausible for her .
( " Seriously , I 'm gonna be playing a mom on a rampage , looking for her lost kid ?
What a joke .
I look like a little kid . " )
So it 's possible Fox actually will spend her career as the Hot Chick , running and screaming in strategically ripped cheerleading outfits as she battles talking cars and evil cowboys — but that 's not likely .
After all , she said she was " terrified " of horses , and within an hour into her first ride she was relaxed in the saddle , smiling , talking about coming back and seeing Bandit again .
By the return trek , Fox was confident enough with her horse that Michael agreed to let her trot .
She gave Bandit a kick — commanding , with both feet — then she let out an excited little scream and off she went .

Interesting FACT
The true cost of cheap ( ly ) made medicines .
Added by Archibald on Jun 12 , 2009 | Visited by 6195 | Voted by 50 persons
I have to say that I am not against cheap medicines , affordable to masses , especially for those drugs that are vitally needed to cure AIDS , TB , malaria , STDs and other mass killers .
More than that , I presume the cost of those powders - active ingredients , produced in huge quantities is just ridiculous compared to profit markups fixed by leading drugs manufacturers .
That is why when negative news appeared about quality standards in new drugs producing countries like Vietnam , Egypt , India , probably most of us thought that this is a part of a monopolistic battle against emerging competitors .
Two things made me change my mind .
First , stories of friends and acquaintances , which are heard more and more often , about either poor effect or absence of any effect of drugs , produced cheap by new companies recently unheard of .
Secondly , my own bad experience , when in one East European countries I had no choice but to buy and use an antibiotic produced in Egypt ( unfortunately it was a few years ago , and I do not remember the name of the producer ) .
It was quite a destructive experience , and one would be happy to have as a result " absence of any effects " , because when I realized what has caused my even worse illness , I started to investigate the issue and was shocked to discover that drugs production in emerging countries is poorly regulated and drugs counterfeiting is a multi-billion dollars business , threatening health and lives of millions of people .
Thus , I found out that :
One can buy - in ( corrupt ) the line manager , so that he puts 70 % or 50 % or even 30 % of active ingredient into the ordered drugs .
The saved difference is split .
The consequences of such products range from untreated illnesses to increasing resistance to drugs , to deaths .
In absence of proper laboratory analyses , one can produce " ultimate weight loss natural herb " additives or other miraculous products , filling them with chalk , ashes and even dried cow 's excrement , or even contaminated poisonous ingredients , like lead containing inks .
If a decade ago a proper packing was a sign and a certain guarantee of proper quality , it is not anymore nowadays .
Even if the drugs are in nice modern blisters and beautiful boxes , it is not a guarantee that it is a genuine brand !
It can be printed that it has been produced in Germany , UK , Egypt or India , while in reality it could have been produced in some cellars on quite unsophisticated equipment in Poland , Ukraine , Russia , Turkey , Romania .
Counterfeiting drugs has also spread to the high value and high demand segments .
Internet is becoming an uncontrolled channel of unregulated poor quality drugs sales .
As a result , you 'll be happy to stay alive .
For that you should follow my true advice :
Stay healthy .
But if you need medicines and can afford to pay a few bucks more for a well known and tested brand - do it .
Maybe these few bucks are the additional expenses for a better quality ensuring and supervision , which in the end would save you from troubles and extraordinary expenses .
Stay away from internet drugs .
Go to the pharmacies with good reputations .
Talk to the pharmacist - he bears moral responsibility .
Check the suspicious producers on Internet .
Sometimes you may found direct comments about a certain drug , or indirect signs ( For example , a friend of mine was recommended to buy a liver function improvement herbal drug .
He could n't find any mentioning about this medicine anywhere , but a short notice on the site of the producers itself that it is a new product in the test phase !
So , he immediately threw out the drug . ) .

After spending more than 11 years in prison accused of murder , Juan Johnson won the largest award in Chicago history for a wrongful conviction lawsuit on Friday .
But even though the City of Chicago was ordered to pay him $ 21 million in compensatory damages , Johnson said he was n't looking for more money from the police officer he said framed him .
All he wanted was an apology .
Johnson did n't get one on Monday , however , and so Reynaldo Guevara , a former Chicago police officer who says he 's living paycheck to paycheck , now owes Johnson $ 15,000 in punitive damages himself .
" He could have picked a side -- protect [ himself ] or apologize , " said Jon Loevy , Johnson 's attorney .
" If he had expressed remorse , we would n't have asked for anything . "
In 1989 , Johnson , then a member of the Spanish Cobras gang , was arrested by Guevara and accused of murdering a member of rival gang , the Latin Eagles , outside a nightclub near North and Western Avenues .
Johnson was convicted and served 11 1/2 years in prison before he was retried and acquitted in 2004 .
In that trial , witnesses testified that Guevara intimidated them into saying Johnson was the murderer .
On Friday and Monday , a jury agreed that Johnson was wrongly arrested and that Guevara and the city were at fault .
Though Johnson claimed that from the beginning , all he wanted was an apology , Guevara 's legal team objected , saying an apology could taint any chance of getting the decision reversed when they appeal .
Guevara 's lawyer , Jim Sotos , said he thinks that witnesses changed their stories during Johnson 's retrial in 2004 because of gang intimidation .
" We strongly believe there is an orchestrated effort by gang members that witnesses were told to recant " their testimonies during the retrial , Sotos said .
Johnson maintains justice was served .
" The evidence is there that he framed me , " he said .
" It 's time the city starts taking responsibility for its actions . "
In one testimony from the retrial , Samuel Perez , another Cobra , testified that Guevara had intimidated him into identifying Johnson as the killer .
" [ Guevara ] told me that he knows that the Cobras killed that Eagle .
Which Cobra , he did n't care , but he preferred that it was this Cobra " and pointed at a picture of Johnson , Perez said .
" I took it as a threat .
... I was going to get hooked up for that murder or Juan Johnson was going to get hooked up for that murder . "
The case is far from closed , however .
Guevara and the city could file paperwork as soon as this week for an appeal .

Some 440,000 Americans die of smoking - related illnesses each year The US House of Representatives has backed a bill introducing tough new curbs on the tobacco industry .
The House passed the bill by 307 - 97 , a day after it was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate .
It now goes to President Obama to be signed into law .
The bill gives the US Food and Drug Administration strong powers to regulate the content and marketing of tobacco products .
It has been hailed as a milestone in the history of tobacco regulation .
About one in five Americans smoke , and the habit kills some 440,000 every year .
I am a non-smoker , but I think this is way out of line .
The federal government has no business in people 's business
Matt , BBC
News website reader , Houston , Texas , USA
Smokers and non-smokers react
But tougher regulation has been stiffly opposed by the industry and tobacco 's political backers .
Until now , tobacco has been more lightly regulated than cosmetics or pet food , and previous attempts at FDA regulation were struck down by the Supreme Court as requiring congressional approval .
The bill will " make history " , President Obama said on Thursday after it was passed by the Senate by 79 - 17 .
He may sign it into law as early as Friday .
Advertising targeted
The bill empowers the FDA to : Limit nicotine levels - though not banning nicotine or cigarettes entirely
Attempt to limit the appeal of smoking among young people , by limiting the use of flavours , restricting advertising in publications targeting young people , and banning outdoor tobacco advertising within 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) of schools
Require tobacco companies to get FDA approval for new products
Bar terms such as " light " or " mild " in tobacco packaging which imply a smaller risk to health , and introduce graphic new health warnings of packets
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that FDA regulation could reduce underage smoking by 11 % over the next decade , and adult smoking by 2 % .
Paying for the new regulation is likely to end up adding to the cost of cigarettes .
Momentous Repeated efforts by supporters of greater regulation of the tobacco industry have been fiercely resisted for years by the industry and lawmakers from tobacco - producing states .
FEDERAL TOBACCO MILESTONES
1964 : Surgeon general 's report alerts many Americans to the health risks of smoking - and its links to lung cancer - for the first time 1971 : Tobacco advertising banned on TV and radio 1988 : Surgeon general reports nicotine is an addictive drug 1988 : Smoking banned on US domestic flights under two hours ; later extended but only applied to all domestic flights in 1998 1990s : FDA tries to regulate nicotine as a drug , but Supreme Court strikes this effort down in 2000 , saying it requires congressional backing
This time , the country 's biggest tobacco firm , Philip Morris , supported the bill - though rivals suggested that was because restrictions on new products would protect the company 's market share .
Observers said the bill was one of the most momentous milestones in the history of smoking since the 1964 surgeon general 's report highlighted the hazards it posed to health .
About 20 % of Americans smoke - a statistic that has declined in recent years , as in many developed nations .
But in some countries smoking remains much more prevalent - for example , 50 % of Namibians smoke , 47 % of Mongolians and 44 % of Turks , according to the World Health Organization .
US MEDIA REACTION TO THE TOBACCO VOTE
The days when this rogue industry could inflict its harmful products on Americans with impunity are drawing to a close .
This is an enormous victory for public health .
The New York Times , in an editorial , hails the legislation .
Is this good news , or another link in Obama 's perpetually growing socialist chain ?
Is there ANYTHING these folks CAN'T take over or regulate if THEY believe it 's in OUR best interest ?
The conservative bloggers at Newsbusters.org suspect the president 's ideological motives for supporting the new tobacco rules .
If the tobacco model repeats itself , it may be a while before something -- whatever that something is , because there is no consensus - gets done [ about obesity ] .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder considers the implication of the tobacco vote for the fight against obesity .
If Philip Morris likes this bill , how much can it really do to control cigarette consumption and protect public health ?
Jonathan Adler , writing at the National Review , wonders how much sway America 's largest tobacco firm had in the drafting of the tobacco legislation .

No parade was staged , to avoid provoking Shanghai 's authorities China 's first gay pride festival has been praised in the state media in a significant shift from the previous attitude to such events .
The festival was described in the China Daily newspaper as an event of " profound significance " and a " showcase of the country 's social progress " .
Film screenings , discussions and parties are being held as part of the week long festival in Shanghai .
Homosexuality was officially labelled a mental illness in China until 2001 .
Before Shanghai's Gay Pride Festival got underway , the organisers were worried it might get shut down .
They were warned by a lawyer not to hold a parade , for fear that it might be seen by the authorities as a protest .
' Open and progressive '
Instead they decided to organise a week of activities in private venues .
That low - key approach seems to have worked .
The China Daily has carried a large front - page article about the event and about homosexuality in the country .
An editorial inside says the festival shows how Shanghai , what it calls " one of the most open and progressive Chinese cities " , has displayed acceptance and tolerance by allowing the festival to take place .

In the past the official attitude to homosexuality in China might best be characterised as " do n't condemn , do n't promote " .
The fulsome praise the paper lavishes on the festival , its organisers and on the city of Shanghai , has not been seen before in the official media .
The paper acknowledges that in rural areas especially homosexuality is seen as a taboo or an affliction .
It says there is still a lot to be done by the government and the country 's media to promote acceptance and respect of the China 's lesbians and gays .

Obama Signs Potentially Unconstitutional Bill Prohibiting Release of Gitmo Prisoners in U.S .
Created : June 25 , 2009 14:52 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
As expected , yesterday President Obama signed a supplemental appropriations bill that prohibits the release of Guantanamo detainees into the United States , and restricts the president ’s ability to release them to other countries without Congressional approval .
The little - noticed provision raises constitutional questions about who has the power to control the release of detainees — the president , Congress or the courts ?
Lawyers representing Guantanamo detainees are already calling the law an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , as SCOTUSblog notes today .
Sabin Willett , the lead lawyer representing the 13 Uighurs who have appealed to the Supreme Court to review their case , today wrote to the court urging it to review the decision of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington , D.C. , in Kiyemba v. Obama , which prohibits the federal courts from ordering any detainees released into the United States .
As a result , while according to American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Jonathon Hafetz , Guantanamo detainees have so far won about 26 of 31 habeas corpus cases decided by federal courts so far , most remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay .
Lawyers , including Willett , have argued that the result is effectively to deny them the right to habeas corpus that the Supreme Court ruled they have in Boumediene v. Bush .
In his letter today , Willett urged the Supreme Court to take up the case , saying that “ a failure either to reverse or affirm the decision below will leave unsettled a question that goes to the heart of habeas jurisdiction . … ”
The court is expected to decide today whether or not to grant certiorari and hear the appeal in the Kiyemba case .

America , you proved yourself a bad judge of stardom .
But a good judge of talent , since Kris Allen is a talented guy .
A humble guy .
An amazing guy .
Such a good person , that 's obvious .
I 've been supporting him for a while and voted ( once ) for him to get this far .
But the season eight winner of " American Idol " ?!
Please .
Even Kris did n't seem to know how to process that .
There was no elation , only confusion .
He did n't know how to feel , other than to say that Adam Lambert deserved it .
Well , no argument here !
There was one star of this season and it was Adam .
No question .
Adam Lambert was robbed .
Pure and simple .
The Associated Press was ready to crown him .
They sent out an AP News Alert at 10:02 p.m.
Wednesday night : " Adam Lambert has won the eighth season of " American Idol , " beating fellow finalist Kris Allen . "
They fixed it quickly to read : " CORRECTS : Kris Allen won the 8th season of " American Idol , " beating finalist Adam Lambert . "
How embarrassing for all of us .
Ryan Seacrest said just under 100 million votes had come in , but he never said how many were between Kris and Adam .
Last season there were 12 million between David Cook and David Archuleta .
I 'm curious about how many people really hated Adam Lambert that much .
Bad call , Sneaky Silent Majority .
Congratulations on getting your middle - of - the - road choice once again .
Safe .
Easy .
" No Boundaries " my arse .
You clearly are keeping those boundaries tightly in place .
All you 've done is canonize martyr Glambert -- somewhere someone is seeing his face on a piece of toast and worshipping it even more -- and making Kris Allen " The Guy Who Stole American Idol From Adam Lambert . "
Kris deserved a nice quiet retreat from the limelight -- at least before the top 10 tour -- not what he 's going to face now .
This is still Adam 's season .
Poor Kris is just the asterisk .
Other than the outcome -- the whole point of being there -- it was best finale I�ve ever seen .
Amazing show .
Lionel Richie , KISS , Keith Urban , Jason Mraz , Cyndi Lauper , Queen Latifah , Carlos Santana , Steve Martin � yes , Steve Martin � Rod Stewart .
Seriously .
Why couldn�t they do this well last night ?
More to the point , why could n't they do this well VOTING last night ?
( I got through for Adam once , but my co-worker got through for Kris four times .
I BLAME HER !)
Just under 100 million votes came in .
( Compared with 97.5 million last season .
They were more precise last year . )
That makes the season total a record - setting 624 million votes .
What �s with the bad mics ?
Why do they all always have to wear white ?
Carly Smithson is in San Diego with the Adam Lambert crowd .
She didn�t take San Diego all the way last year , she said , but she�s hoping Adam can .
Lots of �woo� - ing .
They perform � So What � ?
They are all in white too .
Alexis Grace !
I missed her .
Remember when the show was fixed and she was supposed to make it to the final four ?
Jorge !
Jasmine !
I forgot they were even in the top 13 .
Why top 13 , anyway ?

More than a week after French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Islamic burqa was not welcome in France , a message allegedly posted by al Qaeda ’s North African branch vowed of revenge against the country , according to a cyber security site .

REUTERS - Al Qaeda 's north African wing threatened revenge against France for launching a " war " against Muslim women who wear full burqas that cover them from head to toe , according to a Web statement posted in the group 's name .
French legislators expressed concern this month that more and more Muslim women were wearing a burqa or a niqab which cloaks the entire body , sometimes leaving a gap for the eyes .
President Nicolas Sarkozy said the garments were not welcome in France because they are a symbol of the subjugation of women .
" Here is France mustering all her capacity , mobilising all her institutions and organising her ranks to wage a perfidious new war against our sisters who wear the niqab , " said the statement posted on a Web site used by al Qaeda supporters .
It said the French were committing these injustices " at a time when their denuded women ... flock to our land and occupy our beaches and streets , outrageously defying the feelings of Muslims " .
It said France 's campaign against the burqa was tantamount to " religious terrorism " and was an incitement to a hatred that would only grow .
" This is why we call upon all Muslims to respond to this hatred by another that is more ravaging , we call upon them to confront this French obstinacy , " the statement said .
It said Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb vowed " before God not to be silent in the face of these provocations and injustices and do all in our power and take revenge at the first opportunity against France and its interests wherever they may be found , for the honour of our daughters and our sisters " .
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is the remnant of an Islamic insurgency that raged through former French colony Algeria for most of the 1990s .
The group was formerly known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat ( GSPC ) , itself a spin - off of the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) which was blamed for a series of bombings in France in 1995 .
France , home to Europe 's largest Muslim minority , is strongly attached to its secular values and to gender equality .

( NaturalNews ) Dr. Paul Offit of the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia ( CHOP ) received at least $ 29 million from his share of royalties for Merck 's Rotateq vaccine after using his position with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that childhood vaccination with the vaccine became compulsory .
According to a report on the Web site " Age of Autism , " a review of CHOP 's royalties schedules reveals that Offit likely received between $ 29 million and $ 55 million for his work developing the Rotateq vaccine for rotavirus , which causes diarrhea in infants .
Because the vaccine is jointly owned by CHOP and by the Wistar Institute but Offit is the only inventor listed on the patent from CHOP , he received 100 percent of inventor 's rights payments from CHOP .
" Clearly , based on the distribution of income rights outlined in [ CHOP 's policies ] , Paul Offit had a greater personal interest in Rotateq 's commercial success than any other single individual in the world , " article authors Dan Olmsted and Mark Blaxill write .
" And more than other individual in the world , he found himself in a position to directly influence that success .
" Between 1998 and 2003 , Offit sat on the U.S. government 's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) .
His involvement with development of Rotateq began before and ended after these dates .
While a member of the ACIP , Offit consistently voted in favor of making vaccination against rotavirus part of the compulsory U.S. childhood immunization schedule .
He also voted to rescind recommendation of Wyeth 's competing vaccine RotaShield , while aggressively advocating for the idea that other rotavirus vaccines would be less dangerous .
" Unlike most other patented products , the market for mandated childhood vaccines is created not by consumer demand , but by the recommendation of an appointed body called the ACIP , " Olmsted and Blaxill write .
" In a single vote , ACIP can create a commercial market for a new vaccine that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of months .
"
In the case of Rotateq , its addition to the vaccine schedule led to an increase in yearly revenue of $ 655 million over the course of two years .

There are optimists within the Republican Party .
They look at the wreckage left behind after last year ’s elections , and recall 1964 .
That was the year that Barry Goldwater , the Republican nominee for president , was so badly trounced that pundits proclaimed the GOP dead .
But it was also the year that a new breed of conservative activists , myself among them , brought a new energy to the party that eventually reshaped it and led to years of Republican domination of the executive branch .
The whistle - past - the - graveyard crowd imagines that this year ’s doomsayers have simply forgotten history :
Four years after the 1964 disaster , they remind us , Republicans won the presidency .
We ’ll just do it again , they say .
But the Republicans ’ defeat last year was far different from their 1964 loss -- and it will be a lot harder to come back from .
In 1964 , Goldwater was seen as an anomaly .
He was not representative of his own party , and , to a large extent , was rejected by it .
The conservatives voters so soundly rejected in 2008 are seen not as anomalous but as representative of the larger party .
The Richard Nixon who won the presidency in 1968 had been vice president under Dwight Eisenhower , who left the White House with his popularity intact .
The GOP candidate in 2012 will have to overcome the nation ’s memory of the previous Republican in that office , George W. Bush , who was less popular in most of America than the New York Yankees are in Boston .
There will be no “ glorious days of Republican leadership ” to hark back to unless the party ’s candidates continue to dredge up memories of Ronald Reagan , who left Washington two decades ago , before a good many younger voters were born .

When Republicans rebounded in 1968 , they were a national party , helped to victory by strong support in areas where , today , the party wanders in a political wilderness .
There are now large chunks of the country almost without a Republican presence .
Draw a map of the east side of the U.S. , from the tip of Florida to the Canadian border , and see how many Republican senators or governors you find .
In 1969 , by contrast , the GOP held both Senate seats in New York , Delaware , Pennsylvania and Vermont ; there were Republican senators from New Jersey , Michigan , Maryland , even Massachusetts .
In the House , Republicans held three of the six Connecticut seats , five of 12 in Massachusetts , both in New Hampshire , 15 in New York , seven of 10 in Wisconsin .
You get the idea .
What can you say about the Republican Party in 2009 ?
That it has Alabama locked up ?
Well , that ’s not even true : Democrats are far more competitive in the South than Republicans are in much of the country .
It ’s certainly true that to some degree Arlen Specter ’s defection from the Republican Party was opportunism .
Specter , after all , became a Republican in the first place not because of any particular political point of view but because , in 1966 , when both Republicans and Democrats were trying to recruit him to run for district attorney in Philadelphia , the GOP promised more support .
Specter himself has said that he ’s now a Democrat because that ’s the best way to get elected again .
To Specter , party has never mattered much .

But there ’s more to the story .
While Specter will not march in lock step with Democrats any more than he did with Republicans , he will vote with them on many procedural issues , and in the Senate , that ’s no small matter .
So the loss matters .
And that ’s why Republicans need to take seriously the fact that Specter was not so much seduced by Democrats as driven away by a GOP that has become increasingly intolerant of disagreement within its ranks and seemingly incapable of putting forth an appealing platform .
At one point , Republicans put forth a coherent , idealistic vision of America , one that summoned it to greatness .
There was a profound belief in the dignity of the individual , a reverence for the Constitution and the founders who proposed it , a belief in doing whatever it took ( including spending tax dollars to build a military second to none ) to preserve the peace .
Republican platforms preached prudence and the virtues of small business .
Today , the Republican belief system has degenerated into an embarrassing hodgepodge that worships political victory more than ideas ; supports massive deficits ; plunges the nation into “ just - in - case ” wars without adequate troops , supplies or armor ; dismisses constitutional strictures ; and campaigns on a platform of turning national problem - solving over to “ Joe the Plumber . ”
It ’s hard to see how all that points the way to a reawakening of voters to trust in the GOP .
This may suggest , of course , that the party should just toss in the towel , accept its designated role as the Whigs of the 21st century and leave governance to its betters .
But American freedom depends on power checking power .
If Democrats control the legislative and executive branches without meaningful opposition , the country will be the weaker for it .
Some of President Obama ’s initiatives would dramatically shift the boundaries between public and private , reshape the relationship between citizens and government and alter the lens through which America views its international commitments .
These are serious matters and deserve serious , and constructive , engagement .

Merely attacking administration proposals and labeling Obama a “ socialist ” will only ensure that instead of rebounding , as the GOP did in 1968 , the party will slip even further into irrelevance .
And that will not be good for America .
Emperor Nasi-Goreng
c1225-1290
The most famous of the Chinese Emperors of the Mung Dynasty .
Emperor Nasi Goreng 's legendary rule lasted for 100 years " as long as it takes to pickle an egg " , though sinologists agree it was nearer in fact to a 60 year reign .
His reign was famous for the development of Chinese cooking and the expansion of the rice and noodle houses that served the needs of the burgeoning travelling middle class who had begun to take fashionable pilgrimages to bathe in the health giving waters of the Big Pond ( now known as the South China Sea ) .
More importantly he began the construction of the Great Wall of China ( the only man made structure visible from space )
Early Life
Little is known of the Emperor 's early life .
Born to the 4th wife ( the beautiful Tel Stra ) of the Emperor Mee Goreng , his childhood was spent in a secluded palace on the shores of the Big Pond .
He was not expected to inherit the throne and is supposed to have devoted his time to the refinement of traditional dishes of Chinese Cuisine - wishing thus to win the people 's ovation and fame forever .
On the unexpected deaths of the 17 older brothers during the mysterious summer illnesses of 1225 ( now believed to be caused by a rare virus passed on by reading contaminated correspondence ) he was summoned to Peking and accompanied by his favourite duck , crowned the unexpected emperor of all China .
Dangerous Visitors from the West
The visit of Marco Polo to China in 1275 had opened the country to a new scourge , Giant Angora Rabbits .
Originally given as a gift to the court of the preceeding Emporer Mee-Goreng the rabbits were adopted as accessories by the fashionable followers of the Imperial court , who carried them in small handbags , or displayed them on the roofs of their travelling litters .
Soon a fashion for pet goldfish replaced the fashion for bunnies and , not wishing to kill an aminal so obviously sacred to the visiting Polos they ( the rabbits ) were released into the Western Deserts where they bred to plague proportions .
Picture Licenced under Gnu Free Documentation Licence
Soon the depredations of thousands of starving Angoras were threatening the rice crop and after unsuccesful attempts to control the scourge with compulsory rabbit stews ( Immortalised in the poem " My other Chinese Cook " by James Brunton Stephens ) the Emperor decreed the building of the greatest wall ever known to mankind .
Decline and Death
The emperor enjoyed good health for most of his reign but in 1289 he became ill after a particularly large meal of Rabbit pie .
His doctors were divided as to whether he was struck down with dyspepsia or Mixam - it - osis .
Even lowering him in the waters of the Big Pond , supported by a broad band of imperial silk failed to arrest the course of the illness and within a year he was dead .
After the customery 6 years of compulsory mourning he was buried beneath the great wall at Dai - Lup where to this day pilgrims vist to pray fruitlessly for a speedy recovery from illnesses .
He was succeeded by his son Pisan Goreng ( 1290 - 1303 ) .
Rabbit was never eaten in China again .

The days of the Wild West are coming to their end in the world of Python testing .
It was not many years ago that nearly every project built with Python seemed to have its own idioms and practices for writing and running tests .
But now , the frontier is finally beginning to close .
The community is rallying around a few leading solutions that are bringing convenience and common standards to the test suites of hundreds of popular projects .
This is article will serve as a guide to the new testing frameworks .
In this article , you will be introduced to three popular testing frameworks and see the radically simpler test style that the newest generation of tools are encouraging .
The second article , Discovering and selecting tests , will step back and look at the larger question of how these frameworks automate the task of finding and cataloging your project ’s tests in the first place .
Finally ,
Test reporting with a Python test framework will look at the powerful features these frameworks provide for viewing the results of your test runs .
By learning the common idioms of these three frameworks , you will not only be better prepared to read through other programmer ’s Python packages , but to build elegant and powerful test suites for your own applications as well .
There are three Python testing frameworks that seem to be in use on large code bases today .
Taking them in chronological order , they are :
zope.testing
As usual , the developers working on the Zope project seem to have been early innovators .
They needed a uniform way to discover and run tests across their large code base , and their answer was the zope.
testing package , which remains heavily used to this day .
The zope . testing package only supports traditional Python test styles like unittest and doctest , and not the radically simpler styles permitted by the more recent frameworks .
But it does offer a powerful system of layers with which whole directories full of tests can rely on common setup code that creates once , for the layer ( rather than once for each test ) , the environment in which the tests need to run .
py.test
It was in 2004 that Holger Krekel renamed his std package , whose name was often confused with that of the Standard Library that ships with Python , to the ( only slightly less confusing ) name ‘ py . ’
Though the package contains several sub - packages , it is now known almost entirely for its py.test framework .
The py.test framework sets a new standard for Python testing , and is popular with many developers today .
The elegant and Pythonic idioms it introduced for test writing have made it possible for test suites to be written in a far more compact style than was possible before , as you shall see below .
nose
The nose project was released in 2005 , the year after py.test received its modern guise .
It was written by Jason Pellerin to support the same test idioms that had been pioneered by py.test , but in a package that is easier to install and maintain .
Though py.test has in several ways caught up , and today is quite easy to install , nose has retained its reputation for being very sleek and easy to use .
At Python conventions , it is now common to see developers wearing black T - shirts showing the nosetests command , followed by the field of periods with which it denotes successful tests .
Interest in nose continues to increase , and one often sees posts on other project mailing lists in which the local developers ask the project leads when their project will be permitted to make the switch to nose .
Of the three projects , it looks like nose might well become the standard , with py.test having a smaller but loyal community and zope.
testing remaining popular only for projects built atop the Zope framework .
But all are actively maintained , and each has some unique features .
Keep reading , and learn about the features and differences among the three so that you can make the right choice for your own projects .
The testing revolution
The py.test framework transformed the world of Python testing by accepting plain Python functions as tests instead of insisting that tests be packaged inside of larger and heavier - weight test classes .
Since the nose framework supports the same idiom , these patterns are likely to become more and more popular .
Imagine that you want to check whether the Python truth values True and False are really , as Python promises , equivalent to the Boolean numbers 1 and 0 .
Either py.test or nose will accept and run the following few lines of code as valid tests that answer this question :
# test_new.py - simple tests functions def testTrue ( self ) : assert True == 1 def testFalse ( self ) : assert False == 0 Show more Show more icon
In contrast to the simplicity of the above example , you will find that older documentation about Python testing is replete with verbose example tests that all go something like this :
# test_old.py -
The old way of doing things import unittest class TruthTest( unittest. TestCase ) : def testTrue ( self ) : assert True == 1 def testFalse ( self ) : assert False == 0 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : unittest.main ( )
Show more
Show more icon
Look at all of the scaffolding that was necessary to support two actual lines of test code !
First , this code requires an import statement that is completely irrelevant to the code under test , since the tests themselves simply ignore the module and use only built - in Python values like True and False .
Furthermore , a class is created that does not support or enhance the tests , since they do not actually use their self argument for anything .
And , finally , it requires two lines of boilerplate down at the bottom , so that this particular test can be run by itself from the command line .
Experienced users of unittest might try to argue that the above example should use the testing methods that my new TruthTest class has inherited from TestCase .
For example , they would encourage me to use assertEqual ( ) instead of an assert statement that tests manually for equality , in which case the test would indeed use self instead of ignoring it :
# alternate version of the TestTrue method ... def testTrue ( self ) : self.assertEqual( True , 1 ) ... Show more
Show more icon
There are three responses to this recommendation .
First , calling a method hurts readability .
While the assertEqual ( ) method name does indicate that the two values are being tested for equality , the code still does not look like a comparison in the way that the Python == operator looks like a comparison to someone familiar with the language .
Second , as you will see in the third article in this series , the new testing frameworks now know how to introspect assert statements to inspect the condition that made the test fail , which means that a bare assert statement can now lead to test failure messages that are just as informative as the results of calling the old methods like assertEqual ( ) .
Finally , even if assertEqual ( ) were still necessary , it would surely be simpler and more Pythonic to import such a function from a testing module , instead of using class inheritance merely to make functions available !
You will see below , in fact , that when both py.test and nose want to make additional routines available to support tests , they simply define them as functions and expect users to import them into their code .
Of course , when authors actually need setup and teardown routines that cache state for later use in test cases , unittest subclasses still make eminent sense , and both py.test and nose fully support them .
And many Python tests these days are written as doctests , which are supported by Python ’s standard library and need not make use of either functions or classes :
Doctest For The Above Example -----------------------------
The truth values in Python , named " True " and " False " , are equivalent to the Boolean numbers one and zero . >>>
True == 1 True >>>
False == 0 True Show more
Show more icon
But when programmers want to write simple test code without all the verbiage involved in a doctest , then test functions are a wonderful way to write .
Above all , test functions vastly enhance what might be called the writability of tests .
Instead of making each programmer remember , re-invent , or copy the test scaffolding from the last test he wrote , the new conventions enable a Python programmer to write tests as one usually writes Python code :
By simply opening an empty file , and typing !
Framework - specific conveniences
Both py.test and nose provide special routines that make writing tests easier .
You might say that they each allow you to write tests using their own particular dialect of convenience functions .
This can make test writing simpler and less error - prone , and also result in test code that is shorter and more readable .
But using these routines also carries an important consequence : your tests are then tied to the framework whose functions you are using .
The trade - off is one of convenience versus compatibility .
If you write all of your tests from the ground up using only the clunky standard Python unittest module , then they will work under any testing framework you choose .
Going a step further , if you adopt the simpler and sleeker practice of writing test functions ( as described above ) , then your tests will at least work under both py.test and nose .
But if you start using features peculiar to one testing framework , then a good deal of rewriting might be necessary in the future if another one of the frameworks develops important new features and you decide to migrate .
Both py.test and nose provide an alternative for the assertRaises ( ) method of TestCase .
The version provided by py.test is a bit fancier , because it can also accept a string to execute , which is more powerful because you can test expressions that raise exceptions rather than only function calls :
# conveniences.py import math import py.test py.test.raises( OverflowError , math.log , 0 ) py.test.raises ( ValueError , math.sqrt , -1 ) py.test.raises(ZeroDivisionError , " 1 / 0 " ) import nose.
tools nose.tools.assert_raises(OverflowError , math.log , 0 ) nose.tools.assert_raises (ValueError , math.sqrt , -1 ) #
No equivalent for third example !
Show more
Show more icon
Beyond the testing of exceptions , however , the two frameworks part ways .
The only other py.test convenience seems to be a function to determine whether a particular call triggers a DeprecationWarning :
py.test.deprecated_call(my.old.function , arg1 , arg2 )
Show more
Show more icon
On the other hand , nose seems to have a quite rich set of assertion functions , both for cases where you want to avoid a bare assert statement , and where you need to do something more complicated .
You should consult its documentation for details , but here is a quick synopsis of the possibilities offered by nose .
tools :
# nose .tools support functions for writing tests assert_almost_equal ( first , second , places=7 , msg=None ) assert_almost_equals ( first , second , places=7 , msg=None ) assert_equal ( first , second , msg=None ) assert_equals ( first , second , msg=None ) assert_false ( expr , msg=None ) assert_not_almost_equal( first , second , places=7 , msg=None ) assert_not_almost_equals ( first , second , places=7 , msg=None ) assert_not_equal ( first , second , msg=None ) assert_not_equals ( first , second , msg=None ) assert_true ( expr , msg=None ) eq_( a , b , msg=None ) ok_ ( expr , msg=None )

The routines above that check for an approximate value are especially important when dealing with floating - point results , if you want to write tests flexible enough to succeed on Python implementations with subtle differences in their handling of floating point .
Distributed testing
Tests seem to get run more and more often these days .
The practice of continuous testing has now been adopted in many shops , where project tests are run with every check - in to the team ’s version - control system .
And as test - driven development grows in popularity , many developers now write and run the tests for a new module before they even bring up their editor to start writing the module ’s code .
If tests take a long time to run , then they can become an important roadblock to developer productivity .
It is therefore an advantage to be able to bring as much computing power as possible to bear against the task of running tests .
On a small scale , this can mean running multiple testing processes to take advantage of all of the CPU cores on your machine .
For larger projects , whole farms of test machines are configured , either using dedicated servers ready to run tests in parallel , or even using the combined idle time of all of the developer ’s workstations together .
In the area of parallel and distributed testing , the three testing frameworks the article looks at have quite significant differences :
The zope . testing command line has a -j option that specifies that several testing processes should be started instead of all tests being done in the same process .
Since each process can run on a different CPU core , running -j 4 on a four - CPU machine would allow all four CPUs to be active in running tests at once .
command line has a option that specifies that several testing processes should be started instead of all tests being done in the same process .
Since each process can run on a different CPU core , running on a four - CPU machine would allow all four CPUs to be active in running tests at once .
The nose project reports that they have support for parallel tests now committed to their project trunk , but normal users will have to wait for the next release before trying it out .
project reports that they have support for parallel tests now committed to their project trunk , but normal users will have to wait for the next release before trying it out .
The py.test tool not only supports a multiprocessing option ( - n ) for running on several CPU cores like zope.
testing , but it actually has the tools to distribute tests among an entire farm of test servers .
Of these three frameworks , py.test looks like the clear leader in this area .
Not only can you give it multiple -- tx options , each describing an environment or remote server on which you want to run tests , but it actually supports distributing tests for two quite different reasons !
With -- dist=load , it will use your server farm for the traditional task of spreading your running tests across several machines to reduce the time you spend waiting .
But with dist=each , it does something more sophisticated ; it will make sure that each test gets run on each of the different testing environments that you have made available to py.test .
This means that py.test can simultaneously test your product on multiple versions of the Python interpreter , and on multiple operating systems .
This makes py.test a very strong contender if your project supports multiple platforms and you want a testing solution that will support you out of the box , without requiring you to write your own scripts for copying tests to several different platforms and running them .
Customization and extensibility
All three testing frameworks provide ways for both individual users and for whole projects to select the behaviors and options they want from their test framework .
The zope . testing module is , in Zope packages , often called by a buildout recipe that specifies default options .
This means that developers running the tests will get a uniform set of results , while still being free to specify their own command - line switches when the behaviors selected at the project level do not fit their needs .

This means that developers running the tests will get a uniform set of results , while still being free to specify their own command - line switches when the behaviors selected at the project level do not fit their needs .
Per -user customization is supposed by the nose framework through a nose.cfg or a .noserc file in a user ’s home directory , where he can specify his own personal preferences for how test results are displayed .
framework through a or a file in a user ’s home directory , where he can specify his own personal preferences for how test results are displayed .
Per - project options can be provided for either framework .
The py.test framework will detect conftest .py files in any project which it is testing , where it will look for per-project options like whether to detect and run doctests and for the patterns that it should use to detect test files and functions in the first place .
The nose framework , on the other hand , looks for a project - wide setup.cfg file , which is an already - standard way of providing information about a Python package , and looks for a [ nosetests ] section inside of it .
And , going beyond what can be accomplished by varying their configuration , both py.test and nose provide support for plug-ins , user - supplied modules that can install new command - line options and add new behaviors to both tools .
Conclusion
Adopting one of the new generation of Python testing frameworks will provide concise idioms and uniform testing techniques that , in the past , every Python project had to supply for itself .
The next article will begin to examine the larger testing machinery that each framework implements , the techniques that they use to examine your project in search of test modules and test files .

Farewell
Tour concludes
A US teenager has successfully won a lawsuit against a teacher who described creationism as " superstitious nonsense " .
Chad Farnan , a devout Christian studying at California 's Capistrano Valley high school , persuaded a judge that his European history teacher , James Corbett , violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment , which courts interpret as banning government employees from promoting , or displaying hostility towards , religion .
Farnan claimed Corbett made comments that were " derogatory , disparaging and belittling regarding religion and Christianity in particular " .
In legal documents submitted to the US district court , he said he was uncomfortable going to class and felt as though Corbett had created an atmosphere in which he could not effectively learn " both because and regardless of his religious beliefs " .
Farnan 's lawyer , Jennifer Monk , who works for a not - for - profit Christian law firm , Advocates for Faith and Freedom , told the Guardian yesterday that Farnan 's victory was the first of its kind , proving that the establishment clause applied equally to the disapproval of religion as it did to the promotion of religion .
" It is the first case of its kind where a court has held a teacher responsible for the disapproval of Christianity .
It 's common for lawsuits to be brought against teachers promoting religion .
In general , for years , religion has been taken out of the classroom .
I do n't agree with that , but if it 's going to be taken out , at the very minimum you can't go to the other extreme .
" The [ Farnan ] family is excited , it 's a courageous stand .
There were people who were very supportive and there were people who did n't agree with his stand . "
Farnan spent almost 18 months gathering material against Corbett , compiling a dossier that featured secret recordings of the teacher 's remarks .
However , Judge James Selna found in a 37 - page ruling that almost all the statements cited by the plaintiff did not violate the establishment cause , including Corbett 's view that " when you put on your Jesus glasses , you can't see the truth " – a reference to peasants who did not support the reforms of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II for religious reasons .
The judge said the statement was made in the context of an historical discussion .
He dismissed other comments by Corbett that " conservatives do n't want women to avoid pregnancies — that 's interfering with God 's work " and that there was as much evidence that God created the world " as there is that there is a gigantic spaghetti monster living behind the moon who did it " .
Only one of Corbett 's opinions fell foul of the First Amendment – his " unequivocal belief that creationism is superstitious nonsense " .
Judge Selna concluded that there was no legitimate secular purpose to the statement and it constituted " improper disapproval of religion in violation of the establishment clause " .
In his ruling , the judge said he tried to balance the rights of both parties .
" The court 's ruling reflects the constitutionally permissible need for expansive discussion , even if a given topic may be offensive to a particular religion , " he said .
" The decision also reflects that there are boundaries .
The ruling protects Farnan , but also protects teachers like Corbett in carrying out their teaching duties . "
He said the case reflected the tension between the constitutional rights of a student and the demands of higher education , as well as the tension between Farnan 's religious beliefs and the need for government , especially schools , to carry out their duties " free of the strictures of any particular religious or philosophical belief system " .
Corbett , a teacher with 20 years ' experience , remains at Capistrano Valley high school and has made no public comment since the case started .
Question -
Unless they build the fucking thing from recycled materials , is n't it already damaging the environment from the get go ?
Is n't a new car ( Prius , Insight , Fusion , whatever ) already one big carbon fucking footprint ?
I mean , it 's not like the picked them off the magical fruit bearing car tree for chrissake ...
So at what point does this car , or any ecocar for that matter , ever become environmentally friendly ?
Do they ever ?
Can they ever ?
Or is it one big crock of marketing bullshit and the only true environmentally carbon negative / neutral car would be a used Geo Metro that runs on Flinstone Power ?
But no one in the world is talented enough to sell a used Geo Metro that we peddle around with our feet and so they have to resort to spouting " Gets 50 mpg but please ignore the fact that it 's true cost entails a small forest worth of lumber , ton of iron ore , and 6 trillion barells of oil to produce - ssshhhh it 's still eco friendly ! " type bullshit with a wink and a nod hoping those poor fucks in San Fransisco are n't smart enough to factor in that shit when they are trying to be the cleanest queen on the block .
Because if that 's the case - I 'm buying 3 Hummers and I am going to park them in my driveway and let them idle until they run out of gas , fill them up , and repeat until there is no more winter in the Northwest or Nanci Pelosi is found dead in a Bangkok Hotel with her hands behind her back and a rope tied around her penis .
Since I think about browsers all day here are some thoughts on the future .
As always , I 'm biased towards the Linux ecosystem , so in some sense this post could be considered a response to the question that came up recently in the Gnome world , which was roughly " What next ?
We 've written all this GUI software but nobody really cares anymore . "
Background : HTML as the new display protocol
X11 is a remote display protocol .
It can do some pretty cool tricks but it is also terrible for latent ( aka " anything but a short wire " ) connections , as nearly everything you do involves round trips .
To fix this you want to be able to put more smarts into the low - latency piece of hardware you 're locally interacting with .
Many people have tried to improve this but they 've mostly failed .
( NX is pretty sweet but there 's still not enough smarts client - side . )
In the meantime the world has evolved , for better or for worse , into a remote display protocol called HTML .
( There are many interesting reasons for that , but they are beyond the scope of this post . )
From the X11 perspective , HTML involves a loadable DSL for interface description , another for sandboxed execution , a well - understood and cacheable networking protocol , and a install base larger than anything before seen .
It 's not the system anyone would have designed if we were starting over but it's what we 've got , and it continues to evolve rapidly .
Any future platform that wants their own API will need to support the web one anyway -- witness the annoyingness of developing for Android / iPhone versus the the Palm phone as an example of embracing this .
Most of the software I use today runs in part on my machine and in part on other peoples ' machines , and cloud computing hyperbole aside I expect this difference to only get blurrier .
I used to scoff at the concept of " web applications " but consider that even relatively mundane websites like LiveJournal really are software -- without LJ 's servers doing it for me it , the generation of my friends page would necessarily happen in code on my machine .
One of the reasons I decided to work on Chrome was when I realized the only windowed apps I used anymore were terminals and browsers , and terminals more or less dead - ended evolutionarily with the original xterm ( I have much more to say about that , actually , but it 's for another time ) .
Software like GWT can be thought of as a toolkit ( like GTK / Qt ) in this world ; existing apps are written to something analagous to xcb but stuff like Wave shows how things might work in the future .
( I do n't especially want to write Java , but conceptually GWT is in the right place .
Thesis
So here 's a thesis : Chrome comes with a few almost orthogonal goals behind it -- tabs as processes , some novel * UI bits -- which are a good step but can't go far enough due to the ecosystem it runs in .
People still think of browsers as applications , but their modern use is more as a runtime coupled with a random assortment of retrofitted system - level services .
In part this is because there is no other route for third - party application developers on the Other Platforms to " upload " themselves into system - level services , which is where I think the free software world has an opportunity .
Processes
The elevation ( or you could say " recognition " ) of web applications as things your operating system can help schedule and protect from one another is an old idea , and surely many browsers in the future will do as we 've done , but even in today 's browsers the web processes are still driven by a fragile " browser process " that is the single point of failure .
For example , the network stack all lives in the privileged frontend process , so any bug in the HTTP stack sidesteps the sandboxing and takes out all tabs simultaneously .
Why do networking bugs affect the UI ?
Why do downloads stop when when I close the last visible window ?
Ultimately it 's because you have a hodgepodge of services ( including high - privilege inputs like access to the mouse and keyboard mixed with untrusted network inputs ) in a single place : the browser process .
Researchers have even called it the " browser kernel " , in fact .
( One sad reason for the single monolithic process is so people do n't complain more when they look at the process list in task manager .
Another is that application vendors like Google are n't allowed to provide system services , while OS vendors like Microsoft are n't incented ( or sometimes allowed ) to integrate such services . )
HTTP , viewed as system - wide remote display protocol , should n't be implemented at the application level .
Why do n't other tools like wget know how to use my cookies implicitly ?
Or even simpler : my proxy settings ?
Cookies are credentials much like my user id ; Unix apps have a builtin for the former ( getuid ( ) ) but the web equivalent is considered an application - level problem ( wget -- load- cookies ~/.mozilla/firefox/mumble/etc ) .
MacOS and Windows have approached this problem by making HTTP fetching and proxy settings system libraries ; however , by virtue of being owned by the OS distributor and closed - source it leaves you at the mercy of their bugs and limitations .
( We measured an improvement in page - load performance across our ( opted - in - to - measurements ) user base when we switched off the Windows HTTP stack . )
And the ease of integration is still too lacking ; your favorite programming language of the month is still poorly reimplementing HTTP without integrating with my cookie store .
What I 'd like : a network service that would offload HTTP interaction from applications .
Applications could hand off jobs like " download this file " to the service , which would live beyond a given browser session and allow me to centrally control bandwidth , caching , proxies , limit / resue TCP connections to a particular host , etc .
Tabs
Why do we have tabs ?
Because window management has failed .
As one commenter put it , on a modern machine we now have running native apps in a strip of buttons across the bottom of the screen and a list of running web apps in a strip of buttons across the top of a special browser window .
On my laptop , with a tiling window manager , I have a tab for each X11 app I 'm running and then one tab containing the Chrome tab strip within it .
One spiffy Chrome feature is that when you tear a tab off a window you can drag it to hot zones on the screen that will relayout your browser windows side by side .
But these sorts of behaviors do n't belong as application behavior ; they 're only forced there because the window management the system provides is n't adequate .
( I believe Windows 7 introduces some features like this . )
What I 'd like :
It 'd be a pretty small patch to Chrome to change the call to " open in new tab " : rather than opening a new tab , it 'd open a new window along with some extra hints ( in the the window manager sense ) about the relationship between this new window and the one that already exists .
( Browsers have interesting logic related to whether new tabs appear rightmost or next to the current one , based on the interaction you 've done . )
My window manager is then responsible for what it 's always done : managing windows , and I get to use the existing set of keys for swapping tabs , closing windows , etc .
Conclusions
I think the free software world is uniquely situated for these kinds of changes , because only there do we have enough control over our computers to be able to switch out fundamental pieces like these .
( I tried and gave up on OS X due to frustrations over window management . )
On the other hand , it 's wasted breath to post about this since I do n't have time to implement any of it .
And I 've been sitting on this post for a month so I may as well publish it before I forget about it .
* Before anyone starts on it : very few ideas are " new " ; selection , combination , and execution are relevant .
British citizens will never be forced to carry ID cards , Home Secretary Alan Johnson said today .
In his first major policy announcement as Home Secretary , Mr Johnson ditched a trial scheme that would have required some airport staff and pilots to carry the controversial cards .
The schemes , at Manchester Airport and London City Airport , will instead be voluntary .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He also ruled out ever requiring the public to own a card .
Previously , ministers said ID cards could become compulsory once 80 % of the population was covered .
The cards will still be compulsory for foreign workers , Mr Johnson said .
Mr Johnson said : " Holding an identity card should be a personal choice for British citizens - just as it is now to obtain a passport .
" Accordingly I want the introduction of identity cards for all British citizens to be voluntary and I have therefore decided that identity cards issued to airside workers , planned initially at Manchester and London City airports later this year , should also be voluntary . "
Asked if the cards would ever be made compulsory he said : " No " .
" If a future Government wanted to make them compulsory it would require primary legislation , " he added .
Mr Johnson said he still believed the cards would help improve security at airports .
But he admitted the Government had allowed the perception that the cards would be a " panacea " that would stop terrorism .
Listing the benefits of the scheme at a press conference in central London , he did not at first mention tackling terrorism .
Instead he said the cards would help stop illegal working , people trafficking and ID fraud .
Mr Johnson said he was an " instinctive " supporter of ID cards and said he wanted to " accelerate " the delivery of the cards .
A pilot scheme covering Greater Manchester will be extended to the whole of the North West of England from early next year , Mr Johnson said .

Jim McAuslan , general secretary of the British Airline Pilots ' Association ( Balpa ) , said : " This is a sensible change of approach and one which we welcome .
" Balpa has always had aviation security high on its agenda and has a number of ideas on how we can improve airport security which we will be pursuing with the secretary of state for transport .
" But we have never seen the national ID card as an improvement to security and we are glad that the new Home Secretary has listened to us . "
Balpa said that under the original plans , pilots would have been required to have a national ID card before they could apply for a pass enabling them to get to their aircraft .
The consequence of this would have been that individual pilots would have been forced to have an ID card or automatically lose their job , said the union .
Mr McAuslan added : " Balpa will be stressing to its members the new voluntary nature of the scheme .
We will also be monitoring airport operators to ensure they stick to the new rules and do n't bring in compulsion by the back door . "
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : " This is a victory for union campaigning .
Unions will be pleased that ministers will no longer be making it compulsory for pilots , cabin crew and baggage handlers at the two trial airports to apply for ID cards .
" Unions have had reservations about the pilot scheme from the very beginning , fearing that compulsory ID cards would add little to airport security , but could end up risking the jobs of individuals who refused to comply and deterring new recruits from applying for airport jobs in Manchester and London . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling accused the Government of an " absurd fudge " .
" This decision is symbolic of a Government in chaos , " he said .
" They have spent millions on the scheme so far - the Home Secretary thinks it has been a waste and wants to scrap it , but the prime minister wo n't let him .
" So we end up with an absurd fudge instead .
This is no way to run the country . "
When the ID cards were originally mooted , it was assumed they would eventually become compulsory , with supporters saying the full benefits would not be realised unless they were .
In an early review of the project , police forces said the advantages of the cards would be reduced unless people had to carry them .
Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke said cards could be made compulsory once 80 % of the population already had them .
Today 's decision removes the potential for compulsion , while encouraging more people to volunteer for a card more quickly .
Around 3,500 people have already signed up to carry a card .
Mr Johnson said he wanted more young people to carry the cards to help them prove their age .
He is also considering plans to give the cards away free to those over 75 .
Anyone else wanting a card will pay £ 30 on top of the cost of having their biometric details taken .
The estimated cost to the taxpayer is more than £ 5 billion over ten years .
Everyone who wants a card , or a biometric passport , will have their details stored on the national identity register .
Civil liberties groups said this amounted to a compulsory scheme .
Isabella Sankey , director of policy for Liberty , said : " The Home Secretary needs to be clear as to whether entry on to the National Identity Register will continue to be automatic when applying for a passport .
" If so , the identity scheme will be compulsory in practice .
However you spin it , big ears , four legs and a long trunk still make an elephant .
And this white elephant would be as costly to privacy and race equality as to our purses . "

I 've been doing a couple of changes to the JavaScript InfoVis Tookit lately , which I 'll describe in some other post , but most important I 've been working on a new project I 'm really excited about that 's called V8 - GL [ V8 - GL ] ( http://github.com/philogb/v8-gl/tree/master#readme) intends to provide a high - level JavaScript API for creating 2D / 3D hardware accelerated desktop graphics .
In other words , you can hack some JavaScript code that opens a desktop window and renders some 3D hardware accelerated graphics .
Bindings are made using the V8 JavaScript engine I wrote a small example that animates a rotating Icosahedron .
This example uses timers , colors and lighting among other things :
OpenGL devs. might recognize the API exposed through the Gl , Glu and Glut objects .
Currently 80 % of the OpenGL API is implemented .
OpenGL APIs are exposed through the Gl , Glu and Glut global objects .
However , like I said before , this project is not just about making OpenGL bindings for JavaScript through V8 , but to provide a higher level API .
Although this project is in current development you can already clone the repo and follow the Download instructions at the V8 - GL project page for creating some cool examples .
Hope you like it :)
Ticket sales for London ’s West End production of “ Les Miserables ” have skyrocketed since Susan Boyle sang “ I Dreamed a Dream ” on “ Britain ’s Got Talent . ”
Sales for the long - running musical increased by 46 percent practically overnight since Boyle ’s now legendary performance back in April .
Boyle ’s rendition of the song , which is a solo sung by the character Fantine in “ Les Miz , ” on the talent show received more YouTube views than any video before , with nearly 200 million hits .
The man who discovered the rise in London “ Les Miz ” ticket sales , Mark Bower , the head of lifestyle products for lastminute.com , told the Daily Telegraph : “ There has been a clear knock - on effect from Susan Boyle singing ‘ I Dreamed a Dream . ’
“ After her performance ticket sales shot up almost overnight and have maintained a consistent level of popularity . ”
In the end , Boyle ’s star turn did n’t help her to win at the “ Britain ’s Got Talent ” final ( she was beaten out by dance troupe Diversity ) , but the chanteuse has since teamed up with Simon Cowell ’s record label and U2’s Irish financial manager Ossie Kilkenny in order to launch her professional singing career .
In the meantime , contract requires Boyle , 48 , to take part in the “ Britain ’s Got Talent ” promotional tour beginning tonight .
Speculation has been circling that Boyle would n’t joint the tour due to her brief stay at London ’s Priory mental health clinic , where she was suffering from exhaustion .
Boyle ’s brother , Gerry , has been quite vocal about Susan ’s dreams and aspirations since she shot to fame .
He shared with the media that the Scottish singing star , whose parents were Irish , is ready to embrace the American public ’s love for her , is ready to start her career in the U.S. and was even invited to sing for the Obamas at the White House in the coming months .
The UFC prides itself on real fighting , but that does n’t mean that the mixed martial arts organization is n’t in a constant search for characters .
That ’s why UFC president Dana White buckled and gave Kimbo Slice a chance to associate himself with White ’s organization as part of a deal that will put him on Season 10 of Spike ’s Ultimate Fighter .
White has previously bashed Slice ( real name : Kevin Ferguson ) , who 's made his name through street fighting videos on YouTube , for not having a full complement of skills .
But instead of continuing to knock down Slice , who has been out of work since Elite XC went out of business ,
White made what I think was the necessary move by putting Slice on the show that develops UFC talent .
How big is Slice ?
Well , Elite XC was not a viable business , but I thought that if Kimbo Slice could continue to win - which he did n’t - he single - handedly could have kept the league alive .
Current champion Brock Lesnar , who used to wrestle in the WWE , is a great face for the UFC , but it ’s undeniable that there ’s no current fighter that has the makeup of Kimbo Slice .
Could there be a better name ?
Is there anything better than the disheveled black beard and the good teeth ?
And the back story of being homeless , of being a porn star security guard , of his Internet fights ?
I agree that Kimbo Slice has to learn to fight and I understood White ’s original objection to associating his premium brand with Slice and turning it into a circus act .
But
White also knows that just because the UFC is n’t the WWE , does n’t mean that that they ca n’t take advantage of a free agent who many feel at least looks like the ultimate barbarian .

The assertion of total power through unchecked violence - outside the Constitution , beyond the reach of the law ( apart from legal memos from hired hacks instructed to retroactively redefine torture into ' legality ' ) - will be seen in retrospect as the key defining theory of Bush conservatism .
It ended with torture .
Why ?
Because reality may differ from ideology ; and when it does , it is vital to create reality to support ideology .
And so torture creates reality by coercing " facts " from broken bodies and minds .
This is how torture is always a fantastic temptation for those in power , even if they first use it out of what they think is necessity or good intentions : it provides a way for them to coerce reality into the shape they desire .
This is also why it is so uniquely dangerous .
Because it creates a closed circle of untruth , which is then used to justify more torture , which generates more " truth . "
This is the Imaginationland some of us have been so concerned about .
The Western anathema on torture began as a way to ensure the survival of truth .
And that is the root of the West 's entire legal and constitutional system .
Remove a secure way to discover the truth - or create a system that can manufacture it or render it indistinguishable from lies - and the entire system unravels .
That 's why in the West suspects are innocent before being found guilty ; and that 's why in the West even those captured in wartime have long been accorded protection from forced confessions .
Because it creates a world where truth is always the last priority and power is always the first .
Jailed Iranian reformists are believed to have been tortured in an attempt to force them into TV " confessions " of a foreign - led plot against the Islamic regime .
According to Iranian websites , the " confessions " are aimed at implicating Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the defeated reformist candidates in this month 's presidential poll , in an alleged conspiracy .
Mostafa Tajzadeh , Abdollah Ramezanzadeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh , all Mousavi supporters , are reported to have undergone " intensive interrogation " sessions in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison since being arrested in a mass round - up of opposition figures following Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election .
The three , who all served in the government of the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , are among several hundred activists , academics , journalists and students detained in a crackdown coinciding with the brutal suppression of street protesters who believe the election was stolen .
Fellow prisoners are reported to have heard screams of pain from Tajzadeh , a former deputy interior minister , and Ramezanzadeh , who was Khatami 's government spokesman , during interrogations at Evin 's section 209 , which is reserved for political prisoners and run by the hardline intelligence ministry .
Aminzadeh , an ex-deputy foreign minister , was heard shouting " I am not going to give interviews . "
A spokesman for Amnesty International said the reports came from " very credible sources " .
The Iranian authorities have used this technique before to humiliate and discredit opponents .
In 2007 , state television aired " confessions " by US - Iranian academics Haleh Esfandiari , Kian Tajbakhsh and Ramin Jahanbegloo in which they said they had worked with pro-democracy groups that the regime claimed were plotting its downfall .
This week , state television broadcast interviews with several people admitting to being " terrorists " after purportedly taking part in street demonstrations .
Tajzadeh 's wife , Fakhrosadat Mohtashamipour , told the pro-reform website Emruz that she and a lawyer had been denied access to him since his arrest the day after the 12 June election .
" Any quote or remarks made by these people in the current situation has no credibility .
My husband 's only crime is his efforts to secure a high turnout , " she said .
Tajzadeh , 53 , a member of the pro-reform Islamic Participation Front and the Islamic Revolution Mojahedin Organisation , has been a staunch critic of Ahmadinejad .
After the president was first elected four years ago , Tajzadeh told the Guardian that Ahmadinejad 's leading supporters wanted to create an atmosphere similar to that under the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Renewed fears have been voiced over the health of another jailed reformist , Saeed Hajarian , a former Khatami adviser who is severely disabled from a failed assassination attempt nine years ago .
Reports of Hajarian 's death on blogs and Twitter were dismissed by the reformist website Parlemannews , which quoted " informed sources " as saying he was in " relative health " and being given essential medication and care .
Meanwhile , state TV reported that the head of Mousavi 's information committee , Abolfazl Fateh , had been prevented from leaving Iran for Britain , where he is a PhD student .
Fars , a pro-Ahmadinejad news agency close to the country 's Revolutionary Guard , said he had been banned from travelling to allow the authorities to investigate " recent gatherings " , a reference to the pro-Mousavi demonstrations .
Five pirates arrive back on board ship with 100 gold coins and decide to share them out using a democratic system .
Each of the pirates has a different rank , and the most superior pirate will therefore take the first turn at proposing the way in which the gold is shared out .
The pirates will then have a vote , which , if it is a draw , will be won by the pirate making the proposition .
If the proposal is accepted , the gold is shared out , but if not , the pirate making the proposal is thrown overboard and the next in the chain of command is allowed to propose a way to share out the gold .
These are , in fact , the rules for a mathematical game known as the ' pirate game ' , and the result is quite different from what the average person would expect .
The Problem
We will label the pirates A , B , C , D and E , with A being the highest - ranking and E being the ship 's dogsbody .
Though they are supposedly your run -of - the - mill scourge of the sea and are naturally very self - centred , the pirates all have a good grasp of the situation and can anticipate what the others will do .
A pirate offered nothing in a proposal will vote against it , as they have nothing to lose but would n't mind seeing another pirate thrown to the sharks .
One would expect the resulting shares to look something like this :
A - 20
- 20 B - 20
- 20 C - 20
- 20 D - 20
- 20 E - 20
However , this seemingly obvious solution is ruined by the presence of the chain of command and the seemingly innocuous voting system .
In actual fact , the majority of the crew end up agreeing to A taking almost all the gold .
This seems illogical , but the following will show how it is completely true .
The solution is best explained by looking at what each pirate would propose , starting with the dogsbody , E .
D's and E's Proposals
E never actually gets to make a proposal , although he would award every single gold piece to himself if he had the chance .
The problem is that D's proposal comes first , and D will always win this ballot as he holds the casting vote .
Therefore , if pirates A , B and C were to be cast overboard , D would be able to propose the following and win :
D - 100
- 100 E - 0
C's Proposal
Being a reasonably intelligent pirate , C knows that if he gets to make a proposal through both A and B being thrown overboard , he would only have to offer E better than nothing to win the vote .
Offering D better than nothing would n't work , as D knows that if C goes overboard , D would get the whole stash .
C could therefore propose the following and win :
C - 99
- 99 D - 0
- 0 E - 1
B's Proposal
Also being reasonably intelligent , B has got out a small piece of paper and worked out all the above .
To win the vote , all B has to do is to offer D more than he would get if C's proposal was adopted .
Although D would be able to take the lot if A , B and C were to go overboard , D realises that in reality the game would never get that far , as C and E would gang together to make C's proposal win , as stated above .
B can therefore offer D one more coin than he would get if B were thrown overboard , thus allowing B to win with the casting vote .
The winning proposal would therefore be :
B - 99
- 99 C - 0
- 0 D - 1
- 1 E - 0
A's Proposal
At this point , A looks over at B scribbling on his small piece of paper and , with a smug grin , makes the following proposal :
A - 98
- 98 B - 0
- 0 C - 1
- 1 D - 0
- 0 E - 1
Knowing that , if given the chance , D will help B win B's proposal and leave the others with nothing , C and E happily vote for A's proposal , thus allowing A to walk off with the fortune after a democratic vote .
Brilliant , is n't it ?
A Nash Equilibrium
When played with five players who all know what they 're doing , the game has but one possible outcome , in which the most superior of the five takes the majority share .
This is due to the fact that this solution is a Nash equilibrium .
Put simply , this is where no player can benefit from changing their individual strategy while the others keep theirs the same , and so none of the players will do so , thus making the current result inevitable .
In the pirate game the equilibrium is said to be unique as there is only one possible result which leads to the equilibrium .
However , reaching this solution requires a certain set of circumstances :
All the players are rational .
All the players assume that all their adversaries are rational as well .
The players are intelligent enough to realise the solution .
The players all understand the pay out they are competing for and will attempt to maximise their own gains .
The players all carry out their strategies without making mistakes .
Therefore , the game will not necessarily produce the same results in real life , and is at best restricted to a world containing rational beings , which we are generally not .
Making these assumptions about the pirates is necessary for the Nash equilibrium to be reached , as player A requires so - called ' perfect information ' in order to deduce exactly what the others will be thinking .
Perfect information basically describes a situation where each player knows all the relevant facts about the others and can therefore make use of the best strategy possible .
A's strategy is known as the ' best response ' , as it guarantees him the biggest payout possible under the conditions given .
The responses of the other pirates are also best responses , although unfortunately they do not lead to particularly good results .
However , each player makes use of the best strategy available , and that is why we end up with a Nash equilibrium .
More General Nash Equilibria
The availability of perfect information is only necessary for the successful creation of a unique Nash equilibrium such as that in the pirate game - in other games , the conditions for a Nash equilibrium can be much simpler :
When one of the players changes their strategy without any of their opponents altering theirs :
The player who changed their strategy is worse off .
The players who did not change their strategies are not offered a better potential strategy through this change , and will therefore keep their original strategies .
Provided this is the case , the player will realise that they stand to lose out and will change back to their best response strategy .
An example of this can be seen in the Prisoner 's Dilemma , in which both players may either co-operate or betray one another .
While co-operating brings a good reward , if one player co-operates and the other betrays , the second wins a slightly higher prize while the first gets nothing .
However , if both players betray , they end up with only a small payout each .
Since the players do not know exactly what the other player will do , perfect information is not available .
However , a Nash equilibrium exists when both players choose to betray the other .
In this situation , if one player were to change stance while the other player stuck with betraying , the player making the change would lose out , while the other player would stand to gain from sticking to the strategy of betraying .
This means that the game can end up in a deadlock , with neither player daring to cooperate lest they let the other player simply capitalise through continued betrayal .
Both players will therefore continue to accept a minimal payoff , thus proving that rational game strategies are n't always the most sensible .
Mr Chavez is tightening his grip on the oil industry
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has sent troops to take over companies that provide services for the oil industry .
" This is a revolutionary offensive , " he told workers near Lake Maracaibo , Venezuela 's main oil - producing area .
Military vehicles were used as the state oil company seized supply boats and two US - owned gas facilities .
Mr Chavez nationalised Venezuela 's main oil assets two years ago .
The fresh drive comes as falling oil prices put state finances under pressure .
The move places hundreds of boats , several ports and an estimated 8,000 oil workers under state control .
The state - owned oil company PDVSA has recently clashed with foreign and local service providers over the prices they charge .
The service companies are owed billions of dollars by PDVSA .
But the state firm says lower oil prices mean the contractors are being paid too much .
President Chavez has re-invigorated his nationalisation programme since his victory in a February referendum that removed limits on how many times he and others can stand for re-election .
Venezuela has some of the biggest oil reserves in the world and is one of the largest oil exporters in the Americas .

The wonderful Improv Everywhere just posted the report from its 6th MP3 Experiment , where 2,000 people all got together and listened to the same instructional MP3 .
It looked like a crazy amount of fun .

It ’s time to cash in on Catholic guilt .
At least that ’s what some parishioners think is happening at St. Luke ’s Church in Whitestone , Queens , where detailed breakdowns of members ’ weekly donations have begun appearing in the weekly bulletin .
“ I do n’t like it , ” said Pat McGlinckey , 56 .
“ It ’s like they ’re hitting below the belt to get us to give more . ”
“ It just left a bad taste in my mouth , ” said a 20 - year churchgoer who did n’t want to be named .
“ What someone gives is their personal business .
They should n’t be made to feel bad that they ’re on the lower end of the spectrum . ”
Without naming names , the church leaflet two weeks ago began revealing exactly how many parishioners tossed their church - supplied donation envelopes into the collection basket at Sunday Mass – and how much cash was in each envelope .
Last week there were 661 donations totaling $ 8,527 .
One person stuffed an envelope with $ 175 , while 21 parishioners gave only a single buck .
The most popular denomination offered was $ 5 , with 196 donations .
In second place were the $ 10 offerings , at 142 .
The church ’s pastor , the Rev. Monsignor John Tosi , told The Post the new feature was to ensure financial transparency and not to shame parishioners into bigger offerings .
“ The idea was to let them know where our money comes from and where it ’s going , which is important , ” Tosi said .
“ We ’re not embarrassing anybody , we ’re not judging anybody , ” he added .
And if the efforts causes a parishioner to reach deeper into his pockets , “ That ’s not such a bad reaction , is it ? ”
But it ’s other reactions that have some parishioners nervous .
“ I think it will embarrass some people a bit , ” said Fred Peterson , 82 , a parish member since 1951 .
“ Their names are n’t on there , which would be really bad .
But privately , people may be embarrassed . ”
The Brooklyn Diocese could not say if any other churches are using St. Luke ’s public - accounting methods .
A spokesman , Father Kieran Harrington , said many parishes print less detailed financial breakdowns and added that fiscal transparency is encouraged .
At. St. Luke ’s , where monthly church expenses top $ 20,000 , not all parishioners are up in arms .
“ The church has needs , ” said Claudia Morelli , a longtime parishioner .
“ People may have given $ 1 for years and years .
These days , what does a dollar buy you ? ”

There ’s been a lot of attention paid to President Obama ’s upcoming White House Easter egg roll , because he ’s setting aside tickets for gay and lesbian families , said Amy Sullivan in Time online .
But Obama is also making history by becoming the first sitting U.S. president to host , or even attend , a Passover seder .
As for his Christian Holy Week plans , there ’s “ no word yet on where the First Family will celebrate Easter , ” since they ’re still “ church shopping . ”
You ’d think Jews , and “ key Jewish donors , ” would be pleased by this , said Tom Gross in National Review Online , especially after Obama ’s big week in predominantly Muslim Turkey and Iraq .
But “ many in Israel fear that Obama ’s Passover meal may be a stunt designed to soften up Jewish Democrats ” for upcoming clashes with Israel ’s new government .
According to White House sources , this “ impromptu seder , ” with a dozen friends and staffers , has nothing to do with politics , said Hilary Leila Kreiger in The Jerusalem Post , and everything to do with tradition .
A year ago , Obama and most of the invited staff members held a seder during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania .
So he ’s keeping a campaign promise , of sorts , said Carol E. Lee and Amie Parnes in Politico .
After “ the traditional ‘ Next year in Jerusalem ’ refrain ” at last year ’s seder , Obama added , “ Next year in the White House . ”
The seder will have “ all the Passover fixings , ” but not two of Obama ’s most prominent Jewish aides — Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and chief strategist David Axelrod will spend Passover with their families .
The new Mini 10 v netbook that Dell launched last week will get more capabilities over the year ahead , including what the company is calling " wireless improvements . "
However , although " Linux enthusiasts " might wish otherwise , an upgrade from the currently supported Ubuntu Linux 8.04 to the newer 8.10 or 9.04 wo n't be happening yet .
A later release of Ubuntu is n't in the best interests of " mainstream users , " according to an e-mail from Dell to Betanews last night .
The official word from Dell is that there are two main reasons for sticking with Canonical 's Ubuntu 8.04 -- for the time being , anyway -- in the Linux editions of its Inspiron netbooks , a line - up also available with Microsoft 's Windows XP .
As Betanews reported last week , one of Dell 's other Inspiron netbooks -- the Mini 10 ( without the " v " ) -- is now being groomed to act as a subsidized mass market offering from an as yet unnamed wireless carrier .

" We are trying to stay on a 12 - month cadence to keep costs down , and build a stable platform , " a Dell spokesperson said in an e-mail to Betanews late last night .
" A mainstream user does not care if it 's [ Ubuntu Linux ] 8.04 or 8.10 or 9.04 ( he / she does not know what those are ) -- she just wants it to work right and be stable / safe ... Most of the Linux enthusiasts would not like to be so far behind ( i.e. , 8.04 vs. 9.04 ) , but they are not our primary target audience for the [ operating system ] image . "
Also ,
Dell does n't seem about ready to stray away from Ubuntu as its Linux platform for netbooks or any other consumer products .
" We have offered Ubuntu pre-installed on our consumer systems for two years now , based on customer feedback on Ideastorm .
Canonical has been enthusiastic about working with us to deliver a rock - solid Linux experience for the general non-technical community , and we look forward to continuing this dedicated team effort going forward , " Betanews was told .
Meanwhile , Dell has already added a network manager feature to the Mini 10 and 10v which is aimed at bringing the sort of 3G wireless connectivity that 's built into Ubuntu 8.10 .
" That should support whatever 3G cards are now supported in stock Ubuntu , " according to the e-mail .
" In addition to 8.04 , we chose to control our updates ( via our own update repository -- similar to MS update ) .
We go the extra mile in double qualifying all updates ( that one would see in stock 8.10 and 9.04 ) and only publish those that are rock - stable .
We will [ put in ] select features over the course of the year that make sense for the product , like wireless improvements , " according to Dell spokespersons .
Yet seemingly , the availability of Dell netbooks still varies considerably from one country to another , as does the availability of various operating systems aboard the systems .
A check by Betanews of Dell 's country - specific sites this morning turned up the fact that some sites -- for the UK and Australia , for example -- have also been marketing another netbook , the Atom - based Latitude 2100 , with a choice of Ubuntu 8.10 , Vista , or an XP downgrade .
The " smart rubberized 10.1 - inch netbook " is a tad weighiter than the Mini 10 -- 2.91 lbs. rather than 2.86 lbs. -- and also a little pricier .
You can also buy a Mini 10 or Mini 9 from the UK site , but at this point , only with Windows XP .
In Spain , on the other hand , the advertised Dell netbook choices are limited to the Mini 9 , also with XP ; and in Venezuela , to the Mini 10 with XP .
In the US as in the UK , though , Dell is launching the new Mini 10v on Ubuntu 8.04 and Windows XP simultaneously , according to the officials , who did n't delve into specific plans for the Mini 10 v in other countries .
Dell also plans Ubuntu 8.04 availability on the Mini 10 soon for the UK , and the Ubuntu option is already in full swing in the US , Betanews was told .
" Our goal is to provide choice and while we may not have been able to launch Windows and Ubuntu simultaneously on all of our mini platforms , we have offered [ it ] when it was ready , " according to the company .
" It 's very important for us to make the Linux experience as simple and seamless as possible for mainstream users vs. ' Linux enthusiasts . ' "
In one of RIAA 's high profile cases the Free Software Foundation backed defendant Joel Tenenbaum , much to the dislike of the music industry lobby .
John Sullivan , Operations Manager at the FSF explains in a guest post why they think these cases impact not just music , but also free software and its technology .
Guest post by John Sullivan Operations Manager , FSF
We do n’t make ( much ) music here at the Free Software Foundation , so it ’s natural for people to wonder why the FSF has been standing up for individuals targeted by lawsuits launched by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .
Most recently we filed an * amicus curiae * brief in the case of * Sony BMG Music Entertainment , et al. v. Joel Tenenbaum * showing the RIAA ’s theory of statutory damage awards to be unconstitutional .
Some would prefer that we refrain from fighting these lawsuits , suggesting that they are a distraction from the FSF ’s core charter .
But opposing them is actually an important part of our mission to support free software .
First , these lawsuits represent a concerted attempt to rewrite copyright law in a way that threatens to undermine the ultimate goals of the free software movement .
Second , a vocal minority in the entertainment industry uses these lawsuits as warrants to justify DRM technology and other measures to monitor and control the flow of information over the internet .
Third , if unopposed , these lawsuits create a culture in which people are afraid to share , presuming sharing to be theft .
In their response to our brief , the RIAA says , “ The FSF is not a neutral friend of the Court .
Rather , FSF is an organization dedicated to eliminating restrictions on copying , redistribution , and modifying computer programs , classic intellectual property , much like the sound recordings at issue in this case [ * sic * ] . ”
It ’s unclear what legal aim the RIAA lawyers from the firms of Holme Roberts & Owen and Dwyer & Collora think they are accomplishing with this attack .
Having an interest in the outcome of a case is the reason organizations file such briefs .
William Rehnquist defined * amicus curiae * as , “ a phrase that literally means ‘ friend of the court ’ — someone who is not a party to the litigation , but who believes that the court ’s decision may affect its interest . ”
But here , it is the public ’s interest that we are defending , not our own .
While we do n’t agree — as the RIAA claims — that we are more “ virulent ” than an organization that intimidates everyone from the elderly to college students to the severely disabled into either paying “ settlement ” money or facing the crushing expenses of defending against unwarranted prosecution in faraway jurisdictions , the RIAA is correct that the FSF does have a position on copyright .
Although we are primarily concerned not with music , but with how software can be made and shared so as to benefit and empower everyone , neither are the impacts of the RIAA ’s actions restricted to the distribution of music .
Their lawsuits are a deliberate campaign to rewrite copyright law through the courts .
They are attempting to set precedents which will affect all works governed by copyright law , including software .
The RIAA , which in its litigation campaign represents exclusively EMI , Sony Music Entertainment , Universal Music Group , Warner Music Group , and their affiliates , would like to change copyright to be an ordinary physical property right .
Through these lawsuits , they seek to establish near exclusive permanent control over each and every use of the recordings their members distribute , expanding the power of copyright owners to include things which are not part of the existing body of law , and extracting financial penalties from the largely defenseless individuals accused of disobeying them .
But copyright is not and was not intended to be a right like this .
In fact , copyright requires that the public give up some of its rights , such as to free speech and free association , in order to promote another of its fundamental interests — progress in the sciences and useful arts .
In “ Misinterpreting Copyright , ” FSF president Richard Stallman draws an analogy between this tradeoff and government procurement .
When doing any kind of purchasing necessary to do the public ’s work , the government seeks ( if imperfectly ) to minimize the amount of taxpayer money spent to obtain the needed goods .
This means paying a price that suppliers will find acceptable , while avoiding being gouged by those suppliers who may claim that the goods are worth a lot more than they really are .
When the U.S. Navy was accused of paying Lockheed $ 640 per toilet seat for some of its aircraft , people were understandably outraged , because the government had squandered the public ’s money .
In the case of copyright , it ’s the public ’s freedom that the government is spending , to obtain in return for the public scientific and cultural goods .
Right now , governments are squandering this freedom .
They are spending far too much and getting far too little in return .
Plenty of authors and artists are telling the government that works can and will be made without such expenditure .
The international free software movement has been proving this for many years now , having successfully produced a fully functional operating system in GNU / Linux that can be freely used , shared and improved upon by anyone who wants to do so ; and more recently there have been people doing similar things in encyclopedias , textbooks , and the world of the arts ( including music ) .
Previously , because the required equipment was large and expensive , normal readers and listeners did not have the means to easily make copies .
Restrictive copyright did not negatively affect them .
But now , because so many more people do have the ability to easily exercise this freedom , the burden imposed by copyright restrictions on our society has become unacceptably heavy .
Even while these restrictions have become more burdensome , they have become less necessary — with the cost of publishing so much lower now , less incentive is required .
Instead of acknowledging this , the government has been taking the side of those who , out of greed akin to selling us $ 640 toilet seats , see an opportunity to freeze what should be a contingent and evolving bargain into a permanent and natural right for themselves , expanding ownership powers under copyright law far beyond its current and historical borders .
In the U.S. , the new administration continues to side against the public .
Vice President Joe Biden recently spoke at a MPAA luncheon .
He adopted the entertainment industry ’s loaded “ piracy ” language , saying , “ It ’s pure theft . ”
Biden also assured the MPAA that President Obama would find the “ right ” copyright czar .
His attitude is not surprising , given his past eagerness as a senator to sponsor and support RIAA - backed legislation .
He was , after all , one of four U.S. senators invited to a champagne celebration of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) hosted by the MPAA , RIAA , and the Business Software Alliance .
Obama himself has already appointed Tom Perrelli and Donald Verrilli , both former lead attorneys for the RIAA , to be associate and deputy associate attorney general .
If we are going to achieve sane copyright law , we have to avoid confusing this institutionalization of corporate greed with “ art . ”
In fact , it seems most artists disagree with the RIAA .
Sony artists reportedly earn a tiny $ 0.045 for each song sold on iTunes , and most of them will never receive even that much from Sony .
As one example among many , singer Courtney Love answers the charge of piracy by saying : “ What is piracy ?
Piracy is the act of stealing an artist ’s work without any intention of paying for it .
I ’m not talking about Napster - type software .
I ’m talking about major label recording contracts . ”
The RIAA does n’t stop at manipulating copyright law to gouge artists and the public .
They also use their lawsuits as leverage to argue for control over any technology that could be used to distribute music .
For example , they have pushed to require all wireless access points to be encrypted and closed , to restrict technologies like BitTorrent and other forms of peer - to - peer distribution , to impose bandwidth caps on home internet users , and to monitor traffic through service providers .
Such efforts directly hurt free software .
Because free software authors around the world work by collaboration , they rely on open distribution networks to move software , data , and conversation around .
In particular , peer - to - peer technologies make this easier and cheaper for people with less bandwidth , and so are a powerful means of boosting grassroots free software distribution and development efforts .
The RIAA further attacks free software when they use these filesharing cases as ammunition to advocate DRM under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
It was the RIAA that attacked Princeton scientist Ed Felten for wanting to publish useful mathematical information , because this generally useful information might possibly be used to decrypt their specific DRM scheme .
Sony saw no problem with secretly installing a rootkit on users ’ computers , to facilitate spying on them and blocking certain activities .
These efforts to turn computers against their users and to restrict technical information are on - face incompatible with free software .
If we allow the RIAA to win outrageous damages in these lawsuits , then we are letting them manufacture evidence of losses due to illegal copying , which they will then use to demand from Congress more control over our technology .
Among both the government and the public , the RIAA lawsuits create a culture which frames these issues in terms that make it harder for free software to succeed , by creating a culture that fears sharing .
This leads to confusion like the recent case of a schoolteacher who assumed that a student handing out GNU / Linux discs in class was breaking the law .
One can hardly blame her for having this impression when the RIAA lawsuits and propaganda thoroughly permeate the news media , encouraging everyone to assume that sharing is wrong unless they are told otherwise .
The RIAA ’s framing of the issue as “ intellectual property ” is another key way they foster this fear .
They cite our opposition to this concept in their reply to our brief , and they are correct .
The use of “ intellectual property ” language threatens to undermine the free software movement .
The term lumps together disparate concepts like copyright , patents , and trademarks , which are legally distinct .
The RIAA would like to lump them together because doing so increases the size of the gouge they can extract .
By drawing an analogy with physical property , they erase the actual histories behind these specific areas of law and rationalize the obscene damages they are demanding .
It skews discussion of the issues involved so that good solutions ca n’t be found , and if it is used in place of a clear discussion about copyright in the arena of music then people will accept it when discussing software as well .
The bottom line is that for art and software alike , sane copyright law should facilitate and promote sharing so that everyone can benefit from what is produced , and participate meaningfully in making it .
For software , the easiest way to share is to put source code in the public domain , and not require any End User Licensing Agreement ( EULA ) or patent licenses .
Anyone can then study and use the software , make changes to it , and redistribute changed versions to anyone they want .
However , this leaves the door open for other people to use copyright law to make some changes to that software and strip away the freedom , redistributing their version without the freedoms that were originally there .
Copyright law allows people to play middleman like this , intercepting works that are intended to be free and turning them into proprietary programs to control users .
To ensure that software written to be free remains free , the FSF uses a copyright license called the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
The GPL says that anyone is free to use , copy , change , and distribute modified versions of the software to which it is attached — as long as they pass on those same freedoms to whomever else they give the software .
The GPL can do this because copyright law gives copyright holders the authority to outline those terms .
Instead of using that authority to make copying illegal , the FSF uses that authority to make it illegal to make copying illegal .
Despite this , the FSF will continue working to reduce the power of copyright restrictions by fighting these lawsuits , filing briefs in specific cases , and collecting contributions to the RIAA Expert Witness Fund .
We do not intend to shoot ourselves in the foot by supporting proposals to reduce the scope of copyright that would weaken the way the GPL protects freedom without simultaneously weakening the way companies like Microsoft and Apple use it as a weapon to take away freedom .
But neither will we support the RIAA ’s expansive approach to empowering copyright owners at the public ’s expense on the grounds that it would make the GPL “ stronger . ”
We will not accept losing the GPL as an effective shield unless as part of a plan that we could be confident would make software generally free .
But neither will we confuse it with the end goal , which is a world where people are not called criminals when they want to see what the software on their computer is actually doing , or to share a copy with their neighbors , or to improve it and share their improvements .
Executives like Rolf Schmidt - Holtz of Sony Music Entertainment should get the message and back off .
Although they claimed in December that they would stop filing lawsuits against individuals , the RIAA filed 62 more in the month of April alone .
Citizens are tired of watching their governments squander their freedom to enrich this handful of corporations , and they are tired of being intimidated .
We will continue our work to support this opposition to the War on Sharing , and to restore or replace copyright law for its intended purpose — progress in science and the arts , for everyone .

The name Franklyn D. Roosevelt is one that rings a bell among Americans .
To many , he was one of the greatest presidents to ever lead the greatest nation on earth .
He came from the Roosevelt family which was very wealthy .
His intervention during the great depression was to help people to believe that only the government could offer such .
People believe that FDR was one of the most important presidents in the first part of the 20th century and some believe he was the most important .
FDR holds a unique record of serving three full terms in office while he got elected for a fourth .
He came in as president at a time when the economy was nothing to write home about .
He is also on record to have to lead the country into war at a time when it was not prepared for such .
Was FDR a good president ?
FDR was one of the best presidents America ever produced .
This belief was about his cult following rather than the policies he enacted and implemented .
Roosevelt came into office in the year 1933 at a time when America was battling with the great depression .
His policies were to assist the nation ’s economy to recover fast .
Many of these policies got viewed as anti-constitution and as such , they got struck out .
In a big to push through these policies , Roosevelt packed the Supreme Court bench with people he felt would be more sympathetic to his cause .
This move ended a failure .
He was a rather charismatic leader who chaperoned America through the dangerous depression and the war .
He was not without his flaws though .
FDR : The Road To Greatness
Franklin D. Roosevelt was serving his second term as the governor of the state of New York when the mantle of leadership fell on him as the president of America .
He got elected as the 32nd president of America back in 1932 .
This was at a time when the country was deep in a mess .
America was grappling with the great depression among other issues .
He soon took steps aimed at restoring public confidence by declaring a holiday and addressing the public through a series of media .
He got re-elected with wide margins in 1936 , 1940 and 1944 .
He was the man in charge when America routed Germany and its allies in the Second World War .
He was at the forefront in the alliance with the British and Soviet Union which lead to the creation of the United Nations .
He is on record the only American president elected a record four times .
What Was His Early Life Like ?
FDR was born on the 30th of January 1882 in New York as the only child of very rich parents James and Sara D Roosevelt .
He received his education through the help of private tutors and elite institutions .
He grew up admiring his cousin Theodore Roosevelt who got elected as the president of the United States in 1901 .
He got married to Eleanor Roosevelt who was his distant cousin in 1905 and they had a daughter and five sons .
FDR got credited with encouraging him to appoint more women in federal positions .
It is also believed that she was the brain behind the appointment of more black people in federal positions .
FDR graduated from the Colombia Law School and served several years as a clerk in one of the top firms in Wall Street .
The year 1910 saw his entrance into the world of politics with a state senate seat in a Republican - dominated district .
This was even though he was a Democratic candidate .
The year 1913 , saw the then - president Woodrow Wilson appointed as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy .
He held this position for about 7 years with trips to Europe during the First World War .
How Did FDR Become President ?
Coming on the back of his re-election as the governor of New - York in 1930 , FDR became the front - line aspirant for the Democratic ticket for president .
He went to Chicago to accept the nomination by himself thus breaking a long - standing tradition .
In the general elections , FDR defeated his opponent who was the incumbent president by a wide margin .
This may have been the result of the people towards Hoover who was a symbol of the great depression .
By the time he was sworn in as president , the country was at a point where the depression had lead to 13 million unemployed people .
He began his reign as president by ordering the closure of banks for several days in a bid to force Congress to pass the needed reforms .
What Was Roosevelt ’s Style Of Leadership ?
Roosevelt enjoyed cult - like follower - ship while he was the president of America .
During his early days as president , he began holding press conferences while also addressing the people on the radio .
His first broadcast on radio saw over 60 million people glued to the radio .
This singular act went on to increase the confidence levels of the American people and as such prevented a collapse of the banking sector .
By the time the Emergency Banking Relief
Act got passed , 70 percent of the banks got re-opened within a week .
What Role Did FDR Play In The Second World War ?
FDR had made known his views about the hard - line regimes that existed in Japan , Germany , and Italy as far back as 1937 .
At the break - out of the Second World War , he called for a special session with Congress to review the neutrality stance of the country on international matters .
This saw the country selling arms to France and Britain .
The end of June 1940 saw France captured by Germany and this made Roosevelt convince Congress to give more support to the U.K .
His support for Britain saw him pass the Lend - Lease - Act in 1941 and this saw him meeting Winston Churchill on a battleship .
It was in this meeting that the four freedoms upon which the new world would get founded got created .
These Freedoms included the freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom and from fear and freedom from want .
On the day after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor , Roosevelt came before a joint session of Congress and made a declaration of war against Japan .
He was at the forefront of the war with his constant moves to form strong alliances with the leaders of Britain and the Soviet Union .
Fun Facts About Franklin D. Roosevelt
Aside from being one of the best presidents America ever had , several fun facts make him rather interesting .
1 . He had no love for the law
Upon graduation from Harvard , FDR proceeded to the Columbia Law School .
There he failed at civil procedure and contracts , and this made him take up classes during the summer .
It is on record that he did n’t even wait to get his degree .
He soon landed a job with Carter Ledyard and Milburn via family connections .
He never quite made a mark at the law firm as he instead took up a strong interest in politics .
His family origins soon got him a connection to democratic leaders and it was these leaders that supported his move to become a state Senator .
2 . He remains the longest - serving president
Except for a constitutional amendment that occurs , FDR remains the longest - serving president in American History .
The 22nd Amendment made sure that no one apart from him could run for more than 2 terms of four years .
3 . He was relative to his wife
As stated earlier , Roosevelt was an only child that had roots that were traceable to the Mayflower .
He spent his early days in New York before he attended one of the best boarding schools in Massachusetts .
He later went on to Harvard where he started dating the elegant Anna who was also a Roosevelt .
She was his fifth cousin who was also the niece to his fifth cousin who was then the American president .
It was Theodore that gave Eleanor away instead of her late father .
4 . He approved the imprisonment of Japanese - Americans
The Anti-Japanese era was at its peak soon after the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Habor .
In a state like California for instance , the Governor and other officials demanded the removal of the Japanese from among them .
This was to avert any future case of espionage .
In 1942 , Roosevelt signed an executive order that detailed the places some categories of people could get excluded .
This saw many Japanese moved to various camps and their properties sold .
5 . He was the first president on a plane
During a time when traveling by air was risky .
Roosevelt took a flight to Chicago to accept his nomination as the Democratic presidential flag bearer .
He was also the first president to leave the country during a time of war .
Final Word
FDR was n’t without his failings , but he was a president who sought to effect positive changes during a rather complicated time .
His efforts during the great depression and the World War earned him a place in the history books as one of the greatest presidents to ever rule America .
One of her former teachers said , " She was very popular .
I remember she had a bizarre sense of humour .
She was very bright ... she always got As and Bs . "

[ Attention conservation notice : Skip to the “ Post - Mortem ” for the real point of this post ; the prelude is mostly for entertainment value and may be interesting to renters renegotiating their rent after the housing crash . ]
When rent prices plummeted throughout New York City , we were a little galled to see a small increase in rent on our renewal lease .
Were our landlords hoping we were n’t paying attention ?
If we moved out they ’d have to accept , by our estimates , two or three hundred less in rent and / or miss multiple months of rent altogether .
We made this clear to our landlords , as well as conveying how willing we were to move if we did n’t get fair rent .
But this was apparently cheap talk to them .
They were looking at the other side of the coin : to get a couple hundred dollars off our rent we ’d have to go to the trouble of moving .
So negotiations ensued .
Now to be clear , actually moving made little sense .
It was an expensive and annoying proposition for both us and our landlords .
And there was no reason we would n’t be willing to pay at least a bit more for our apartment than whoever our landlords would replace us with .
In fact , if our original renewal lease had offered even a small decrease there ’s little doubt we ’d have just signed it .
The elaborate negotiations amounted to a game of chicken where swerving was “ fine , here ’s your inflated rent ” or “ fine , we ’ll take your stingy rent ” .
Neither of us swerving would mean moving out .
Of course to make that threat credible we had to actually start looking at other places , which we did .
And it was quite a buyers ’ market .
Tons of vacancies , great deals , and the notorious brokers ’ fees were usually being covered by the landlords .
We also talked to our neighbors in our building , to compare rents ( why do n’t people do this more often ? ) , and found out some of the slimy , duplicitous tactics of our landlords .
The more we learned the less of a bluff our bluff was .
We were quite willing to move unless our landlords offered us something close to fair market price .
We told this to our landlords , who offered a reduction of $ 82 / month , and a one - time $ 100 gift certificate as a bonus .
Insulting !
But just to be quite certain what fair market price was , we enlisted our friends , David and Grace , who happened to be apartment hunting .
They called our landlords and were referred to a slick , high - pressure broker who , well , would n’t quote them a price for our apartment .
I took over at that point , posing as David ( speaking of duplicity , but it was with David ’s permission ) in a long series of phone calls and emails before getting this broker to even name a price range .
And sure enough — consistent with other buildings we looked at , and our neighbors in our building who moved in since the housing crash — it was a couple hundred dollars below the lowest price we as existing tenants ( perfect ones , let there be no doubt ! ) would ever get from our landlords .
So we knew what kind of rent they should be willing to accept from us , but how to get them to do so ?
We did have one card up our sleeve .
As the negotiations progressed , with the end of our lease less than two weeks away , the landlords threatened us with what they did ( in that case without warning ) to our neighbors :
If we did n’t sign a renewal lease by the first of the month our rent would go up to the legal limit ( literally double in our case ) .
It was time to put our last card on the table , in the form of counter - offer to their $ 82 / month reduction : A $ 200 reduction and as a bonus we ’d tone down the first google hit on their name .
This got their attention .
According to our access logs , they googled themselves several times that day .
But they did n’t let on and they made no move to swerve from their hard line .
And neither did we .
We were headed for a grizzly collision .
It was now within a week of the end of our lease , and we had n’t started packing .
Perhaps our landlords were observing that and thought they had us right where they wanted us .
In fact , we were lining up professional movers and signing a new lease at a building down the block .
With two days before our lease ended , the movers swooped in and we left the keys in the empty apartment the next day .
Post - Mortem
I said that actually moving made little sense , costing both us and our landlords a lot of time and money .
So why did it happen and could we or should we have avoided it ?
First , were we irrational ?
Not at all !
Our new apartment is a much better deal and I think we did everything we could to get a fair price from our landlords .
At our old landlords ’ best offer , we preferred our new place .
So were our landlords irrational ?
Surprisingly , no .
Their strategy , as much as it gets my goat , is sound .
They ’re engaging in a simple form of price discrimination . [ 1 ]
Landlords have an extremely simple price discrimination litmus test :
Do you already live there ?
Then you ’re probably willing to pay a juicy premium to stay there .
Other apartments may offer more for the money but they all have the distinct disadvantage of not having all your stuff in them .
Our landlords exploited this ruthlessly .
Sure , it cost them plenty in our case but as a blanket policy it probably does well .
And making exceptions is dangerous , since tenants may talk to each other .
So everyone follows rational strategies and the result is a lot of needless apartment switching ?
Surely there ’s a better way !
Consider the fundamental situation : A seller ( the landlords ) selling something ( an apartment lease ) to a buyer ( us ) .
And , importantly , the most the buyer is willing to pay and the least the seller is willing to accept are private values , much as they loudly insist that they can’t possibly yield another penny .
What could we do besides verbal haggling in situations like that ?
Lots of things , it turns out .
You could have a sealed - bid auction where the buyer and seller both write down their final offers and the deal happens if and only if the offers overlap ( the buyer ’s number is higher than the seller ’s ) in which case the final price is the average of the two .
This works fine but you ’d be well - advised not to write down your true maximum as a buyer or minimum as a seller .
And with both parties strategizing like that , there will be times when their true values overlap but the numbers they write down do n’t .
That is , this mechanism will sometimes say “ no deal ” even when there was a price everyone would ’ve been happy to make the deal at .
An even simpler mechanism is the one most of us are most used to : the seller picks a single price and the buyer takes it or leaves it .
Here it ’s especially easy to see the problem : the seller wo n’t name their true rock bottom price .
That means for any buyer with a maximum willingness to pay between the seller ’s secret rock bottom and the posted price , the deal wo n’t happen .
How about a more complicated mechanism with iterative bidding or proxy bidders that bid optimally on your behalf ?
Alas , this is the real tragedy : Nothing will work .
No possible mechanism can prevent tenants from sometimes moving out , even when there ’s a price that would make both parties prefer the tenants to stay .
In other words , try as we might to find a mutually agreeable price , there ’s no guarantee we ’ll succeed , even when such a price exists !
The Impossibility of Avoiding Grizzly Collisions ( Myerson - Satterthwaite )
There ’s a famous result in economics called the Coase Theorem that says that when people are free to bargain with each other , the efficient ( welfare maximizing ) thing will happen .
But it assumes all the information is public : the tenants know exactly what the landlords will accept ( as we thought we did but were obviously wrong ) and vice versa .
When no one can be sure if the buyer ’s and the seller ’s values overlap ( including the buyer and seller themselves ) [ 2 ] then a different theorem kicks in : the Myerson - Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem .
It states that there are three important properties [ 3 ] that you just ca n’t have all at once :
1 . No subsidies .
You can burn money but you ca n’t conjure it . [ 4 ]
2. No coercion ( forced participation ) .
Neither buyer nor seller , knowing their own valuation , would prefer to opt out of the mechanism altogether . [ 5 ]
3. Efficiency ( welfare maximization ) .
The seller sells the item to the buyer if and only if the buyer values it more than the seller does .
The last property — technically known as ex post efficiency — is key .
It means you do n’t have buyer and seller playing chicken with each other , calling bluffs that are n’t bluffs , and ending up colliding — failing to make the trade when it was in everyone ’s best interest to do so .
But , tragically , since the first two properties are n’t exactly negotiable , it ’s efficiency that has to give .
And that ’s what we told our two - year - old when she asked why we had to move .

Footnotes
[ 1 ] Price discrimination means charging more to people who are willing to pay more .
The trick is that people who are willing to pay more do n’t freely admit this .
Airlines manage to discriminate by charging more if your trip does n’t span a Saturday ( since that means it ’s likely a business trip and business travelers tend to be willing to pay more ) .
Grocery stores do it with coupons ( by your willingness to cut out coupons you reveal yourself to be more price sensitive ) .
Companies often discriminate by offering two tiers of service ( like Windows Professional Edition vs Windows Home Edition , or whatever ) .
Student / senior discounts are another classic form of price discrimination ( the assumption being that students and seniors tend to be more price sensitive ) .
[ 2 ] Technically stated , we assume that the seller ’s valuation distribution is nonzero on some closed interval , as is the buyer ’s , and these intervals have a non-empty intersection .
We also assume that these distributions are independent .
Additionally , there are two standard assumptions about the buyer and seller : Risk - neutrality and quasilinear utility .
[ 3 ]
A common misconception is that one of the properties is incentive compatibility .
Myerson and Satterthwaite fuel this misconception in their own statement of the result : “ If [ assumptions ] then no incentive - compatible individually rational trading mechanism can be ex post efficient . ”
In fact , by the Revelation Principle , ( Bayes - Nash ) incentive compatibility is without loss of generality .
In other words , even without imposing incentive compatibility , you ca n’t simultaneously achieve weak budget balance , individual rationality , and ex post efficiency .
[ 4 ]
The technical term for this is weak budget balance .
It ’s probably a must - have mechanism property but if you did have a generous benefactor , here ’s what you ’d do :
The buyer and seller each write down their bids .
If they do n’t overlap then no deal ( which is good since that means the seller values it more than the buyer , if they both told the truth which it turns out they ’ll want to ) .
If they do overlap ( the buyer ’s bid is higher ) then the buyer pays the seller ’s bid and the seller receives the buyer ’s bid .
Of course that means the seller is getting paid more than buyer is paying , and it ’s that generous benefactor that makes up the difference .
The buyer now wants to say a number so high that any higher and they ’d rather not buy the item .
( Why not ?
The price does n’t depend on their own bid . )
And it ’s the same for the seller , who wants to name the truly rock bottom price they could possibly accept .
Everyone ’s happy ( except the benefactor ) and the deal happens exactly when it should .
This is an application of the Vickrey - Clark - Groves mechanism .
[ 5 ]
The technical term for this property is interim individual rationality .
What could you do if you were willing to broker a deal at gunpoint ?
Remember , we ’re still trying to maximize welfare so we do n’t want to just say “ Hey , Seller , cough it up or else ! ”
Instead we can just extract a fee from either or both of them before participating .
Once we have that we can use the VCG trick without needing a “ generous benefactor ” ( see previous footnote ) .
The catch is that the fee would have to be so high that a rational agent would rather not play , hence the need for the gun .
So this property is probably a must - have as well .

The Housewives are coming back !
Who ca n’t get enough of the Real Housewives of New York ?
ME ! that ’s who !
I mean , that reunion show was painful , but I loved most of Season 2 .
The news is ….
That the ladies ( and Kelly ) will be back !
Not only are they ALL coming back for Season 3 and for a hefty sum .
“ All of the wives are expected back , and their paycheck is upwards of $ 30,000 per episode , ” said the source .
The sticking point appears to be the men .
“ The husbands get nothing , but they ’re part of the show , ” said the source .
“ Ramona ( Singer ’s ) husband is definitely part of the effort to get something . ”
We all knew that Ramona ’s diva wandering eye husband wanted to be a star , he should just sit down , and keep his mouth shut .
He ’s making a fool of himself .
I ’m just sayin’ .
You know what that means ?
More product placements , crazy eyes , and Kelly ’s misunderstanding of space and time .
What are you looking forward to seeing with the RHWONY .

HTTP PubSub : Webhooks & PubSubHubbub
With all the recent buzz about real - time web , surely this is the year XMPP / AMQP Publish - Subscribe ( PubSub ) makes it to the big leagues !
Or maybe not .
Ejabberd ( XMPP ) , RabbitMQ ( AMQP ) and other pubsub server implementations have come a long way but they remain cumbersome to setup and maintain , and perhaps more importantly , the clients require special libraries and a steep learning curve .
That is not to say that either XMPP or AMQP are doomed for failure , in fact , they will continue to thrive , but there is a great case for a simplified PubSub implementation to cover the ad - hoc cases where a dedicated TCP channel might be an overkill : enter Webhooks .
The best part about Webhooks is that most of us are already familiar with them : callbacks over HTTP .
Pioneered by PayPal and Subversion as a way to send real - time notifications to the client , they have found their way into many dozens of products we all use every day .
Need pre or post commit hooks for your SVN or Git repository ?
Both GitHub and SVN support HTTP callbacks .
Need a payment alert from PayPal , or an alert when a wiki page is modified ?
There are webhooks for that too .
This simple mechanism allows us to build web services that work together via a simple and ubiquitous protocol we can all understand : HTTP !
Working with Webhooks
A good way to think about webhooks is as Unix pipes for the web .
While PubSub is a great application of the technology , Webhooks allow bidirectional communication , which opens up our possibilities to : publishing notifications , chaining web services to perform complex actions , or allowing external plugins to enter the workflow .
All of this functionality is accomplished via simple HTTP queries ( both POST and GET ) , which means no special libraries or servers to make it all happen .
In fact , building your own Webhooks powered PubSub server takes less than a hundred lines with the help of Sinatra , as demonstrated by the Julio Capote and his watercoolr project on GitHub .
To see it in action , we can use PostBin as our mock recipient :
$ ruby postbin.rb http://www.postbin.org/1987c4m # creating channel ... # adding subscriber to channel sej7u7 # { " status " : " OK " } # Post message : Hello Webhooks PubSub ! # { " status " : " OK " }
In this scenario , our local watercoolr service acts as a PubSub server , accepting requests to create custom channels , maintaining a subscriber list , and pushing out notifications when an update arrives at the channel .
Best of all , interacting with the server is as simple as writing a RESTful client :
require " rubygems " require " rest_client " require " json " puts " creating channel ... " resp = RestClient . post " http://localhost:4567/channels " , : data => " " id = JSON . parse ( resp ) [ " id " ] puts " adding subscriber to channel #{ id } " resp = RestClient .
post " http://localhost:4567/subscribers " , { : data => { : channel => id , :url => ARGV [ 0 ] } . to_json } loop do print " Post message : " msg = STDIN . gets .
chomp resp = RestClient . post " http://localhost:4567/messages " , { : data => { : channel => id , : message => msg } .
to_json } puts resp end
PubSubHubbub Spec : Auth , Discovery & Protocol Implementation
Brad Fitzpatrick of Livejournal fame and Brett Slatkin , both of whom are currently at Google drafted a PubSubHubbub spec for a “ simple web - scale pubsub protocol ” which preserves the spirit of HTTP webhooks but adds a much needed layer of basic security , discovery , and coherent protocol definition :
We offer this spec in hopes that it fills a need or at least advances the state of the discussion in the pubsub space .
Polling sucks .
We think a decentralized pubsub layer is a fundamental , missing layer in the Internet architecture today and its existence , more than just enabling the obvious lower latency feed readers , would enable many cool applications , most of which we can't even imagine .
But we 're looking forward to decentralized social networking .
The google code project also provides an AppEngine implementation with a public hub , which we can test via an asynchronous ( EventMachine based ) PubSubHubbub Ruby library :
require " rubygems " require " pubsubhubbub " EventMachine .
run { # publish single URL pub = EventMachine :: PubSubHubbub . new ( ' http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/publish' ) . publish " http://www.test.com/ " pub .
callback { puts " Successfully notified hub . " } pub .
errback { puts " Uh oh , something broke : #{ pub .
response } " } # publish multiple URL's to hub feeds = [ " http://www.test.com " , " http://www.test.com/2 " ] pub = EventMachine :: PubSubHubbub . new ( ' http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/publish' ) . publish feeds pub .
callback { puts " Successfully notified hub . " } pub .
errback { puts " Uh oh , something broke : #{ pub .
response } " } }
PubSubHubbub.git - Asynchronous PubSubHubbub Ruby Client
Webhooks & PubSubHubbub
Of course , neither Webhooks nor PubSubHubbub are the answer to every problem .
Both XMPP and AMQP will continue to exist alongside , but chances are , will take on the brunt of high - velocity feeds while Webhooks can happily power the remaining 90 % of the simpler use - cases .
In fact , there is already a RabbitMQ PubSubHubbub hub server implemenation in the works !

A prominent Israeli peace activist is expected to be sentenced to several months in jail tomorrow in a high - profile prosecution which began after he tried to stop the demolition of Palestinian homes near a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank .
Although activists who challenge the Israeli occupation are often arrested or detained for short periods , Ezra Nawi , a plumber from Jerusalem , is expecting a sentence of up to 18 months .
He said he would lodge an immediate appeal , which may keep him out of prison initially , but it is likely he will be jailed within weeks .
In March he was convicted by a judge at a Jerusalem court of taking part in a riot and assaulting a police officer , charges he denies .
The incident happened when the Israeli military sent bulldozers to demolish Palestinian shacks near the settlement of Carmel , close to Hebron , in February 2007 .
Nawi , who is in his 50s , has worked with vulnerable Palestinian families in the hills around Hebron for at least eight years .
But he is an unusual figure , even among Israel 's shrinking circle of leftwing activists .
Born to a Jewish Iraqi family from Basra , he speaks Arabic and lives on the modest earnings of his plumbing work , not a typical story for leftwing activists .
Instead , he said , most Israelis from his Middle Eastern background have strong rightwing views and often serve in the border police force that arrested him in the first place .
He is also gay and has frequently faced homophobic taunts from Israeli police , soldiers and settlers in Hebron who , by now , are used to his regular presence in the area .
He is motivated , he says , by a will to resist the " dehumanisation " of the Palestinians .
" I have seen the checkpoints , the barriers .
I 've seen everything with my own eyes and I think any decent person cannot sit indifferent to this .
It is beyond the issue of Jews and Arabs , " he said .
" Here everybody sees it , but not everybody refers to it … the settlement is a few metres from them on their land , and they are in heartbreaking poverty , and then the police come to demolish the house , and this is legal ?
It 's beyond politics . "
His trial has sparked a broad campaign of support from academics , musicians and artists .
" You have here the whole misery and cruelty of the occupation in a nutshell , " David Shulman , a Hebrew University professor and activist with the Israeli - Palestinian peace group Ta'ayush , wrote in the Ha'aretz newspaper .
" Inside the occupied Palestinian territories is a shadow state where the only real law is the law of the gun , where land is being taken away from its rightful owners every day , and where the very few who stand up to protest , without violence , like Ezra Nawi , are sent to prison . "
Another Hebrew University academic and peace activist , Amiel Vardi , who teaches classics , said : " I do n't know of anyone as dedicated as Ezra . "
Vardi , too , said Nawi was different from most .
" We are others .
Even for those who work with us for years and perhaps understand more or less what we are doing , we are still others , " he said .
" Not Ezra .
Ezra is accepted as a human being , meaning they both belong to the same group .
He is not so much of an other . "
The case against him relies on the testimony of two border police officers who allege Nawi punched them during the demolition .
The demolition was videoed , but the alleged incident took place inside one of the shacks and is not caught on film .
Nawi admits he shouted , protested and lay in front of the bulldozer , but insists he is committed to non-violence and did not strike the officers .
Neither officer mentioned any punch in their initial statements , but Judge Eilata Ziskind said their testimonies were still reliable .
In her verdict she said : " Freedom of speech is not the freedom to act in an inciting manner or to take steps to prevent or disturb police work … freedom of speech is not the permission to be unruly and certainly not to use violence . "
Once he has been arrested and cuffed , the video shows Nawi sitting in the back of a border police van as the officers laugh at him .
He tells them : " Yes , I was also a soldier , but I did n't demolish houses .
There 's a big difference .
The only thing that will be left here is hatred . "
This is the the fourth post in a six post series that follows Alexandra Cousteauâ€™s Blue Planet Expedition , a 100 day journey to 5 continents to study the interconnectivity of water .

After Botswana , Alexandra Cousteau ’s next mission was to investigate the role that fresh water access has played in the Israeli / Palestinian conflict in the West Bank .
After visiting Jordan , she arrived at the Sea of Galilee in Israel , which is also known as Lake Tiberias .
Israel surrounds the large lake on all sides , having captured the Golan Heights ( along the eastern shore ) , from Syria in 1967 .
The Golan is the main water source for the Sea of Galilee .
Israel pumps water out of the lake and distributes it its cities .
Cousteau ’s blog confirms the tragic impact of Israel ’s actions on the surrounding countries :
“ The devastating part of the water story is that once it controlled the watershed , Israel dammed the Sea of Galilee completely , severing the Jordan River from its primary replenishing source .
The country of Jordan also taps the river heavily in the north .
As a result , the Jordan River , which I remember hearing as a child was â€œdeep and wideâ€  is now , according to our Israeli guide from the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies Clive Lipchin , “ narrow and polluted . ” ”
The West Bank area has been conflict ridden for years , drought only exacerbates the situation .
Both the Israelis and the Palestinians are feeling the impact of continuous dry spells , but Israel , which controls the watershed , has tightened its grip on water supplies to Palestine .
Palestine gets only one - fourth of the water allotment that Israel gets .
While Jordan has agriculture all along the Jordan River Basin , Israel wonâ€™t allow Palestinians access to the river .
Hence , the latter are largely dependent upon groundwater and rainfall .
However , these supplies decrease each year .
The International Committee of the Red Cross has come to Palestine ’s aid , as Israel continues to restrict supplies , by trucking water in to the worst affected areas of the southern West Bank .
“ â€ œDo we deserve this treatment ? â€ asks an official from the local Palestinian council .
He dons a brown polyester suit and chain - smokes as we talk .
â€ œWe have no self - determination .
We arenâ€™t even allowed to dig wells without Israeli permission .
We canâ€™t afford to treat our sewage , so our groundwater gets more and more polluted .â€ 
He takes a dramatic puff of his cigarette .
â€ œThe Israelis know what theyâ€™re doing .
Theyâ€™re using water as a weapon .
If farmers canâ€™t irrigate their fields , theyâ€™re forced to go to work in construction or move away or take government money .
This gives Israelis more land security , because it separates the Palestinians from their land.â€  ”
—- Taken from Alexadra Cousteau ’s blog .
Cousteau has attempted to put a positive spin on things by asking whether the issue of water scarcity can be transformedÂ into an opportunity that brings people of different religions and conflicted histories together .
But although many agree on the need for regional collaboration , few are actually willing to come forward to do what it takes to separate water from politics .
Perhaps it is inevitable that this is the way things have been and will always be .
Watch this video in which Cousteau interviews Muna Dajani , Palestinian Student , Arava Institute Alum , about the Israel - Palestine water and politics .

A tiny island in the corner of a distant ocean will vote next Sunday to become a French département or county – defying a separatist trend in other fragments of France scattered around the globe .
Mayotte in the Indian Ocean , population 180,000 and roughly the size of the Isle of Wight , is confidently expected to vote to become the 101st département of France in a long - awaited referendum .
Despite the angry opposition of the African Union and the nearby Comoros , the islanders have long insisted that they want to retain , and even solidify , their Frenchness .
They are expected to vote overwhelmingly to end their present vague status as a French “ overseas collectivity ” and agree to become a fully fledged overseas département – legally as much a part of France as Paris or the Pas de Calais .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
When the new status takes effect in 2011 , the overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim people of the one large and one small island in Mayotte will have to come in line with the French legal code .
Among other things , they will have to give up Islamic courts , polygamy and child marriages .
They will qualify gradually for French social benefits over 25 years .
The vote in Mayotte may appear to be a historical anachronism .
The African Union has long supported the sovereignty claim of the nearby Comoros Islands , which were once part of a single French colony with Mayotte .
Some other parts of foreign oceans which are forever France , such as Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean and Réunion in the Indian Ocean , have increasingly powerful separatist movements .
All three have seen serious , social unrest in recent weeks in which protesters have complained about low wages and the high cost of living .
Nouvelle Calédonie , the French territory in the Pacific , has begun a process which is expected to lead to full independence some time after 2014 .
The people of Mayotte – “ les Mahorais ” – have already voted four times since 1974 to remain part of France .
All political parties in the island have recommended a “ oui ” vote in Sunday ’s referendum .
The Mahorais fear domination by the larger population of the Comoros islands and hope to develop their economy – based on manioc ( cassava ) , bananas and tourism – more rapidly as part of France .
Unemployment in Mayotte is around 29 per cent but has been falling in recent years .
Under the terms offered by next week ’s referendum , the islanders will qualify for somewhat increased social benefits as soon as they become a French département in 2011 .
However , full benefits would not be paid until 2031 or 2036 .
Actress Salma
Hayek who married her long - time boyfriend Francois - Henri Pinault in February thinks lavish wedding ceremonies are a waste of money .
The celebrity denied reports she is going to celebrate her wedding again in a big party because she does n’t see the point .
“ I think a wedding is about love , friends , family and fun .
I think spending millions of dollars on a wedding is ridiculous and it has never been my dream ” – said Hayek .
Salma does what she says .
The 42 - year old actress had a very moving , intimate and moderate ceremony with about a dozen guests present .

It looks pretty clear that the U.S. regulators are going to clean house this year — at least with small banks .
Hundreds of small banks and credit union will go into receivership in 2009 .
However , big banks are getting a free ride .
First there was the juxtaposition of the kid gloves treatment of too big to fail financial institutions versus the iron fist meted out for the soon to be bankrupt Chrysler and General Motors .
Now , on a day when 4 small banks and one credit union are going bust , the difference in what is happening with big banks versus smaller financial institutions is equally dramatic .
The stress tests are complete for the Golden List of 19 .
But , rest assured , the Feds wo n’t be doing a damn thing .
This is all just for show .
Nationalization is now for small institutions only .
So , with our regulators in mind , I give you the distraction of the day .
This is for you American Southern Bank , Michigan Heritage Bank , First Bank of Beverly Hills and First Bank of Idaho .
( Bank failures 26 , 27 , 28 and 29 ) – and for you too Eastern Financial Florida Credit Union .
Long live small banks !
All your bank are belong to us :

“ It just keeps rising , ” he said .
The geology is complex , but it boils down to this : Relieved of billions of tons of glacial weight , the land has risen much as a cushion regains its shape after someone gets up from a couch .
The land is ascending so fast that the rising seas  a ubiquitous byproduct of global warming  cannot keep pace .
As a result , the relative sea level is falling , at a rate “ among the highest ever recorded , ” according to a 2007 report by a panel of experts convened by Mayor Bruce Botelho of Juneau .

At low tide , it is possible ( but messy ) to hike across exposed mudflats around Juneau .

Greenland and a few other places have experienced similar effects from widespread glacial melting that began more than 200 years ago , geologists say .
But , they say , the effects are more noticeable in and near Juneau , where most glaciers are retreating 30 feet a year or more .
As a result , the region faces unusual environmental challenges .
As the sea level falls relative to the land , water tables fall , too , and streams and wetlands dry out .
Land is emerging from the water to replace the lost wetlands , shifting property boundaries and causing people to argue about who owns the acreage and how it should be used .
And meltwater carries the sediment scoured long ago by the glaciers to the coast , where it clouds the water and silts up once - navigable channels .
A few decades ago , large boats could sail regularly along Gastineau Channel between Downtown Juneau and Douglas Island , to Auke Bay , a port about 10 miles to the northwest .
Today , much of the channel is exposed mudflat at low tide .
“ There is so much sediment coming in from the Mendenhall Glacier and the rivers  it has basically silted in , ” said Bruce Molnia , a geologist at the United States Geological Survey who studies Alaskan glaciers .
Already , people can wade across the channel at low tide  or race across it , as they do in the Mendenhall Mud Run .
At low tide , the navigation buoys rest on mud .
This month marks the 100th anniversary of Father ’s Day , and a big celebration is planned for June 20 at the Lincoln Memorial .
I figured it was a good time to ask a local lawyer who is active in family court , child support and gender issues about what he sees facing boys and men at this milestone .
To begin with , President Obama ’s recognition of the importance of fatherhood is very welcome , said Ronald K. Henry , a child - advocacy attorney in the District .
“ We ’re very excited about the administration ’s determination to create some visibility and some action to strengthen and restore fatherhood , ” he said .
But there ’s a lot of work to be done .
For instance , it ’s time to figure out how to reduce the number of men and boys who end up in prison .
“ The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
What are we doing wrong ? ” Mr. Henry said .
The U.S. incarceration rate is 751 per 100,000 residents , with Russia having the second - highest rate , 627 per 100,000 .
“ It ca n’t be that our population is genetically inferior to the rest of world , ” Mr. Henry said .
“ What are we doing wrong that contributes to the incarceration rate ?
Is it the fatherlessness problem ?
Our government ought to be looking at prevention rather than incarceration . ”
Another issue is education .
“ We ought to be looking at why boys are disengaged in primary and secondary education such that they never get to college .
What is it about our school system that turns off the boys so that by the time college comes around , they ’re not in the equation ?
What is it that is causing boys to have lower academic aspirations than girls ? ”
Mr. Henry asked .
Other topics :
• Domestic violence , which is a national issue with an office of its own when it ’s against women , but an invisible issue when men are the victims .
• The gender gap in health - insurance coverage , in which men are more likely to be uninsured than women .
( The current gender breakdown among uninsured , nonelderly adults is 54 percent male and 46 percent female , the Kaiser Family Foundation says . )
Even social science has come to view men as abnormal or ill subjects .
“ Men as men are almost completely unstudied , ” said Mr. Henry .
“ There is a lot of blaming and a lot of pathologizing , but almost nobody has looked at what is it to be a man , how boys become men , what is expected of a man , what is demanded of a man , what does a man want , how does the man live , how does the man feel about himself , how does he feel about being treated the way he ’s treated , how does he feel about walking down the street and noticing people become defensive because they ’ve been taught to be afraid of males ? ”
This fear of men is “ something that black males feel with enormous intensity , ” added Mr. Henry .
It ’s often been written about how when a black male walks down the street , people move to the other side .
“ Well , that happens to all guys .
It happens more visibly and intensely to minority guys , but it happens to all guys , ” he said .
“ Even a guy taking his own kids to the playground can feel the suspicion and defensiveness around him . ”
Still , the Obama administration seems to be offering fresh hope , and the “ renewed focus on the importance of family , importance of fatherhood and the need to restore fatherhood ” are all welcome changes , he said

' Vid Kids ' Likely to Suffer Delayed Language Development
New Findings Strengthen Suspected Link Between Infant TV Exposure , Delayed Language Development
The more time your infant or toddler spends listening to the television , the less likely he is to hear your voice , or to speak himself , a new study asserts .
The findings strengthen a suspected link between infant TV exposure and delayed language development , according to a report in the journal Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine .
This sets up an interesting paradox .
While some researchers think audible TV is linked to decreased communication in young children , an entire market of educational DVDs geared toward babies has sprouted under the opposite theory that TV programs can help promote interaction between parent and child .
Whatever the connection , infants are spending an increased amount of time in front of the TV , according to a team led by Dr. Dimitri A. Christakis of the Center for Child Health , Behavior and Development at the University of Washington .
A 2003 report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that each day , 68 percent of American infants viewed some type of electronic medium : TV programming , DVDs or video tapes , computers or video games .
To determine the impact of infant TV watching , the Christakis group recruited parents who agreed to equip their 2 - to 24 - month - old kids with a wire for one day a month in order to record every sound for a 12 - to 16 - hour period .
Using noise - detection software that analyzed at least one recorded session from each of the 329 youngsters , files were sorted into sounds the kids heard and sounds the kids made .
The researchers used a statistical model to determine the association between audible television and the number of words spoken by each adult and each child .
They also examined how many meaningful vocal interactions were shared by the child and adult while the TV was on .
They found that each hour spent with a TV was associated a significant reduction in a child 's own attempts to talk .
Likewise , for each hour in front of the tube , the child heard 770 fewer words from an adult .
That 's 7 percent fewer than the average number of words a child hears in a household when the television is off .
TV May Present Toddlers With Distractions
" Some of these reductions are likely due to children being left in front of the television screen , but others likely reflect situations in which adults , though present , are distracted by the screen and not interacting with their infant in a discernible manner , " the researchers concluded .
The authors said 30 percent of households have a TV on at all times , which brings up the question , How many opportunities for child - parent communication are being missed ?
Previous research has shown that when adults are watching their own programs -- even a show like Jeopardy , which would be mere background noise to an infant -- the grownups communicate less with their children , and the kids make less noise themselves , said Deborah Linebarger , a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the effects of media on young children .
Linebarger was not affiliated with the study .
The authors of the latest report acknowledged that their findings seem obvious : More TV time equals less human interaction .
But they say it might also debunk the claims of companies that market DVDs for infants suggesting that their products promote child - parent interaction .
Those claims are not backed by evidence , the authors said , adding that communicating with a child while the TV is on may be more important than the type of program to which the child is exposed .
Linebarger said her biggest criticism of the Christakis study is that it did not take into account what effect various types of programs have on parent - child communication .
She said her research indicates that television shows designed for young kids that mimic the storytelling approaches of books are best at promoting language development .
The battle is likely to go on , with plenty of ammunition on both sides .
Since 1999 , the American Academy of Pediatrics has discouraged the watching of TV or other screen media by children younger than 2 .
In addition to its adverse effects on body weight , attention and sleep , watching TV before age 2 may restrict a child 's cognitive development and the uptake of language , a variety of studies have found .
TV Exposure May Not Increase Baby's Intelligence
But research published in Pediatrics as recently as March found that the amount of time spent watching TV before age 2 was not associated with cognitive development at age 3 .
The latest study by Christakis was supported by the LENA Foundation , a nonprofit that develops technology for language research .
Three of the study authors were employed by the LENA Foundation .
One of the biggest reasons I like living where I do is that two or three times a summer , someone hosts a block party .
The format is pretty simple – bring a side dish , grab a plate , fill up , and talk to people .
Yet , I know from watching the hosts , the actual hosting can be really frenetic – the hosts often look completely frazzled , even if everyone else is having fun .
I had planned on having a block party early this summer to celebrate the release of my first book , 365 Ways to Live Cheap , but the release date wound up being substantially earlier than I expected .
So I decided to push the idea off until the release of my second book ( which I anticipate to be late next spring ) .
During the process of thinking about the party , I stopped by and had a chat with a person who had recently hosted one .
He told me that it was ( a ) surprisingly expensive and ( b ) a lot more work than he expected it to be , but it was very worthwhile because it gave him an opportunity to meet so many neighbors –
something I find very valuable , too .
So I resolved right then to plan out a frugal block party .
If you ’ve ever wanted to host a block party but have been thrown off the scent by fear of the cost and time investment , here are the tactics we ’re using to trim both factors without reducing the fun .
Seven Tactics for a Fun and Frugal Block Party
1. Buy Only the Basics – But Buy Far in Advance
As soon as you ’re sure you ’re going to host a block party – even before you set a date in stone – make a shopping list .
The earlier you make a list , the longer you have to shop for the items – meaning , the more time you have to find huge sales on the items you need to get .
The items to look for are pretty simple : paper plates , silverware ( I prefer biodegradable corn plastic silverware ) , napkins , and cups .
Over a long period of time , it ’s easy to find each of these items on sale somewhere .
2. Invite a Neighbor or Two to Co- Host
This enables you both to serve as hosts and be involved in the meeting and greeting of everyone , but split the costs and effort in setting up , hosting , and tearing down .
3. Estimate High on What You Need
Estimating high will cause you far fewer headaches than estimating low .
The items that are left over can be saved and used again for other occasions , whereas if you start to run low on items during the party , panic will ensue and difficulty will follow – including high prices because you could n’t shop around .
Of course , if you ’re buying in bulk , this likely will not be a problem .
4. Rely on Guests for Side Dishes and Some Beverages
Preparing a flyer for the party is key – and on that flyer , be sure to highlight some key information – your address , your phone number , and also a note to bring a side dish .
As for beverages , you can set out a few beverages in bulk – like water and tea – in self - dispensing jugs with cups , but if other beverages are desired , you should note this for guests who might come .
Depending on available seating arrangements , you may also ask guests to bring their own lawn chairs .
In some neighborhoods , there will be a plethora of options – picnic tables and the like .
However , you may want to have backups for some guests .
5. Borrow Equipment
Do n’t hesitate to ask the people you know well if you can borrow some items for the party , such as extra chairs they might have , extra tables , or even their grill .
The more items you can borrow , the fewer items you have to invest money in for such a limited use .
6. Get Cheap Help
A big reason that you ’re having this party is so that you can meet neighbors and build relationships , not run around on small errands .
One good solution is to hire some neighborhood help – and one great solution for that is enlisting any teenage children that live nearby .
$ 10 or $ 15 is a small price to pay to have someone making sure that there are no emergency needs or other things , keeping beverages rotated , and so forth , leaving you to actually meet and greet people .
7 . Buy food that can you prepare easily in large quantities for entrees
I almost always think sandwiches are a good idea .
Have bratwursts , hot dogs , and veggie dogs ( for any vegetarians ) – or have burgers ( beef and soy options ) .
Another option – pulled meat sandwiches .
Along with these , you ’ll need to buy buns in bulk , as well as condiments .
Again , plan this as far in advance as you can , so you can seek out bargains .
Planning and Preparation
The Week Before
Clean !
Clean your garage .
Clean the yard and make sure it ’s mowed two or three days before the party .
Clean any portions of your house that people might use for the restroom – and also in event of rain .
It ’ll leave you feeling refreshed and more prepared .
The Day Before
Borrow equipment from neighbors and store it in your garage .
Begin thawing anything that needs thawed .
Make sure all equipment that you ’re going to rely on is in proper working order – fire up grills and so forth .
Doing this now will save you a lot of money and stress compared to putting it off .
The Big Day
Something will go off wrong .
Expect it .
Do n’t stress out when it happens .
Recognize that it ’s just part of life , and make do as best you can .
If you ’re prepared for this , you wo n’t react with strong emotions and you wo n’t be drawn to throw money at it just to solve it .
Also , plan to cook so that a large batch of food will be put out thirty minutes after the start time .
This gives the on - time arrivers plenty of time to mingle , get side dishes set up , and when people start going through the food line , the first batch wo n’t sit out there for long .
I find that putting food out when people start arriving usually means many people just eat and run and many other people end up eating food that ’s sat out for a long time .
The biggest thing , really , is not to panic .
Something will go wrong .
Do n’t worry about it too much .
Spilling a beverage wo n’t ruin everyone ’s day .
Nor will being fifteen minutes late with the entree .
No matter what , do n’t throw cash at the problem – just solve it calmly , with what you have .

Abstract IP v6 rapid deployment ( 6rd ) builds upon mechanisms of 6to4 ( RFC3056 ) to enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IP v6 unicast service to IP v4 sites to which it provides customer premise equipment .
Like Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 1 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009 6to4 , it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IP v4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4 - only network infrastructure .
Unlike 6to4 , a 6rd service provider uses an IP v6 prefix of its own in place of the fixed 6to4 prefix .
A service provider has used this mechanism for its own IPv6 " rapid deployment " : five weeks from first exposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000 residential sites being provided native IP v6 , under the only condition that they activate it .

Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009 1 .
Introduction Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 4 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009 Readers are supposed to be familiar with 6to4 [ RFC3056 ] .
2 . Problem statement and purpose of 6rd Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 5 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009 own customers .
Quality of service , at least for customers of other 6to4 ISPs , will then hardly be guaranteed .
The purpose of 6rd is to slightly modify 6to4 so that : 1 . Packets that , coming from the global Internet , enter 6rd gateways of an ISP are only packets destined to customer sites of this ISP .
2 . All IPv6 packets destined to 6rd customer sites of an ISP , and coming from anywhere else on the IPv6 Internet , traverse a 6rd gateway of this ISP .
3 . Specification Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 6 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009
The chosen address format uses 32 bits of IP v4 address within the IP v6 address for reasons of simplicity and of compatibility with the existing 6to4 code .
Free 's customers being essentially residential , limiting initially their sites to one IP v6 subnet per site was not a significant restriction : most of them would not have been able to use several subnets anyway ; as soon as Free would get shorter a prefix than / 32 , this restriction could be relaxed .
IPv4 AND IPv6 customer site | | 6rd CPEs 6rd relays | ( modified 6to4 ) ( modified 6to4 ) | | | | | __________________________ | | | | | | | | | ISP IPV4 INFRASTRUCTURE | V GLOBAL V V | | ___ IPV6 ___ | | | | INTERNET | | | | .-----------------|--|
|--- |--| |--|-. / | |___| | |___| | \ / | | \ / IP v4 | IPv6 Prefix | O anycast address => | <= of 6rd relays | ___ | / \ of 6rd relays | of the ISP | | | | / \ | ___ |--| |--|-' \ | | | | |___| |
'-----------------|--| |--- | | | |___| | IP v4 addresses | | <= of customer sites | |__________________________|
ISP ARCHITECTURE TO DEPLOY IPV6 WITH 6rd Figure 2 NOTE :
If it had been important to use less than 32 bits of IP v4 addresses in IP v6 prefixes , this would have been possible .
Since Free , like many ISPs , had several RIR allocated IP v4 prefixes ( 6 of them , having lengths from / 10 to /16 in the particular case ) , 6rd gateways and 6rd CPEs would however have had for this to support a variable length mapping table .
Some of the IP v4 addressing entropy would thus have been extended to 6rd gateways and CPEs , and complexity would have been significantly higher .
This would have defeated the objective of extreme simplicity to favor actual and rapid deployment .
Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 7 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009
Figure 2 shows which nodes have to be upgraded from 6to4 to 6rd , and which addresses or prefixes have to be routed to them .
IPv6 communication between customer sites of a same ISP is direct across the ISP IPv4 infrastructure : when a CPE sees that the IP v6 destination address of an outgoing packet starts with its own 6rd relay ISPv6 prefix , it takes the 32 bits that follow this prefix as IP v4 destination of the encapsulating packet .
( Sending and decapsulation rules of 6to4 , duly adapted to the 6rd prefix in place of the 6to4 prefix , apply as described in [ RFC3056 ] section 5.3 . )
The IP v4 anycast address of 6rd relays may be chosen independently by each ISP .
The only constraint is that routes toward the ISP that are advertised must not include this address .
For example , Free took a 192.88.99. k address , routed with the same / 24 prefix as 6to4 but with k different from 1 to avoid confusion with the 6to4 address of [ RFC3068 ] .
Another possibility is to use the anycast address of 6to4 and to add , in relays , a test on the IP v6 prefix of the ISP side address .
If it is 2002::/16 , the packet is 6to4 , not 6rd.
4 . Applicability to ISPs that assign private IP v4 addresses Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 8 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009
If an ISP has assigned to customer sites addresses of an IP v4 private space of [ RFC1918 ] , typically 10.x.x.x/8 addresses , it can also use 6rd to offer IP v6 to these sites .
IP v4 packets that contain IP v6 packets do n't go to NATs which this ISP needs to operate in its infrastructure : they go directly to 6rd relays because their destination is the 6rd relay anycast address .
Note that in this case the 10.0.0.0 / 8 prefix is common to all IP v4 addresses of the addressing realm in which 6rd is used .
Knowing it , gateways and CPE can avoid including this constant IP v4 prefix in IP v6 prefixes , and thus reduce to 24 the number of bits of IP v4 addresses to be used in IP v6 prefixes .
If an ISP is large enough to provide service to more IP v4 endpoints than will fit inside a 10 .x.x.x/ 8 addressing realm , it can configure several such realms , with 6rd - relay IP v6 prefixes specific of each one .
Each of these prefixes is the RIR allocated ISP prefix followed by an ISP assigned realm identifier .
5 . Security Considerations RFC3964 ] .
With the restriction imposed by 6rd that relays of an ISP deal only with traffic that belongs to that ISP , checks that have to be done become the following : o CPE PACKETS TOWARD THE INTERNET :
The IPv6 source must be , and the IP v6 destination must no be , a 6rd address of the site .
o RELAY PACKETS TOWARD THE INTERNET : The IPv6 source must be a 6rd address that matches the IP v4 source .
The IP v6 destination must not start with the ISP 6rd prefix .
o CPE PACKETS FROM THE INTERNET :
If the IP v4 source is the 6rd - relays anycast address of the local ISP , the IP v6 source must not be a 6rd address of this ISP .
Otherwise , the IP v6 source must be the 6rd address that matches the IP v4 source .
o RELAY PACKETS FROM THE INTERNET : The IP v6 source must not be a 6rd address of the ISP .
The IP v4 destination must not be multicast , i.e. must not start with 224/3 .
( Notes :
The fact that the IPv6 destination starts with the IPv6 prefix of the ISP 6rd relays is ensured by the routing configuration , but may be double - checked .
If the IPv4 address extracted from the IPv6 destination does n't belong to the ISP , the destination CPE should detect that the IPv6 destination contains neither its ISP 6rd prefix , if it has one , Despres Expires October 9 , 2009 [ Page 9 ]
Internet - Draft 6rd - IP v6 Rapid Deployment April 2009 nor the 6to4 prefix , and should discard the packet . )
These precautions being taken , it remains that , where IP v4 address spoofing is possible ( IPv4 sites placing unauthorized source addresses in some packets they send ) , IP v6 address spoofing is also possible .

In a rather unexpected turn of events , Microsoft ’s WPF and Silverlight platforms have lost another early adopter .
Back in 2006 we reported on how the Times Reader was based on WPF .
Since then the New York Times has also added a Silverlight - based application for OS X users .
Unfortunately the Silverlight version has been plagued with problems , both political and technical .
The biggest hurdle was the lack of cross-platform support .
Though based on WPF or Windows Presentation Foundation , Silverlight only has a subset of WPF ’s capabilities .
This makes writing code that works on both difficult and most developers seem to end up maintaining two separate code bases .
Silverlight 2.0 is designed to run within a browser , a limitation not found in WPF .
Apple users , who tend to be sensitive to such issues , rightfully complained about not having all the same features as Windows users .
Silverlight is also known to produce blurry text at times , a major issue for an application dedicated to displaying news .
Finally , the Times Reader has some compatibility issues with Safari 4 .
To address these and other issues , the New York Times is abandoning both WPF and Silverlight .
Rob Larson writes ,
Next week we ’ll be introducing Times Reader 2.0 .
This version is powered by Adobe AIR and will run equally well on Windows , Mac and Linux computers .
With this latest release , Times Reader resembles the printed paper even more closely , and it updates every five minutes with the latest news from the Web .
The Times Reader 2.0 is now available ; and with Microsoft promoting its New York Times Silverlight Kit , the timing could n’t be worse .
RabbitHub is our implementation of PubSubHubBub , a straightforward pubsub layer on top of plain old HTTP POST — pubsub over Webhooks .
It ’s not well documented yet ( understatement ) , but that will change .
It gives every AMQP exchange and queue hosted by a RabbitMQ broker a couple of URLs : one to use for delivering messages to the exchange or queue , and one to use to subscribe to messages forwarded on by the exchange or queue .
You subscribe with a callback URL , so when messages arrive , RabbitHub POSTs them on to your callback .
For example ,
– http://dev.rabbitmq.com/rabbithub/endpoint/x/amq.direct is the URL for delivering messages to the “ amq.direct ” exchange on our public test instance of RabbitMQ , and
– http://dev.rabbitmq.com/rabbithub/subscribe/q/some_queue_name is the URL for subscribing to messages from the ( hypothetical ) queue “ some_queue_name ” on the broker .
( The symmetrical … / subscribe /x / … and … / endpoint / q/ … also exist . )
The PubSubHubBub protocol specifies some RESTful ( ish ) operations for establishing subscriptions between message sources ( a.k.a “ topics ” ) and message sinks .
RabbitHub implements these operations as well as a few more for RESTfully creating and deleting exchanges and queues .
Combining RabbitHub with the AMQP protocol implemented by RabbitMQ itself and with the other adapters and gateways that form part of the RabbitMQ universe lets you send messages across different kinds of message networks — for example , our public RabbitMQ instance , dev.rabbitmq.com , has RabbitHub running as well as the standard AMQP adapter , the rabbitmq - xmpp plugin , and a bunch of our other experimental stuff , so you can do things like this :
– become XMPP friends with pshb@dev.rabbitmq.com ( the XMPP adapter gives each exchange a JID of its own )
– use PubSubHubBub to subscribe the sink http://dev.rabbitmq.com/rabbithub/endpoint/x/pshb to some PubSubHubBub source — perhaps one on the public Google PSHB instance .
( Note how the given URL ends in “ x / pshb ” , meaning the “ pshb ” exchange — which lines up with the JID we just became XMPP friends with . )
– wait for changes to be signalled by Google ’s PSHB hub to RabbitHub
– when they are , you get an XMPP IM from pshb@dev.rabbitmq.com with the Atom XML that the hub sent out as the body
RabbitHub is content - agnostic — you do n’t have to send Atom around — so the fact that Atom appears is an artifact of what Google ’s public PSHB instance is mailing out , rather than anything intrinsic in pubsub - over - webhooks .
We ’ve also been experimenting with using http://www.reversehttp.net/ to run a PubSubHubBub endpoint in a webpage — see for instance http://www.reversehttp.net/demos/endpoint.html and its associated Javascript for a simple prototype of the idea .
I ’m playing with building a simple PSHB hub in Javascript using the same tools .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Jonathan Chait describes “ The Obama Method ” in a not - yet posted piece on The New Republic .
He tries to explain the eerie similarity between how Obama has reached out to moderate Republicans and independents at home while marginalizing right - wingers and how Obama reached out to the majority of Muslims while isolating the extremists in his foreign policy ( and specifically the Cairo speech . )
Chait also tries to tie this in to different critiques of Obama :
Democratic partisans think the enemy is vicious and must be met with uncompromising force .
That ’s exactly how conservative foreign policy hawks feel about the world .
Unsurprisingly , the right - wing foreign policy critique of Obama today sounds eerily like the partisan Democratic critique of Obama during the primary .
Let ’s call this method in foreign policy – which assumes every foreign rival is a reincarnation of Nazi Germany – the Bush doctrine ; and in domestic policy , in domestic politics – assuming that all Republicans lie about their goals and probably hate the poor and downtrodden and merely want to aid the rich in getting richer – we can call this the Krugman doctrine .
( On the Republican side of this , it would be the Rove doctrine , but that ’s not relevant here . )
The Bush / Krugman doctrine – in assuming that all opponents are acting in bad faith – is rather simple .
Identify your opponents .
Tell everyone what you believe and call your opponents names ( your skill at name - calling is the only way to demonstrate your moral clarity ) .
Everyone will see how right you are .
This is n’t that bad of an approach for a newspaper column – it can be downright entertaining and sometimes even enlightening .
As a basis for foreign policy or domestic political agenda though , it is poisonous – and though it may work for a time , the results diminish rapidly .
Obama ’s method operates differently :
Demonstrate one ’s respect for one ’s opponent .
Start with the assumption they are acting in good faith .
Invite them to a conversation about what needs to be done to solve the problem (s ) on which they are opponents .
If they are acting in good faith , they can be worked with .
If they are not , “ by demonstrating [ one ’s ] own goodwill and interest in accord , [ one ] can win over a portion of [ one ’s ] adversaries ’ constituents as well as third parties . ”
I disagree with Chait that Obama ’s method “ entails small acts of intellectual dishonesty in the pursuit of common ground , ” though .
Chait , for example , cites the line I criticized in Obama ’s Cairo speech in which he called the Middle East the region where Islam “ was first revealed . ”
In this case , I think Chait is right – that this line is intellectually dishonest .
But his appreciation for Reagan which Chait also cites seems perhaps a bit exaggerated , but consistent with the rest of Obama ’s beliefs – which tend to find a balance between Reaganesque individual responsibility and Kennedyesque calls for national responsibility .
Chait traces this method back to a Obama ’s training as a community organizer .
He cites a Mark Schmitt piece in The American Prospect which describes the community organizer method of dealing with opponents acting in bad faith :
One way to deal with that kind of bad - faith opposition is to draw the person in , treat them as if they were operating in good faith , and draw them into a conversation about how they actually would solve the problem .
If they have nothing , it shows .
And that ’s not a tactic of bipartisan Washington idealists – it ’s a hard - nosed tactic of community organizers , who are acutely aware of power and conflict .
It ’s how you deal with people with intractable demands – put ‘em on a committee .
Then define the committee ’s mission your way .
Chait explains why Obama ’s approach is so successful :
The rhetoric removes the locus of debate from the realm of tribal conflict – red state versus blue state , Islam versus America – and puts it onto specific questions – Is the American health care system fair ?
Is terrorism justified ?
– where Obama believes he can win support from soft adherent of the opposing camp .
Obama ’s method seems designed to short - circuit the dynamics of moral outrage that lead to polarization , extremism , and even violence .
He illustrated this in his campaign – as he tried to calm his supporters down , defending pro-life demonstraters and on the eve of the election , as his crowd booed McCain , chiding them : “ You do n’t need to boo .
You just need to vote . ”
And now , in reaching out to the Muslim world he is demonstrating this same grasp of how to defuse the escalating cycle of moral outrage – by treating his opponents with respect and as “ people of goodwill . ”
A little bit of civility will not remake the world – but it can go a long way in calming tensions .

Of all our natural resources water has become the most precious .
By far the greater part of the earth ’s surface is covered by its enveloping seas , yet in the midst of this plenty we are in want .
By a strange paradox , most of the earth ’s abundant water is not usable for agriculture , industry , or human consumption because of its heavy load of sea salts , and so most of the world ’s population is either experiencing or is threatened with critical shortages .
– Rachel Carson
Around the world , scarcity of potable water is becoming a portentous matter .
Admonishing phrases like “ water is the next oil , ” and “ wells are running dry ” have percolated their way into the collective lexicon of global issues .
Rivers and streams are vanishing , and the desiccation and depletion of entire watersheds and aquifers is increasing the world over .
Desperately seeking a reason for the withering away of drinkable water and the silencing of gushing streams , it becomes obvious that there is not one sole factor contributing to this dire situation , but many .
Global warming and climate change , industrial modes of production , dam construction , and water privatization all conduce to the problem of water scarcity .
The supply of freshwater on this planet is only 2.5 percent of the world ’s total water .
Considering the amount that is frozen up in ice and snow , roughly one percent is left for human use .
Water consumption has grown twice as fast as the world ’s population .
We are often told that we ’ve exceeded our carrying capacity here on Earth ( or are arriving at that calamitous denouement of the story of civilization in no time soon ) , and water – a finite resource – is being exacerbated at an alarming rate in tandem to population growth .
It is very true that we ’ve reached our carrying capacity , this planet cannot healthily sustain so many people living in current arrangements ; it can not support our lifestyle .
But anyone who has closely studied the conflation of civilization , agriculture , and Capitalism understand well that human population booms are endemic to the aforementioned social formula .
And in all honesty , to blame the problem of water scarcity upon an increasing global population is sneaky as hell .
Ninety percent of human water use is for industrial purposes – 70 percent being used exclusively for large - scale agriculture and factory farming .
If the dominant economic mode were to shift gears , to one that was n’t defined globally , and predicated upon the funneling of resources to the producer rather than the community , the availability of water would be much different .
If community - scale projects and strict environmental protection policies were implemented to define our economic behavior , then I ’m pretty sure billions of people would not be facing such dire water related plights .
However , in a world where market theory has greatly influenced the dominant praxis of economic intercourse , the privatization of the planet ’s water has been pitched as the panacea that will solve our troubles .
Such pernicious tropes like “ blue gold ” used to describe water have motivated many corporations to privatize water with much alacrity .
Here in Vermont I quickly got wind of the contentions surrounding the privatization and commercialization of water .
Like sprouting cowslips that push their way through marshy soils in the springtime , private water - bottling operations were popping up left and right along Vermont ’s pristine springs .
These enterprises have set up shop with the intent to siphon the state ’s fresh water from age - old springs and commercialize it .
There was the New Jersey resident , East Montpelier landowner , and chief executive officer of Montpelier Spring Water Company , Daniel Antonovich , who initially pitched forward the Montpelier Spring Water Company in May of 2007 to the East Montpelier Selectboard .
Antonovich envisions constructing a subterranean pipeline that will transport the water over several miles from the East Montpelier site to a bottling factory ( yet to be erected ) alongside U.S. Highway 2 in Montpelier , where the water will then be bottled , capped – ready for shipment , and consigned to its mercantile fate .
Following the proposal , many citizens became skeptical and concerned that the Montpelier Spring Water Co. could follow suit of other companies and someday sell out to a larger corporation that would aggrandize the water - bottling operation .
This had already occurred in Randolph , Vermont with Vermont Pure ; ClearSource , being a leviathan in the commercial bottled - water industry , bought them out .
ClearSource has a history of violating their traffic violations , as well as transgressing their sewage discharge limits .
According to its permit , ClearSource ’s sewage discharge is restricted to 2,960 gallons of sewage on a daily basis .
Currently , ClearSource pumps out 8,000 gallons a day – a considerable decrease from 23,000 gallons only a few years ago – but still , ClearSource is over its limit , and well – rightly so , any company that ca n’t tolerate administrative precepts implemented to carefully manage human ordure scores a big fat zero with concerned citizens .
In accordance with their permit , ClearSource must maintain no more than 120 roundtrips per day for all vehicles into the bottling plant .
As a response to the guidelines , ClearSource ’s CEO Jay Land stated that if the company were to suddenly follow this requirement “ the result would be a mass layoff this morning in the plant , ” and that , “ I ’d have to tell [ employees ] that if you go home for lunch you have to stay home …
But I will not do that to the people in the plant . ”
Geez Land , ever think about offering incentives for carpooling , or having your employees pack a lunch ?
Fortunately , ClearSource “ has fallen upon difficult economic times ” and had to shut down their bottling plant in Randolph , VT in early May ‘ 09 .
Good riddance .
In October of 2007 , Ice River Springs ( aka Aquafarms and Aquafarms 93 ) one of Canada ’s paramount “ private label bottled - water companies ” announced that it would be opening two new bottling plants in the U.S. , one of those plants being constructed on the New Hampshire / Vermont border in Claremont , New Hampshire .
The company further announced that 75 percent of its water would be extracted from a Vermont source in Stockbridge , Vermont , while the remainder would be retrieved from Claremont ’s municipal water supply , alongside manufacturing the plastic bottles at the plant .
According to an article titled “ Ice River Springs / Aquafarms 93 Exposed ” at polarisinstitute.org “ … the company locates plants in small rural communities that are desperate for economic development and jobs … ” and that “ … Ice River Springs uses paid lobbyists to put pressure on politicians to push for or against policies that effect [ sic ] the company ’s profit . ”
I thought of all the other water privatization injustices , sanctioned in tandem by the IMF , World Bank , and transnational corporations like Nestle™ , Bechtel™ , Suez™ and Coca - Cola™ , ad nauseam , that have occurred throughout the world in places such as Belize , Buenos Aires , Atlanta , Georgia , Manila in the Philippines , Cochabamba , Bolivia , Jakarta , Indonesia , Nelspruit , South Africa , and The United Kingdom .
The article goes on to expose that Ice River maintains a plant located in Morganton , North Carolina , an area of the state suffering from one of the worst drought conditions ever recorded , and that it has n’t curtailed its production and has made no indications that it will be doing so .
The precipitating trend of privatizing and commercializing Vermont ’s freshwater is a microcosm of a larger corporate zeitgeist to seize control of much of the world ’s fresh water .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , more than 1.2 billion people worldwide go without access to clean drinking water , and approximately 2.5 billion people do n’t have access to “ adequate sanitation services . ”
Over five million – mostly children in Africa and Asia – die annually from preventable , water - related diseases .
The following countries ( population provided ) consume only contaminated water : Sudan ( 12.3 million ) ; Venezuela ( 5 million ) ; Zimbabwe ( 2.7 million ) ; Tunisia ( 2.1 million ) , and Cuba ( 1.2. million ) .
Proponents of water privatization argue that privatization of water in developing nations , where millions are subjected to abject poverty , would be a boon , delivering clean water for drinking and sanitation to many who go without .
Conversely , many posit that these nations are not equipped to negotiate contracts and the poor bear the brunt of fee increases .
The ensuing information will corroborate the latter allegations .
In 1997 , the people of Bolivia did not choose to privatize their water – it was forced upon them .
Bechtel ’s subsidiary , Aguas del Tunari , along with the Abengoa Corporation of Spain , went into Bolivia , enforced a forty - year contract that privatized much of their fresh water , and not soon after , rate increases quickly doubled and tripled for most of the poor water users .
The private investment relied stringently on market - rate pricing .
According to Jim Shultz , in an article for The Nation on January 28 , 2005 titled “ The Politics of Water in Brazil , ” the cost of water and sewage hookup , in El Alto , was more than half a year ’s income for those making minimum wage .
The contract was so draconian that protest broke out in the streets of Cochabamba , the people demanding an immediate rescinding of the water contract .
The protest led to martial law to save the companies ’ contract , which led to the death of a teenage boy , and the wounding of more than a hundred people .
Over the course of five years in Bolivia , there have been two citizen revolts decrying the privatization of their water .
Bechtel ’s contract was indeed cancelled , but in 2001 Bechtel filed suit against the Bolivian government , claiming they were entitled to $ 25 million in compensation for the loss of future profits .
By the end of 2000 , more than 93 countries worldwide had partially privatized water or wastewater services .
The larger the company , the more control .
According to research done by Elizabeth Brubaker at the Energy Probe Research Foundation , at the largest scale , private water companies construct , own , and run water systems around the globe , raking in revenues of more than $ 30 billion – excluding revenue from the sales of bottled water .
Most of this money does not make it back into the communities , but is rather transferred to the transnationals .
The largest players in water privatization are two French transnationals : Veolia Environment ( owned by media conglomerate Vivendi ) and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux whose water and wastewater businesses are run by its subsidiary Ondeo ( I ’m sure you can find the CEOs ’ names and home addresses if you reconnoiter hard enough on the Internet … to send them letters , silly ) .
These two companies have interests in water projects in over 120 countries and provide to roughly 100 million people .
Suez alone is active in more than 100 countries , and has become the second largest overseer of municipal systems in the U.S. – right behind American Water Works .
In 1993 , Suez and Buenos Aires consummated a privatization deal ( lauded by the World Bank ) ; over the years the results were : drastic increases in consumer water prices ; more than 95 percent of the city ’s sewage dumped into the Rio del Plata river , to name but a couple .
In 1998 , Atlanta , Georgia signed a 20 - year , $ 428 million contract with United Water , a Suez subsidiary .
The results ?
Rate increases of sewer bills – 12 percent annually .
According to a report procured by Public Citizen , the company also charged “ an extra $ 37.6 million for additional service authorizations , capital repair , and maintenance costs . ”
The denizens of Atlanta paid about $ 16 million of these costs , and then an additional $ 1 million to hire investigators to verify United Water ’s reports .
Which turned out to be fishy .
How ’s that for venality – as if selling people water is n’t enough of a depraved iniquity .
As for abroad , the U.K. has used a large private system since the late 80s .
A 1994 study purported to show rates of dysentery ascending in a majority of the urban areas .
And according to the Public Citizen report , in 1998 , “ the major water companies in the U.K. were ranked as the second , third , and fourth - worst polluters . ”
And , “ … ten water companies were prosecuted a total of 260 times between 1989 and 1997 . ”
Other noted effects of water privatization include : Improper protection of water quality ; ecological destruction of downstream habitat ; failure to protect public ownership of water and water rights ; wasted water and neglect of conservation ; and the transfer of assets of local communities to transnationals .
Despite corporate claims ( which are fallacious beyond a doubt ) , the privatizing of water heavily increases the price of water .
According to foodandwaterwatch.org , “ International corporations can easily expect to make a 20 percent to 30 percent margin of profit from investment in water service …
In 2006 , Veolia made a consolidated net income of €759 million ( nearly $ 1.12 billion ) , according to its 2006 annual report .
In addition , 35 percent of Veolia ’s total revenue came from water , with 10 percent from North America , ” and “ In the same year Suez earned a gross operating income of € 7,083 million ( nearly $ 10.38 billion ) , and RWE had a net income of € 3,847 million ( almost $ 5.66 billion ) .
Some €689 million ( $ 1.02 billion ) of RWE ’s EBITDA ( earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization ) came from its water division , known as U.S. water provider American Water . ”
All of this money is funneled out of the community and into the pockets of the shareholders .
There is virtually no case in which the privatizing of water has benefited everyone in a specific community .
Kendra Okonski , editor of The Water Revolution , observed , “ In most poor countries today , governments perpetuate water scarcity – which harms both people and the environment .
They fail to provide water to the poor , but provide massive subsidies for water use by vested interests , such as big landowners . ”
Conflicts over water issues arise as well .
Along the Tigris and Euphrates River System , the countries of Iran , Iraq , and Syria face problems .
As early as 1974 Iraq mobilized troops along the Syrian border , threatening to destroy Syria ’s al Thawra dam along the Euphrates .
In India , Arundhati Roy claims , “ …over the last fifty years in India alone big dams have displaced more than thirty - three million people . ”
And according to the World Bank ’s “ Water Resources Strategy , ” the World Bank will continue its policy of funding big dams .
In 1992 , Hungary and Czechoslovakia took a dispute over Danube River water divisions and dam construction to the International Court of Justice .
Other conflicts include disputes between : North and South Korea , Israel and Palestine , and Egypt and Ethiopia , to name a handful .
Dams , big or small , are deleterious to entire riparian ecosystems , disrupting sediment flow and fish populations , alongside uprooting people from their communities .
They must go .
There are over 75,000 dams , most inoperable , within the continental U.S. alone .
If we were to take down a dam - a - day , it would take over 215 years .
Meanwhile , salmon , steelhead , and trout are disappearing at an inexorable rate .
For the Coho salmon , the apocalypse has already begun .
As for climate change and the latter ’s effect on the world ’s water systems , warmer climates will conduce to the desiccation of Himalayan glaciers as soon as 2035 , as claimed by many reports .
These glaciers are the sources of Asia ’s largest river systems , i.e. Ganges , Indus , Brahmaputra , Yangtze , Mekong , Salween , and the Yellow .
Roughly 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan Rivers .
Much trepidation presides over these folks with the morbid knowledge of likely being inundated by glacial melt , and the subsequent disappearance of their sacred , nascent glaciers .
Australia , too , faces desperate conditions in the near future .
As a result of an epic drought , there is severe ecological damage done to the Murray - Darling basin , which provides for 40 percent of the country ’s agricultural produce .
In the opinion of environmentalist Tim Flannery , unless there are drastic changes , Perth ( home of my former bands ’ record label – I should give Cam , the owner of Hidden Shoal Records , a call and see how everything is going for him , water - wise ) could become the world ’s first “ ghost metropolis ” – virtually no water to support its population .
I recently had a chat with local environmentalist , Annette Smith from Vermonter ’s for a Clean Environment ( VCE ) , over the issues of water privatization , and the reprehensible bottled - water industry .
She explained to me that “ large extractions of water , the size at which commercial bottled - water companies operate , can taper stream channels , alter temperatures fish rely upon for their life cycles , and can expend aquifers and other nearby water sources .
“ Furthermore , the impact goes far beyond the actual water extraction . ”
Smith explained that , “ the plastic bottles have their environmental impacts as well .
For one , the plastic bottles contain phthalates , which are chemical compounds that are added to plastics to increase their flexibility .
Phthalates have been known to be culpable for organ damage , adverse hormonal activity , and birth defects . ”
Plastic is a polymer , which is a very complex molecule .
When plastic is disposed of in a landfill , it takes thousands upon thousands of years for that polymer to break down .
In the U.S. approximately 60 - 70 million plastic water bottles are discarded every day .
The industrial process of manufacturing plastic bottles is very intensive as well .
It uses the equivalent of four pints of water to manufacture one plastic bottle .
A quote taken from the Chicago Tribune pretty much sums up a brief but comprehensive analysis of the water - bottle industry ’s uses :
“ The 1.5 million barrels of crude oil used each year to manufacture plastic water bottles in the U.S. could fuel 100,000 cars for a year [ or just stay in the ground and mitigate our military involvement in the Middle East ] .
Thousands of tons of greenhouse gases are emitted transporting bottled water around the world .
Just 23 percent of all plastic bottles are recycled , meaning 52 billion end up in landfills or littered . ”
Did you know that there is a trash vortex in the Pacific Ocean larger than the continental United States , and that there is now more plastic by weight than plankton ?
Phytoplankton populations are in inexorable decline .
Whale populations are in inexorable decline .
This is what I do know : People manufacture plastic while sea otters choke to death on polyethylene rings from beer six - packs .
People buy plastic while nylon nets strangle the lives out of great gulls .
People discard plastic into the landbases and oceans while plastics get lodged in sea turtles – killing them .
Fulmars wash ashore , lifeless , their stomachs distended with plastic .
Whales , too , have been found dead along shorelines , autopsies revealing stomachs bloated with plastics .
As we ’re all aware global warming is a consequence of green house gas emissions , especially CO2 emissions , and the water - bottling industry clearly is n’t helping the situation .
I was curious to hear what Smith had to say about the impact global warming will have on watersheds .
Her response was sharp : “ Drought is the equalizer , because you can have water extractions that do not seem to be having an impact , but in drought the impacts can turn a neighborhood from barely having enough water to having no water at all . ”
I was beginning to see some irony here , as the song goes : “ You do n’t miss your water ‘ til your well runs dry . ”
Annette was also kind enough to forward me information she had retrieved herself when she attended a symposium at the Omega Institute in upstate New York in 2003 , addressing the condition of the planet ’s fresh water resources .
The conference included some venerable and sagacious thinkers such as John Todd , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Ralph Nader , Winona Hauter , Maude Barlow , and the prolific , left of center author , Kirkpatrick Sale .
Annette was so impressed by Sale , that she attached a piece he had written following the conference .
I have to concur with Annette , it is quite poignant and so I ’d like to adduce an excerpt :
Of all the social and natural crises we humans [ and nonhumans ] face , the water crisis is the one that lies at the heart of our survival and that of our [ sic ] planet Earth .
No region will be spared from the impact of this crisis which touches every facet of life , from the health of children to the ability of nations to secure food for citizens .
Water supplies are falling while the demand is dramatically growing at an unsustainable rate .
In an article written last year by John Walters , in Montpelier ’s The Bridge , as a response to Montpelier Spring Water Co. ’s proposal “ … skeptics circulated a petition calling for a three - year moratorium on any large - scale withdrawal of East Montpelier – anything over 10,000 gallons a day . ”
The idea of the petition began with the lone voice of East Montpelier resident , Carolyn Shapiro .
She became outraged two years back after getting wind of the Montpelier Spring Water Co. ’s proposal in a local paper that “ covered a request from the fledgling water company for Montpelier City Council ’s approval work in the city ’s right - of - way . ”
She had harangued the selectboard for “ not informing the public of the company ’s application to the town and for not granting an information meeting after she presented the board with a petition signed by 60 East Montpelier residents . ”
Eventually , after much public concern , the petition came under Article 15 at East Montpelier ’s town meeting on March 4 , 2008 .
Dean Hedges , the town water manager , opposed the moratorium , stating : “ permitting by the State Agency of Natural Resources , Act 250 and oversight by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) would suffice enough to protect the town ’s water . ”
The idea of leaving this issue exclusively in the hands of the state to be dealt with legally did not seem like the best of ideas , considering how much influence corporate lobbyists have over politicians .
Moreso , I recalled Annette stating : “ The Clean Water Act required Zero Discharge and we [ the state ] are not doing that at all .
In Vermont , an attorney at ANR told me the other day that in his position it is legal to contaminate the groundwater under your site .
I asked another attorney in private practice and he said no it is n’t . ”
At the town meeting , Paul Earlbaum proposed an amendment to the moratorium , stating the selectboard and planning commission should “ take all steps necessary to realize the intent of …a three - year and three - week prohibition on withdrawing water … for the purpose of allowing citizens adequate time to gather information . ”
The meeting adjourned and the amendment was passed .
The citizens ’ voices proved not only to be loud , but effective , and there seemed to be a realization that this was more than just a fight against private industry – it was about preserving Vermont ’s pristine watershed .
As a result of East Montpelier ’s victory , Vermont Natural Resources Council was inspired to push for legislation that would enact law making it so Vermont ’s groundwater be mapped and accounted for ; to much success , the initiative received a great response and a write - up in the New York Times .
However , the issues surrounding water access around the world still remains dire and demanding .
Mexico
City has sunk more than thirty feet into the ground due to their extracting from the underlying aquifer .
Routine shutting off of taps has become compulsory as they are over 50 percent below their water table .
The same conditions exist in Beijing and Shanghai , China , as well as in many regions of India , Africa and the Global South .
Between 1970 and 2000 , virtually all vegetation of Madagascar ’s highland plateau had been lost to deforestation for irrigation and agriculture .
The endeavor transformed the country ’s biomass into a wasteland .
The detrimental effects are widespread erosion that produce heavily silted rivers that “ run red ; ” the loss of ecosystems , and species driven to the brink of extinction ; as well as the loss of fresh water , and coral reef reformations .
In California farmers are on strike because of drought conditions and lack of adequate water supply for agricultural purposes .
We ’re told this is an issue that is commensurate with a growing global population .
But the truth is , it is the result of social arrangements .
Ninety percent of the use of water is for industrial agriculture and the commodification of nature , viz . for the industrial production of consumables and energies .
Population growth is not responsible for the desiccation of fresh water as much as capitalism is , as much as industrial civilization is ( it is self - evident that cities do not have a clean source of fresh water – fluoridation does not count , to find out why , go buy some rat poison at your local grocer and read the ingredient – there ’s only one : sodium fluoride .
Or better yet , see how long it takes for one of your friends to take a swim in the Hudson in the NY Bay area ; I ’ll give you a hint at how long it ’ll take – unless s/he ’s fucking bonkers , you ’ll get well beyond quadruple - dog - dare ) .
If we want to preserve our freshwaters , it is imperative that our modes of production change radically , that the dams the world over come down – immediately , and by any means necessary ; and that water is not viewed objectively as a catalyst for generating financial wealth , meaning no more commercial bottled water .
Every river , stream , and brook in the continental U.S. is tainted with carcinogenic material .
There are approximately 41 million Americans drinking water that has traces of pharmaceuticals in it – in India the waters contain 150 times the highest levels of pharmaceutical contamination than in the U.S.
The reasons for this abuse to our watersheds and freshwaters runs deep folks , but if we want to preclude further devastation we must act now , we must engender what the residents in East Montpelier had last year , this time on a global scale .
In April 2000 , after weeks of civil disobedience and vehement protest in the streets , the president of Bolivia was forced by the popular upheaval to terminate the 40 - year water privatization contract granted to Aguas del Tunari .
This victory shows that if we align voices with actions , then community agency can direct what ’s in our best interest , and that is to preserve the natural world – especially its freshwaters .
It is almost too bizarre and disturbing to know that this sort of thing goes on in North America in modern times .
A Connecticut Church , Manifested Glory Ministries , posted a video on Youtube of what can only be described as a gay exorcism .
The video drew massive outrage on the site and was quickly removed , but not before someone recorded a partial copy ( see below ) .
A 16 year old boy , allegedly gay , appears in the video with members of the church and congregation and you can hear people yelling as they try to cast homosexual demons from the boy ’s body .
“ Rip it from his throat !
Come on , you homosexual demon !
You homosexual spirit , we call you out right now !
Loose your grip , Lucifer ! ” – one woman can be heard yelling .
During the original video , the boy was shown vomiting into a bag and appeard to be under a tremendous amount of mental and physical stress , bordering on shock .
The Associated Press got an interview with the minister at the church , Rev. Patricia McKinney , and she stated : “ We believe a man should be with a woman and a woman should be with a man .
We have nothing against homosexuals .
I just do n’t agree with their lifestyle . ”
Gay rights groups have had their say as well , and rightfully so .
Robin McHaelen , executive director of True Colors , an advocacy group for gay youths , said : “ I think it ’s horrifying .
What saddens me is the people that are doing this think they are doing something in the kid ’s best interests , when in fact they ’re murdering his spirit .
They have this kid in a full nelson .
That just seems abusive to me . ”
Personally , I ’m glad the video below is short ( the original was 20 minutes long ) because it sickened me to even think people can be so twisted in this day and age .
Here ’s the video clip below .
Prepare yourself – it ’s pretty disturbing .

What do you all think of THAT ?
Police in Flower Mound , Texas arrested and charged a 10 - year - old girl for fighting with her 13 - year - old sister in a park .
According to the elder sibling :
She pushed me , so I just walked away from it .
The third time she pushed me , we just started fighting .
The fight is being treated as a case of family violence by the Flower Mound police , the 10 - year - old has been charged with Class A misdemeanor assault .
Lt. Clay Pierce of the Flower Mound Police explains :
By state law we are required to take action and what we did , we detained the youngest one .
Both of them had some injuries .
The one showed more serious injuries , so the other one was detained .

I know I defend ( some ) remakes , but there are those occasions that cause me to vomit a little in my mouth and then brush my teeth for hours trying to get the taste out .
I just got back from spending an hour in the bathroom and no matter how hard I brushed , how much toothpaste I used , or how much mouthwash I swished , the taste just would n’t go away .
Alien is getting the ol’ reboot treatment , courtesy of the fine folks at 20th Century Fox .
Read on for the skinny .
Update ( 12:07 am , May 28 ) :
We just heard from a separate reliable source that Fox is possibly working on an origins story , as opposed to a straight - up remake .
Still …
In January we broke the news that Robert Rodriguez ’s Troublemaker Studios would be producing a reboot of Predator for 20th Century Fox .
Our regular tipster was proven correct once again as the story was confirmed in April .
Our tipster even scooped us on who would be penning the remake , now titled Predators .
So Mr. Anonymous is back again .
And being that 20th Century Fox is remaking Predator , it does n’t surprise me at all that Fox is also going back to their catalog for a reboot of Ridley Scott ’s Alien .
What our tipster informed us is that – opposite the Predator situation – the plan is to stick with the original concept of only one alien on the ship .
Michael Costigan , Ridley Scott and even Tony Scott are all on board to produce and have tapped Carl Rinsch to get beyond the camera and bring a new Ripley to the big screen .
Who is Carl Rinsch ?
I ’m being told he ’s a commercial / music video director and does work for Scott Free Productions , who is also producing the remake .
In the original , the terror begins when the crew of a spaceship investigates a transmission from a desolate planet , and discovers a life form that is perfectly evolved to annihilate mankind .
One by one , each crew member is slain until only Ripley is left , leading to an explosive conclusion that sets the stage for its stunning sequel , Aliens ( my favorite film of all - time ) .
We ’ll keep you posted on any updates , but that ’s what we got for you this evening .
Remember to take it as rumor until confirmed as many projects change through the course of development .
Adobe 's North America operations will remain closed this week in an effort to cut operating costs , says Bloomberg .
Employees have been asked to use their paid vacation days during the shut - down .
This forced vacation is in addition to the holiday shut - down between Christmas and New Year .
This is Adobe 's ( ADBE ) second shut - down this year .
The last one was in April , and the company plans to have at least one more this year .
This is a part of a bigger cost cutting plan , says Bloomberg :
The company has frozen salaries , trimmed bonuses and variable compensation plans , and curbed travel expenses , Chief Executive Officer Mark Garrett said in an April interview .
In December , the company fired about 8 percent of the workforce to help rein in costs during the economic slump .
Second - quarter sales fell 21 percent as customers held off upgrading to the latest version of Adobe ’s Creative Suite programs , which account for about 60 percent of revenue .

Scientists warn Australia is particularly vulnerable
Thousands of demonstrators have rallied across Australia to demand greater government action to protect the environment from climate change .
The National Climate Emergency Rallies called on Australia to take the lead at the UN environment summit in December in Copenhagen .
Activists also want an end to Australia 's dependence on cheap and plentiful supplies of coal .
It is one of the world 's worst per capita emitters of greenhouse gases .
' Strong grip '
Protesters were urged to wear red to highlight the risks of global warming .
In Sydney , rally organiser Moira Williams said that a coalition of trade unions and religious groups , as well as students and environmental campaigners , was pushing for immediate action .
" We need to be making these alliances and be stronger than the fossil fuel industry that currently has such a strong grip on climate policy in Australia .
" That is the positive in this rally and in this year - that we need to build that movement and it does need to come from the ground up , because at the moment we are not seeing any action from the top down . "
Scientists have warned that Australia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a shifting climate .
As temperatures increase , there are predictions that coastal communities will be threatened by rising sea levels , while other parts of the country could suffer more severe droughts , cyclones and bushfires .
The government in Canberra has repeatedly stressed that tackling climate change is a priority .
A newly discovered type of brain cell may help us prep for social interactions .
The cells are a special type of " mirror neurons , " which are thought to aid understanding of the actions and intentions of others .
Mirror neurons fire both when you do something , like grab a bottle of wine , and when you watch another person do the same thing .
Instead of carrying out a step - by - step reasoning process to figure out why a friend is grabbing a bottle of wine , we instantly understand what 's going on inside his head because it 's going on in our heads too .
Now , researchers have discovered some mirror neurons do n't just care about what another individual is doing , they also care about how far away they 're doing it , and , more importantly , whether there 's potential for interaction .

" This was very surprising for us , " said Antonino Casile of the University of Tübingen in Germany , co-author of the research , published in Science Thursday .
" The current view about mirror neurons is that they might underlie action understanding .
But the distance at which an action is performed plays no role in understanding what the others are doing . "
The findings suggest an expanded role for mirror neurons in social interaction .
Not only do they facilitate quick comprehension , but they may also help us instantly decide whether to respond and interact .
If our friend drops the bottle of wine , we 're ready to swoop in before it crashes to the floor .
When someone special puckers up , you do n't have to think before leaning in for the kiss .
The researchers located mirror neurons in the brains of two monkeys , which fired when the monkeys grabbed a small metal object and when they watched the experimenter do the same .
Unexpectedly many of these neurons actually had a preference for where the experimenter was grabbing the object — about a fourth of the cells fired more rapidly when the action took place within arm 's reach of the monkey ( its
" peripersonal " space ) , while another fourth were more excited when the action was out reach ( its " extrapersonal space " ) .
Over a range of distances , the closer the motion was to the monkey , the faster its peripersonal mirror neurons fired ; the extrapersonal mirror neurons had the opposite response .
Distance should n't make a difference for understanding or imitating a task , or for any of the commonly attributed functions of mirror neurons .
However , distance plays a fundamental role in deciding how to respond to behaviors .
" Our brain divides space into at least two major sectors — one in which we can do things , in which we can act , and one in which we can't , "
explained Marco Iacoboni , who studies the human mirror neuron system at the University of California at Los Angeles .
" Our cognition , even fairly complex stuff like empathy , seems grounded in our body . "
The researchers also demonstrated that it's not mere distance that affects these neurons , but more specifically , whether there is indeed potential to act .
They did the same tests with a clear barrier between the monkey and the experimenter 's grabbing , eliminating the possibility of interaction .
Even though the monkey never tried to grab the object during any of the experiments , the barrier stopped some peripersonal mirror neurons from firing , even when the grabbing was very close to the monkey .
Meanwhile , the extrapersonal mirror neurons stepped in and started firing .
Casile speculates that these mirror neurons are analyzing actions both to understand what others are doing and to decide what one could do in order to interact with them , and that these analyses are happening simultaneously .
" We might be deciding whether and how to interact with an action not after understanding it , but rather in parallel , " he said .
" Mirror neurons may be very important for social relations , " Iacoboni said .
" These new findings truly speak to this idea .
The neurons may be encoding actions in a way that 's essential for cooperating with others , and very important for social interactions . "

The research will look at how plants cope with cold , heat , pests and disease A Dundee scientist has been awarded £ 1 m to study the stresses that plants come under and how they will cope with things like climate change .
Professor John Brown is investigating alternative splicing - the process by which individual genes can produce several different proteins .
His research should give a clearer insight into why certain plants react better to changes in the environment .
Prof Brown 's laboratory is at the Scottish Crop Research Institute .
' Local conditions '
Prof Brown , who is also with Dundee University , said : " It 's known in plants that there are many many genes that undergo alternative splicing , which means many genes can give rise to many different proteins and under different stress conditions this alternative splicing can change .
" So under cold stress or hot stress for example , or when a pathogen or pest infects the plant , these can affect the expression of genes in a plant .
" So it 's really about how plants deal with their external conditions because , unlike us , if it 's cold they can't go inside and sit by the fire .
" They have to have this flexibility where they have all their normal cellular functions even though the temperature is minus four up to plus 30 . "
Prof Brown has attracted funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for his work .
He said : " One of the goals is to understand how plants respond to stress so that ultimately if temperatures go up people will be able to breed or generate new cultivars which will grow in different conditions .
" So , things which grow well here at the moment , if temperatures go up in Scotland , may grow less well in the future and therefore you would need to have cultivars which are adapted to local conditions . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
With the Memorial Day weekend and summer driving season approaching , motorists are facing a familiar trend -- surging gasoline prices .
But while pump prices have increased nearly 17 % over the last 24 days , and are likely to go even higher over the coming weeks , experts do n't foresee anything like the record levels of 2008 .
" An overall increase is not abnormal for this time of year , " said Bob van der Valk , a fuel - pricing analyst with 4 Refuel Inc. in Lynnwood , Wash .
" It will follow a similar trend , just starting at a lower price than 2008 did . "
He also cited recent refinery fires in California , Pennsylvania and Illinois , curtailing supply , as a reason for the current spike .
The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline increased Friday to $ 2.391 , up 2.9 cents in a daily survey compiled for motorist group AAA .
That 's the 24th consecutive increase , during which the price of gas has increased 34.3 cents , or 16.7 % .
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have regular unleaded gas prices of $ 2 and higher .
But the surge in prices is somewhat relative .
The average price is down 38 % from the $ 3.831 per gallon AAA reported one year ago .
And it 's down $ 1.72 or 41.8 % , from the record high of $ 4.114 set last July 17 .
Gas prices could increase to $ 2.41 this weekend , said Tom Kloza , publisher of Oil Price Information Service .
" That would be an astounding 50 % increase from November , " he noted .
" We have never seen a similar percentage increase from winter to spring . "
As a result of the comparatively lower prices , van der Valk said he expected Americans will drive more this summer when they take time off .
That was n't the case last year , when prices at the pump were volatile .
Soaring prices curtailed travel , and by July 17 gas prices had risen already 35 % year - over - year .
Consumers finally began to see a reprieve in August .
But late summer brought Hurricanes Gustav and Ike , and gas prices shot back up in September , reaching more than $ 5 per gallon in some parts of the country .
On Sept. 16 , gas prices started declining amid weakening demand as the global economic slowdown took hold .
Barring major hurricanes or other unforeseen events , van der Valk expects the average price to peak around $ 2.75 by Labor Day .
California and other West Coast states could see prices spike as high as $ 3 , he added .
Kloza does n't see quite as big a spike .
" If you believe in $ 3 gas , you believe in the Dow going back to 10,000 , " he said .
" Fundamentals are the only way prices will move higher -- and I do n't see that . "
Instead , Kloza predicted average national prices will peak this year around $ 2.50 -- and " we may be really close " to that level , he said .
And then , the cycle heads downward again .
" It could go below $ 2 by Christmas , " van der Valk said .
" People will say , ' Great , the gas companies are giving it away again . ' "
There is a new website http://iamdrtiller.com/ devoted to the memory of Dr. George Tiller , the abortion doctor who was shot and killed in his church .
The site contains letters and photos sent in from people .
In some ( but not all ) of the photos , people are holding signs saying “ I am Dr. Tiller ” over their faces .
So Bill O’Reilly is discussing the site with Amanda Carpenter on his show last week , and asks what must be one of the stupidest questions possible :
Why are they hiding their faces , Amanda , if it ’s such a noble cause ?
Mind you , O’Reilly is the person who kept calling the doctor “ Tiller the baby killer ” , a “ barbarian ” , “ murderer ” , said he was “ executing babies ” , compared him to Hitler and Stalin , and said that anyone who did n’t help stop him had “ blood on their hands ” .
So now he wants people to uncover their identities so he can demonize them on his TV show ?
Yeah , right .
Does O’Reilly want more blood on his hands ?
On a lighter note , all this reminds me of something that happened to me many years ago , when I was a volunteer doing clinic escorts .
Our job was to escort patients into health clinics to help them get through the phalanx of anti-abortion protesters .
One time , I had given a ride to another volunteer — a woman about my age — and as we were walking toward the clinic the pro-life forces started running after us , thinking we were a couple going to get an abortion .
They started screaming at us that we were killing our baby , and without thinking I spun around and yelled “ Ca n’t you see that she was raped by an Albanian dwarf ? ”
For some reason that stopped them in their tracks and they left us alone .
Apologies to any Albanians .
Bosnian state television has broadcast several video clips it says show war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic living freely in Serbia despite genocide charges filed against him by a UN tribunal in 1995 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Sarajevo - based TV Federacije did not say where it got the video footage aired late Wednesday .
But a Serbian official said it was part of the material that was impounded last December from Mladic 's Belgrade home , and handed over to UN prosecutors .
The station said the home videos were taken over a period of years , one as recently as 2008 .
But Belgrade officials claimed Thursday that the most recent was filmed in 2001 , when the former Bosnian Serb army commander was last seen in public before disappearing .
Mladic has been on the run since 1995 when the UN war crimes court in The Hague , Netherlands , indicted him on genocide charges for allegedly orchestrating the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica during Bosnia 's 1992 - 95 war — the worst carnage in Europe since World War II .
Pro-Western leaders in Belgrade have insisted they do not know where Mladic is , although their recent investigation revealed that he had been hiding in different apartments in a new part of Belgrade as recently as 2006 .
His capture is a condition for Serbian progress toward membership in the European Union .
Some of the footage showed him singing popular Serbian folk songs and dancing at weddings and private parties , as well as receiving guests at his house in a Belgrade neighborhood , or cuddling his baby granddaughter .
A video dated September 2000 showed him at a wedding party of one of his bodyguards in a restaurant near Sarajevo that is located near the main NATO base in Bosnia .
Another has him slowly walking on a snow - covered mountain path with a cane , looking significantly older than in other footage .
Another amateur video , apparently taken by someone from his family circle , shows him sitting in peaceful wooded surroundings of what the television said were Serbian Army military barracks .
The Serbian government official in charge of relations with the UN tribunal , Rasim Ljajic , said at an urgently called news conference that the footage was part of the material that was impounded last December from Mladic 's Belgrade home , and handed over to UN prosecutors .
Olga Kavran , spokeswoman for the UN tribunal 's prosecutor , confirmed that the prosecution possesses the same Mladic videos , but refused to comment on their context to avoid jeopardizing the search for the fugitive .
Ljajic alleged that the release of the videos was designed to " minimize a recent positive assessment about Serbia 's cooperation with the Hague tribunal " by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz .
" This is no coincidence , " he said .
" The timing suggests it was not done with good intention , " Ljajic added .
He was referring to Serbia 's efforts to persuade the Netherlands to allow the implementation of a European Union deal with Serbia even though Mladic is not in jail .
" He did n't take any notice of the leopard , just went straight over to the meat and started feeding himself .
But the leopard was pretty surprised - she bent down and sniffed the mouse and flinched a bit like she was scared .
On a rainy Saturday , Cameron Dolansky put on a metal - studded leather vest and a red tunic and headed to Neumont University ’s most raging weekend party .
It was n’t your usual college kegger .
A dozen students sat in a classroom frantically trying to kill the zombies racing across their computer screens .
A few more jammed to Rock Band , their musician avatars displayed on two projector screens .
Cans of Mountain Dew and fast - food wrappers littered the darkened room .
“ Back in high school , I was the lone geek , ” said Dolansky , who earned a rep on campus after he and his roommate played Rock Band for 72 hours straight .
“ Now I ’m surrounded by geeks . ”
Spread over two floors in a suburban office park south of Salt Lake City , Neumont University is devoted to pumping out a steady stream of experts in computer science -- the only major that students can choose .
The 6 - year - old school places its graduates in high - tech jobs at such companies as EBay Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp .
If trends hold up , more than 90 % of the 59 students graduating with bachelor ’s degrees today will find work within three months .

But surrounding introverted computer programmers with other introverted computer programmers creates unique challenges for school administrators .
Employers praise the skills of Neumont ’s graduates but complain about their computer addictions and difficulty socializing with colleagues .
For their part , some students grumble that their peers spend too much time playing video games and too little time in the shower .
So in addition to the intricacies of computer science , Neumont is trying to teach its students how to get along better in the real world .
Administrators forced them to close their laptops in class , established social clubs and required them to take courses in interpersonal communications and public speaking .
The efforts have met resistance .
After all , students ask , what ’s the purpose of attending a place known affectionately as “ Geek Heaven ” if you ’re not free to geek out whenever you choose ?

One impediment to organizing student parties at Neumont is the lack of dormitories ; students live off - campus .
Another is a major shortage of women , whose ranks the school is trying to increase .
Cameron Murray , a leather jacket - wearing 20 - year - old from Cleveland , estimates that the gender ratio is one woman in a billion ( it ’s actually 1 in 20 ) .
What ’s more , he complains , the women at Neumont “ are more like dudes with long hair , ” which hurts the dating scene .
Eager to flirt , he and eight other members of a student group known as the Gentlemen ’s Order moseyed down to a mall recently and split into teams to see who could get the most phone numbers from women .
The eager Lotharios wandered from food court to department store and back again , spending an afternoon in search of potential dates .
The sum total of their efforts : a single number .

“ We got shot down as hell -- it was horrible , ” Murray said .
The Gentlemen ’s Order is one of five social clubs launched in September .
Administrators refer to the orders as fraternities without the alcohol .
“ We know that forming relationships outside of the classroom is an important part of the college experience , ” Neumont President Edward Levine said .
The orders still tend toward the geeky .
There ’s Game Shark Order , for students who like video games , and Beyond the Screen , for those who enjoy tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons .
Advertisement
The Gentlemen ’s Order is an outlier .
Murray says he created it to show students how to attract women and have a good time .
“ I do n’t think anybody has enough fun at Neumont -- it ’s a bunch of people addicted to sitting in their mom ’s basement playing World of Warcraft and drinking Dr Peppers , ” said Murray , who himself was drinking a can of Dr Pepper at 8 a.m. on a Friday .
He might have a point .
Instead of Mardi Gras , students hold Nerdi Gras , a video game party featuring “ nothing that would ever happen at Mardi Gras , ” according to organizer Keith McIff .
And though the student commons does n’t have couches or fast food ( or for that matter , any hot food at all ) , it does have a “ Star Trek ” pinball machine , a pingpong table and a flat - screen TV frequently hooked up to Nintendo ’s Super Smash Bros .
Brawl .

Some of Neumont ’s female students , who make up about 5 % of the 266 enrolled this year , are on a mission to get their peers to tune in to the world around them .
In October , one posted a message on Neumont ’s Web forums protesting what she called “ offensive odors . ”
“ The truth is there are people in this school who just do n’t smell pleasant at all , ” she wrote .
The post generated more than a dozen replies , with students suggesting the creation of a personal - hygiene company , a crackdown on halitosis , and a three - shower - a - day regimen .
“ People ( who probably just get busy and distracted by their passion for coding ) need to remember to take care of themselves as well as they care for their machines , ” Stacy Hughes , the school ’s communications manager , wrote on the forum .
Advertisement
It should n’t be a surprise that Neumont students spend so much time in front of their computers .
The school ’s mission is to teach students how to be valuable computer programmers in just 2 1/2 years .
The for - profit university was established in 2003 under the name Northface University and changed in 2005 to Neumont , or New Mountain , likewise an allusion to climbing a difficult peak .
For $ 28,800 tuition , students attend eight hours a day , five days a week , year - round with a few weeks off .
The school attracts people who do n’t mind the grueling schedule , the accelerated format or the fact that everyone lives off - campus .
“ It ended up being kind of a Hogwarts environment where everyone ends up saying , ‘ Everyone here is like me , ’ ” said Graham Doxey , one of Neumont ’s three founders and its president until late 2007 , referring to Harry Potter ’s school .
When the students graduate , though , they will need to know how to socialize with people who are n’t like them , which is why students are required to take three classes about communicating with others .

During a lecture for Collaborative and Interpersonal Communications I , students leaned back in their chairs while instructor Paul Parkin moved around the room to hold their waning interest .
Cars snaked by on the highway outside the window below snow - covered mountains .
“ My goal is to heighten your awareness so you have the skills necessary to not carry germs into your relationships , ” Parkin said .
Two guys wearing aviator sunglasses mumbled to each other , ignoring the lecture , while a few students dressed in Dungeons & Dragons T - shirts took notes .
“ You have to look up from your computer screens from time to time , ” Parkin told them .
“ This will also help you if you ’re in a relationship . ”
Advertisement
“ We do n’t have many of those , ” a student retorted .
The classroom erupted into raucous laughter .
This kind of mocking and even flat - out resistance is a common response to Neumont ’s efforts to entice students out of their computer - aided comfort zones .
That includes the “ Laptops Up ” policy , introduced last month , which mandates that students close their computers in class at their instructors ’ request .
Hughes , the communications director , said the school adopted the policy after employers reported that though Neumont grads were good at programming , they were too distracted by their notebook computers during meetings .
Neumont students reacted to Laptops
Up in the same way students on other campuses might react to a crackdown on alcohol : with rage .

“ War Is Peace / Freedom Is Slavery / Ignorance Is Strength / Laptops Up Is Laptops Down ” reads a sticker distributed on campus by Joshua Boston , an 18 - year - old Florida native who was wearing computer wires as bracelets and welding goggles .
But even Boston conceded that something needed to be done to stir students out of their torpor .
He once tried to organize a movie outing , he said , but his friends bailed because they preferred to stage a raid in the computer game World of Warcraft .
“ There are skills we need beyond grunting over our laptops , ” Boston said .

Hanging out in the typical college sense -- beer bashes , football games -- does n’t appeal to many at Neumont , said Sam Lippert , a 19 - year - old student from Duluth , Minn .
He was attending the Saturday afternoon video game party because he said he was bored .
“ The social scene has never really been my thing , ” he said .
Greg Whelan , a prospective student visiting from Seneca , Ore. , said he liked the idea that everyone at the school was interested in the same thing .
“ I do n’t mind geeks , ” he said .
There ’s another reason Neumont students do n’t socialize much :
They work really hard , taking a hefty helping of such courses as Algorithms and Data Structures I , Software Engineering Methodologies , and Applications of Human Computer Interface Design .
“ I might be missing a whole laid - back year of college , ” said Christina Dessi , a 19 - year - old from Eastham , Mass .
“ But my friends at other colleges might not be able to get a job . ”

Dolansky , the Rock Band - playing tunic wearer , said that although he envies the wild college experience and worry - free summers his friends at other schools are experiencing , he knows they ’re jealous that most grads from his school land jobs when they ’re only 20 .
Plus he can be himself at Neumont , he said , pulling his cellphone from a leather pouch to field a call .
No one will mock him because he loves Dagorhir , a role - playing game inspired by “ The Lord of the Rings ” in which he dresses up in period clothing and fights opponents with foam swords .
“ Here , ” he said , “ I feel at home . ”

Met een heftige buikpijn werd de 37 - jarige Joyce Echaquan , moeder van 7 kinderen , naar het ziekenhuis gebracht , maar in plaats van haar te helpen werd ze door de verpleegsters compleet aan haar lot overgelaten én kreeg ze ook nog eens veel te veel medicatie toegediend waarvoor ze allergisch is .
Dit alles was nooit aan het licht gekomen als ze niet een livevideo van zichzelf op Facebook had gezet .
Tegen het einde van de video , die ongeveer zeven minuten duurt , komt het ziekenhuispersoneel de kamer binnengelopen .
De verpleegsters slingeren al snel diverse grove en denigrerende opmerkingen naar haar hoofd .
, , Ben je nu klaar met rotzooien ?
Je bent echt zo dom .
Je hebt duidelijk slechte keuzes in je leven gemaakt .
Wat zouden je kinderen denken als ze je zo zouden zien ?
Denk eens aan hen . ”

Volgens een nicht van Joyce werd ze vanwege hartproblemen regelmatig in het ziekenhuis opgenomen waar ze regelmatig met discriminatie te maken kreeg .
Er is een onderzoek gestart naar stelselmatige discriminatie en grove nalatigheid onder het ziekenhuispersoon .
Eén van de verpleegsters is naar verluidt op non-actief gezet .
Inmiddels is er ook een fundraser voor haar familie opgezet waar op dit moment meer dan $ 80.000 is ingezameld .

MOSCOW , June 6 ( UPI ) --
Two astronauts on the International Space Station tested new Russian - made suits during five hours of work on the docking system , station officials said .
Russian commander Gennady Padalka and U.S. flight engineer Michael Barratt Friday wore Orlan - MK computerized space suits to install three antennas on the Kurs auto - docking system , RIA Novosti reported Saturday .

The Orlan - MK suits have a mini-computer in their life support system backpack which monitors the suit 's systems and issues a warning during malfunctions .
The computer then gives the astronauts a contingency plan , displayed on an LCD screen attached to the right breast of the suit .
Previously , astronauts had to memorize responses to emergency situations and then try to recall them during the stress of a malfunction , Russian space officials said .
During a second spacewalk scheduled for June 10 , Padalka and Barratt are to work in the depressurized docking bay of the Zvezda module to install a docking cone , RIA Novosti reported .
An Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) interferogram over the L’Aquila area in central Italy showing the deformation pattern caused by the seismic events in early April 2009 .
This interferogram was generated by Italy ’s Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dell ’ Ambiente ( IREA - CNR ) in Naples , Italy just a few hours after Envisat ’s acquisition on 12 April 2009 .
It combines that acquisition with a pre-seismic acquisition on 1 February 2009 , with an estimated baseline ( separation between the two Envisat orbital positions ) of about 154 m .
The satellite ’s right - looking angle is 23 degrees .
Each fringe of the interferogram , corresponding to a colour cycle , is equivalent to an Earth surface displacement of 2.8 cm along the satellite direction .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Studying satellite radar data from ESA 's Envisat and the Italian Space Agency 's COSMO - SkyMed , scientists have begun analysing the movement of Earth during and after the 6.3 earthquake that shook the medieval town of L'Aquila in central Italy on 6 April 2009 .
Scientists from Italy's Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dell ' Ambiente ( IREA - CNR ) and the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia ( INGV ) are studying Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR ) data from these satellites to map surface deformations after the earthquake and the numerous aftershocks that have followed .
The scientists are using a technique known as SAR Interferometry ( InSAR ) , a sophisticated version of ' spot the difference ' .
InSAR involves combining two or more radar images of the same ground location in such a way that very precise measurements - down to a scale of a few millimetres - can be made of any ground motion taking place between image acquisitions .
The InSAR technique merges data acquired before and after the earthquake to generate ' interferogram ' images that appear as rainbow - coloured interference patterns .
A complete set of coloured bands , called ' fringes ' , represents ground movement relative to the spacecraft of half a wavelength , which is 2.8 cm in the case of Envisat 's ASAR .

The first Envisat data , acquired after the earthquake on 12 April , were made immediately available to the scientists .
" We produced an interferogram just a few hours after the Envisat acquisition by combining these data with data acquired before the earthquake on 1 February .
We were pleased that we were able to immediately see the pattern of the earthquake , " said Riccardo Lanari of IREA -CNR in Naples , Italy .
The Envisat interferogram , as explained by Stefano Salvi from INGV 's Earthquake Remote Sensing Group , shows nine fringes surrounding a maximum displacement area located midway between L'Aquila and Fossa , where the ground moved as much as 25 cm ( along a line between the satellite 's orbital position and the earthquake area ) .
" By using available 3D ground displacements from five GPS location sites around the affected area , we were able to confirm the preliminary results obtained with Envisat data , " Salvi said .
The COSMO - SkyMed constellation , which is currently made up of three satellites , allows for frequent data .
This means new interferograms can be calculated every few days .
The COSMO - SkyMed data together with the Envisat data and possibly SAR data from other satellites will ensure a dense sampling of the ground deformation around the L'Aquila area in the next months , which could make this earthquake one of the most covered by SAR Interferometry measurements .
To ensure all scientists are able to contribute to the analysis of the earthquake , ESA is making its Earth observation dataset collected over the L'Aquila area freely accessible with an innovative fast data download mechanism .
The dataset will be continuously updated with the newest Envisat acquisitions .

Do Bigfin reef squid listen out for predatory whales ?
Octopus and squid can hear .
The discovery resolves a century - long debate over whether cephalopods , the group of sea creatures that includes octopus , squid , cuttlefish and nautiluses , can hear sounds underwater .
Compared to fish , octopus and squid do not appear to hear particularly well .
But the fact they can hear raises the possibility that these intelligent animals may use sound to catch prey , communicate with one another or listen out for predators .
The question of whether cephalopods can perceive sound has been controversial since the early 20th Century .
Some experiments suggested that blind octopus seemed able to locate the sounds produced by boats or by tapping on the outside of a tank .
But most cephalopods lack a gas - filled chamber , such as the swim bladders that fish can use to hear .
That suggested they could not detect the pressure wave component of sound .
However , sensory physiologist Hong Young Yan of the Taiwan National Academy of Science in Taipei , Taiwan suspected that octopus and squid might use another organ called the statocyst to register sound .
An octopus 's hearing is tuned to life on the seafloor
The statocyst is a sac - like structure containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs .
Fish also use it to detect sounds , and in previous research , Yan showed that prawns can use their statocysts to hear .
" So we extended our work from prawns to cephalopods , " says Yan .
Yan 's team tested the auditory capabilities of two species , the Common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana , often called the Bigfin reef squid .
They discovered that the octopus can hear sounds between 400 Hz and 1000 Hz .
The squid can hear an wider range of sound from 400 Hz to 1500 Hz , they report in Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology , Part A . " That indicates that squid have a better hearing capability than the octopus , " says Yan .
" Interestingly though , both species hear best at a frequency of 600 Hz . "
Yan 's team had to overcome particular technical challenges to investigate the cephalopods ' hearing ability .
The usual way to prove that an organism can hear is to measure how its nervous system electrically responds to sound .
But that can involve directly attaching electrodes to exposed nerves , an invasive procedure that could harm delicate cephalopods .
So Yan invented a non-invasive method , which involves placing electrodes on an animal 's body to measure the electrical activity in its brain .
In this way , he could measure within just a couple of hours whether the brain of an octopus or squid responds to sound .
Avoiding being eaten
The discovery could open up a new understanding of cephalopod behaviour .
" The key question which I would like to investigate is what kind of sounds are they listening to ? " says Yan .
" Perhaps they listen to sound to evade predators and can eavesdrop to sounds made by their prey .
Or , perhaps they even could make sounds to communicate among themselves . "
For example , because octopus or squid do not possess gas - filled chambers within their bodies , they cannot amplify sounds , limiting their hearing ability .
But they can hear as well as invertebrates such as prawns , although less well than many species of fish and the toothed whales which often eat them .
A Bigfin reef squid undergoes a non-invasive hearing test " Squid are heavily preyed upon by toothed whales including dolphins .
So perhaps their hearing would aid them to avoid the pinging sounds made by dolphins , " says Yan .
He says the different abilities of the octopus and squid also reflect the environment they live in .
The common octopus dwells on the seabed , which is covered by large rocks , boulders , coral reef and other features .
In water , sounds above 1000 Hz have a wavelength less than 1.5 m .
Such sound waves cannot in turn pass objects greater than 1.5 m in size , and they get deflected , which could explain why the octopus does n't need to hear them .
Squid live in the open water where there are fewer obstacles , and therefore sounds pass uninterrupted over a greater frequency range .

A judge at a preliminary hearing has the authority to order a complainant in a sexual assault case to remove her veil while testifying if he or she believes it 's not being worn for religious reasons , a just - released court ruling says .
Last fall , Ontario Court Justice Norris Weisman ordered a Muslim woman to testify with her face bared after finding her " religious belief is not that strong . . . and that it is , as she says , a matter of comfort . "
The woman asked the Superior Court to overturn the ruling .
Superior Court Justice Frank Marrocco considered the application during a hearing in March and in a 38 - page written ruling released today agreed to quash Weisman 's decision .
However , Marrocco refused to grant the woman 's order permitting her to wear her niqab while testifying once the preliminary hearing resumes .
Instead , Marrocco says Weisman will have to conduct another hearing about the issue since he did n't explore it far enough before making his decision .
" The failure to explore the limits and exceptions of the applicant 's professed religious belief may have resulted in the preliminary inquiry judge mischaracterizing the applicant 's evidence as an assertion that wearing the veil was a matter of comfort , " Marrocco wrote .
However , Marrocco says Weisman , as the preliminary judge , is within his jurisdiction to rule on the matter once a more thorough hearing is held .
" At risk of stating the obvious , if the preliminary inquiry judge is not satisfied by the applicant that she is wearing a veil for a religious or other valid reason , he has the authority ... to order her to remove it , provided he is satisfied that he must make such an order to regulate the preliminary inquiry in a way consistent with the Criminal Code . "
Lawyer David Butt , who represented the woman at the preliminary hearing and also argued the issue in front of Marrocco , said his client needs time to review and consider the " complicated " ruling .
" It appears to be saying on the one hand , that the preliminary inquiry judge inappropriately weighed in on Charter issues at a preliminary inquiry .
On the other hand , it also appears to be saying that if the judge went a different route he or she could do precisely that at the preliminary inquiry anyway , " Butt said today .
" In that sense , there does appear to be two different directions coming out of the judgement and that 's something obviously my client will have to look very carefully at in terms of considering how to go forward from here . "

The preliminary hearing is set to resume Aug. 19 .
Butt said his client now has two choices : whether to return to court that day " and in which case this judgement would govern what would unfold from there . "
She also has the option of appealing Marrocco 's decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal .
" Because the judgement is in a new area and it's a very complicated set of reasons that 's going to require some thought and careful attention . "
After his wife left him , Tony Alleyne set out to create the ultimate bachelor pad , painstakingly turning his flat in Hinckley , Leicestershire into a Star Trek set .
Mr Alleyne hand - crafted all the furnishings himself , cutting timber and plexigas to create the futuristic look .
He started the project in 1999 and completed it in 2004 , but then decided to give the flat a Star Trek : Voyager make - over .
“ I have always considered that of all the Starfleet ships , Voyager is , in terms of interior , the luxury liner of the galaxy , ” he says .
The 500 - square - foot apartment features voice - activated lighting , LED lighting , running lights , air - conditioning – but no bed .
A few years ago Mr Alleyne suffered from sciatica and was advised by his GP to sleep on the floor .
“ It cured the sciatica and gave me the opportunity to convert the bed area into the Transporter area , ” he says .
“ Bed space is overrated ”

Heinz creates world 's smallest microwave ( and you can plug it into your laptop )
It is the world 's smallest , portable microwave and can be powered via a link to the USB port on a laptop computer .
The turquoise device - called the Beanzawave - has been created in partnership with Heinz to allow workers tied to their desks to create a warm snack , or hot drink , to see them through the day .
However , it might also sustain a hard - working student through the many hours of lonely revision .
Heinz has come up with a novel device that will heat up food at the desk of busy workers
And the convenience of powering it from a laptop computer means you could tuck into a hot snack while flying on holiday or even on the train .
To date , the device , which stands just 7.4inches tall by 6.2in wide and 5.9in deep , is only a prototype .
However , experts at the Microwave Association insist the sophisticated miniaturised technology does exist to turn the eye - catching gadget into a reality .
The mini-micro has been designed by microwave expert Gordon Andrews and Stephen Frazer , an authority on industrial design and managng director of Frazer Designers .
Apart from its size , the key breakthrough is the use of a combination of mobile phone radio frequencies to create the heat to cook both on the outside and within in under a minute .
Mr Andrews , the managing director of GAMA Microwave Technology , said it is possible to ' tune ' the radio - frequencies to provide the best results with any small product .
' It is possible to heat a pie , a burger , a cup of soup or tea in quick time , ' he said .
' There is the option of powering it with lithium ion batteries that would make it completely portable , which would be a help to fishermen , campers or sportsmen . '
Mr Andrews said he created the oven after being approached for help by Heinz , who wanted a portable microwave that would work with its Snap Pots .
The Beanzawave is powered from a USB cable plugged into a computer
The main drawback , with component prices at current levels , is the fact that the mini-micro would carry a hefty price of around £ 100 .
However , just as mobile phones have become cheaper , so the cost of production could fall to the point where it becomes profitable to manufacture on a large scale .
Mr Andrews said the product conforms with all the safety standards of a normal microwave oven , including protective walls and a door mechanism which kills the power when it opens .
Heinz claims there is a ready market for the ovens .
Its research found 69 per cent of office workers find they are so busy at their terminals that they do not have a chance to go out for lunch every day .
Heinz Beanz marketing manager , John Alderman , said : ' Heinz Beanz and Hoops Snap Pots are one of the most innovative and successful new product launches in this category for the last two years , boasting sales of over £ 22 million .
' They were designed in response to the changing eating habits of Brits , who require a quick solution to mealtimes , a trend which is even more relevant in today ’s environment .
' The single serve microwavable Snap Pots allow people to quickly heat and eat .
We are therefore delighted to be working with Gordon as the Beanzawave is the perfect partner to Heinz Snap Pots , allowing a nutritious snack to be whipped up anywhere in just 60 seconds . '
Heinz said that any decision on whether to support production will depend on the feedback it receives from the public .
If you let yourself get tempted into installing the pirated versions of iWork or Photoshop CS4 that circulated on Bit Torrent earlier this year , you may have unwittingly turned your Mac into a zombie .
Security researchers for Symantec have turned up evidence that these zombie machines are being used to create a Mac - based botnet .
Botnets are used to perform DDoS attacks on systems , gather sensitive personal information , and send out a majority of the spam that clogs up the ' Net .
While commonly made out of infected Windows computers , this is the first known attempt to create one from Macs .
The two variants of the iServices trojan , OSX .
Trojan.iServices .
A and OSX .
Trojan.iServices .B , have been implicated in at least one DDoS attack .
According to researchers Mario Ballano Barcena and Alfredo Pesoli , the malware has peer - to - peer communication , remote start - up , and encryption capabilities .
" The code indicates that , wherever possible , the author tried to use the most flexible and extendible approach when creating it — and therefore we would not be surprised to see a new , modified variant in the near future , " according to their report .
They also noted that the person who activated the botnet is not the same as the original author of the malware code .
After the trojans were reported in January , most anti-virus software was updated to remove the payloads associated with the iServices trojans .
Removing the directories / System / Library / StartupItems / DivX and / or / System / Library / StartupItems / iWorkServices should help , but that does n't rule out other remnants getting left behind — if you suspect you were infected with either of these trojans , you may want to look into AV software .
We 'll also again repeat our favored refrain of " Steer clear of pirated software and sketchy files from website or torrents , " which should help you avoid infection in the first place .
While Mac OS
X does n't suffer from the sheer amount of malware that Windows does , the creation of this botnet should serve as a warning that security through obscurity is n't a sound security policy — and Macs are far from being obscure any more .

Vienna ’s Schonbrunn Zoo
Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna is host to a fascinating series of temporary art installations by Christoph Steinbrener and Rainer Dempf .
In one animal enclosure , the German duo have half - submerged a car in a watering hole used by the resident rhinos .
In another enclosure , penguins frolic in the shadow of an oil pump , and in yet another , alligators must share their modest bayou with a bathtub and a monster truck tire .
( Pics )
According to the artists , these scenes of ecological nightmares are “ experimental set - up [s ] ” in which “ the viewer is forced to reconsider traditional modes of animal presentation and simultaneously to question the authenticity of concepts which are restaging ‘ natural ’ environments while they are increasingly endangered . ”
Quoting further : “ Present - day conceptions of zoological gardens aim at the presentation of animals in an idyllic and apparently natural environment , untouched by civilization .
But this is a contemporary conception , since courtly menageries and kennels were adapted to the exposure of animals as decorative objects .
Until the early years of the 20th century , animals were part of a preferably spectacular and exotic staging , to the entertainment and amazement of the public .
The artificial and the sensational were foregrounded , without creating a realistic setting of the natural environment of the animals . ”
The installations will last until October 18 , 2009 .

In a 2007 interview , Smith admitted to studying Scientology with Tom Cruise , but then probably realized how crazy that sounded and backpedaled with a weak qualification that he 's a " student of world religions " in general .
" Ninety - eight percent of the principles [ in Scientology ] are identical to the principles of the Bible ...
I do n't think that because the word someone uses for spirit is ' thetan ' that the definition becomes any different . "
Big Willy

But the biggest indicator that Will thought Men In Black was a documentary was when he and Jada spent millions to found the New Village Leadership Academy , a school based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard .
When an actor thinks he 's smart enough to educate his children in his kitchen , that 's a harmless joke , because everyone sort of understands that Will Smith 's kids are going to grow up and be retarded , and that 's funny .
But when he builds a school and starts handing out diplomas to the neighborhood kids , the joke 's gone a little too far .

Welcome to rock bottom , Hitchens - San ...
A penetrating look at a Japan still reeling from TWO economic earthquakes
I dived beneath the kitchen table as the floor trembled and heaved beneath me .
A pan clattered from the stove , the furniture tottered .
An unsettling roaring noise seemed to surround me .
It was an earthquake .
But I had , literally , asked for it .
Japan must be the only place in the world where you can learn how to behave in an earthquake , by undergoing a remarkably realistic simulation .
Showing off , as usual , I had requested the most violent version possible , equivalent to the 1995 Kobe upheaval which flattened hundreds of buildings , snapped a motorway in two and killed more than 4,000 people .
Wrong track : Peter Hitchens finds that even a brief pause for a photo is n't allowed to disturb the perfection of Japan 's rail system
It turned out to be a much nastier and more disturbing experience than I had bargained for , the ground pushing painfully and queasily against my knees as I cowered , wishing it would stop .
Anyone in Tokyo can undergo this rather odd experience , provided by the capital 's fire brigade at several special ' safety learning centres ' , along with an unsettling instructional film on how to survive when the Big One strikes , as it is bound to do sooner or later .
This is a country where everyone is accustomed to the idea of sudden , irresistible disaster .
Small and medium - sized earthquakes are normal and frequent .
Huge , devastating ones are all too common .
Nor are earthquakes the only sudden horrors in the national memory .
Japan has the only two cities in the world which have been destroyed by nuclear weapons , when an ordinary morning turned into Hell in half a second .
Many still living recall the great incendiary bombing raid of March 1945 that destroyed half of Tokyo in a night and wiped out more people than either atomic bomb .
But the earthquake that is troubling everyone now is an economic one .
Japan went bust in the early Nineties in an eerie foretaste of the collapse which has now overtaken the rest of the world .
A bubble of growth based on inflated property prices and a frenzied building boom burst , leaving what had once been the world 's most impressive economy limp and wheezing , deflated and unable to recover .
Nothing , it seemed , would bring Japan back to life .
The banks would n't lend .
Deflation set in .
House prices sank .
Grandiose spending projects - of the kind now being planned in the United States and Europe - were tried to the limit .
All over Japan you can see the monstrous concrete stilts of uncompleted motorways or bridges stretching into the distance .
The country has more football stadiums than it knows what to do with - especially given that baseball is really the national sport .
Even now , there are giant new towers uncompleted in central Tokyo .
Smooth ( and often superfluous ) roads and railways , smart new bullet trains and majestic office blocks crowd the already cramped landscape .
A new airport , costing £ 1 billion , has just opened at Shizuoka in an area well - served by the fastest and most reliable trains in the world , and so near Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports that nobody can really work out what it is supposed to be for , except to stimulate the economy .
With their usual virtue , discipline and dedication , the Japanese did eventually manage to clamber out of the hole they had fallen into .
Appliance of science : Dr Maria Niino with a selection of the fake fingers that she sells to maimed gangsters
They did what Britain and America ought to do , and redoubled their efforts to make things the world wants , at prices it can afford .
Well - run car and electronics companies turned out excellent products .
And , just as prosperity was returning , New York succumbed to the sub - prime catastrophe , the customers vanished and recession reappeared , this time thanks to someone else 's bursting bubble .
However good Japan 's products were , the major Western countries no longer had the cash to buy them .
Virtue went unrewarded - punished , in fact .
Down they went again , Gross Domestic Product shrank by more than 15 per cent in a single quarter and thousands were abruptly thrown out of work in car plants and TV factories .
In any society , this would bring problems .
But Japan is not like anywhere else .
Among Tokyo's sparkling towers and madly busy streets , you get a strong feeling of being in a different universe from ours , a feeling strengthened by the way British mobile phones are not advanced enough to work here , and your cashpoint card is rejected with an almost audible sneer by most Japanese bank machines .
As a Japanese friend said : ' We are on another planet here , the only place that has not globalised . '
In many ways this is a conservative paradise .
Though Tokyo is not as severely conformist as when I first saw it almost 30 years ago , some things have not changed .
Men still see too little of their children because of ferocious work pressure .
Karoshi , or death from overwork , is still common - often happening on crammed commuter trains after an over - long day of stress and smoking .
The regiments of salary - men with identical suits and hairstyles , all spookily opening their identical umbrellas in unison at the first sign of rain , have been replaced by a much more varied people , as adventurous with their hair and clothes as most Westerners ( though in a fundamentally tasteful and orderly way ) .
Even the umbrellas are multi-coloured these days , and the feeling of being in a beehive state where all think alike has faded , if not completely gone .
But beneath a thin layer of fashion , the ancient and harmonious Japan still lives and breathes .
The old are respected .
Immigration ( we shall come to that ) is more severely restricted than in any other major industrial nation .
Education is tough and mercilessly selective .
Street crime and disorder are virtually unknown .
You and your property are safer here than anywhere else on Earth .
The rare perpetrators of heinous murders are hanged , and the public approve .
Most women still give up paid work at marriage , whereupon they run the home with an iron hand and their husbands hand over their wage packets , and control of the family budget , to them .
Face off : Peter Hitchens meets a robot ' secretary ' - a symbol of Japan 's high - tech wizardry
Each small neighbourhood is under the care of its own jichi kaicho , an elected community leader who keeps an eye on the old and ill and discourages anti-social behaviour with a quiet word here and there .
Everyone has beautiful manners .
You bow - and get bowed to - when you buy a pizza or ask directions .
I am greeted as Hitchens - San , the equivalent of Mr Hitchens , wherever I go .
Self - restraint is almost universal .
Outbreaks of temper are hugely frowned on and quelled with a cold stare or a single word of rebuke .
Schoolchildren in their early teens sit quietly as they wait for trains , quite unlike the noisy and menacing gaggles you so often see in Britain .
The same children can freely walk or bike to school through neighbourhoods safer and more settled than we can nowadays imagine .
As your impossibly shiny and tidy train glides into Tokyo central station right on time , platoons of cleaning women , smartly dressed in pink uniforms like a sort of SWAT team of Fifties housewives , stand ready with brushes and cloths to get it even cleaner before it leaves on its next journey .
Department stores employ smiley squads of lift girls with gloves and hats , as if it is still 1936 .
Even gangsters want to be respectable .
Dr Maria Niino runs a successful business providing replacement fingers for members of the Yakuza - Japan 's mafia - who have had the originals chopped off in gory punishment rituals , but do n't want their associations to be obvious to friends and neighbours , or possible employers .
Her convincingly gnarled and ugly fake digits , she says , come in handy at awkward social moments :
' They 're especially useful at a wedding or a funeral where you need to clap your hands , necessary in Shinto rituals .
And you can't travel to Hawaii these days without a full complement of fingers , so I supply them with fingerprints as well , to cope with US immigration . '
The price is nearly £ 3,000 a finger , plus £ 900 for a spare : expensive for those who have suffered double or triple amputations .
So what happens when people fall off the edge of this perfect - seeming planet ?
For the double shock , of the bursting bubble and the Wall Street collapse , has undoubtedly caused grave hurt .
The first to suffer are the immigrants .
And here Japan has unintentionally conducted an astonishing experiment which establishes once and for all that it is culture and upbringing , not blood and genes , which determine where and how you fit in and who and what you are .
Back in 1990 , Japan 's rulers began to wonder how to cope with an ageing population and a falling birthrate , without destroying the country 's unique culture .
They needed workers to do the jobs known as the Three Ks - kitsui , kitanai , kiken , or hard , dirty and dangerous .
World apart :
The uniformed lift attendants in a luxurious Tokyo department store seem a million miles from the parks where the homeless congregate
The authorities decided to encourage immigration from Brazil , where many Japanese families had emigrated about a century before and where there are now more than a million ethnic Japanese .
The idea was that , being basically Japanese , the Brazilians would fit in .
It was not to be .
More than 300,000 came from Brazil and Peru .
Many of them ended up in Hamamatsu , a neat if dreary industrial city , making TV sets and cars , two hours south of Tokyo by Shinkansen bullet train .
There , all too many of them did not , would not , or perhaps could not , fit in .
Coming from a chaotic , loud land of carnivals and exuberance , they found it difficult to belong in a place where failing to sort your rubbish into burnable and non-burnable items is a major affront to public morals , and modesty is very highly valued .
Having been raised in Brazil 's outgoing sunshine culture , with perhaps a few words of old - fashioned Japanese learned from grandparents with vague memories of the homeland long ago , they swiftly encountered problems over their graffiti , loud music , unruly children and generally non-Japanese behaviour .
Shops , claiming that the migrants stole from them , began to sprout signs saying ' No Brazilians ' , which were eventually taken down after protests .
But the sentiment lingers on and the experiment is coming to a sad end .
To me , these rather tragic people look completely Japanese .
But my Japanese guide could immediately tell that they were different .
Even the set of their faces , formed by speaking Portuguese rather than Japanese , marked them out .
So did their very different diet .
And - even where they spoke good Japanese - their accents instantly gave them away .
Now many are on the dole , which in Japan means relatively generous unemployment benefit for a few months , followed by severely means - tested and regulated minimal benefits reserved for those who really cannot work - in practice , for many people , nothing at all .
Late in the evening in a bare and harshly - lit cafe , in the corner of a Brazilian supermarket selling specialities from Rio and Sao Paolo , I met Shuichi Shimomoto , who has lost his job in a TV plant and hopes to find new work before his benefits run out .
But what if he does n't get another job ?
He wants to stay , but knows it will be difficult .
' A lot of my friends have already gone back to Brazil . ' he admits .
The authorities are offering £ 2,000 to anyone who goes back to South America , provided they stay away for three years ( to begin with the money came on condition that you never came back at all , but the conditions have now been softened ) .
Like all the Brazilian - Japanese I meet , he is confused by the local equivalent of Norman Tebbit 's famous ' cricket test ' , and does n't want to say if he supports Brazil or Japan at football .
Down and out : Homeless men collecting and crushing cans to sell as scrap in a Tokyo park
Many also have Portuguese names as well as their Japanese ones , and are delighted when I thank them by using the Portuguese ' obrigado ' instead of the Japanese ' arigato ' .
Early the following morning I see an even more stark illustration of Japan 's unembarrassed belief that to be Japanese is to have won first prize in the lottery of life , while others just have to cope as best they can .
The Hamamatsu labour exchange , like all such offices in Japan , bears the jaunty name of Hello Work .
But it might equally well be called Goodbye Foreigners .
It has two separate queues where the jobless can sign on : one for Japanese citizens and one for the rest .
Both are alarmingly long , but the non-Japanese line looks somehow more dispirited .
It contains a few Koreans ( another awkward minority here ) but is mostly made up of Brazilians , who say softly that their circumstances are much worse than those of Japanese citizens .
After a few minutes , an official emerges from Hello Work and instructs me to stop asking questions .
Even the children of the Brazilians , many of them raised and educated in Japan , will find it very hard to be naturalised .
They gain no rights from having been born here .
Koreans who have lived here for five generations were only recently spared from forcible fingerprinting .
An earlier experiment in allowing mainland Chinese to work in Japan on ' apprentice visas ' resulted in unpleasant friction , with Chinese workers complaining of being singled out by the police as crime suspects .
Many of the leaders of a recent anti-Japanese campaign in China were former residents in Japan .
With the Japanese birth rate well behind the death rate , and a recent TV projection suggesting that in a few hundred years there will be only two people left in the country , the pressure is on to go multicultural .
Or it would be if the economy had not shrivelled .
As it is , there are more Japanese than there are jobs , and it grows worse every day .
This is true even for the best - placed .
Michimasa Ogata , 23 , a Tokyo University graduate , says that even for alumni of his highly - regarded college it can now take as many as 30 interviews to get a job , when once it would have taken only 20 .
' It is quite possible that you wo n't have a job even after 30 interviews .
If they can't find a job by the time they graduate , they do an extra year at university . '
He explains that it is fatal to leave university .
It is far better to stay on well into your 20s than to finish .
Once you leave , you are off the conveyor belt and probably have no hope of getting one of the coveted jobs with big corporations or government departments .
What his contemporaries fear is that they might follow the so - called ' lost generation ' of the mid-Nineties .
' They are now 35 and can not get secure jobs .
Once you are out , it is very difficult to get back in .
All you can hope for is a string of temporary jobs .
You are not secure and you can not get married . '
The Japanese dream : a long - term , safe job with a giant company or the state , will elude them all their lives .
City of dreams : Peter Hitchens in the wealthy heart of Tokyo , where Karoshi , or death from overwork , is still common
Even worse is the plight of many thousands of so - called ' freeters ' , young men and women left adrift by the last recession , when the big corporations were not recruiting , and so forced to take temporary jobs or seek work experience as unpaid interns .
These live on the edge of society , many as ' internet - café refugees ' , without proper homes to go to .
Cheaper than the cheapest capsule hotel , many such cafés rent cubicles for the night .
I visited one near Yoyogi Park where for about £ 3 you can rent a tiny space with a cushioned floor and a computer screen , where you can play games , watch DVDs or sleep for a few hours .
The proprietors knew perfectly well that the place was a sort of home to young people on the margin of life .
Showers and free soft drinks were also provided .
Although I doubt if anyone but the scrupulously clean and considerate Japanese could make such a system work .
In London it would be full of rubbish , booze and drug paraphernalia .
But there is a stage even lower than this , and not far away .
In the park across the road , one of Japan 's new industries is flourishing .
Homeless men , some young and unlined , some old and bowed , are collecting and then stomping on empty beer cans collected from the prosperous Shibuya suburb , with its fashionable shops and cafes .
A young woman , who says she is 29 but looks older , hurries forward with a cart loaded with hundreds of fresh cans for crushing .
As soon as they are unloaded , she is off again for more .
She is willing to talk , but not to stop .
The price of metal has fallen , and she must work harder than before to make ends meet .
If she does not reach her quota , she will not be paid and will not eat .
Somewhere in the background there are bosses and gangmasters controlling what is , in fact , a bustling scrap metal trade .
Look carefully in any Tokyo park and you will see signs of this almost Victorian fringe economy , and its proud , genteel misery .
In Ueno Park , next to several grand art galleries and a concert hall , there are little tent villages of tiny homes , screened from sight by twee fences rather nauseatingly adorned with pretty pictures of cottages , clouds and trees .
These are not the squalid hovels you might see in London , but tragically respectable homes , clean and intensely tidy , sometimes with carpets , where visitors must remove their shoes before entering .
Their inhabitants are embarrassed at their plight , reluctant to talk , jealous of their privacy .
A dismal queue forms in the rain as a Korean church sets up a soup kitchen , handing out sandwiches and providing free haircuts to the hundreds of poor men who appear suddenly from among the dripping trees as the food distribution begins .
None of these people is a beggar .
No Japanese will beg .
The shame would be too great .
And many are clearly uncomfortable about accepting the aggressively charitable help offered by the Koreans .
The atmosphere is somehow angry and upset , but they are hungry .
A few days later , in Shinjuku Park , visible from the upper floors of the super - grand hotel where they filmed Lost In Translation , I watch as more than 500 destitute men ( and a few women ) line up solemnly in the early evening for a bowl of rice , this time handed out by a Japanese charity organised by a gentle philanthropist , Mr Kazuaki Kasai .
It is an astonishing sight .
The queue stretches into the darkness .
Marshalled into groups of three , the hungry and roofless advance silently and patiently towards their benefactors , who are each holding a bowl of rice .
Both groups bow solemnly and equally to each other before the food is handed over with a polite smile .
It is both moving and disquieting : a symbol of a society that has deliberately chosen not to provide a heavy - duty state - funded welfare safety net for those who fail or fall .
In Japan , if you slip or miss your chance , you might tumble all the way to the bottom - and here it is .
Not far away are the teeming stations with their ever - punctual trains , the electronic marvels in the shops , an unending array of excellent restaurants , cosy bars and shops crammed with tasteful luxuries .
Beyond lie the peaceful , crime - free suburbs stretching for dozens of well - mannered and harmonious miles .
Yet amid the most efficient , well - ordered , peaceful and technically advanced civilisation on the planet , you might witness scenes which Charles Dickens would find entirely familiar .
Is it possible that the one might be the price for the other , and that in our long struggle to make life safe , we have also made it worse ?
Will we , when all the accounts are completed , have coped better or worse with recession and crisis than our distant twin , another group of small , cramped offshore islands which have somehow managed to shake the whole world with their inventiveness and energy ?
The bombardment of Earth by asteroids 3.9 billion years ago may have enhanced early life , according to a new University of Colorado study .
An asteroid bombardment of Earth nearly 4 billion years ago may have actually been a boon to early life on the planet , instead of wiping it out or preventing it from originating , a new study suggests .
Asteroids , comets and other impactors from space have been suggested as the causes behind some of the world 's great mass extinctions , including the disappearance of the dinosaurs .
Impact evidence from lunar samples , meteorites and the pockmarked surfaces of the inner planets paints a picture of a violent environment in the solar system during the Hadean Eon 4.5 to 3.8 billion years ago , particularly through a cataclysmic event known as the Late Heavy Bombardment about 3.9 million years ago .
No such record exists for Earth because tectonic processes have folded ancient craters back into the interior , but scientists assume our planet took the same pummeling .
Although many believe the bombardment would have sterilized Earth , the new study uses a computer model to show it would have melted only a fraction of Earth 's crust , and that microbes — if any existed in the first 500 million years or so of Earth 's existence — could well have survived in subsurface habitats , insulated from the destruction .
" These new results push back the possible beginnings of life on Earth to well before the bombardment period 3.9 billion years ago , " said CU - Boulder Research Associate Oleg Abramov .
" It opens up the possibility that life emerged as far back as 4.4 billion years ago , about the time the first oceans are thought to have formed . "
Modeling the bombardment
Because physical evidence of Earth 's early bombardment has been erased by weathering and plate tectonics over the eons , Abramov and his colleagues used data from Apollo moon rocks , impact records from the moon , Mars and Mercury , and previous theoretical studies to build three - dimensional computer models that replicate the bombardment .
The researchers plugged in asteroid size , frequency and distribution estimates into their simulations to chart the damage to the Earth during the Late Heavy Bombardment , which is thought to have lasted for 20 million to 200 million years .
The 3 - D models allowed the researchers to monitor temperatures beneath individual craters to assess heating and cooling of the crust following large impacts in order to evaluate habitability , said Abramov .
The study , detailed in the May 21 issue of the journal Nature , indicated that less than 25 percent of Earth 's crust would have melted during such a bombardment .
The team even cranked up the intensity of the asteroid barrage in their simulations by 10 - fold — an event that could have vaporized Earth 's oceans .
" Even under the most extreme conditions we imposed , Earth would not have been completely sterilized by the bombardment , " Abramov said .
Instead , hydrothermal vents may have provided sanctuaries for extreme , heat - loving microbes known as " hyperthermophilic bacteria " following bombardments , said study team member Stephen Mojzsis .
Even if life had not emerged by 3.9 billion years ago , such underground havens could still have provided a " crucible " for life 's origin on Earth , he added .
The modeling work was supported by the NASA Astrobiology Program 's Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology Department and the NASA Postdoctoral Program .
Dawn of life
The researchers concluded subterranean microbes living at temperatures ranging from 175 degrees to 230 degrees Fahrenheit ( 79 degrees to 110 degrees Celsius ) would have flourished during the Late Heavy Bombardment .
The models indicate that underground habitats for such microbes increased in volume and duration as a result of the massive impacts .
Some extreme microbial species on Earth today — including so - called " unboilable bugs " discovered in hydrothermal vents in Yellowstone National Park — thrive at 250 F ( 120 C ) .
Geologic evidence suggests that life on Earth was present at least 3.83 billion years ago , Mojzsis said .
" So it is not unreasonable to suggest there was life on Earth before 3.9 billion years ago , " he added .
" We know from the geochemical record that our planet was eminently habitable by that time , and this new study sews up a major problem in origins of life studies by sweeping away the necessity for multiple origins of life on Earth . "
The results also support the potential for microbial life on other planets like Mars and perhaps even rocky , Earth - like planets in other solar systems that may have been resurfaced by impacts , Abramov said .
" Exactly when life originated on Earth is a hotly debated topic , " says NASA 's Astrobiology Discipline Scientist Michael H. New .
" These findings are significant because they indicate life could have begun well before the [ Late Heavy Bombardment ] , during the so - called Hadean Eon of Earth 's history 3.8 billion to 4.5 billion years ago . "

Debian GNU / Linux , the open - source operating system that 's proven more influential than any Linux flavor this side of Red Hat , recently hit the Internet 's FTP mirrors in the form of an updated 5.0 release .
Version 5 , which is also known by the Toy Story - inspired name " Lenny , " sports the same excellent software management tools and broad processor architecture support that marked previous Debian releases .
In addition , the new release includes a host of updates to the open - source components that comprise it .
Unlike the Debian 4 release that I last reviewed , which impressed me with its disk encryption leadership among rival Linux distributions , Lenny does n't significantly advance the state of Debian or of Linux in general .
Beyond its slate of software package refreshes , the best reason for existing Debian users to upgrade to the new version is that , as per the project 's security policy , version 4 will fall out of security fix coverage one year after Lenny 's Valentine 's Day release date .
Stability and long life are frequently cited as the chief reasons for choosing Debian , particularly in server roles for which administrators might wish to " set and forget " their machines .
However , the roughly three - year security fix window that applies to Debian releases falls short of the five years of coverage that Ubuntu offers for its Long Term Support releases , or the seven years that the similarly free - to - acquire CentOS derives from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases on which CentOS is based .
Still , Debian is a great fit for server deployments , and is particularly well - suited for hosting applications that draw on open - source components , such as Apache , MySQL , or any of the other thousands of applications that the Debian project has packaged up for easy installation over one of the project 's many repository mirror sites .
I often turn to Debian as a foundation for assembling virtual servers for my testing , since the distribution 's very good text - based installer makes it easy to spin Debian into whatever arbitrary sort of Linux server I seek , and since I find the configuration applets that come bundled with many Debian packages handy for setting up unfamiliar components .
Debian 5.0 can also work well in a desktop role , thanks in part to what appear to be contributions drawn from the Ubuntu Linux releases that are themselves based on a Debian foundation .
For instance , during my Lenny testing , I recognized the system 's Update Manager and Software Add / Remove tools from my use of Ubuntu .
Debian 5.0 defaults to GNOME 2.22.2 as its desktop environment , but offers KDE 3.5.10 and Xfce 4.4.2 , among other , lesser known options , as desktop alternatives .
Finally , Debian 's broad processor architecture support - which spans 12 architectures and sets the distribution apart from any other Linux flavor of which I 'm aware - makes Debian a natural fit for the fast - growing class of embedded Linux implementations .
Debian is freely available for download from the Debian project or from one of its mirrors via www.us.debian.org.
As a noncommercial entity , the Debian project does n't offer support beyond community resources , although the project maintains a directory of companies offering support services here .
The entire Debian distribution , which includes all the freely redistributable packages in the project 's main repository , spans 31 CDs or five DVDs .
I typically download the distribution 's 180MB network install image and pull down the packages I need from a friendly neighborhood mirror site .
UK - based data storage start - up DataSlide has announced potentially revolutionary hard drive technology , and a Partnership Network agreement with Oracle for the Berkeley Data Base to be embedded into the device .
DataSlide 's Hard Rectangular Drive ( HRD ) does not use read - write heads moving across the recording surface of a spinning hard disk drive ( HDD ) .
Instead an ultra - thin , 2 - dimensional array of 64 read - write heads , operating in parallel , is positioned above an piezo - electric - driven oscillating rectangular recording surface , and delivers 160,000 random IOPS with a 500 MB / sec transfer rate .
For comparison , a STEC ZEUSIOPS SSD , as used by EMC , IBM and others , with up to 320 GB capacity , can provide 220 MB / sec read bandwidth , 115MB / sec write bandwidth and 45,000 random IOPS .
There is no read - write asymmetry , typically found with SSDs , with the HRD because it uses a standard hard disk drive recording medium and not flash memory .
Charles Barnes , DataSlide 's CEO , said : "  DataSlide 's Massively Parallel architecture with 64 heads per surface could saturate a 32 - lane PCI express bus .
The Hard Rectangular Drive has the industry reliability and cost advantages of Hard Disk Drives with superior performance and lower power then Solid State Drives .
" The HRD uses over 60 per cent lower power than HDDs and during idle the media has zero power dissipation making it the green storage winner . "
The technology is also more shock - resistant than hard drives .
This could be described as a solid - state drive with none of the well - known NAND flash problems , such as read - write asymmetry and write endurance .
Oracle 's Embedded Global Business Unit stated : " DataSlide provides a high bandwidth , low latency , magnetic storage device whose architecture lends itself to vastly improved database throughput and latency reduction . "
There is a description of the DataSlide technology here ( PowerPoint deck pdf ) .
Literally , it is non-revolutionary , using oscillations to move the magnetised bits to and fro underneath the read - write heads so that they can use magnetism value changes at the bit edge just as a read - write head on a spinning hard drive does , but where the recording layer passes continuously under the heads .
There is no seek time access delay with the HRD .
The Embedded Global Business Unit at Oracle has an OEM charter and Data Slide meets its requirements by incorporating the Berkeley DB into the actual storage device to make what it calls a ' smart ' storage device .
It says potential applications are many and varied .
Examples include TCP / IP - based systems and video applications requiring multiple concurrent streams .
The company says media indexing , fast positioning , forward , back , skip , and scene / track operations will have significant performance improvements with its technology .
DataSlide is a privately - held company with locations in the United Kingdom , France and United States .
It has affiliations with academia from Carnegie Mellon University / DSSC , and the Universities of Cambridge , Exeter , Sussex , Sheffield and Brighton in the UK , and Paris - Sud in France , and is backed by angel investors .
It has a management team with experience from companies such as Seagate , Connor , Quantum , Maxtor and HP .
The technology is proven in a research and prototype sense , and the company emphasises that it uses standards - based mature process technologies from LCD , HDD and semiconductor manufacture .
There is no need to design and tool - up a new manufacturing process .
DataSlide is currently in discussion with a number of storage and system OEMs and can provide more details under a non-disclosure agreement .
It will be holding private meetings at the Santa Clara Hyatt Regency from June 22 - 25 during the Memcon 2009 conference .

WASHINGTON — With last - minute deals and some old - fashioned political muscle , Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pushing hard to get a comprehensive energy and climate change bill through the House by the end of the week .
To get the bill passed , Pelosi and Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , have made concessions to agriculture , the biofuel industry and oil refineries on emissions controls and rules .
That has angered some environmentalists , who say the compromises weaken the bill and it wo n’t do enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
But John Podesta , former White House chief of staff and a confidant of President Barack Obama , tried to rally Democrats and clean - tech advocates by quoting Mick Jagger :
“ You ca n’t always get what you want , but if you try , sometimes you just might find you get what you need , ” said Podesta , director of the Center for American Progress .
His point : “ This landmark bill is revolutionary in its intent and , while imperfect in its means , deserves the support of progressives . ”
The 1,200 - page bill would set a price on carbon , creating a cap - and - trade system that would restrict emissions from every source , with tighter limits each year .
Polluters would buy and trade emissions credits to stay under the cap , establishing a market mechanism that could reach $ 2 trillion in trading within five years , according to a federal agency .
The goal is to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050 , compared to 2005 levels .
The bill would also boost renewable - fuel industries , many of which are based in the Bay Area , by requiring the nation ’s utilities to generate 20 percent of their power by 2020 from renewable sources and efficiency measures .
Another provision would require higher energy efficiency in new buildings .
“ This is the most important energy and environmental bill in the history of the United States , ” said Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass . , at a Wednesday rally of unions , businesses , green groups and faith - based groups .
Markey and Waxman authored the legislation .
Taking up the bill so quickly — it passed Waxman ’s Energy and Commerce Committee last month — is a gamble for Pelosi , who is seeking a vote Friday or Saturday .
At least eight Democrats oppose it , fearful that consumers will be hit by higher energy costs .
Pelosi , D - San Francisco , took the unusual step last week of meeting with 11 Republicans who might support the bill .
Obama also spoke forcefully for the bill , and his staff is lobbying hard for it .
Obama said at a press conference Tuesday that the bill would “ spark a clean - energy transformation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and confront the carbon pollution that threatens our planet . ”
Republicans have attacked the bill as an energy tax that will hurt average Americans and cripple the economy .
“ Cap - and - trade is nothing more than a tax which starts accruing the moment you flip on your light switch , ” Rep . Pete Sessions , R - Texas , said in a fundraising letter for his party .
Democrats have tried to counter that argument with an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that by 2020 , the net impact of cap - and - trade on the average household would be $ 175 a year , and would help poor families because of rebates in the bill .
This week , to win the support of farm - state members , Waxman agreed to let the Department of Agriculture , not the Environmental Protection Agency , administer a program giving farmers credits for conservation measures that keep carbon dioxide in the soil .
That decision , and some other concessions , drew the ire of Frank O’Donnell , president of Clean Air Watch : “ It ’s painful to learn of the latest negotiations over the climate legislation .
Even some strong supporters of the Waxman - Markey legislation are now holding their noses , as if on the perimeter of a hog farm . ”
If the bill passes the House , the Senate might take it up — or a similar version — later this year .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , who chairs the Environment Committee , has said she would try to move quickly if House passage occurs .

Does the Transcendent Man just want to be a robot ?
That ’s part of the story coming out of Daniel Lyons ’ recent article in Newsweek about Singularity front man , Ray Kurzweil .
The other part is that Kurzweil is much too optimistic in his predictions and his beliefs .
It ’s not a flattering article , for either Kurzweil or Singularity enthusiasts in general .
For his part , Kurzweil defended his positions in a responding letter to the editor .
It ’s the media equivalent of a boxing match and I ’m not sure who landed the more devastating blows .
For those of you just joining the debate , let me say that it centers around two key issues : how fast the technology of intelligence ( computers , biotechnology , etc ) is growing , and whether or not Ray Kurzweil is a nut .
A large part of Lyons ’ Newsweek article , and Kurzweil ’s response , focused on whether or not Kurzweil ’s earlier predictions about technology were accurate .
Lyons posits that most of Kurzweil ’s predictions were easily forseeable ( like the success of the Internet ) or wrong .
Kurzweil defends the originality of his insights and their accuracy .
These predictions , from Kurzweil ’s books and speeches , ranged from the Internet to the Human Genome project .
In the mid to late 80s , Kurzweil predicted that the Internet would grow exponentially and enjoy widespread use .
Lyons says this was an easy prediction .
Kurzweil also predicted , a decade later , that most computers used would n’t have keyboards , and would be part of someone ’s apparel .
Lyons claims this has n’t happened , while Kurzweil points to iPhones , mp3 players , and computerized hearing aids .
Kurzweil predicted the success of the Human Genome project in 15 years ( predicting exponential growth in the rate of return ) .
Lyons concedes that prediction but points to Kurzweil ’s belief that the economy would keep growing between 1999 and 2009 .
The list goes on and on .
Figuring out who ’s right is n’t easy .
What kind of metric do we apply to futurists ?
How often do they have to be right , and how right do they have to be ?
If Kurzweil was wrong about everything else , but is correct in predicting that artificial intelligence will be indistinguishable from human intelligence in 20 years , that alone would make him a visionary .
In the end , it ’s up to each reader to evaluate the predictions Kurzweil made and decide whether they collectively prove he ’s a technological seer , or just another dreamer .
One area in which Kurzweil certainly won is his preparedness .
While Lyons might have you think that Kurzweil is a pie-eyed optimist , too certain in his beliefs to even consider other possibilities , the truth is far from it .
As was evident in the panel - discussion after the Transcendent Man premier , Kurzweil is actively working on projects designed to prevent some of the worst case scenarios new technologies present .
He is part of the national security team working on bio-terrorism response in the United States .
His books warn against technological perils as well as predicting benefits .
Whether or not he is wrong about the Singularity , Kurzweil is preparing for all outcomes .
If Lyons had just focused on Kurzweil ’s predictions and left it at that , I may not be writing my own article .
However , Lyons brings up several sensationalist themes prominent in the movie about Kurzweil ’s life , Transcendent Man .
As Singularity Hub mentioned before , Kurzweil wants to live forever , and takes a wide - range of dietary supplements to keep him going .
Eventually he wants to download , or upgrade himself , into an immortal intelligence ( most likely in the form of a computer ) .
Using a similar process , Kurzweil wants to reanimate the intelligence of his dead father , remaking him from data collected in journal ’s and Ray ’s own memories .
He proposes that the rest of us could do the same for ourselves and our loved ones .
It ’s a story ripe for pity , horror , or disdain depending on your outlook .
Lyons explores all three emotions .
Even when attacking Kurzweil ’s predictions on their own merit , Lyons is constantly returning to the futurist ’s motivations .
The optimism Kurzweil feels is really just a fear of death .
His predictions are really just hopes to bring back his dead daddy .
His continuous speaking tour around the world is just a public display of a mid-life crisis .
Am I the only one who finds the focus on these suppositions offensive to my intelligence ?
Maybe I ’m just tired of someone ’s “ story ” getting more press coverage than their work .
You notice it most during the Olympics , but it ’s pretty ubiquitous in the media as a whole .
No matter who is discussed — politician , scientist , or athlete — the story of their life , the motivations for their actions , are taking up more of the discussion than the actual meaning of the actions themselves .
We ’re big on narrative but short on analysis , and that ’s just silly .
I ca n’t speak much for politicians or athletes , but I know scientists .
Sir Isaac Newton was into alchemy .
Einstein wrote his miraculous 1905 papers while slaving away in a dead - end job .
Many top scientists have been racists , sexists , drug- addicts , or just general pricks .
Many have also been loving , caring men and women who ’ve overcome great obstacles in life .
Great .
I ’m enough of a post - modernist to understand that someone ’s character and work are not two separate entities , but intertwining states that support one another .
Still , I ’m tired of being sold the story of someone ’s life , when it ’s their work that will impact mine .
Ray Kurzweil may be a nut , he may be going through the biggest mid-life crisis ever .
I do n’t know .
I honestly do n’t care much .
I want to evaluate his predictions , and his actions , on their own merit .
It would be nice if the major media outlets focused on the same .
Will we have AI that passes the Turing test in 20 years ?
Is the Singularity a pipe - dream or an upcoming reality ?
Can the average person affect the outcome ( through voting , buying , or protesting ) ?
These questions need answers , or at least , discussion .
As interesting as Kurzweil may be , it ’s the what , when , and how , not the who or why , that I ’m dying to know about .
If Newsweek really wants to focus on whether or not someone wants to become a robot , they should interview seven years olds outside the Transformer ’s movie premier .
For compelling science articles , I want something that ’s more than meets the eye .
As a web developer I ’ve always made sure to have every browser I can installed on my system in order to test for compatibility issues .
I ’ve given every browser a fair chance , but have always favoured Firefox due to its developer plugins , stability and all around ease of use .
Lately I ’ve also been using Chrome quite a bit as it is exteremly fast and performs much better on my netbooks , which can often take a good minute or two to load up Firefox or Internet Exporer .
Opera , on the other hand , I have always used for looking at “ adult content . ”
It keeps my history and recent searches free of questionable material , which is important in the event that a friend or family uses my computer to check their email or something .
So with that being said , I use Opera a fair bit …
Despite it ’s quirks .
Every time I open Opera 9.62 I get this lovely error .
I use Opera in both Ubuntu Linux and Windows and usually I do n’t have it install for a week before that error starts appearing .
I ’ve managed to fix it before , but it always comes back .
But I ’ve gotten into the habbit of just clicking
Ok to continue doing my “ work . ”
So today when I heard that Opera 10 Beta was released to the public I was eager to give it a chance to see if it not only fixed this problem but created a better user experience .
Despite being a robust and versitle browser I never truely enjoyed the previous versions of Opera .
I did n’t like the way it progressed through a stack of tabs .
In most browsers if you open 10 new tabs in the background , then click the last one , you can work your way back by closing each tab and getting the next newest tab .
Opera does this differently , it takes you right back to the tab that last had focus .
Although this makes sense , it creates a very broken experience which I have never been able to get used to .
Another thing that has always drove me crazy about Opera is the way it randomly changes tabs on me when I right click .
I does n’t happen consistantly but it has hapen more times than I can remember .
I ’ll go to right click a link to open it in a new tab , or to save an images , and it randomly jumps to another open tab .
It does n’t appear to be something I ’m accidentally clicking , rather just a random quirk .
The third and final quirk of Opera that keeps me from enjoying the experience is quite often when I double click some text , or select a block of text , it will randomly open my right click menu .
Once it happens , it keeps happening whenever I click anything .
It reminds me very much of an old Windows 95 bug , as they can both be fixed by actually right clicking , which seems to remind it which is the right click button and which is the left .
But enough about Opera 9.62 , time to install Opera 10 Beta .
The installation was pleasent experience .
It was very quick , and it did n’t try to ask me to install any toolbars , set a specific home page or force me to set it as my default ( though it did offer the option ) .
Within a minute I had it installed and was launching it for the first time .
Upon launching it was happy to see it started without the usual error I had come accustomed to .
But as I ’ve said before , that usually does n’t start up for a few weeks so I ’ll wait and see if that has been fixed or not .
I was also very please with it ’s new look and feel .
The tab bar has a much more sleek look to it , it reminds me somewhat of the new tab bars seen in Chrome and Safari .
The difference being that it does n’t run along the top most part of the browser , which is good because that ’s the one thing I do n’t like about Chrome .
Other than that , not much has changed to the UI other than its slightly more modern look .
So the big question is , how does it perform ?
According to my sources it has passed the Acid 3 test with flying colours .
Scoring an astonishing 100 out of 100 .
Compare that to WebKit ( Safari / Chrome ) which also scored 100/100 , or Firefox 3 with 91 .
As for Internet Explorer 7 , well lets just say that no one was surprised it only scored 14 .
Here ’s the official scores I was able to gather for a good comparison :
Browser Score Opera 10 100 % Opera 9 46 % Chrome 2.0 100 % Safari 4 100 % Safari 3.0.4 39 % Firefox 3.1 91 % Firefox 2 52 % IE 8 20 % IE 7 14 % IE 6 12 % Konqueror 4.2.4 87 %
On top of the Acid tests , I also gave it my own barrage of tests .
Overall , it did quite well .
I visited every site I have ever designed , only to see it break one layout .
A site which also breaks with WebKits Browsers , so that was n’t much of a surprise .
New Features :
New Rendering Engine ( Presto 2.2 )
Inline Spell Check
Auto Updates
HTML Authoring ( Opera Mail )
Improved CSS 3 support
HTML 5 Support
Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) Support
Speed Dial Configuration
Tab Bar Thumbnails
Overall I am quite happy with the new release of Opera .
It shows a great deal of promise and makes a great competitor in the browser wars .
Although it wont be my primary browser it will still get a good deal of use on my computer and still recieves a solid two thumbs up from me .
Calabasas resident Richard Shapiro never made it to his college graduation .
Instead , he went to work and spent decades in the commercial real estate industry .
Overnight , he watched a lifetime of savings disappear in the wreckage of Bernard L. Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme .
“ It was sickening to see your life ’s work disappear in a second , ” said Shapiro , one of almost 5,000 investors who lost money to confessed swindler Madoff .
On Thursday night , Shapiro and about 65 other Californians gave state senators an earful at a hearing held by the state Senate ’s Select Committee on Investment Malfeasance to explore possible state tax remedies .

“ I understand that the state is broke , ” the 56 - year - old Shapiro said at the forum , held at the Skirball Cultural Center .
“ But we ’re more broke .
There are people that are starving . ”
The hearing was held in response to the hundreds of Californians , the majority of whom are elderly with little to no savings left , who have been pushing lawmakers to step in and help recoup money they lost in an investment Ponzi scheme run by Madoff .
They want state law changed so they can get back the taxes they paid on income they thought they had earned off their Madoff investments but never received .
In March , Madoff , 71 , pleaded guilty in a Manhattan federal court to 11 securities - related fraud counts .
At the center of the charges is Madoff ’s admitted use of new investor money to pay off earlier investors .
Many of Madoff ’s clients were elderly people who relied on their investments into his fund as their only retirement income .
It may take more than a decade to find all of the assets of Madoff ’s money management firm and pay back victims of the $ 65 - billion fraud , Stephen Harbeck , president of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. , told Bloomberg News on Thursday .
The Washington agency , formed by Congress in 1970 to liquidate bankrupt brokerage firms , hired the trustee liquidating Madoff ’s firm , Investment Securities .

Madoff is slated to be sentenced next month and faces up to 150 years in prison .
The state Senate committee also is trying to quantify the losses in state revenue that might result from any tax law changes to accommodate Madoff victims .
No state law allows people to recover taxes paid on phantom income , and the state does n’t allow victims to claim their losses as a theft loss , Senate Majority Leader Dean Florez ( D - Shafter ) said in an interview .
The Internal Revenue Service is allowing theft losses from Ponzi schemes to be counted against income from the last five years or future income in the next 20 years .

“ What the state Legislature has to figure out now is whether or not we can mirror the IRS actions or if we can find a solution in another way .
Either way , we need to find a solution , ” said Florez , who chairs the committee .
Also attending the hearing was Sen. Tom Harman ( R- Huntington Beach ) .
The committee will hold another hearing next month in Sacramento .
Florez acknowledged that the cash - squeezed state is n’t in a strong position to return tax money to its citizens , but added , “ I do n’t think the state of California should participate in victimizing people twice .
We will in essence be participating in a crime and saying the crime is OK if we keep the money . ”
Some of the more than 400 Californians victimized by Madoff are rich and famous , including director Steven Spielberg .
But most are n’t .

Taylor Levin , 15 and a 10th grader at St. Francis High School , said in an interview that he lost $ 1,500 of birthday money that he was saving to buy a car .
“ I ’m turning 16 on Aug. 23 and now because of Madoff , I wo n’t be able to get a car .
Also my mom lost my college fund and I will be taking out loans for that . ”
Marcia Cholodenko , 72 and retired from the Los Angeles Unified School District , told the lawmakers that she and her husband , Paul , “ were really counting on these years being the golden years for us because we had money invested with Madoff .
. . .
For many years , we were comfortable , and now . . . we ’re just existing . ”
Elliot Kaye , retired chief operating officer of Parthenia Medical Group Inc. , said he lost his $ 1.3 - million retirement fund , is living on state disability and “ if it does n’t turn around , I ’m going to go homeless . ”

“ We need immediate assistance and immediate relief , and the state of California is in a position to provide this relief , ” Kaye , 61 , said .
“ The state has undeniably reaped the benefits of the taxes we paid on this fictitious income , and it ’s time for the state to return this money with reasonable return on investment .
It ’s an honorable thing to do . ”

You ca n’t spell unproductive without the letters “ U ” and “ N ” …
I ’m one of those guys that the conspiracy theorists love to hate .
I not only believe that we need stronger global governance mechanisms , I believe that the reinvention of our global governance system is one of the great shared missions of the world for the century ahead .
Whether it is strengthening institutions that regulate trade or climate , finance or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , or whether it is creating multilateral enforcement mechanisms with real teeth , the international system of nation states and very weak multilateral mechanisms we currently have is showing its age and is simply not up to satisfying the obligations of the social contract in the global era .
In the eyes of the conspiracy maniacs … weakened by too much time staring at anti-Bilderberg , anti-Davos , anti-World Jewish Conspiracy Web sites … this makes me a world government guy and a threat to the natural order .
( Which apparently is manifested in a libertarian fantasy land of white guys living in shacks and RVs far from the influence of any cultural tradition but their own .
The notion of one nation under Toby Keith seems a little dubious to me , but then again , most of these guys think people like me would best serve as hood ornaments . )
Having said that , watching the UN continue its kabuki theater concerning North Korea makes me want to shut the place down , convert it to condos and remit the funds to the former member states .
Even in a down New York real estate market it is almost certain to be a better return on investment for the dollars poured into that white elephant on the East River than “ outcomes ” like the proposed sanctions on Pyongyang .
This is particularly tragic since containing and ultimately eliminating the threats posed by states like North Korea and other proliferators seems to me a vital role for the UN or at least for some international mechanism .
But you ca n’t stand up to the bad guy without a spine and the UN has been an invertebrate by design since it first crawled out of San Francisco Bay in April 1945 .
No one wanted anything like a strong world governance structure back then and so they built a talking shop that makes most freshman philosophy seminars look like decisive drivers of global change .
Basically the organization was designed along the lines of the conflict resolution sessions my daughters ’ elementary school used to use when students got into a fight .
The combatants would be sat down in a room , asked to explain the problem , and then told to apologize and make up or else .
Of course the “ or else ” was the equivalent of the great parental technique of counting to three , you did n’t know what might happen once you got to the point of no return but you were sure it was bad .
To my eldest daughter ’s credit at one point she got into a fight with a budding bitchlet from the grade ahead of her and when asked to say they were friends , she refused .
She sensed that there would be no repercussions .
Who knew that my adorable little cupcake and Kim Jong - Il would have that much in common .
He must be sitting there with his 26 year - old son , Kim Jong - Un , his recently anointed successor , in their badly paneled rumpus room full of tapes of old American movies playing their favorite video game ( Grand Theft Plutonium ) and cackling at the wimps on Manhattan Upper East Side .
Seriously , I can hardly understand how in a city in which every cab driver is prepared to get all up in your grille about the most casual comment , these UN folks can manage to negotiate the basics of daily life .
It takes more gumption than they have ever displayed to get a waiter to bring you a menu at most Manhattan coffee shops .
( I ’ve seen “ Gossip Girl . ” I know how that part of town works .
Blair Waldorf would have Ban Ki Moon braiding her hair and carrying her books to school within seconds of their first meeting . )
In essence , the new tough stand of the UN , orchestrated by the United States , has two parts .
In the first , we essentially reiterate what we ’ve said in the past about interdicting shipments of weapons materials .
But this time , folks , we say it with feeling .
There is no commitment by anyone to actually stop or inspect North Korean ships and there is no UN mechanism obligating or even sanctioning the use of force .
We also plan to cut off financing options for the starving country … except those that pertain to humanitarian or development needs .
Of course , money is fungible and the government has shown a real willingness to spend on arms in the past while letting its people eat grass , so why we think this tactic wo n’t just produce more humanitarian and development needs … which in turn will be met … is beyond me .
In all the articles on these developments , the usual suspects at think tanks and in the diplomatic community say all this matters because this time the Russians and the Chinese are really pissed off .
Yes , maybe .
But apparently not pissed off enough to actually collaborate in the production of anything that might actually change North Korean behavior .
( Their approach , written on the package every North Korean bomb comes seems to have been lifted from a shampoo bottle : Threaten … negotiate / buy time for program development … win aid packages … repeat as necessary . )
How was it all described by that UN expert from Stratford - on - Avon ?
“ A lot of sound and fury , signifying nothing . ”
( They did n’t call it the Globe Theater for nothing . )
Oh yeah , by the way , I ’m still in India .
I ’m writing this while periodically looking up to watch the small fishing boats come into the Back Bay from the Arabian Sea .
Great people , great meetings , great food and yes , if you must ask , I do keep my mouth closed in the shower to avoid becoming the host to any local bacteria ( with whom I have had bad experiences in the past . )
Also , for the record , on the broader point of this blog , despite my being a very big fan of this wonderful country and a big supporter of it having a much bigger role on the international stage and in America ’s foreign policy priorities , I do n’t like the nuke deal we cut with them either .
I ’ve said it before and I will say it again , the world ’s complacency on proliferation will produce one or more of the great tragedies of the century ahead .
( As in the North Korea case , the international community has developed and seems to be sticking to a three - speed plan on proliferation these days : cooperate with proliferators , cut them a lot slack or cut them a little slack .
Just in case you wanted to know what was responsible for that ticking sound you hear … )

Rogers Communications Inc. will begin charging wireless subscribers 15 cents for each incoming text message received on cellphones despite watching federal politicians berate its rivals for implementing similar charges last summer .
Liz Hamilton , a spokesperson for Rogers Wireless , said yesterday the new charges would take effect July 7 for customers who do n't subscribe to a text messaging plan .
The company 's discount Fido brand is unaffected by the new policy , she said .
Big U.S. carriers such as T - Mobile , Verizon , AT&T and Sprint charge 20 cents ( U.S. ) per incoming message , Hamilton added .
Bell Canada Inc. and Telus Corp. announced last July that they would charge 15 cents for each incoming text message , a move that prompted a backlash from consumers and some politicians .
Then - industry minister Jim Prentice ultimately decided the government would not pursue legislation against the carriers , but that did n't stop Prime Minister Stephen Harper from promising during the fall election campaign to outlaw charges for unsolicited commercial text messages , also known as spam .
Such measures never came to pass .
Bell , meanwhile , said proposed changes would n't have had much effect because 95 per cent of its wireless customers have text messages included in monthly plans .
As for spam , the policy at both Telus and Bell is to reimburse customers who receive unsolicited text messages from advertisers .
" On wireless , spam is a extremely rare occurrence , " said Mark Langton , a Bell spokesperson .
He said the company has made big investments in spam filters and controls virtually all aspects of the network , unlike the Internet .
Rogers subscribers charged for spam are asked to forward the messages to SPAM ( 7726 ) so they can get a credit , Hamilton said .
Rogers also said yesterday that both Rogers and Fido customers will be able receive text messages through micro-blogging service Twitter .
The messages will be treated as standard messages under all text messaging plans , Rogers said .
Separately , Rogers and Bell said yesterday that their Inukshuk joint wireless venture is buying the spectrum and broadcast licence of Look Communications Inc. for $ 80 million .
Look said in December that it planned to liquidate itself .
The deal is contingent on the settlement of legal disputes with Bell and Rogers .
Look provides a range of services , including high - speed Internet access and digital television distribution over a wireless network in Ontario and Quebec .
Rogers uses the Inukshuk network to provide its portable Internet service .

Many articles I am reading seem to be encouraging Iranians to revolt .
Journalists seem more interested in egging on angry Iranians than trying to understand the problems with the system that led to this situation .
One article describes it this way : " the possibility of choice did inspire what had seemed to be a passive society to protest " .
There is no doubt about it , the American media wants Iranians to protest .
The words " revolution " and " coup d'etat " are not far from their lips .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will lift his predecessor ’s restriction on federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research on Monday and will give the National Institutes of Health four months to come up with new rules on the issue , officials said on Sunday .
President Barack Obama walks out of the Oval Office before departing for the presidential retreat in Maryland , March 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Obama will not lay out guidelines himself but will let the NIH decide when it is ethical and legal to pay for embryonic stem cell research , science adviser Dr. Harold Varmus said .
Researchers and advocates have been invited to a White House ceremony at which Obama will make the announcement , said Melody Barnes , director of Obama ’s domestic policy council .
He will also sign a pledge to “ restore scientific integrity in governmental decision making , ” Barnes said .
“ He believes that by signing them he ’s going to continue to fulfill the promises that he made over the 20 - plus months on the campaign , ” Barnes told reporters in a conference call .
“ And the president believes that it ’s particularly important to sign this memorandum so that we can put science and technology back at the heart of achieving a broad range of national goals . ”
Former President George W. Bush was accused by scientists and politicians of injecting politics and sometimes religion into scientific decisions regarding not only stem cells , but climate change policy , energy policy and contraceptive policy .
Barnes said scrapping the restriction on federal funding imposed by Bush would help to create jobs and strengthen national security .
Varmus said Obama will give the NIH 120 days come up with a framework to govern the use of federal funds to work with human embryonic stem cells .
LIMITED USE
A law called the Dickey Amendment limits the use of federal money to actually make the powerful stem cells , because they must be taken from human embryos .
So federal research money can currently be used only to work with cells that were made using other sources of funds .
“ The president , in effect , is allowing federal funding on human embryonic stem cells research to the extent that is allowed by law , ” said Varmus , a former NIH director who is also president of the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York and an adviser to Obama .
“ There will be no explicit attempt to draw up what those guidelines will be , ” Varmus added .
Researchers are delighted .
“ Hallelujah !
This marks the end of a long and repressive chapter in scientific history .
It ’s the stem cell ‘ emancipation proclamation ’ , ” said Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology in Massachusetts .
“ I really hope this is the end of this political football game , ” agreed Michael West , who once headed ACT and Geron Inc and is now chief executive officer of a California - based biotech firm called BioTime .
Stem cells are primitive , long - living cells that are the source of all other cells in the body .
When taken from days - old embryos they are virtually immortal and can give rise to all the other cells and tissues in the body .
Supporters say they can transform medicine and have been working to use them to repair severed spinal cords , regenerate brain cells lost in cases of Parkinson ’s Disease and restore the tissue destroyed by juvenile diabetes .
Dr. Douglas Melton , co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute , noted that the process of getting federal funding itself is time - consuming but said his group will seek the cash alongside its other sources of money .
“ The removal of this barrier that has stood in our way for eight years will open important new areas of research , and help in moving the field forward more rapidly , ” Melton said .
Although support for federal funding of human stem cell research crosses political and philosophical boundaries , opponents remain .
“ Taxpayer dollars should not aid the destruction of innocent human life , ” said House of Representatives Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio .

Whatever the era or situation , women 's issues have always cropped up , and the relief panels at Candi Tegowangi , in Pare , Kediri , are testimony that in East Java also , issues concerning the fate of woman were not swept under the carpet .
Instead , they are made overt , portrayed on the temple 's walls for subsequent generations to learn from the past and prevent problems from recurring .
The beautifully sculpted relief panels at Tegowangi also show that female solidarity in defending their cause was a force to be reckoned with .
It was someone no less than Prince Sadewa , one of the Pandawa brothers in the Mahabharata Hindu epic , who had a rude awakening to the presence of female solidarity when he was literally dragged by his mother , Goddess Kunti , to address the case of Goddess Durga .

Before answering the question on whether HGH for sale online is legal , it ’s important to learn more about it .
Human growth hormone is just one of the many hormones that are produced by our bodies over our lifetime .
Hormones are responsible for sexual function , metabolic rate , and growth .
They influence nearly every part of our bodies , from the smallest cells to the largest organs .
HGH plays a large role in bone and muscle growth , as well as in the repair of cells .
It helps break down subcutaneous fat and promotes the proper deposition of protein in the body .
Benefits of HGH
There are many benefits of human growth hormone , otherwise called HGH .
It promotes a process called protein synthesis , which is the process via which the body creates new proteins , thus helping with muscle repair and recovery .
Some research has suggested that it is also involved with metabolizing body fat and converting it into energy sources .
Using exogenous HGH can help build stronger bones and improve the longevity and function of the kidneys and the heart .
Many people state that HGH therapy has helped with their sleep and has made them feel more energized .
In addition , it may improve sexual performance .
How to Dose HGH
Your dose of HGH will vary based on your individual tolerance and your goals .
Keep in mind that while HGH has been shown to be relatively safe for otherwise healthy people when used for short periods , there are very few studies on the long - term effects of this hormone .
For this reason , it ’s important to weigh the risks and benefits before using it , and to stay within the dosage guidelines .
HGH Pills for Sale
You ’ll find HGH pills for sale in many different doses from several manufacturers .
Most of the HGH does not actually contain the growth hormone ; rather , it contains peptides , amino acids , and other nutrients that are thought to increase the production of natural growth hormone within the body .
Some of the active ingredients in these products include arginine , lysine , valine , colostrum , GABA , and many others .
The HGH pills for sale are to be taken daily to increase the body ’s production of HGH .
These are considered homeopathic medicines and they are perfectly legal to buy and use .
Is HGH Legal ?
Legal Uses of HGH
The FDA has approved the use of the growth hormone for several medical conditions that are often associated with the aging process .
A patient who has demonstrated HGH deficiency may be prescribed growth hormone therapy .
In most cases , HGH therapy is only prescribed to young children who are failing to grow as per the established benchmarks deemed normal .
The process for treating these diseases will involve the injection of the hormone directly into the subcutaneous tissue .
Most users prefer injections in the buttocks as there is a smaller chance of hitting a nerve with the needle .
It can also be injected into the calves , thighs , or biceps .
These injections must be prescribed by a doctor .
A person should not consider using this type of therapy without the approval of their physician .
How to Find HGH
The only legal way to find HGH is through a physician , clinic , or a hormone therapy center .
It is intended to be used only to treat medical conditions .
A doctor must determine that a person has a hormone deficiency before that patient can legally use HGH therapy .
Doctors in the United States can prescribe HGH from a manufacturer such as Eli Lilly , Novo-Nordisk , Upjohn , Pfizer , Sandoz , Merck , and others .
There are several injection methods available as well .
The legality of using HGH is somewhat murky .
While homeopathic drugs are legal in the United States , it is illegal to purchase HGH products from outside the country .
It is recommended that a person who wishes to use this form of therapy contact their physician for more information .
HGH and Anti-Aging
One of the most common claims regarding the use of HGH has to do with aging .
In fact , even celebrities like Sylvester Stallone swear by it , claiming that even at the age of 70 and beyond , they still feel young and are as strong as they ’ve ever been .
Many , many people across the globe receive regular growth hormone therapy in an effort to prevent ( or at least significantly slow ) the aging process , and it certainly appears to be having a tremendous impact on Sly .
Most physicians will agree , however , that HGH is not a cure - all for aging , and that results like Stallone ’s are atypical .
They also warn that using too much HGH results can leave some undesirable side effects .
It is , after all , growth hormone , so it can cause enlarged organs and noticeable growth of parts of the body , including the hands and feet .
Some people seem to be more prone to these effects than others , though .
Is HGH Proven Effective ?
The results of studies on HGH are mixed , especially when it comes to the use of HGH for preventing aging .
For example , one such study published by the Jama Network noted that adverse effects of growth hormone on life expectancy have only ever been observed in mice who received huge doses ; mice who received normal doses had a statistically relevant extended mean life span .
A paper published in the Washington Post in March 2015 highlighted skepticism surrounding the use of HGH .
Critics claimed that the propulsion of HGH and testosterone into the limelight was “ disease mongering ” , and it was done for no other reason than to take billions upon billions of dollars from consumers .
The critics say that HGH and testosterone alike do very little to improve quality of life , and the idea that companies are convincing otherwise healthy people that they ’re sick is ludicrous .
Even so , there are hundreds of thousands ( and some estimates span into the millions ) of people who use HGH regularly , claiming they feel great and they ’re healthier than their peers of the same age .
Because there are no large - scale surveys , it ’s difficult to pinpoint just how many people use HGH , legally or otherwise , and how they believe HGH has helped them .
In a nutshell , HGH has been clinically proven to extend lifespans of otherwise healthy mice , to facilitate protein synthesis , and to provide significant boosts in energy .
Whether or not it slows the aging process is highly debatable , but for those who swear by growth hormone for their youthfulness , it ’s crystal clear that whether it ’s working – whether it ’s the hormone or a placebo effect .
Also , to answer the question – is HGH legal – the answer is that it is but you need to prove you have a medical need for it .
If you 've ever been sleep - deprived , you know the feeling that your brain is full of wool .
Now , a study published in the April 3 edition of the journal Science has molecular and structural evidence of that woolly feeling — proteins that build up in the brains of sleep - deprived fruit flies and drop to lower levels in the brains of the well - rested .
The proteins are located in the synapses , those specialized parts of neurons that allow brain cells to communicate with other neurons .
Sleep researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health believe it is more evidence for their theory of " synaptic homeostasis . "
This is the idea that synapses grow stronger when we 're awake as we learn and adapt to an ever - changing the environment , that sleep refreshes the brain by bringing synapses back to a lower level of strength .
This is important because larger synapses consume a lot of energy , occupy more space and require more supplies , including the proteins examined in this study .
Sleep — by allowing synaptic downscaling — saves energy , space and material , and clears away unnecessary " noise " from the previous day , the researchers believe .
The fresh brain is then ready to learn again in the morning .
The researchers — Giorgio Gilestro , Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli , of the Center for Sleep and Consciousness — found that levels of proteins that carry messages in the synapses ( or junctions ) between neurons drop by 30 to 40 percent during sleep .
In the Science paper , three - dimensional photos using confocal microscopy show the brains of sleep - deprived flies filled with a synaptic protein called Bruchpilot ( BRP ) , a component of the machinery that allows communication among neurons .
In well - rested flies , levels of BRP and four other synaptic proteins drop back to low levels , providing evidence that sleep resets the brain to allow more growth and learning the next day .

" We know that sleep is necessary for our brain to function properly , to learn new things every day , and also , in some cases , to consolidate the memory of what we learned during the day , " says Cirelli , associate professor of psychiatry .
" During sleep , we think that most , if not all , synapses are downscaled : at the end of sleep , the strongest synapses shrink , while the weakest synapses may even disappear . "
The confocal microscope views show this happening in all three major areas of the fruit - fly brain , which are known to be very plastic ( involved in learning ) .
In a paper published last year , Tononi , Cirelli and their co-investigators found similar chemical changes in the synapses of rats ' brains .
They also showed that rats ' brains have a stronger " evoked response " to electrical stimulation after being awake , and a weaker one after sleep .
That finding provided more evidence , using electrophysiological rather than molecular techniques , consistent with the idea that synapses grow stronger during the day , then weaker during sleep .
Because sleep performs the same function in the brains of species as diverse as fruit flies and rats , Cirelli says it was likely conserved by evolution because it is so important to an animal 's health and survival .
The Wisconsin laboratory has pioneered ways of studying sleep in different species , including fruit flies .
To keep the flies awake , they 're put into a " fly agitator " that holds 10 plates , each containing 32 drowsy flies .
A robot arm shakes the plates occasionally to keep the flies from dozing .
Flies were deprived of sleep for as long as 24 hours .
Researchers then dissected their brains and measured the levels of four pre-synaptic proteins and one post - synaptic protein .
All levels rose progressively during periods of wakefulness and fell after sleep .
Other experiments confirmed that the changes in protein levels were not caused by exposure to light and darkness or by the stimulation itself , but by sleep and waking .
They also used confocal microscopy and an antibody that specifically recognizes BRP to measure the expression of this protein in many fly - brain areas .
Higher levels of these synaptic proteins during waking may be evidence of random experiences that fill the brain every day and need to be dissipated to make room for the learning and memories that are truly significant .
" Much of what we learn in a day , we do n't really need to remember , " Cirelli says .
" If you 've used up all the space , you can't learn more before you clean out the junk that is filling up your brain . "

Reformist presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said Saturday morning that the 4 pm GMT rally on Saturday against the alleged stealing of the presidential election in Iran would go ahead .
This despite the threats made by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in his Friday prayer sermon to crack down on “ chaos . ” Karroubi , a cleric , is not a wild man and his determination to forge on shows that Khamenei did not succeed in laying the issue to rest .
Moroever , there are popular constituencies with genuine grievances who are doing grassroots organizing .
( For the role of women in the protests , see here .
Khamenei ’s speech on Friday underlined that Iran was under siege from abroad .
He implied that Britain and the United States were sponsoring counter - revolutionary fifth columns aimed at overthrowing the regime .
He said that Israel and its supporters were plotting against Iran .
He depicted the righteous , pious , just and upright Islamic Republic of Iran as virtually alone in the world , at risk of being toppled by the wicked , oppressive global powers dedicated to the iniquitous hegemony of consumer capitalism , which corrupts morals and punishes the poor .
It is for this reason , he said , that everyone must pull together .
He was careful to depict the crisis as a split among old comrades in arms .
He acknowledged that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had gone too far in his television debates with rivals , having impugned the integrity of the Islamic Republic in the 1980s through the present , having accused members of the Hashemi Rafsanjani family of getting rich from corrupt dealings with the government , and having slammed the son of Ali Akbar Nateq Nuri ( former speaker of the house and failed presidential aspirant in 1997 ) for embezzlement from state coffers .
Khamenei praised the frankness and openness of the televised presidential debates but warned that if they descended too far into personal accusations and bickering they would become counter - productive .
Khamenei praised the contributions to the revolution of Mir Hosain Mousavi , whom he depicts as the runner - up in a fair election , and of Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mehdi Karoubi and Mohsen Rezaie , the latter two candidates having been awarded only a few hundred thousand votes each by the electoral commission .
But , he said , given the severe menaces to Iran from abroad , they must bury the hatchet with Ahmadinejad and move on .
Khamenei seemed to me to explain one thing I had not understood , which is why the regime felt compelled to allege that Ahmadinejad had won in such a landslide , of 63 % to Mousavi ’s 32 % .
I still do n’t find that assertion plausible .
But Khamenei gave as one reason for which there could be no challenge to Ahmadinejad ’s victory that a margin of 11 million votes was unassailable .
It would have been more plausible if Ahmadinejad had squeaked out a victory , but I now see that the down side for the regime would have been that a narrow win for the incumbent , despite being more believable , would have emboldened the challengers and put pressure on the supreme leader for a genuine recount .
This way , Khamenei can just shoot down such demands .
But what he does not realize is that although he has made it easier to resist a recount , he has completely undermined faith in the system on the part of millions of Iranians , who , as he said , were system insiders , not outsiders .
Whether or not Khamenei succeeds in quelling the current unrest , I do n’t think the regime will be left untouched by this debacle in the future .
Khamenei dismissed carping from the US and the UK about Iran ’s authoritarian system as mere hypocrisy .
The US , he said , has killed thousands in an illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq , and is bombing people in Afghanistan .
Even domestically , he alleged , the US does not permit freedom of dissent , as shown by the Clinton administration ’s siege of the Branch Davidian sect at Waco , Tx. , which ended with large numbers of people being immolated .
[ Khamenei conveniently leaves out that this was an armed group engaged in firearms violations and child abuse ; as if such an armed cult would be tolerated by his government in Iran !
Though it is true that many religion specialists believe the Reno approach was heavy - handed and counter - productive . ]
He also found laughable British protestations against Iran ’s system in light of the current scandal in the UK over the members of parliament using public funds to fix up their houses , buy houses , or pay mortgages on alleged houses that did not actually exist .
( This scandal has angered the British public like nothing I ’ve seen in 40 years of visiting the UK , and has profoundly undermined public trust in government ; I doubt most Americans , who mainly get their news from television , even know about it , since corporate mass media in the US encourages the public to cocoon and ignore the rest of the world where possible .
But Khamenei ’s point may resonate with some Britons . )
The tropes of British and American conspiracies against Iranian sovereignty are so well ingrained in Iranian consciousness that Khamenei only had to allude to them .
There are odd idees fixes in the Iranian public about British power in Iran that go back to the Victorian age when British India neighbored the Qajar empire and asserted its south as a British sphere of influence during the Great Game with tsarist Russia over Central Asia .
Me , I wonder if MI6 even has more than a handful of field officers and local agents in Iran .
This paranoid style in Iranian political discourse ( which has its counterparts in the US ) was being deployed to damn the protesters as witting or unwitting tools of nefarious imperial designs on the Iranian state .
Khamenei heavily implied that the protesters would be cracked down on brutally if they continued , and would be depicted and treated as traitors .
At the end of the sermon , Khamenei prayed to the hidden Twelfth Imam , the Shiite messiah , to whom , he said , true sovereignty over Iran belonged .
This way of speaking seemed to me to be a concession to Ahmadinejad , who sees the Islamic Republic as the manifestation of the will of the hidden Imam , a view mainstream Shiite clerics find blasphemous .
Shiites believe that after the Prophet Muhammad ’s death , he was succeeded by his son- in - law and cousin Ali , and then the latter ’s descendants ( also the Prophet ’s descendants through his daughter Fatimah , Ali ’s wife ) .
The Twelver branch of Shiism in Iran and Iraq believes that the Twelfth Imam disappeared as a small child into a supernatural , immortal dimension .
Some sayings have him walking hidden among us , others speak of his location in a distant mystical geography ( the mountain of Jabulsa ’ e.g. )
But Shiites believe he will one day reveal himself , or return .
In his absence , there can be no truly legitimate government , since the descendant of the Prophet or Imam should rule by secret divine knowledge .
Khomeini alleged that in the Imam ’s absence , the seminary - trained clergy could rule in his stead , though Khomeini did not maintain that the clergy had certain knowledge of the Imam ’s will ; the best they could do was an educated conjecture ( zann ) based on scripture and holy sayings , but since that was the best they could do , they would be forgiven if they got anything wrong .
That is a different stance from Ahmadinejad ’s which sees the hidden hand of the Imam working through the theocratic state .
Khamenei did not endorse the latter view explicitly , but he did seem to me to imply that the protesters were rebelling not just against a mortal government but against the will of the Hidden Imam himself .
It now seems only a matter of time until there are high - level arrests and then an intervention against the protesters by the security forces of a quite brutal sort .
Only if Mousavi backs down ( and thus possibly demoralizes the crowds ) can this outcome now be averted .
The real question is whether this is 1963 , when the shah managed to put down a rebellion led by Ruhollah Khomeini , or whether it is 1978 - 79 , when he failed to do so .
The answer lies in the depth of support for the protests among the population , and in the stance of the various armed forces toward the latter .
In 1963 the military was willing to crack down hard on the protesters .
In 1978 , they started refusing to fire on them .
The air force officers actually went over to Khomeini , which was decisive .
Precisely because the opposition is from within the ruling circle , we cannot know what the Revolutionary Guards and the regular armed forces are thinking .
Mousavi helped get Iran ’s military act together during the Iran - Iraq War .
Rezaie is a former commander of the Revolutionary Guards , Iran ’s national guard .
If the armed forces hesitate or split , Khamenei could be in real trouble .
If not , the protesters could end up being crushed .

you 're saying your 3G network would fold like a cheap suit if these apps took off
it already has in some places
Sweating bullets over network saturation , are we ?
AT&T 's obviously taking a good helping of heat today over Sling 's rock - and - a - hard - place decision to remove 3G streaming capability from its SlingPlayer Mobile build for the iPhone -- a decision that gets at the very heart of several hot - button issues plaguing AT&T and Apple alike -- and the carrier understandably felt the need to release an official statement to address the situation .
Unfortunately , it prompts as many questions as it offers answers .
It starts off simply enough , stating that apps like SlingPlayer could create congestion on the network that denies services to others -- and while a truly trivial number of users own Slingboxes , we understand what they 're getting at ; no amount of tweaking or fudging of a modern HSPA network can withstand the traffic onslaught generated by wildly popular streaming video services .
Here 's where we start to lose our way , though .
AT&T cites a portion of its wireless terms and conditions -- " Applications like this , which redirect a TV signal to a personal computer , are specifically prohibited under our terms of service " -- and says that it considers " smartphones like the iPhone to be personal computers in that they have the same hardware and software attributes as PCs . "
Sure , guys , but a RAZR shares 85 percent of its DNA with a PC and an iPhone shares 87 percent , so we 're splitting hairs here -- never mind the fact that you 've inexplicably labeled the S60 - powered Nokia 6650 ( which can run SlingPlayer , by the by ) a dumbphone simply because it lacks a QWERTY keyboard .
Furthermore , AT&T specifically points out that it does n't restrict users from downloading streaming videos , which is the very problem SlingPlayer generates -- the upload from the user 's TV on the far end is the ISP 's concern , not AT&T's , and we figure that the network pressure generated by the download is roughly equivalent to watching a whole bunch of YouTube videos .
It does n't add up .
Next , the carrier uses the opportunity to pimp its extensive WiFi network and says that you 're welcome to use SlingPlayer there ; that 's all well and good , and yes , it 's cool that AT&T gives iPhone users free access to the hotspots , but it's no substitute for the mobility of streaming Sling over the WWAN , which works really freaking well -- just ask countless BlackBerry , S60 , WinMo , and Palm users who are using SlingPlayer as you read this .
The only material difference is that they can't be touched -- not as easily , at least , as iPhone users who are bound to the whim of Apple 's singular , all - powerful clearinghouse .
Look , AT&T , just tell it like it is : .
Thing is , -- trust us , we 've experienced it firsthand -- so let 's make sure the blame gets distributed appropriately here .

Microsoft announced that Windows 7 would be " generally available " on October 22 , according to a Dow Jones news report .
UPDATED with confirmation by Microsoft .

Bill Veghte , SVP of the Windows business , is quoted as saying : " We feel confident that we will deliver Windows 7 with our partners on Oct. 22 . "
Does this mean it appears in retail PCs before it appears in boxes , or will it all hit together on the same day ?
Regardless , it 's a pretty nice early date , definitely good for the Christmas PC - buying season , assuming there is a Christmas this year .
We have confirmed the date with Microsoft , and have received this helpful definition : " General Availability ( GA ) is when consumers can actually purchase the software and PCs with the software preinstalled . "
Also , " release to manufacturing " ( RTM ) , when the finished software is given to computer makers to pre-load on new machines , takes place in " late July , " presumably over a matter of weeks .

Facing death every day :
The most dangerous job on earth
They are armed with just a pair of pliers and raw courage .
As the widow of a hero bomb disposal expert prepares to collect his medal , ROBERT HARDMAN meets the bravest ( and most modest ) of the brave ...
How on earth are you supposed to keep your cool in this thing ?
You can hardly bend your legs , you feel as if you are trapped in a diving bell and the whole lot weighs more than 7st .
But this is the uniform of a small elite who must always keep the coolest of heads while all around are losing theirs .
In fact , they might even crack a joke while they 're at it .
They are the people with what is , arguably , the worst job in the world .
They do n't see it that way , of course .
In fact , they are devoted to their profession and are universally regarded as the world leaders in their art .
Which is just as well because , right now , the world needs Britain 's bomb disposal experts more than ever .
Last week , the spectre of an Al Qaeda superbomb in northern England prompted an enormous police operation and many arrests .
The late Warrant Officer Gary O'Donnell :
He was ' brave as a lion '
Concrete details have yet to emerge , but one thing is beyond doubt : if any such bomb should surface , it will be the men and women of 11 EOD ( Explosive Ordnance Disposal )
Regiment who will end up walking towards it while the rest of us are stampeding in the opposite direction .
As I stand here alone , holding a missile the weight of a small child with a mobile phone detonator attached , I cannot comprehend what makes anyone sign up for this sort of work .
When one of my hosts cheekily calls the mobile attached to the bomb and it starts ringing - very funny , chaps - I am on the cusp of a coronary .
All right , I know I am at 11 EOD Regiment 's Oxfordshire headquarters .
I know this thing is a fake .
I know I am being watched by some of the best and boldest experts in the world - and they are all laughing .
But this thing still looks like a bomb , it 's in my hands and it's going ' Brrring brrring .
. .'
In recent days , this assiduously low - key branch of the Armed Forces has been propelled back into the spotlight for the saddest but noblest of reasons .
In last month 's list of gallantry decorations from the Ministry of Defence , it was announced that Warrant Officer Gary O'Donnell had been awarded the George Medal for ' repeated and sustained acts of immense bravery ' in Afghanistan , where he had defused more than 50 bombs .
What made this award so exceptional was the fact that WO O'Donnell already held the George Medal for similar heroism in Iraq , where he had tackled several devices under enemy fire .
It was the first time in 26 years that this decoration - just below the Victoria Cross and George Cross - had been given to the same person twice .
But the announcement was a posthumous one .
The 40 - year - old father - of - four had been killed by a Taliban device , which was threatening troops and civilians last September , just nine weeks after the birth of his son , Ben .
It will be his widow , Toni , who goes to Buckingham Palace shortly to receive the Bar to his original George Medal .
The Mail has now learned that WO O'Donnell is to receive another honour .
Next Thursday - on St George 's Day - the men and women of 11 EOD Regiment will gather with his family at his old headquarters to watch a new wing be named in his honour .
The O'Donnell building will be home to 40 members of this remarkable unit .

It is impossible to say how many lives this one man has saved .
In one case , WO O'Donnell stopped a bomb going off in Afghanistan by jamming his finger into its clothes peg detonator .
Another time , he was attempting to defuse a bomb when he realised that a man in a nearby crowd was trying to detonate the thing by mobile phone ( he managed to deflect the signal using lead screens ) .
His commanding officer summed him up as follows : ' Bigger than life .
Brave as a lion . '
The rest of the Army were in awe of him .
The Parachute Regiment does not mess with words .
Major Russell Lewis of 2 Para , himself the holder of the Military Cross and who knew WO O'Donnell in Afghanistan , said : ' I have seen many brave soldiers and he was one of the bravest .
What he did was above and beyond the call of duty . '
Warrant Officer O'Donnell did not see it like that , of course .
As his widow has explained : ' He just got on with it .
He loved his job . '
That was the same response given this week by Captain Tom Bennett , 28 , shortly after taking out a 45 lb bomb near a crucial bridge in Afghanistan 's Helmand Province .
As he approached the device - knowing there could be a remote detonation any second - he was ambushed by enemy fire on three sides , but pressed on under covering fire and attached a charge to the thing before withdrawing to press the button .
Only half of the device went off , so the gallant captain had to run back through the enemy bullets and do it all over again .
' Just another job , ' he said later .
So what does makes these men tick ?
I have come to 11 EOD Regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps in Didcot to find out .
It could be any old military complex except for the odd truck saying ' Bomb Disposal Unit ' and the flaming ' A ' symbol on various uniforms ( it stands for Ammunition Technician ) .
Inside I find Warrant Officer Class 1 Martin Laverack , 38 , who has just returned from Afghanistan after six months .
He has n't even been home yet as he needs to debrief the regiment on all his discoveries .
And he does n't pause for a moment when I ask him what his worst moment was in Helmand Province .
' Losing Gary , ' he says .
' I 'd known him for 15 years .
He was in the tent opposite me .
We waved him off on a few jobs and that was it .
It could have been anybody working on the one that killed him . '
Do n't moments like that make him rethink his career ?
He looks baffled .
' If I could n't do the job properly , I would n't be allowed to do it , ' he says .
What I cannot understand is why , given all the technology available , anyone needs to get killed any more .
A bomb was found in this parked car in central London on June 29 , 2007 .
Bomb disposal experts do a crucial job but it 's dangerous work and they risk their lives every day
WO Laverack explains there are often situations when you can't use a remote - controlled robot ( known as a ' wheelbarrow ' ) .
Similarly , there are often situations where there is neither time nor space to use the hefty 7st bomb suit which took me 15 minutes to put on .
' If you are arriving by helicopter and people are shooting , your options are limited , ' he adds .
So why not just shoot the blasted thing or spray it with petrol and light a match ?
' Because we need to discover what we are up against . '
For obvious security reasons , he can't tell me much about techniques .
But he says he signed up to be an ammunition technician in 1991 and , after five years ' training , he faced his first job - a suspected IRA car bomb in Preston , Lancashire .
What was he thinking as he took what they call the ' long walk ' from the ICP ( incident control point ) to the target ?
' I was probably wondering what I was having for tea that night , ' he says .
WO Laverack does not do melodrama .
He loves the job , he says , because of the challenge and the unusual level of responsibility .
He points out that it is not unusual for a young ammunition technician to have a colonel hanging on his every word as soon as an IED ( improvised explosive device ) is discovered .
The outside world , he says , finds it very hard to grasp what he actually does , so he does n't tell many people .
His colleague , Warrant Officer Steve Fallon , says his own parents - in - law did not believe what he did for a living until he turned up outside their house in a truck with ' Bomb Disposal Unit ' on the side .
But then this curious breed of men - and there are now a few women , too - have always been a modest bunch .
At the outbreak of World War II , there was not a single specialist unit charged with handling unexploded bombs .
By the end of the war , during which the Luftwaffe dropped more than half a million bombs on Britain , the Armed Forces had tackled 45,000 which did not go off .
Quite apart from the death and destruction it could cause long after landing , an unexploded bomb ( UXB ) could cause as much disruption as an explosion if , say , its mere presence shut an entire airfield .
On land , the early bomb disposal teams were drawn from the Royal Engineers .
Their kit consisted of a shovel , a pick - axe and a bit of string to pull out the fuse from a ' safe ' distance if they could run far enough .
The best candidates , so the joke went , were ' unmarried and good sprinters ' .
Their life expectancy was less than ten weeks .
One of the bravest , and most modest , veterans I 've ever met is Colonel Stuart Archer , now 94 , who found himself leading a bomb disposal team in Swansea in 1940 when that city was being thumped by the Germans .
On one occasion , two hefty UXBs were blocking a vital Battle of Britain airfield , so the young Archer simply dug them up , hauled them on to a lorry and drove them away - alone - to a nearby field for demolition .
Bomb disposal experts dig a hole to dispose of a rocket propelled grenade found by the roadside in Chad , central Africa
Soon afterwards , he was called to defuse a series of bombs in , of all places , a blazing oil refinery .
While everything around him was exploding , he spent hours in the inferno dismantling a single bomb and managed to extract not just a new type of fuse , but also a new breed of German booby trap .
These things had killed many UXB teams but he had the first specimen intact , to the delight of the boffins back at base .
' This was luck , luck , luck , ' he said later .
It was also monumentally brave , and George VI had no hesitation in awarding him one of the first George Crosses .
As the years progressed , a new breed of enemy evolved - the terrorist .
While the Royal Engineers handled industrial ordnance dumped from the air , it required very different skills to tackle the improvised bombs of today 's enemies .
That task fell to the ammunition experts of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps , now part of the Royal Logistic Corps .
Bob Harvey , 70 , learned the trade using a fishing rod to ' jerk ' homemade bombs in Cyprus and Malaysia , and was presented with one of the first car bombs in Northern Ireland in 1972 .
' It was 20lb of explosive with an alarm clock , ' he recalls .
' We tried shooting it but when that did n't work , I had to go up and deal with it . '
He remembers the frantic on - the - job learning curve in those days - and the casualties .
' We lost three men in a week , ' he recalls .
' There was real pressure to " get things back to normal " , and the terrorist had the edge .
It [ the explosions ] damaged my hearing and the stress affected me a lot .
But I 'd do it again . '
Mark Ritchie , 69 , also remembers the pressure to ' get on with it ' from his days as a warrant officer in Ulster , where he once dismantled 500lb of gelignite concealed in milk churns in County Londonderry .
' If you join the Army , you 've got a job of work and you do n't want to be seen as not up to the job , ' he says .
The game of cat and mouse between terrorist and bomb disposal teams would last for years - which is why Forces all over the world still call on 11 EOD Regiment for its unique expertise .
The Army 's kit was much - improved by October 1989 when WO Barry Johnson found himself tackling a set of mortar bombs next to a hospital in Derry .
The remote - controlled ' wheelbarrow ' was of little use and he decided to handle all the bombs himself .
The last one blew him right across the road .
But even as he lay there critically injured , he continued to give instructions .
Having been awarded the George Cross , Barry Johnson GC could have retired with distinction .
But he did n't .
' I just wanted to get back to my family for Christmas , get my sight back and then get back to work , ' says the 56 - year - old father of two .
And , in due course , he did all three .
He thinks he had it easy compared to today 's bomb disposal teams .
' They 're having to chuck smoke grenades just to get near the device without being shot at , ' he says .
He has huge admiration for his fellow GC , Captain Peter Norton , who supervised a major bomb disposal operation in Iraq in 2005 despite having suffered dreadful injuries himself .
But let us never forget those who are left behind .
Flo Grosvenor , 69 , was a young mother with a six - year - old son when her first husband , Staff Sergeant Chris Cracknell , was killed with Sergeant Anthony Butcher while defusing an IRA car bomb 37 years ago .
' I remember the three officers in uniform coming to the door and they just looked at me , ' she recalls .
' I was absolutely devastated .
I just thought : " What do I tell my son ? " '
Over the years , she has been greatly comforted by the friendship within the War Widows Association and by a ' lovely memorial ' in Belfast .
But it all floods back every time she hears of a military casualty .
' You never get over it .
You live with it , ' she says .
' Chris was always quiet about his job .
He said that only a fool would not be frightened .
But he loved his work . '
So did Gary O'Donnell .
The world never gets any safer .
But wherever there is terror and panic , just be grateful for the quiet soul making that ' long walk ' into the unknown , armed with nothing more than a pair of pliers and the heart of a lion .
So check this : AT&T just launched a service called FamilyMap .
It basically let ’s you locate any number on your AT&T account for a monthly fee .
Here ’s the thing though … besides the first notification text message alerting that subscriber they are being tracked , everything else is completely silent .
For instance , we signed up and were able to track both an iPhone 3G and a Bold completely without any visible indication .
No text message , nothing .
What ’s even more strange , however , is that this is n’t just using cell tower triangulation , it actually can activate the GPS chip .
How messed up is that ?
Something is wrong with this picture …
But hey , for only $ 9.99 / month for two phones or $ 14.95 for five phones , you can have the pleasure of being as freaked out as we are .
Thanks , James !

In the first article in our two - part series on virtualization , we asked the IT pros in the Ars forums to share their tips and best practices for first - time virtualization deployments .
The results were extremely useful , and we got plenty of positive reader feedback on the effort .
So for this second and final installment , we asked those same users about the future of virtualization , and about what they see as the next phase in this fast - moving trend 's evolution .
Their answers provide a glimpse at where the folks in the IT trenches expect virtualization to go , and at what they hope to see happen in the near - to medium - term .
I 've broken the discussion down into a few main themes , some of which will be familiar to Ars readers .
We 've been tracking some of these trends for a while in our coverage , and the forum discussion indicates that they 're still worth watching .
The VM will move down the stack
Right off the bat , user K0DE set the tone for the discussion with his opening post , which is a response to my initial question about the future of the hypervisor :
" I 'd guess it 's going to be a piece of firmware / hardware .
As long as the hooks into the hypervisor are easy for an OS to connect to I can't see why it would n't be done in hardware . "
A large part of the ensuing discussion evolved around variants on this theme , with many users emphasizing that the VM will shift down the software / hardware stack from being OS - hosted via a client application , to being hosted in a hypervisor that lives in embedded firmware on the motherboard and is loaded at boot - time .
Surprisingly , despite the widespread agreement that a flash - based hypervisor is the way to go , none of the responses tried to make a detailed case for this move .
It may be because the benefits are obvious , and indeed I 've written previously about the numerous advantages to this approach , but it 's worth recapping why it 's a good idea .
With a flash - based hypervisor ( see Intel 's Rapid Boot Toolkit for an example of this ) you can do stateless network booting .
I 've seen Windows booted in this fashion over a network , and it ran quite comfortably ; I can also imagine that a stripped - down Linux or BSD image runs really well in this fashion .
This kind of stateless net booting has a few benefits , not the least of which is the fact that you can do live provisioning where you decide boot time whether you want a node to be stateless or stateful , and you can easily switch between the two options .
Perhaps the main advantage to stateless netbooting is the power saved per node , since the node does n't need a hard drive to run the OS .
This means that server nodes can go entirely without a local hard drive , or they can opt not to use an installed hard drive by just rebooting from the network .
Of course , OS - hosted virtualization approaches wo n't go away , even if most datacenters do end up using a flash - based hypervisor .
So the best answer to the question of the eventual location of the VM in the software stack is probably " everywhere , depending on the usage scenario , " including directly beneath individual applications ( see the next section for more on the last point ) .
The VM will move up the stack
The forum discussion started with the VM taking up residence at the bottom of the stack , but other users suggested that the VM is headed in the opposite direction , as well .
So - called application virtualization , in which an individual application is deployed ( often over the network ) to a client machine by wrapping it in a VM , is something I 've seen promoted by a number of vendors who have software solutions in this space , as well as by Intel .
The theory here is that app virtualization , especially in its application streaming form , gives you a number of licensing , security , and policy advantages over running an app directly .
Here are a few of the bonuses :
A virtualized app leaves no trace in the OS , so there are no registry , DLL , or other issues to deal with .
With app streaming you can serve up the version of an app that you have a license for , so it solves the license compliance problems that still plague the enterprise .
Application streaming lets you update the app centrally and serve this updated version to clients ; this is in contrast the traditional method of trying to push updates to all of the clients in an enterprise .
The drawback to app streaming , which I once pointed out to a Symantec who did n't want to hear it , is that for some categories of applications , you may break a power user 's workflow by forcing an update on them .
When this happens , the users that are the most productive — i.e. , the ones who have custom scripts , toolbars , and tweaks that tend to be version - dependent — are the ones who suffer , while the least productive users ( i.e. they use the out - of - the - box configuration ) are spared any interruption .
The degree to which this is actually a big deal greatly depends , of course , on the specific organization and on its user base .
The embedded hypervisor will be guest - OS agnostic
Quite a few users insisted that the hypervisors that end up embedded on the motherboard will have to support multiple guest OS types .
Many of our forum folks work in heterogeneous OS environments , and they have to be able to support all of the users on their network , regardless of OS .
Of course , as one contributor pointed out , if you 're an all - Windows shop , then there does n't seem any reason not to use Microsoft 's hypervisor , and likewise with RedHat 's in an all - Linux environment .
But if you 're supporting a heterogeneous OS environment , then you have no choice but to use a hypervisor that fully supports any guest OS that you may have to bring up on your network .
The pendulum swings back from client to server
One of the larger themes to come up in multiple virtualization threads is the idea that virtualization somehow represents a cyclical shift back to the server from the client .
In other words , if you tell the story of the past four decades of computer evolution in terms of an ongoing tug - of - war between a centralized server ( a mainframe , a file / app server , a cluster , " the cloud " ) and a constellation of clients , then virtualization as an enabling technology represents a shift of power and control back in the server direction .
This theme came up in the latest conversation in the context of user comments about the growing importance of enterprise - level management tools , which some users envision as a single , centralized point of management and monitoring that gives admins visibility across all the layers of the stack from a single tool .
So what 's interesting about this latest turn of the wheel is that the " mainframe " on this cycle is really a large cluster of more - or - less commodity machines that will eventually present itself to the admin as a single entity and present to the client as either a single server or as a flexible resource pool ( " the cloud " ) .
The future of the OS
One worthwhile point that came up in our forum conversation was that any discussion of the future of virtualization is really about the future of the OS .
Abstractly speaking , virtualization is just the latest development in the operating system 's ongoing adaptation to different forms of multitenancy ( protected memory and multiuser support being two earlier points on this trend ) .
So virtualization provides for even more robust forms of multitenancy than had previously been possible by cleaving the OS into separate hardware - and application - facing components .
Perhaps ironically , the drivers still live on the app - facing ( guest OS ) side , which means that when Marc Andressen famously called Windows " a bag of drivers " back in the Netscape era , he was n't wrong — just really early .
This article is part of our temporary focus on virtualization here at Ars .

Today ’s G.I.s are lucky if they get radios when they go on patrol in Iraq .
But by 2030 , their uniforms will be packed with nano - antenna arrays , capable of communicating with everything from drones to satellites .
The soldiers will all be Hulk - strong , and Spiderman - agile , thanks to their nanotech - based exoskeletons .
“ Neural prosthetics ” and “ smart drugs ” will make them battlefield geniuses .
On - board computers will let them understand every language — and every cultural reference — as if they were natives .
Naturally , their flexible , nanofiber uniforms will be all - but - impervious to bullets , flame , and lasers , too .
That ’s the thinking , at least , over at the Soldier Research Design and Engineering Center in Natick , MA .
Researchers there have spent years of effort — and tens of millions of dollars — to give tomorrow ’s soldiers high - tech supersuits .
The results have been … well , less than super .
One such program , “ Future Force Warrior , ” was supposed to deploy next year .
Now : never mind .
A simpler effort , to give G.I.s digital maps and software radios , “ Land Warrior , ” had to fight a rear - guard action within the Army to keep from getting canceled .
So now the folks at Natick are starting over again .
They recently released a white paper , on the “ Future Soldier 2030 Initiative . ”
It ’s not official U.S. Army doctrine or anything .
“ Nor is it intended to answer every question raised about warfare in 2030 .
Our intent is to stir imaginations , and start a dialogue about how best to equip the soldier , ” the paper says .
“ There is no budget .
Right now it is an analytical tool , ” Natick ’s Jean - Louis “ Dutch ” DeGay tells InsideDefense.com .
A bit of a fantasy , in other words .
So maybe it makes sense that “ researchers have maintained contact with Hollywood and the video game industry in order to exchange ideas . ”
Movies like “ Aliens ” and “ Starship Troopers ” have inspired the military ’s efforts to build exoskeletons , and SRDEC in turn has provided input to 2007 ’s “ Transformers ” and the upcoming “ G.I. Joe , ” in which characters wear armored strength - and speed - enhancing “ accelerator suits . ”
“ It used to be that art imitated life or life imitated life , and now that line has been blurred , ” said DeGay .
Now , the military is making progress on building some early prototypes of the gear that the Natick white paper has in mind .
Two companies are competing to build crude exoskeletons that can radically improve the wearer ’s strength .
In - helmet monitors have been deployed , to see if G.I.s get hit with a blast that might lead to traumatic brain injury .
Still , that ’s nothing like the panoply of sensors Natick has in mind , to check on a soldier ’s “ energy levels , work load , hydration , stress levels , thermal state , [ and ] sleep . ”
Nor can today ’s exoskeletons automatically stabilize wounds , use face recognition to spot from foe , or provide “ pulsed energy weapon protection . ”
And they certainly do n’t come with a “ digital buddy ” who can remind soldiers of tasks , order them more ammo , handle inter - office e-mail , and “ adapt to an individual soldier ’s personality , strengths , and weaknesses . ”
But a grunt can dream , right ?

Shots have been fired at an opposition rally in Tehran where more than 100,000 Iranians were protesting against the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
An Associated Press photographer saw one person killed when shots were fired from a compound for pro-government militiamen .
Several other people appeared to have been seriously wounded in Tehran 's Azadi Square .
BBC 's Persian service quoted an eyewitness saying that four protesters have been killed .
A reporter on Iran 's English - language Press TV said : " There has been sporadic shooting out there ... I can see people running here . "
Speaking live on the air , he said : " A number of people who are armed ... I do n't know exactly who they are , but they have started to fire on people , causing havoc in Azadi Square . "
Local residents said they had heard shooting in three districts of northern Tehran .
Earlier , the defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi addressed the crowd in his first public appearance since Friday 's disputed election .
Addressing the crowd from the roof of his car , Mousavi said he was ready to compete in a fresh election .
"
The vote of the people is more important than Mousavi or any other person , " he said , according to al - Jazeera television .
The gathering followed an announcement from Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , that he had ordered an investigation into claims vote - rigging had given the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a landslide victory .
The rally had been banned by the authorities and was initially called off by Mousavi amid fears of violence .
But tens of thousands of people , dressed in Mousavi 's green campaign colours , took to the streets , chanting " God is great " and " We fight , we die – we will not accept this vote - rigging " .
Calling on Ahmadinejad to resign , they said the election results were a " coup d'etat " and chanted " Death to the lying government " .
" I just want to show the president that we are not bandits .
I want my vote back , " Maryam Sedaghati , a supporter , told Reuters .
Scuffles broke out as Ahmadinejad supporters on motorbikes used sticks to beat the marchers .
Mousavi had attempted to cancel the rally after receiving warnings that militias responsible for policing it would be equipped with live ammunition .
The rally had been banned by Iran 's interior ministry , which declared the gathering " illegal " .
Iran has been plunged into turmoil since Friday when the government declared that Ahmadinejad had won , a claim his rivals immediately disputed .
Iran 's leaders spent the weekend urging people to accept the result but today Khamenei ordered an investigation into allegations of vote - rigging and fraud .
Iranian state television said he had told the guardian council , the clerical body that oversees elections , to examine Mousavi 's claims of widespread vote - rigging .
The guardian council was reported to have said it would take no more than 10 days to hand down its ruling after complaints from Mousavi and another candidate , Mohsen Rezai .
" Mousavi and Rezai appealed yesterday .
After the official announcement [ of the appeal ] , the guardian council has seven to 10 days to see if it was a healthy election or not , " the ISNA news agency quoted a council spokesman , Abbasali Kadkhodai , as saying .
The news represents a surprising turnaround for Khamenei , who had previously welcomed the results .
" Issues must be pursued through a legal channel , " state TV quoted Khamenei as saying .
The supreme leader said he had " insisted that the guardian council carefully probe this letter " .
Iranian TV quoted Khamenei as urging Mousavi to try to keep the violence from escalating and saying , " It is necessary that activities are done with dignity . "
The UN secretary - general Ban Ki-moon today called on Iran 's leaders to heed " the genuine will of Iranian people " , but stopped short of fully endorsing Khamenei 's call for a re-examination of the election result .
" The position of me and the United Nations is that the genuine will of Iranian people should be fully respected .
I 'm closely following how this investigation into this election result will come out , " he said .
Ahmadinejad claimed the election results were fair and compared the protests over the past three days to the passion shown by football fans after a game .
But in a further sign of the escalating tensions , he put off a planned visit to Russia , cancelling a meeting planned for today with President Dmitry Medvedev .
Reports continued to spread that dozens of leading members of the opposition had been detained , and that security forces had last night raided a dormitory at Tehran University , killing three people and injuring 15 .
The reports could not be confirmed .
The official result – 63 % for Ahmadinejad and 34 % for Mousavi – means four more years for the president and an end to hopes for reform at home as well as , perhaps , detente with the west .
All three contenders to the presidency , reformist and conservative , have raised serious doubts about the result .
Mousavi claimed that , on Friday night , he had been informed by the interior ministry that he had won the election convincingly .
That claim was first published on a popular website that was subsequently closed down .
There were also reports of a leaked interior ministry figures allegedly suggesting Mousavi had won .
EU foreign ministers today expressed " serious concern " over the fraud allegations and called for an investigation into the conduct of the election .
Small groups of Ahmadinejad supporters gathered outside the British and French embassies in Tehran , protesting at European " interference " in the elections .
Ahmadinejad has rejected claims of fraud as a " psychological war " by the foreign media .

Sarah Palin stood firm against wasteful government spending today , rejecting $ 28.6 million dollars in stimulus funds .
“ Alaskans and our communities have a long history of independence and opposing many mandates from Washington , D.C , ” she proclaimed .
Well , Alaska has already accepted about $ 930 million in other stimulus money , so what was the program that Palin found so pernicious ?
It turns out that this money would have gone to energy efficiency — weatherizing homes against the bitter cold , that kind of thing .
Alaska , of course , is quite a chilly place , and its inhabitants pay the highest energy costs in the nation .
The money will now probably flow to other states instead —
Palin was the only governor in the country to reject energy efficiency funds .
But as shivering Alaskans worry about their electricity bills this winter , they can at least take comfort in the fact that Palin is keeping her relationship with the GOP base toasty warm .

Encyclopedia of Tie Knots
This is the definitive catalogue of tie knots , most of which were invented by me and my co-author , Yong Mao .
At the end of this page , I give some general notes on ties .
The catalogue follows , and compliments , The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie , though it does not excerpt any of the text therein .
More detailed information can be found in the book .
A mathematical derivation of the knots included here and technical information about the different knots can be found in the two physics journal articles , ' Designing tie knots by random walks ' ( a summary ) and ' Tie knots , random walks and topology ' ( a detailed exposition ) .
Introduction
The two ways of beginning a tie knot .
The six ways of continuing a tie knot .
The two ways of ending a tie knot .
The T T ending .
This can be generalised to T T T , etc. , as expected .
Knots of Note
The knot tying directions make use of the L - R - C notation below , where ' i ' and 'o ' mean in and out .
I give explicit illustrated instructions for the classic tie knots 2 , 5 , 7 and 31 ( four - in - hand , Pratt , half - Windsor and Windsor ) ; more illustrated instructions can be found in the book .
Of the 85 possible tie knots that can be tied with a tie of conventional length , the following are of particular interest .
The first number is the number of the knot , as catalogued in the Summary of Knots inand at the bottom of this page .
Some of the knots have close cousins with which they are often confused ( not including mirror images ) .
These typically involve the transposition of one or more L - R pairs .
They are indicated by prefixing the name of their relation with ' co - ' , as in co-Windsor .
1 Lo Ri Co T Oriental ( aka simple , small )
Although this is the simplest of knots , it is not widely known in the Western world , where it is sometimes called the simple knot .
It is , however , widely used by youth groups in China , hence its name .
The Oriental is particularly useful for wool or thick silk ties .
On thinner cloths it can loosen up over time , requiring frequent adjustment .
The Oriental is also the first knot to be tied with the tie inside - out around the neck , a technique unfamiliar to most men but used in half of all possible knots .
2 Li Ro Li Co T four - in- hand
This is , without question , the most well - known , and today most frequently worn , knot of all .
Tied in an ordinary silk tie , it is a small knot with a characteristic elongated , asymmetric shape .
In thicker ties , the four - in - hand can look deceptively large ; the Windsor knot , named after the eponymous Duke , was in fact a four - in - hand tied with specially tailored thick ties .
It was the public , rather than the Duke , which invented the Windsor knot and in an attempt to emulate his big knot .
The four - in - hand refers not only to the knot described here , but also to the modern necktie itself .
The knot and the tie were simultaneously introduced in the 1850s as an alternative to the cravats popular at the time .
There are a number of possible etymologies for the name : drivers of the four - in - hand carriage tied their scarves with the above knot ; the reigns of carriage were tied in the same way ; it was worn by members of the now - defunct Four - in - Hand Club .
2 on Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T Ri Co Onassis
Although this knot is technically no different from the four - in - hand ( 2 ) ( the wide blade is simply thrown behind ond over the existing knot ) , it gives a dramatically different appearance .
It was worn by the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis and , according to The New York Times in 1989 , it ' still has a certain popularity along Seventh Avenue ' in New York City .
The suffix ' on ' has been added to the knot number 2 to designate this Onassis variation .
The Ri Co effect can in principle be applied to any knot , although the effect will be the same .
3 Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T Kelvin
This knot , also begun inside - out , is similar to the four - in - hand , but slightly bigger and more symmetric .
It is named after Lord Kelvin who , although he would not have used the knot itself , contributed to the mathematical theory of knots first seriously studied in the 19th century .
3 2 Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T T cross Kelvin
When the T T ending is used with the Kelvin , it produces a cruciform structure similar to the Christensen below ( knot 25 2 ) .
This is the smallest knot with which the T T ending can be used , given that the knot must end L R L R C or R L R L C to do so .
3 2 r Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T T diagonal
When the cross Kelvin is worn in reverse ( back - to - front ) , it shows an unusual diagonal pattern .
The tie itself should be reversed before tying .
4 Lo Ci Ro Li Co T Nicky
This knot , a cousin of the Pratt ( 5 ) , has a compact , symmetric shape , despite the fact that is has two L moves and one R .
In size it is in between the four - in - hand ( 2 ) and half - Windsor ( 7 ) , and it is a natural choice for those seeking a symmetric knot of modest size .
5 Lo Ci Lo Ri Co T Pratt ( aka Shelby )
Although more well - known than the Nicky , this knot is also the co-Nicky , being identical to that knot apart from the transposition of the R - L pair .
Some men prefer the Nicky , some the Pratt ; one or the other should be a staple of any man 's knot repertoire .
6 Li Ro Li Ro Li Co T Victoria
This knot is identical to the four - in - hand apart from the addition of another R - L pass of the the wide blade across the knot before ending .
7 Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T half - Windsor
If a man claims to know a second knot in addition to the four - in - hand , it is likely to be the half - Windsor , the third of the four classic tie knots .
This symmetric knot is medium - sized , with the silhouette of an equilateral triangle .
It can satisfactorily be worn with collars of most sizes and spreads .
Although the name of the half - Windsor suggests it is derived from the Windsor , there is little direct evidence for this claim .
Moreover , the half - Windsor is not half the size of the Windsor , but rather three - quarters .
Keep in mind that the half - Windsor is sometimes a victim of the erroneous naming convention used to describe both it and the Windsor , calling them the Windsor and double - Windsor .
There is no such thing as a double Windsor , and the Windsor should be used to refer to knot 31 only .
8 Li Ro Ci Ro Li Co T co-half - Windsor
This cousin of the half - Windsor has the advantage of self - releasing ( unknotting ) when the thin end is pulled out through the knot .
12 Lo Ri Lo Ci Ro Li Co T St Andrew
14 Lo Ri Lo Ci Lo Ri Co T co-St Andrew
18 Lo Ci Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T Plattsburgh
Named after the small town in up - state New York , where the author was born .
19 Lo Ci Ro Ci Ro Li Co T co-Plattsburgh
23 Li Ro Li Co Ri Lo Ri Co T Cavendish
This is the principal 8 - move , 2 - centre knot .
As its sequence suggests , the Cavendish is a concatenation of two four - in - hands , one being a mirror image of the other .
This gives an idea of its shape : similar to the four - in - hand , but much bigger .
25 2 Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T T Christensen ( aka cross )
This is an ingenious knot which has an unusual cruciform structure .
It is achieved by wrapping the thin blade around twice and passing the wide blade through both loops ( see the explanation of the T T move above ) .
Here is a picture of a Christensen knot from an old catalogue , using a tie of uniform width .
Notice that both layers of the ( normally ) thin end should be visible , which form the two legs of the cross .
The knot is best tied with ties made from thin material , giving the hourglass shape shown here and not the more triangular shape which results from medium - and heavy - weight fabrics .
27 2 Li Ro Ci Ro Li Ro Li Co T T co-Christensen
31 Li Co Ri Lo Ci Ro Li Co T Windsor ( aka double - Windsor )
This is probably the most well - known knot name , though in practice more men know how to tie the simpler half - Windsor ( 7 ) .
It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the double - Windsor ; no such not exists , unless it is meant to refer to the ludicrously large 16 - move knot , Li Co Ri Lo Ci Ro Li Co Ri Co Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T .
The Windsor produces a large , solid , triangular knot , which is not worn as frequently as it was in the first half of the 20th century .
In the Ian Fleming novels , Bond thinks the Windsor knot is ' the mark of a cad ' .
Today it is , curiously , the knot of choice of ( once ) communist leaders and dictators ; Hugo Chavez , Putin and the Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao are examples .
The knot is self - releasing .
Despite the knot 's name , it was not , as is commonly held , invented by the Duke of Windsor .
In his memoirs A Family Album , the Duke explains that it was his specially made thick ties , rather than a complicated knot , that produced the effect :
' The so - called '' Windsor knot ' ' in the tie was adopted in America at a later date .
It was I believe regulation wear for G.I.s during the war , when American college boys adopted it too .
But in fact I was in no way responsible for this .
The knot to which Americans gave my name was a double knot in a narrow tie - a ' ' slim Jim ' ' as it is sometimes called .
It is true that I myself have always preferred a large knot , as looking better than a small one , so during the nineteen twenties I devised , in conclave with Mr Sandford , a tie always of the broad variety which was reinforced by an extra thickness of material to produce this effect .
As far as I know this particular fashion has never been followed in America or elsewhere . '
32 Li Co Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T co-Windsor1
A cousin of the Windsor , but not self - releasing .
33 Li Co Ri Lo Ci Lo Ri Co T co-Windsor2
Another cousin of the Windsor , but not self - releasing .
35 Li Co Li Ro Ci Ro Li Co T co-Windsor3
A self - releasing cousin of the Windsor .
44 Lo Ri Lo Ri Co Li Ro Li Co T Grantchester
48 Lo Ri Lo Ri Co Ri Lo Ri Co T co-Grantchester
54 Lo Ri Co Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T Hanover
This is the principal 9 - move , 3 - centre knot .
It is a direct extension of the Oriental and the half - Windsor , each knot being larger in turn by the addition of an L - R - C triplet .
The Hanover is one move larger than the Windsor , and in shape is slightly less squat - like the half - Windsor , if forms a perfect equilateral triangle .
Being a 9 - move knot , it requires a larger collar or at least one with considerable spread .
It is not self - releasing .
The Hanover is named after the House of Hanover , which lasted from 1760 to 1901 and included the British monarchs George III , George IV , William IV and Victoria .
55 Lo Ri Co Ri Lo Ci Ro Li Co T co-Hanover1
A cousin of the Hanover , but self - releasing .
56 Lo Ri Co Li Ro Ci Ro Li Co T co-Hanover2
Another self - releasing cousin of the Hanover .
59 Lo Ri Co Ri Lo Ci Lo Ri Co T co-Hanover3
Another cousin of the Hanover , but not self - releasing .
78 Lo Ci Ro Ci Lo Ci Ro Li Co T Balthus
This is the principal 9 - move , 4 - centre knot , the largest , broadest class of all .
It is an natural extension of the Plattsburgh , starting inside - out but with the addition of the Lo Ci moves .
The Balthus is very wide , and requires a spread collar to accommodate it .
It is self - releasing .
81 Lo Ci Ro Ci Lo Ci Lo Ri Co T co-Balthus
A cousin of the Balthus , but not self - releasing .

Notes on Ties
Like most elements of Western men's dress , the knotted neckcloth has its origins in England , where the cravat replaced the ruff collar in the mid-17th century .
The earliest record of the tie in its modern form is in the 1850s , where it was worn by young men as sporting attire .
The style became fashionable at once , eclipsing the bow tie in popularity by the early 20th century .
Two essential ties
We will not talk about the color or pattern of ties here , apart from saying that two ties are essential in any man 's wardrobe : a solid navy tie in woven silk ; and a solid black tie in woven or knitted silk .
An undecorated navy tie never goes amiss , whether it is worn with a pair of jeans , a blazer or a morning suit .
Plain black ties , despite their relatively recent exclusive association with funerals , have long been a favorite of James Bond and Italian men .
Tie size
The ideal width of a tie is 3 – 3 ½ inches , which is in natural proportion with the typical man 's suit .
While most ties available today are wider than this , the best tie makers , such as Hermès and many of the shops along London 's Jermyn Street , have consistently produced ties of the ideal width .
Once tied , the length should be such that the tip of the wide blade ends anywhere within 1 inch above or below the waistband .
If the thin blade descends below the wide blade , there are a number of ways to fix it .
One is to choose a bigger knot ; another is to tuck the thin blade into the shirt between the second and third buttons down ; a third is described in Label , below .
Tie handkerchief
If you can't make up your mind as to whether to wear a tie , you can keep the option open and put the tie in the breast pocket of your jacket , where it doubles as a handkerchief .
This looks best with solid - colored ties , with the tie folded in half three times over , to one - eighth of its original length .
Dimple
' When the fabric of the tie permits ( if it is silk twill or a supple Jacquard silk , for example ) , a beautiful effect can be obtained by using the index finger to press a slight convex cavity into the tie just below the knot .
The French call this little hollow a cuillère , which means spoon or scoop ' explains François Chaille in The Book of Ties .
This hollow is called a dimple in English , and it is best suited to wide and medium width ties .
But while one dimple is smart , two is very much an affectation .
Label
On the back of the wide blade a small horizontal band can be found , usually a label with the name of the maker or , on better - made ties , a band of the same material as the tie itself .
While most men slip the thin blade through this band to secure it , it is arguably smarter to leave it free to flow .
If the thin blade is too long after the tie is tied , one way of shortening it is to slip the excess through the label and pass the thin blade through it , as shown .
Storage
Tie experts are divided over the best way to store a tie .
Some say that a tie should be rolled up in a coil when not in use , starting from the thin end .
Others suggest simply hanging it from the middle over a hanger or bar .
In either case a tie should never be left knotted when not in use , which tends to leave heavy creases in it .
It is possible , of course , to tie a tie once and never untie it , but this comes at the expense of wearing the same knot , tied with the same execution , whatever the occasion , collar style , or mood .
Cleaning
It is often said that ties should never be dry - cleaned , but this is not quite true .
It is not the cleaning but the inevitable pressing afterwards which most harms a tie , and the latter can be avoided if a cleaner is warned beforehand .
Nonetheless a tie should not be cleaned unless it shows visible marks or stains .
The death of a much - loved tie invariably results from the fraying of the wide blade 's bottom edges , which usually happens long before any other part of the tie wears out .
The solution is to have the tie shortened by half an inch , which many alterations tailors will do if asked .
It is a somewhat delicate operation but , if done with care , it can double a tie 's life .
No tie
Much has been said about the demise of the tie , and throughout the last hundred years its death has been repeatedly prophesied .
It should be borne in mind , however , that knotted neckcloths have been standard attire for 350 years , and if the tie does vanish something knotted around the neck will almost certainly replace it .
If you do decide to wear a suit without a tie , however , here are a few pointers .
Always wear a dress shirt ( a shirt with buttons all the way down the front ) ; a suit with a t - shirt always looks faintly ridiculous .
Keep the top one or two buttons of your shirt unbuttoned .
If you take off your tie and jacket , think about rolling up your sleeves as well .

Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to constitute a key mechanism for modifying functional properties of neuronal networks .
This belief implicitly implies , however , that synapses , when not driven to change their characteristics by physiologically relevant stimuli , will maintain these characteristics over time .
How tenacious are synapses over behaviorally relevant time scales ?
To begin to address this question , we developed a system for continuously imaging the structural dynamics of individual synapses over many days , while recording network activity in the same preparations .
We found that in spontaneously active networks , distributions of synaptic sizes were generally stable over days .
Following individual synapses revealed , however , that the apparently static distributions were actually steady states of synapses exhibiting continual and extensive remodeling .
In active networks , large synapses tended to grow smaller , whereas small synapses tended to grow larger , mainly during periods of particularly synchronous activity .
Suppression of network activity only mildly affected the magnitude of synaptic remodeling , but dependence on synaptic size was lost , leading to the broadening of synaptic size distributions and increases in mean synaptic size .
From the perspective of individual neurons , activity drove changes in the relative sizes of their excitatory inputs , but such changes continued , albeit at lower rates , even when network activity was blocked .
Our findings show that activity strongly drives synaptic remodeling , but they also show that significant remodeling occurs spontaneously .
Whereas such spontaneous remodeling provides an explanation for “ synaptic homeostasis ” like processes , it also raises significant questions concerning the reliability of individual synapses as sites for persistently modifying network function .
Neurons communicate via synapses , and it is believed that activity - dependent modifications to synaptic connections — synaptic plasticity — is a fundamental mechanism for stably altering the function of neuronal networks .
This belief implies that synapses , when not driven to change their properties by physiologically relevant stimuli , should preserve their individual properties over time .
Otherwise , physiologically relevant modifications to network function would be gradually lost or become inseparable from stochastically occurring changes in the network .
So do synapses actually preserve their properties over behaviorally relevant time scales ?
To begin to address this question , we examined the structural dynamics of individual postsynaptic densities for several days , while recording and manipulating network activity levels in the same networks .
We found that as expected in highly active networks , individual synapses undergo continual and extensive remodeling over time scales of many hours to days .
However , we also observed , that synaptic remodeling continues at very significant rates even when network activity is completely blocked .
Our findings thus indicate that the capacity of synapses to preserve their specific properties might be more limited than previously thought , raising intriguing questions about the long - term reliability of individual synapses .
To evaluate the tenacity of individual synaptic structures over behaviorally relevant time scales and differentiate between activity - dependent and activity independent - synaptic remodeling , an experimental system is needed in which both structural dynamics of individual synapses and electrical activity can be monitored continuously and simultaneously at sufficiently high temporal resolutions for very long periods .
At present , this is an extremely challenging requirement , in particular where in vivo studies are concerned .
We therefore developed a novel system , based on networks of rat cortical neurons in primary culture , that allowed us to continuously follow and record the structural dynamics of individual PSDs over time scales of minutes to weeks while concomitantly recording ( and manipulating ) network activity in the same preparations .
We find that the vast majority of PSDs in this preparation undergo significant , continuous remodeling over time scales of many hours and days .
The direction and extent of PSD remodeling are strongly affected by network activity levels , but remodeling does not cease upon suppression or elimination of activity .
Our findings , described below , thus indicate that the tenacity exhibited by individual synapses over time scales of days is rather limited and may indicate that structural ( and by extension , functional ) properties of individual synapses experience significant drift over long durations .
In most of the aforementioned studies , synapses were visualized by means of volume - filling fluorescent dyes ( mainly enhanced green fluorescent protein [ EGFP ] or its spectral variants ) and identified on the basis of typical pre- and postsynaptic morphological features ( i.e. , axonal varicosities and dendritic spines , respectively ) , whereas functionally relevant reporters , such as synaptic vesicle , postsynaptic receptor , active zone , or postsynaptic density ( PSD ) molecules were rarely used .
Furthermore , even though manipulations aimed at altering network activity were performed in some of these studies , actual network activity was not recorded .
Thus , the actual relationships between synaptic tenacity , synaptic remodeling , and network activity over these long time scales remained unknown .
Despite the molecular dynamics of synaptic constituents , most central nervous system ( CNS ) synapses appear to be quite persistent , although some degree of synapse formation and elimination is observed , depending on brain region , type of synapse , animal age , and imaging techniques [ 13 ] – [ 20 ] ( reviewed in [ 8 ] , [ 21 ] ) .
Interestingly , however , even persistent synapses , when examined over long time scales ( days ) , seem to exhibit considerable morphological changes ( for example , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ; see also [ 18 ] ) .
In most of these studies , it was surmised that the observed changes in synaptic morphology represented structural manifestations of synaptic plasticity processes .
The advent of molecular imaging techniques and the ability to study the molecular dynamics of specific molecules are gradually leading to the realization that synapses are not static , rigid structures ; rather , they are made of multimolecular protein ensembles that exhibit significant dynamics at time scales of seconds to hours .
Such dynamics include the recruitment and dispersal of regulatory constituents , lateral diffusion , endocytosis and exocytosis of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors , cytoskeletal dynamics and spine “ morphing ” , loss , incorporation , and turnover of scaffold molecules , and the interchange of synaptic molecules , multimolecular complexes , and synaptic vesicles among neighboring synapses ( reviewed in [ 3 ] – [ 11 ] ) .
When considering the bewildering dynamics exhibited by synaptic molecules , it becomes apparent that the long - term tenacity of synaptic structure and , by extension , synaptic function is not at all an obvious outcome .
Yet to date , very little is known on the long - term tenacity of individual synapses [ 12 ] .
Synapses are widely believed to constitute key loci for modifying the functional properties of neuronal networks , possibly providing the basis for phenomena collectively referred to as learning and memory [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
Indeed , an overwhelming body of literature supports the notion that synapses are “ plastic ” , that is , change their functional characteristics in response to specific activation patterns .
The hypothesis that activity - dependent changes to synaptic characteristics constitutes a key mechanism for modifying neuronal network function also implies , however , that synapses , when not driven to change their characteristics by physiologically relevant stimuli , should retain these characteristics over time .
Otherwise , physiologically relevant modifications to network function would be gradually lost due to stochastic , spurious changes or spontaneous drift .
Thus , it might be expected that the capacity of synapses for directed change — synaptic plasticity — should be accompanied by a tendency to retain their characteristics at all other times , a phenomenon we will refer to here as “ synaptic tenacity ” .
Results
Spontaneous Changes in Network Activity , PSD Number , and PSD Size
We initially set out to the examine the long - term stability of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta under baseline conditions , that is , without experimentally manipulating network activity .
To that end , we used preparations maintained in culture for at least 17 d .
At this stage , networks of rat cortical neurons are considered to be relatively mature , and beyond the phase of extensive dendrite extension and synapse formation .
The preparations were mounted on the CLSM and followed by combined time - lapse imaging and electrophysiological recordings as described above .
At the end of each experiment , spike counts per electrode were extracted from the electrophysiological recordings , and the numbers of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta and their respective fluorescence intensities were extracted from maximal intensity projections of Z - stacks for each time point and each site ( see Materials and Methods ) .
These experiments resulted in two highly consistent observations .
The first concerns network activity .
As noted above , cultured networks of dissociated cortical neurons typically develop complex patterns of spontaneous activity composed of asynchronous action potentials and synchronized bursts ( Figure 2A – 2C ) .
These forms of activity were observed here as well , as soon as recording was initiated .
However , over the first 1 – 2 d , we consistently observed significant elevations of spontaneous activity levels ( Figure 3A ) .
These elevations reflected both increases in the number of “ active ” electrodes as well as increases in the frequencies of action potentials measured from individual electrodes ( Figure S3 ) .
Intermittently , periods of “ superbursts ” ( i.e. , bursts of bursts ; [ 49 ] ) were recorded ( see below ) , giving rise to significant variability in action potential counts from one minute to the next .
This gradual increase in network activity at the beginning of the experiment was observed in practically all experiments regardless of preparation age , indicating that it was due , somehow , to the environmental conditions introduced during the experiments ( see below ) .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000136.g003
The second consistent observation concerns the morphological complexity of postsynaptic structures along dendritic segments .
In practically all experiments , we observed a gradual increase in the total number of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta , mainly ( but not exclusively ) due to increased density of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta along existing dendritic segments , at both spine tips and shafts ( Figures 1C and 3B ) .
Moreover , the population of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta changed from one that was relatively uniform in terms of fluorescence intensity to one that contained both very large , bright puncta as well as many small , dim puncta ( Figures 1C , 3C , and 3D ) .
Interestingly , the broadening of the puncta intensity distribution was usually transient , and was partially reversed when network activity reached relatively high levels after 1 –2 d ( Figure 3A , 3C , and 3D ) .
As the majority of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta were typically juxtaposed against functional presynaptic boutons ( Figure S1 ; see also [ 35 ] ) , the observed increases in PSD - 95 : GFP puncta number reflected , in all likelihood , increased numbers of glutamatergic synapses .
Furthermore , given that PSD size , PSD - 95 : GFP fluorescence , spine head dimensions , AMPA receptor number , and glutamate - induced synaptic currents , are well correlated [ 16 ] , [ 50 ] – [ 54 ] changes in PSD - 95 : GFP content , probably reflected changes in PSD size and possibly in synaptic strength [ 8 ] , [ 53 ] .
The ( post ) synaptic remodeling described above resulted in dendrites assuming morphological characteristics more akin to those of dendrites in vivo .
Yet we could not rule out the possibility that these morphological changes were actually reflecting pathological processes induced by the environmental conditions during experiments or damage inflicted by continuous imaging .
To examine the possibility that the experimental conditions were detrimental to neuronal vitality , we used the same system to follow the development of less mature networks in which vigorous growth and synapse formation are known to occur , because here , pathological phenomena such as growth cessation , axon / dendrite retraction , and synapse elimination , are clearly recognizable .
To that end , preparations were mounted on the CLSM starting from day 9 –10 in vitro , maintained in the environmental conditions described above , and imaged at higher frequencies ( every 10 min instead of 30 ) for about 1 wk .
Dendritic development in these experiments appeared to proceed as expected : new branches were added , synapses were formed at high rates , and network activity levels increased 10 - to 20 - fold ( Figure S4 and Video S1 ) .
In none of these experiments ( n = 7 ) did we observe signs of damage .
In fact , these experiments resulted in exciting and , to the best of our knowledge , unprecedented recordings of dendritic development and synapse formation that will be described elsewhere .
These experiments , therefore , do not support the possibility that the experimental conditions used here adversely affect neuronal viability , and lead us to conclude that the synaptic remodeling described above is not secondary to pathological processes .
Relationships between Network Activity and the Population Distribution of PSD Size
In the aforementioned experiments , we observed significant changes in PSD - 95 : GFP puncta number and fluorescence intensity , which , in all likelihood , reflected changes in glutamatergic synapse number and PSD size .
This remodeling occurred concomitantly with significant changes in network activity , which pointed to the possibility that the two phenomena might be causally related .
It should be noted , however , that unlike network activity , that generally increased over time ( Figure 3A ) , the initial broadening of the PSD - 95 : GFP fluorescence intensity distribution ( and the gradual increase in mean puncta fluorescence ) was usually followed by a second phase during which the intensity distribution partially recovered ( as did mean puncta fluorescence ; Figure 3C and 3D ) and thereafter remained stable for days , indicating that the potential relationships between the two phenomena are not straightforward .
To determine whether the observed changes in PSD - 95 : GFP puncta number and fluorescence intensity were dependent on changes in network activity , we repeated the experiments described above except that here , spontaneous network activity was blocked by adding tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) about an hour after the experiments were started .
As shown in Figure 3E–3H , blocking network activity did not block the initial broadening of the PSD - 95 : GFP fluorescence intensity distribution .
However , the second phase ( the partial recovery of the intensity distribution ) was completely lost .
Instead , the distributions of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta fluorescence intensities continued to broaden , and mean puncta fluorescence continued to increase ( Figure 3G and 3H ) .
In addition , the number of puncta did not increase over time , and in fact , gradual decreases in puncta numbers were observed ( Figure 3 F ) .
These experiments indicate that the initial broadening of PSD - 95 : GFP puncta fluorescence intensity distribution is not driven by activity .
Rather , it seems to be driven by the exposure to environmental conditions during experiments .
Given that ambient temperature and atmospheric conditions were identical to those in the incubators in which preparations were maintained , the most likely “ culprit ” is the slow perfusion .
Indeed , these phenomena are not observed if perfusion is not applied ( unpublished data ) .
On the other hand , in the absence of perfusion , the long - term viability of these preparations was drastically impaired .
Interestingly , media turnover rates ( ∼0.15 % / min ) were one to two orders of magnitudes lower than cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) turnover rates in the intact rat brain ( 1 % to 16 % / min ; [ 55 ] ) , indicating that perfusion rates were not excessively high .
In contrast to the initial broadening of PSD - 95 : GFP fluorescence intensity distributions , the subsequent constriction of fluorescence intensity distributions was clearly dependent on network activity .
This dependence indicates that an increase in activity levels is associated with a reduction in mean PSD size .
This finding is consistent with the concept of “ synaptic scaling ” [ 56 ] –[ 58 ] , that is , the adjustment of synaptic strength to match neuronal activation levels .
Interestingly , following the initial broadening and subsequent constriction , PSD - 95 : GFP puncta fluorescence intensity distributions remained relatively stable as long as activity levels did not change significantly ( as exemplified in Figure 3C ) .
These observations are consistent with the possibility that PSD size is generally stable , with changes in activity followed by uniform and gradual scaling of PSD size ( multiplication by a scalar , for example ) .
However , as shown next , this does not seem to be the case .
Modeling Relationships between Network Activity and Synaptic Remodeling
The long - term recordings of synaptic remodeling described so far indicate that ( 1 ) spontaneous network activity maintains distributions of synaptic sizes within rather constrained boundaries ; ( 2 ) reductions in network activity levels result in a broadening of synaptic size distributions , increases in mean synaptic size , and reductions in synapse numbers ; ( 3 ) most synapses exhibit significant changes in size over time ; ( 4 ) in active networks , changes in synaptic size are partially dependent on momentary synapse size : large synapses tend to become smaller , whereas small synapses tend to become larger ; and ( 5 ) when activity is blocked or significantly suppressed , synapses continue to change their sizes , but the direction and extent of these changes become independent of momentary synapse size .
We hypothesized that the phenomenological relationships between network activity and synaptic remodeling described above could be explained by the following set of rules : ( 1 ) synapses continuously undergo spontaneous , activity - independent changes ( drift ) in their size ; ( 2 ) activity acts to reduce the size of large synapses on the one hand , and increase the size of small synapses on the other ; ( 3 ) new , small synapses are continually formed at a constant rate ; and 4 ) synapses whose size is reduced beneath some threshold are eliminated .
To examine whether this set of rules could , at least in principle , explain the phenomena described above and produce synaptic size distributions similar to those measured experimentally , we created a simple numerical model in which sizes and fates of individual synapses were updated over time according to these four rules ( see legend of Figure 7 and Materials and Methods for further details ) .
Figure 7C–7 F shows simulations seeded with the initial puncta counts and intensities measured in the experiments of Figures 4 and 5 .
As these figures show , the numerical simulations recapitulated the major phenomenological relationships between network activity and synaptic size distributions ( Figure 7C and 7E ) .
Furthermore , they predicted correctly the changes in synaptic counts measured in these experiments ( Figure 7D and 7 F ) .
These findings indicate that relationships between synaptic size distributions and network activity levels can be accounted for , at least in principle , by the four simple rules described above without a need for explicit “ scaling ” or compensatory mechanisms invoked by reductions in network activity levels ( although this does not preclude their existence ) .
Although the simulated data generally approximated the experimental measurements quite well , they failed to account for a small population of particularly large synapses observed in active networks ( visible as blue dots in the upper regions of the histograms of Figure 7C and 7E ) .
We do not think this is related to imperfect simulation parameters but rather to the existence of at least one other “ rule ” that drives the formation of large synapses in highly active networks .
Indeed , we noted that relatively large synapses tended to appear during periods of particularly high levels of synchronous activity , often associated with “ superbursting ” [ 48 ] , observable as periods of significant variability in action potential counts from one minute to the other .
In fact , a comparison of particularly bright ( 1.5 standard deviations above mean puncta fluorescence ) PSD - 95 : GFP puncta appearance rates to burst rates revealed strong temporal relationships between these two phenomena ( Figure S6A ) , relationships observed in practically all experiments in which superbursting occurred .
In one striking example , tracking particularly bright puncta backward in time revealed that 18 out of 18 such bright puncta exhibited dramatic increases in fluorescence with the onset of superbursting or seemed to appear de novo ( Figure S6B , S6C , and S6E ; see also Figure 6 , puncta 1 and 4 ) .
It is likely that these large PSD - 95 : GFP puncta represent synapses that underwent forms of potentiation associated with spine - head enlargement ( e.g. , [ 23 ] , [ 53 ] , [ 59 ] – [ 64 ] ) .
In fact , we suspect that high levels of synchronized activity , rather than high activity levels per se are also the driving force behind the aforementioned tendency of small puncta to grow larger in highly active networks ( see [ 65 ] and discussion below ) .
As we did not have access to the precise firing timings of individual pre- and postsynaptic partners , this possibility remains somewhat speculative .
Interestingly , however , as our system did allow us to follow these synapses for relatively long periods , we were able to compare their tenacity to that of the rest of the synaptic population .
These observations indicated that newly enlarged synapses did not necessarily fair much better than other synapses in terms of their long - term tenacity , even in the presence of TTX ( Figure S7 ; see also [ 23 ] , [ 59 ] ) , although their lifespans were typically longer ( unpublished data ) .
While 65 percent of women have a left breast that is larger than the right , the same percentage of men have a left testis that hangs lower in the scrotum than the right .
The left testicle also tends to be 7 - 10 percent smaller .
Why ?
It ’s a question that won an IgNobel prize for Chris McManus .
Although scrotal asymmetry is faithfully reproduced in Greek sculpture , the British psychologist observed , the Greeks were n’t exactly anatomically correct .
Greek sculptors faithfully made the left ball lower , but they mistakenly made it larger .
Absurdly , they thought the testicles acted like weights to keep open the ducts when semen was released .
The left one was erroneously believed to be heavier .
Hundreds of years have passed and we still do n’t exactly why the testes are n’t side - by - side and symmetrical , but there are a few theories that touch on the mystery :
Temperature regulation .
A French study found that the left and right testicles have different modes of thermal regulation .
The left runs hotter than the right .
They hang at different levels because they have separate arteries and veins that differ from each other in length , angle , and source .
Sperm are temperature - sensitive , so having redundant semi-independent temperature regulation mechanisms may be beneficial .
Researchers also speculate that twin testes , if snugly pressed against each other , would run too hot and thereby impair sperm production .
More exposed surface area = cooler .
Hanging at slightly different heights prevents them from crushing and overheating each other .
Handedness .
Some studies have found that the left testicle hangs lower in right - handed men and the right testicle hangs lower in left - handed men .
Handedness is linked to cerebral asymmetry , and there is some suggestion that testicle size and position are , too .
Intriguingly , scientists are investigating whether cognitive performance can be predicted by the testes .
According to a Canadian study , men with a larger right testicle performed better on spatial tasks than men with a larger left testicle .
( Again , on most men , the left is smaller . )
Poor thing .
The littler , lighter , lower - hanging left testicle has such a bad reputation that , according to the Urban Dictionary , it ’s now slang for slacker .
Despite reports of US weapons used in human rights violations in Gaza , another shipment has arrived and been unloaded in Israel .
In January , Amnesty International along with other groups in Greece were able to divert and delay this shipment of arms , but on January 12 , in the midst of the conflict , the ship disappeared from the radar near Greece .
It reappeared March 23 , traveling from Israel to the Ukraine .
The Pentagon confirmed that on March 22 , the cargo ship unloaded 300 containers of munitions to the Israeli port Ashdod .
There is not too much to add to the statement of Amnesty ’s Brian Wood :
Legally and morally , this U.S. arms shipment should have been halted by the Obama administration given the evidence of war crimes resulting from military equipment and munitions of this kind used by the Israeli forces .
Even still , President Obama has committed to a 10 - year contract with a 25 % increase in military aid totaling around $ 30 billion .
There must be an immediate cease of arms trade to Israel and all Palestinian armed groups or the risk of serious human rights violations continues .
The US government clearly owes us some answers as to why the recent arms shipment was delivered .

As things currently stand , the vast majority of event handling between JavaScript and the DOM is somewhat primative ; only involving the element being affected by the event .
An example of this is a simple rollover effect :
$ ( elem ) . hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
addClass ( ' over ' ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
removeClass ( ' over ' ) ; } ) ;
The only effect induced by the event is on the element itself .
Even with something as simple as the above example there ’s a lot of uneccessary bloat , all of which could be avoided by a simple abstraction ; consider this plugin :
$. fn .
hoverClass = function ( className ) { return this .
hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
addClass ( className ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
removeClass ( className ) ; } ) ; } ; //
Usage : $ ( elem ) .
hoverClass ( ' over ' ) ;
While that hugely simplifies the process it does n’t provide much scope as a plugin ; it can only be used for adding and removing a class when an element is hovered over .
These kind of abstractions , as far as I ’m concerned , are perfectly welcome ; anything that makes the end product more readable is a bonus !
On the topic of readability , a thread came up a while ago on jQuery ’s development group within which the benefits of “ ultra - chaining ” were discussed ; a term first highlighted by John Resig in a blog post back in ’08 .
It ’s definitely worth a read !
The resulting proposals were all of the same basic idea ; provide methods to enable more seamless chaining in jQuery .
Here ’s an example :
// From the Dev thread : j Query ( " div " ) . hide ( " slow " ) . wait ( ) . addClass ( " done " ) . find ( " span " ) . addClass ( " done " ) . end ( ) . show ( " slow " ) . wait ( ) .
removeClass ( " done " )
As John stated in his post , this style , if adopted , would transform jQuery into a domain - specific - language , one with little or no resemblance to JavaScript as it normally exists .
Take what you will from John ’s post and the enthralling discussion that followed .
I for one am not too fussed either way ; the syntax itself is seamless and somewhat more graceful than current techniques but , if adopted , it would fall much more hardly on the developer to ensure proper indentation , without which the readability of the code would suffer massively .
I was only really interested in one aspect of this new chaining technique ; event handling .
Throughout the Dev thread there were a number of similar suggestions for easier event handling in jQuery ; here ’s one example ( proposed by Ariel Flesler ) :
$ ( ' div ' ) . when ( ' click ' ) . addClass ( ' active ' ) . text ( ' Hey ' ) . done ( ) //
Also possible with on ( ) . on ( ' mouseout ' ) .
removeClass ( ' active ' ) . text ( ' Ho ' ) . done ( ) ;
As Ariel stated , this would not be a replacement for the conventional callback technique ; it ’s just a convenient shortcut for the primitive event handling I mentioned before ( an event triggers on an element ; something happens to that element ) .
While unsuitable for many scenarios , the “ ultra - chaining ” technique does offer a refreshing simplicity .
My only issue is with the fact that code could quite quickly become a nightmare to maintain .
I ’d be uncomfortable using it because of its dependence on indentation .
I much prefer having the code I write represent the logical outline of the actions performed through the code ; if a piece of code is not executed until later ( e.g. a callback ) then it should be logically contained in such a way that it infurs when and if it will execute ; unfortunately “ ultra - chaining ” does not provide this explicit way of containing functionality ( in fact , it does the opposite ) .
After reading through the discussion surrounding ultra-chaining and other similar endeavors I thought I may as well have a crack at it .
Like I said , the only part that really interested me at this point was the event handling .
So , in my efforts to create a simple and readable alternative to callback functions I eventually came to the conclusion that method chaining ( or “ ultra chaining ” ) was not the way to go ; like I said before , it ’s not well contained and the readability of it relies too heavily on indentation .
Function ’less callbacks
// Regular callback functions : $ ( elem ) . hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
addClass ( ' over ' ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
removeClass ( ' over ' ) ; } ) ; //
Callback objects : $ ( elem ) . hover ( { addClass : ' over ' } , { removeClass : ' over ' } ) ;
I ’m not just musing here ; you can check out the source which makes the above notation ( “ callback objects ” ) possible .
Instead of passing a function you can pass a regular object with key - value pairs .
Each property name of this object is executed as a jQuery method with arguments specified in the corresponding property value .
So , in the above example , jQuery ’s addClass method would be executed with ‘ over ’ as its only argument .
I know what some of you are thinking ; abstracting away the functional side of event handling is dangerous and relinquishes necessary control .
While I agree with you ( mostly ) it ’s important that you note the following :
No control is relinquished ; you can still pass regular functions as handlers and they will be executed just as before .
If a function and a data object is passed then the data object will be treated as before .
Much of event handling involves simply changing something on the corresponding element ( E.g . Hover over a table row and it changes colour ) .
This extension acknowledges this common requirement .
Other examples :
Here are some examples of the ways in which you can use the extension :
// E.g. # 1 $ ( ' a ' ) . bind ( ' click.namespace ' , { addClass : ' clicked ' , animate : [ { fontSize : '+ =2 px ' } , 300 ] } ) ; // E.g. # 2 $ ( ' div ' ) . click ( { css : { color : ' black ' , background : ' orange ' } , attr : { id : ' something ' } } ) ; // E.g. # 3 var over = { css : [ ' color ' , ' red ' ] , unbind : [ ' mouseover ' , over ] } ; $ ( ' h 1 ' ) . mouseover ( over ) ;
Note : jQuery ’s bind method accepts three parameters by default : an event type , a data object and a callback function .
This extension will only activate when you pass an object without a function as the third parameter ( as shown in # 1 above ) .
If you pass all three parameters then the second ( object ) will be treated as a regular data object .
I hope this has provided you with some perspective on ultra-chaining and its alternatives .
Please feel free to make use of the extension ( download ) , I ’ve been using it without a problem so far …
Thanks for reading !

Have a great day !
A Morrison Christian - school principal who students claimed regularly engaged in vulgar sex talk with his male pupils is now accused of sexually assaulting one of them and attempting to sexually assault a second student .
Charged with sexual assault on a child and unlawful sexual contact in connection with one alleged victim is Daniel Charles Brock , 36 , who has been on administrative leave from Silver State Christian School , 14711 W. Morrison Road .
Brock also was charged Tuesday with attempted sexual assault on a child involving a second pupil .
Calls to the school inquiring about Brock ’s current status at the institution were not returned .
Pam Russell , spokesperson for the Jefferson County district attorney ’s office , said investigators “ believe Brock was terminated at the end of May . ”
In an arrest - warrant affidavit unsealed Tuesday in Jefferson County District Court , male pupils told investigators how Brock repeatedly asked them intimate questions about their sexual activity with their girlfriends .
He would ask in graphic terms if they had engaged in specific sex acts with their female friends .
He allegedly asked them if they viewed pornography as well .
Brock also described to the students sex acts he had performed with his wife , according to the affidavit .
When one student complained about Brock ’s behavior , the school “ suspended the student for unrelated reasons , ” according to the affidavit written by David Lynn , an investigator for the Jefferson County DA ’s office .
The students also claimed that Brock fondled male students in both school hallways and in Brock ’s office .
One student claimed that on a trip to California , when 11 students traveled to what was described as “ Brock ’s family Christian camp , ” Brock engaged in aggressive fondling .
When they stopped in Las Vegas on the way to California , one student said that he was forced to sit in the front of the van with Brock .
That night , he said , Brock demanded he sleep in a bed with him .
There , he allegedly rubbed the student ’s lower back and talked about sex and his wife .
Investigators were told that once in California , all the boys shared a cabin with Brock .
One student said that after he was in his bunk , Brock came over and rubbed his legs .
He described how on other occasions , as they sat around a campfire and took walks together , Brock would fondle his genitals .
One of the alleged victims said the fondling started when he was in the 10th grade and continued through his senior year .
During the years of abuse , the student told investigators that “ all he wanted to do was graduate . ”

CHAMPAIGN , Ill . —
Researchers have constructed a light - emitting transistor that has set a new record with a signal - processing modulation speed of 4.3 gigahertz , breaking the previous record of 1.7 gigahertz held by a light - emitting diode .
But , the researchers did n't stop there .
By internally connecting the base and collector of a light - emitting transistor , they created a new form of light - emitting diode , which modulates at up to 7 gigahertz , breaking the speed record once again .
In a pair of papers published in the June 15 issue of Applied Physics Letters , researchers at the University of Illinois and at U. of I. licensee Quantum Electro Opto Systems in Melaka , Malaysia , report the fabrication and testing of the new high - speed light - emitting transistor and the new " tilted - charge " light - emitting diode .
" Simple in design and construction , the tilted - charge light - emitting diode offers an attractive alternative for use in high - speed signal processing , optical communication systems and integrated optoelectronics , " said Nick Holonyak Jr. , a John Bardeen Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics at Illinois , and a co-author of both papers .
The modulation speed of either a light - emitting diode or a light - emitting transistor is limited by the rate at which electrons and holes ( the minus and plus charges – the carriers of current ) recombine .
The recombination lifetime is important in determining device speed .
With a usual " slow " recombination process , the speed of a light - emitting diode is limited to approximately 1.7 gigahertz , which corresponds to a carrier lifetime of 100 picoseconds .
For more than 40 years , scientists thought breaking the 100 - picosecond barrier was impossible .
Recombination speeds of less than 100 picoseconds are not readily achieved in light - emitting diodes because equal number densities of electrons and holes are injected into the active region to preserve charge neutrality , said Holonyak , who invented the first practical visible light - emitting diode more than 40 years ago .
These charges become stuck , stacked - up waiting to recombine , Holonyak said .
To achieve high recombination speeds , an extremely high injection level and a very high charge population are required in light - emitting diodes .
These conditions are not necessary in transistors , however .
" Unlike a diode , a transistor does not store charge , " said Milton Feng , the Holonyak Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering , and a co-author of the two papers .
" Charges are delivered to the transistor 's quantum well active region , where they either recombine almost instantly , or they are kept moving on out of the device .
The charges do not become stacked - up , waiting to recombine with their oppositely charged twins . "
To increase the modulation speed of their light - emitting transistor , the researchers reduced the emitter size , increased the so - called collector thickness ( the third terminal region ) , and utilized a special internal common collector design .
These changes resulted in a faster signal at a very low current level , and at low heat dissipation .
Having a " fast " recombination process , the modulation speed of the light - emitting transistor was measured at 4.3 gigahertz , which corresponds to a recombination lifetime of 37 picoseconds , well under the " 100 - picosecond barrier . "
" In the light - emitting transistor , the third terminal – the collector – effectively ' tilts ' the charge and removes carriers with slower recombination lifetimes , " said Holonyak , who also is a professor in the university 's Center for Advanced Study , one of the highest forms of campus recognition .
" As opposed to the charge ' pile - up ' condition found in a normal diode , the dynamic ' tilted ' charge flow condition in the transistor base is maintained with the collector in competition with the base recombination process , " Holonyak said .
" If the charge does n't recombine and generate a photon fast enough , it is swept away by the current in the collector . "
By preventing the build - up of " slow " charges in the base , the " fast " picosecond recombination dynamics also provided the basis for the researchers ' light - emitting transistor rewired internally as a new type of light - emitting diode .
The tilted - charge light - emitting diode achieved a record - breaking modulation speed of 7 gigahertz , corresponding to a recombination lifetime of 23 picoseconds .
" The tilted - charge light - emitting diode is simple to make , low cost , and easy to package and use , " Holonyak said .
Because of the tilted base population in the device , current flow , which is a function of the slope of the charge distribution , makes possible high current densities without requiring extreme carrier densities .
" That 's the trick of the transistor , " Holonyak said .
" And now we 've incorporated it into a diode .
The physics has been there all along .
It just was n't recognized . "

I ’m at a cafe near us , I love the view here .
Sometimes its good to have no plans at all , just relax and watch people scurry to and fro .
We stopped at a bakery to have some lunch , its hot outside – probable around 27 degrees celcius today as well !
My view right now , how is yours ?
The long - running MMORPGwill be shuttering on May 1 , franchise owner Ubisoft has announced . , created by defunct Wolfpack Studios , has been live for over six years .
The official Shadowbane website read , " We come to you now with regret and sadness , but also happiness and pride .
Regret and sadness that it has finally come to this , and as of May 1 , 2009 the Shadowbane servers will be powered down once and for all .
" Ubisoft gave no specific explanation for the shutdown , although we 've contacted the publisher for comment .
The future ofhad been hanging in the balance for some time .
Ubisoft acquired creator Wolfpack in 2004 in an attempt to gain footing in the MMO market .
The publisher then announced it would be shuttering the studio in 2006 , after announcing thatwould become free - to - play .
Former Wolfpack members went on to form independent online developer Stray Bullet Games , which had been supporting the MMORPG for Ubisoft while working on an unannounced title .
On Ubisoft 'sforums , some fans hoped the announcement was a belated April Fool 's Day joke .
Others expressed sadness about the closure .
" It will be sad to seego , but it was the pioneer for all [ PvP ] MMOs , and no other game has been able to duplicate it , " reckoned one poster .
Ubisoft's " Farewell " added , " Many passionate and creative individuals have poured their hearts and souls into developing and hosting .
We want to thank each and every one of you for your tremendous work and valiant efforts throughout 's lifetime . "
ICC World Twenty20 final , Lord's :
Pakistan 139 - 2 ( 18.4 overs ) beat Sri Lanka 138 - 6 by eight wickets
Match scorecard By Oliver Brett
Pakistan won the ICC World Twenty20 in an exciting finish at a noisy Lord 's when Sri Lanka 's total of 138 - 6 was overhauled with eight balls remaining .
Shahid Afridi , man of the match in the semi-final , was again the hero , hitting 54 not out from 40 balls to steer Pakistan to an eight - wicket win .
Having chosen to bat , Sri Lanka lost star batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan in the first over and were soon 2 - 2 .
Kumar Sangakkara 's 64 gave them hope but Pakistan paced their chase well .
Sri Lanka had progressed through the tournament smoothly , winning all their matches and relying on the brilliant batting of Dilshan and some superb bowling led by Ajantha Mendis .
TOM FORDYCE BLOG Pakistan 's turnaround from World Twenty20 whipping - boys to champions was as utterly unexpected as it was stirring to the soul
But on the grand stage , both their leading players fluffed their lines , and Pakistan ruthlessly seized the initiative .
Pakistan had lost two of their first three matches and needed a win against the Netherlands just to make the last eight .
But they turned a corner when thrashing New Zealand - from which point they never looked back .
They began the final in ideal fashion , with a wicket - maiden from 17 - year - old sensation Mohammad Aamer .
It was n't just any wicket - maiden - a rare event indeed in this format .
The fact that the tournament 's leading run-scorer Dilshan had been dismissed made Aamer 's over extra special .
Dlishan craves deliveries on a good length so he can sweep and drive , but keeping the ball short and straight , Aamer bowled four dot - balls then enticed a top - edged pull to short fine - leg .
Pakistan began superbly with the ball at Lord's , and kept it going
The wicket seemed to scare Sri Lanka 's other batsmen , who had not enjoyed particularly good tournaments , and it was the fast - medium bowler Abdul Razzaq who reaped the rewards .
Jehan Mubarak , promoted up the order , skied a catch into the off - side , Sanath Jayasuriya crashed a six and two fours but then dragged one on , before Mahela Jayawardene edged an attempted late - cut to slip .
Sangakkara and Chamara Silva had a major repair operation on their hands , coming together with the score 32 - 4 in 5.3 overs .
They put on 35 from 36 balls which at least stopped the rot , but the arrival of Umar Gul dented Sri Lanka 's renaissance .
Silva mistimed a pull to midwicket and Isuru Udana swished and missed the last two balls of a fine over .
It got even better for Pakistan when Afridi bowled Udana to leave the score 70 - 6 from 13 overs .
Finally , some positive running between the wickets from Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews saw nine runs come off a Saeed Ajmal over and then Gul , so brilliant in Pakistan 's last three victories , suddenly lost his length and was hammered for 14 in an over .
Mathews played his part too , clubbing a couple of boundaries on the on- side before tucking into the final over , bowled by Aamer .
It was a great day for Pakistan fans
The decision to give the teenager the final over looked a questionable one , and with Mathews flaying a boundary through the slips and muscling a six through the on - side 17 more precious runs came Sri Lanka 's way .
Pakistan 's chase was given impetus by Kamran Akmal , who hit big leg - side sixes off both Mendis and Mathews to take his team to a very respectable 48 - 0 from seven overs .
Jayasuriya , Sri Lanka 's sixth bowler , then immediately had Akmal stumped , but the other opener Shahzaib Hasan , who had been so quiet , drilled consecutive boundaries off Mendis , the mystery spinner who Pakistan were playing so well .
When he fell to Muttiah Muralitharan , the required rate hit eight an over , but Pakistan still had eight wickets in hand and just 64 more runs were required .
Afridi , who had had time to play himself in , now hit Muralitharan into the Tavern Stand and then launched him over wide mid-off for four .
That made Pakistan hot favourites , but just 16 runs came off the next three overs , so 26 were still wanted from 18 balls .
But Afridi , with Shoaib Malik playing a quiet role in support , now smashed Udana for six over midwicket and pulled him past fine - leg for four more , leaving an easy seven runs needed from the last two overs .

It should be decriminalized .
But , we will see how far this goes .
A controversial law in Massachusetts could go national if Congressman Barney Frank gets his way .
Frank has filed a bill that would eliminate federal penalties for personal possession of less than 100 grams of marijuana .
It would also make the penalty for using marijuana in public just $ 100 .
" I think John Stuart Mill had it right in the 1850s , " said Congressman Frank , " when he argued that individuals should have the right to do what they want in private , so long as they do n't hurt anyone else .
It 's a matter of personal liberty .
Moreover , our courts are already stressed and our prisons are over - crowded .
We do n't need to spend our scarce resources prosecuting people who are doing no harm to others . "

A quick resume : I worked for the one of the world ’s biggest international health care companies , providing international cover for people who travel or live overseas .
I was high enough up to be familiar with the business model .
I only know a little about US insurance , but I can talk comfortably about insurance in general .
BLAMING INSURANCE COMPANIES MISSES THE POINT
To me , Americans often seem to be obsessed with insurance companies , and hold them accountable for all your healthcare woes .
I understand that insurers are blocking reform , and that some of them are unethical in some of their behaviors , they are just doing what they are supposed to do .
Some seem to believe that insurance companies ’ first responsibility is to provide cover , to enable care .
This is bullshit .
Their first responsibility is to manage risk in order to make a profit .
I ’ve read some on Daily Kos talking about insurers " moving away from the concept of insurance " by doing things like charging higher premiums for the elderly , or denying cover for serious , chronic conditions .
To me , these behaviors are slap bang in the middle of the concept of insurance , and are perfectly acceptable for an insurance company .
The " concept of insurance " is that you pay higher premiums for higher risk .
If the risk is too high , insurers will refuse to cover because they are guaranteed a loss .
We accept this on our home insurance or car insurance , why do we struggle to get it when it comes to health insurance ?
You would n’t expect a motor insurance company to cover a blind driver , you would n’t expect to get home contents insurance on a house with no roof ; why would you expect a health insurance company to cover someone on long - term dialysis ?
Insurance by its very nature rewards those who do n’t claim and penalizes those who do , with higher premiums or reduced cover .
To expect any other outcome is madness .
In these denial - of - cover cases , the crime therefore is not the insurance , it ’s the lack of any alternative route to getting healthcare .
The crime is the stupidity of designing a healthcare system based on private insurance alone , and expecting it to meet the needs of sick people .
It wo n’t .
At best , it might meet the needs of healthy people .
You ’d better pray you stay healthy .
REDUCING COSTS IS GOOD FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES
In our office in London I sat next to the actuarial team , the number crunchers , who spent a lot of time shaking their heads in disbelief over the cost of American health care .
When we wanted to provide a plan that gave an option of getting treated in the US , they ’d do the sums and come up with a premium sometimes three times the price of worldwide cover without the US .
Unsurprisingly , we did n’t sell very many .
But it was n’t just the US .
Healthcare costs are going up around the world at over three times the rate of inflation .
A long time ago we stopped putting our rates up every year and started putting them up every six months .
Our sales teams were tearing their hair out over trying to keep customers , let alone attract new ones .
It was always a battle between the sales teams who wanted lower premiums to offer , and the actuaries who worked out the risk , or " loss ratio " and who had to make sure each plan was profitable .
Balancing the two forces was a difficult game , and there was always tension around the time the loss figures came out .
So do n’t believe a word of it if someone tells you that high and rising healthcare costs are good for insurance companies .
In a healthy market , high healthcare costs kill insurance companies .
If costs were to stabilize or go down , insurers should see their loss ratios go down , be able to start reducing premiums and increasing cover , sell more policies and make more profit .
A single payer system or public plan would dramatically reduce healthcare costs through better bargaining power .
Healthcare costs are running away from us .
It ’s a no -brainer .
INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN CO-EXIST WITH PUBLIC HEALTH CARE
If American health insurers are pissing their pants at the thought of competing with a single payer system , they should man up and join the big boys .
In the UK , private health insurers have co-existed comfortably with the NHS for the last 60 years or more , and they do n’t find themselves short of a nickel .
The NHS in Britain is not perfect , but it is so beloved by us Brits that it was the policy of my company , seared into the minds of all new recruits on day one , never to criticize the NHS or to try to directly sell against its perceived flaws .
Instead , we simply offered policies that gave people services and coverage that the NHS could n’t give them .
All of our six million UK customers already qualified for NHS treatment , but they liked the extra benefits , such as shorter waiting times , that we could offer them .
We also found many ways of working in partnership with the NHS , to the point that it even became one of our customers , with NHS patients receiving treatment in our private hospitals .
--
Sometimes it ’s odd being a part of this community and not being able to fully engage in the struggle you face to impose some form of sanity on American politics .
This is one of those moments .
A single - payer system is so clearly , shit - in - your - face obviously the best and only option that it makes me want to come over there and slap some sense into people .
But that would be inappropriate , so I ’ll have to make do with this diary .
Good luck with the healthcare fight America , you have the rest of the world cheering you on .
In between the moments when we pop out to see the doctor for free .
Great piece in MMA Weekly about Bellator 's use of YouTube to promote their wares :
In the two years before Bellator launched , Rebney studied demographic information on the MMA market and arrived at a conclusion known to all serious fans : this sport thrives on the Internet .
" They 're not doing an enormous amount of reading and they 're not doing an enormous amount of television watching , but man , are they online , " said Rebney about the MMA faithful .
" So we knew that was a really key part of our marketing strategy .
" From the moment we had our first events , and the moment we had our first big highlights , we sat in the truck all night , editing those , putting our brand on them , and getting them out there .
And not getting them out there for pay ; just feeding the content out there week in and week out , so people could go , ‘ whoa , that 's really cool , I 've never seen Bellator before , I should tune in and watch that show or buy a ticket to that event . '
It was a strategy that we had long before the season occurred .
...
" The bottom line is , if I had had an additional 10 million dollars to spend , I could n't have gotten nearly the traction that I got by sending those clips out and putting them on YouTube , " said Rebney .
Bellator is the first promotion to really take control of the viral power of social media online and put it to work for the promotion in a controlled fashion .
The UFC has embraced Vlogs and Twitter as a way to put out one - way messages to their fans , but they 've been notoriously uptight about controlling their online fight videos .
Obviously they 're the industry leader and what they 're doing is working great , but Bellator has shown that an up and coming promotion has to be more innovative , more open and more aggressive .
The whole article is well worth a read as Rebney explains the thinking behind their tournament format as a way to encourage fighters to go all out .
He believes that the series of highlight reel fights that came out of the Bellator events was n't an accident .
Instead of just happening , moves like Toby Imada 's amazing inverted triangle on Jorge Masvidal were the likely outcome of their high - pressure , high - reward tournament format .
The payoff was so big for winning the Bellator tournament that it encouraged risk - taking on the part of its fighters .
That 's a well known formula in MMA -- one the UFC was founded on .
Gazprom could increase its power over European supplies
Russia 's energy giant Gazprom has signed a $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.53 bn ) deal with Nigeria 's state operated NNPC , to invest in a new joint venture .
The new firm , to be called Nigaz , is set to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations in Nigeria .
Analysts say the move could further strengthen Russia 's role in supplying natural gas to Europe .
The agreement comes during a four - day African tour by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
As well as forming Nigaz , Russia is keen on developing a trans -African pipeline to transport Nigerian gas to Europe .
This could further reinforce Gazprom 's already - strong influence over Europe 's energy supplies .
' Commodity - rich '
" Russia has a number of goals [ in Africa ] , one of which would be to take part in a growing competition for resources and markets on the continent - mainly with China , " said Yaroslav Lissovolik , head economist with Deutsche Bank in Moscow .
Sergei Novikov , a spokesman for Rosatom , Russia 's state - run civil nuclear energy agency , said the Nigaz deal would lay the foundations for building nuclear power reactors in Nigeria .
Nigeria has previously said it would like to develop a nuclear power plant to address its energy shortages .
Before visiting Nigeria , Mr Medvedev spent time in Egypt .
He is also visiting Namibia and Angola - which are rich in natural resources - during his trip , as he seeks to promote Russian business interests .
" Part of the agenda is to push Russia 's credentials as a representative of commodity - rich developing countries with such forums as the G8 and the G20 , " said Ural Sib bank 's chief strategist Chris Weafer in a note to investors .
Chinese deal
Russia is not alone in seeking to secure energy deals overseas with commodity - rich nations .
Separately on Thursday , Chinese oil refiner Sinopec has made a $ 7.2 bn bid to acquire oil exploration and producing firm Addax , which focuses on Africa and the Middle East .
If the deal is approved by regulators it would be the biggest foreign takeover by a Chinese firm .
It ’s always been a mystery to me why Congress gets its own government - run , special rights , health care plan .
If there is any indication that Congress is n’t going to come through with a comprehensive health care plan that benefits ALL of us , we should begin a push to repeal their government health coverage .
Let the members of Congress and their staff do what Joe and I do .
Call up Blue Cross and get your own damn health insurance .
And when Blue Cross tells you that they wo n’t cover your prescriptions beyond $ 1500 a year , because they ’re cheap skates , that they ’re going to hike your premiums 600 % because you moved to another state , then we ’ll see how opposed you are to a comprehensive solution .
Actually , there ’s no reason to wait .
We know there ’s at least a 50 - 50 chance that the Dems , and many of our health care advocates , will cave and accept , at best , half a loaf .
We should start the push to repeal their health coverage now .
It would cause quite a stir in the news , and I ’d love to see members of Congress on both sides of the aisle explain why they deserve a government handout that they refuse to give the rest of the country .
And just think of the money the government would save !
Hmm ...
We got the 9 - 12 dry hump , promoting his Dick and Jane Glenn Beckifesto .
Check .
Got the Glenn Beck desk before the Nazi march job .
Cute .
What tragic historic events will Glenn Beck dry hump next ?
Perhaps he 'll photoshop himself riding shotgun with Jack Kennedy through Dealey Plaza .
Ooh !
Maybe he 'll have the boys ( who'll " do your homework for you " ) work up a My Lai massacre barbecue , starring Glenn Beck in a " Kiss the Cook " apron .
That would be adorable .
Remember the 9/11 tourist on the WTC hoax ?
Yeah .
That 's right up his alley .
I know !
maybe he should work himself into Hiroshima , stratched out on a deck chair with one of those suntan reflectors and the whatchamacallit on his nose !
Yeah !
Such " entertainment " makes Glenn Beck look like so much more than a malicious pundit , it makes him look like an actual historic figure !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China and Russia once again lead the list of countries with the worst record on preventing piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. goods , the U.S. Trade Representatives office said on Thursday .
In addition , USTR said it was putting Canada on the “ priority watch list ” for first time because of increasing concern about the need to Canada to reform its copyright laws and to strengthen border enforcement .
“ In this time of economic uncertainty , we need to redouble our efforts to work with all of our trading partners -- even our closest allies and neighbors such as Canada -- to enhance protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights , ” U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement .
USTR put China was on the priority watch list for the fifth consecutive year and Russia for at least the seventh consecutive year .
The designation highlights the country for increased U.S. pressure to stop intellectual property rights theft .
“ I ’m particularly troubled by reports that Chinese officials are urging more lenient enforcement of IPR laws , motivated by the financial crisis and the need to maintain jobs , ” Kirk said .
“ China needs to strengthen its approach to IPR protection and enforcement , not weaken it , ” Kirk said .
USTR said it was elevating Algeria and Indonesia to the priority watch list because of growing concerning about piracy and counterfeiting in those countries .
It said it was removing South Korea from a lower level “ watch list ” because of progress that government has made .
The RNC late last month filed an amended report detailing exactly which disbursements were clothing purchases for Sarah Palin and her family .
RNC closes loop on Palin clothes
Closing a loop on the campaign finance side of the Sarah Palin clothes saga , the Republican National Committee late last month filed an amended report detailing exactly which disbursements were clothing purchases for the Republican vice presidential candidate and her family .
The amended report shows that the committee paid about $ 23,000 for clothing in the three weeks before and after Election Day — which is actually $ 7,000 less than previously reported .

That new report brings the total Palin clothing costs paid by the RNC down to about $ 173,000 and also makes it easier to spot clothing purchases that had previously gone undetected .
For instance , a $ 192 payment to the Philadelphia Flyers pro shop previously described as “ campaign accessories ” was recategorized as “ candidate clothing , ” possibly for either the Flyers hockey jersey Palin reportedly received with her name and the No. 1 on the back before dropping a ceremonial puck or the one that her younger daughter , Piper , wore at the game .
Similarly , a $ 289 payment to high - end shoemaker Stuart Weitzman , which had been described as “ retail ” and “ accessories , ” became “ candidate clothing . ”
The report also details a number of clothing payments to retailers not known for their sartorial selection , including $ 49 to a UPS Store near running mate John McCain ’s Arizona ranch ; $ 144 to CVS stores in Ohio , Florida and Wisconsin ; and $ 426 to various Walgreens stores .
The RNC did not respond to requests for comment about the amended report or the fate of the clothes , which were to have been donated to charity .
The amended report came at the behest of the Federal Election Commission , which last month ordered the committee to “ include a brief statement or description of why the [ accessory ] expenditures were made ” on behalf of the McCain - Palin campaign .
By most available accounts , John Floyd Thomas Jr. spent the last two decades living a relatively quiet life .
In 1989 , he got a job processing workers ’ compensation claims for the state .
One co-worker described him as friendly and religious , known for sending out e-mails quoting Scriptures .
Other sources said he quit smoking soon after landing the job , talked about setting long - term goals and adhering to his Christian faith .
At age 72 , he was still working at the Glendale office of the State Compensation Insurance Fund and living with a son in South Los Angeles when police contacted him last year .
As part of an ongoing Los Angeles Police Department program to collect DNA evidence from convicted sex offenders , officers asked Thomas for a DNA swab .

From that random request , police allege they soon linked Thomas to two murders of older women in the 1970s .
He is being held on those charges .
Now , authorities say they have DNA evidence linking him to six slayings and believe he could be responsible for up to 30 .
“ He always had a smile on his face .
He was placid , congenial and affable , a pleasant fellow who , if the allegations are true , may in fact be a monster , ” said Earl Ofari Hutchinson , an L.A. community activist who once worked with Thomas .
“ It almost takes your breath away . ”
As more details come to light about Thomas , a portrait of two different men is emerging : one of a hard - core criminal in his early life ; another of a more low - key life after 50 .
An L.A. native , Thomas received a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force , according to military records , and a short time later was arrested for burglary and attempted rape in Los Angeles .
He was convicted and sentenced to six years in state prison in 1957 .
Two parole violations sent him back behind bars until 1966 .

Authorities now allege that Thomas raped and killed older women during two cycles : in the 1970s in Los Angeles and in the 1980s in the Claremont area .
Police continue to receive calls from family members of slain woman who believe he might be responsible .
At the office where he worked , red -eyed co-workers were stunned by the allegations .
Many spent Thursday clustered in small groups , discussing the news and comforting each other , colleagues said .
Ofari-Hutchinson said Thomas kept to himself and was fond of citing Scripture .
They talked about current events and politics -- but rarely about Thomas ’ personal life .
At Ofari-Hutchinson ’s invitation , Thomas attended a couple of community round - tables -- but his interest did n’t last .
“ You could always sense there was a barrier there , that there was only so deep you could go with him , ” he said .

The mainstream media is finally taking a notice of the Alt - A and pay Option ARM issues that await the California housing market late in 2009 and will run deep into 2012 .
A few of you have sent articles that started appearing within the last month .
This is a really important factor in determining a housing bottom .
And more to the point , Fitch Ratings came out last week stating that they project prices will drop 12.5 percent nationally from Q1 of 2009 but more importantly , they stated that California prices still have 36 percent further to go down .
They also stated that prices will not turn around until the second half of 2010 .
This coincides with our prediction made last summer that California will not face a housing bottom until 2011 .
The exact date is irrelevant since prices will remain depressed for years but I am glad seeing the mainstream media coming more in line with more realistic projections instead of conjuring up back of the napkin calculations .
To quell the housing bottom callers , I did a detailed post of the Westside of L.A. showing how more prime areas will start facing declines in late 2009 and all of 2010 .
This still does n’t seem to be enough .
Anecdotal stories of people over bidding and paying top bill for some reason get people worked up .
The reason I ’ve been trying to put out dates on a bottom is so people can take a deep breath and relax .
For some reason some people are just itching to blow through two or three years of savings just to buy right now .
I ’ve gotten a couple of e-mails of people looking to buy in Pasadena and this is the exact place where prices will be coming down late this year and into 2010 .
Why ?
Current prices do not reflect local area incomes .
Pasadena has a population of 146,518 and is located 10 miles north of downtown Los Angeles .
A nice city famous for the Tournament of Roses and the Rose Bowl football game , which is a familiar scene for many local college football fans .
Pasadena has 51,000 households and is what many would consider a “ prime ” middle - class location .
Of course , in the last few years prime and L.A. meant you would be shelling out $ 750,000 for a Real Home of Genius .
Here is where things get interesting .
The median household income as of 2007 is $ 66,465 and the average household income is $ 92,125 .
Not bad for aggregate figures .
In Pasadena only 48 percent of households actually own .
This is typical of L.A. County which is a renting majority county .
The bubble started in 2000 so how many people bought or moved into their new location between 2000 and 2007 ?
A stunning 58 percent .
So keep all this data in mind as we move along .
The distress sales are now making their way into the market .
How so ?
I ’ve put together all homes in the pre-foreclosure stage and the amount is astounding :
Source : Foreclosure Radar
When I ran this report , there are 348 homes in Pasadena that are in pre-foreclosure .
What does this mean ?
It means these places have those infamous notice of defaults ( NOD ) I keep talking about which will hit the market like a tsunami later this year .
This is important because most of these are flying under the radar .
Many do n’t show up on the MLS .
Many are n’t even being sold .
As we now all know , lenders are so behind that your typical 3 - month NOD filing may take 6 to 9 months meaning many people are living payment free .
Consider it a personal mini-bailout .
The data from the chart above is troubling because this is a giant amount for this city .
Currently , there are only 277 single - family homes listed on the MLS for Pasadena .
If we include condos and multi-family units we are up to 570 .
So that 348 number is big .
If we are to include bank owned homes and notice of trustee sales for Pasadena , we add another 300 + homes .
In total , we have over 600 distressed properties in the city while the current listing only gives us 570 .
Here is how you realize how screwed up the data is .
The current MLS only has 11 homes showing up as foreclosures .
How can that be when we have REOs and scheduled auctions above 300 ?
Alt - A and pay Option ARMs are rampant in these areas .
Take a look at one of those 11 foreclosures :
This home is a 2 bedroom and 1 bath home .
It is 1,038 square feet and was built in 1911 .
Yes , prior to the Great Depression .
We are told that there is easy access to the 210 freeway .
Let us take a look :
Any closer to the freeway and you ’d be in the center divider .
This home is currently listed at $ 369,900 and has been on the market for 46 days .
Let us look at some sales history here :
09/08/2005 : $ 462,000
08/23/2000 : $ 145,000
So we see typical bubble behavior here .
It is hard to say how much this home will sell for but it is already down nearly $ 100,000 from the peak price .
Just think about that .
In many places of this country , $ 100,000 will buy you a home .
But this is a home already in foreclosure .
What is going on with those homes in pre-foreclosure ?
Ah yes .
This is where the action is taking place .
Let us take a look at a $ 1 million condo in Pasadena .
$ 1 million for a condo ?
That is correct .
This one gets really at the point of what we are going to face .
There are many units in this place .
This condo has 2 bedrooms and 2 baths .
It is a good size condo coming in over 2,000 square feet .
It sold in January of 2007 for a stunning $ 1,000,000 .
So who made the loan on this place ?
None other than old faithful IndyMac Bank :
This is really where you can dissect what is going on .
IndyMac first made an $ 800,000 mortgage on this place plus a $ 100,000 loan .
Looks like a 10 percent down deal on a million dollar home .
Only six months later after the purchase , E - Loan allowed the borrower to take out an additional $ 188,350 from the condo basically rendering this a place with no equity .
So that would assume of course that the condo had a value of :
$ 800,000 + $ 100,000 + $ 100,000 ( down ) + $ 188,000 = $ 1.18 million .
This is the kind of math that was occurring during the bubble .
So in six months this condo went up in value by $ 188,350 ?
Come on now .
I ca n’t tell what kind of loan this is but Indymac was an option ARM specialist and that is one of the reasons they have imploded .
Well as you can tell , a notice of default was filed on March of 2009 with payments of $ 24,084 .
This is what I was talking about that once someone misses a few payments on a place like this , the aggregate amount gets big quickly .
Do you really think this place is going to fetch anything close to the peak price ?
Who is going to buy this in this market ?
You would need jumbo financing which is much higher than conventional financing .
No doubt this condo is very nice and has some extensive work done but is it worth $ 1 million ?
You tell me .
Looking at Pasadena carefully you realize that there will be many foreclosures coming online in the next few months and accelerating in 2010 .
The Alt - A and pay Option ARM tsunami is building up and is going to hit with full force .
Just look at these examples .
Last month , over all zip codes Pasadena had 78 homes sold .
If you look at the MLS figure of 570 , we would have about 7 months of inventory .
Not bad right ?
Wrong .
Just take a look at the pre-foreclosure , REO , and NTS data above and you double the amount of inventory .
I ’m glad Fitch is now in our camp .
California will see no bottom until 2011 .

A PROFESSIONAL INDIAN WOMAN ( BELIEVED TO BE 80 YEARS OLD ) WITH 50000 BURNING FIRE - CRACKERS TIED OVER HER BODY JUMPS OFF INTO WATER GIVING AN OUTSTANDING CEREMONIAL PERFORMANCE .
A. Discipline of a super - powered child is a complex issue .
First , try to explore the limits of his or her powers , and use some common sense .
Can your child control magnetic fields from across a room ?
If so , place all knives in the attic .
Has your toddler ever ensnared you in spider - webbing that can only be removed with great effort ?
Explain ( sternly ) that superpowers are a “ sometimes ” behavior .
And do limit their super- activities ; I have found that insisting that they only use their powers for one hour a day is a good way to teach a child self - control .
And what of the “ traumatic experiences ” we so often hear about when we speak of superhero origins ?
I cannot emphasize this enough : it is not necessary to be emotionally tormented , or to have witnessed the death of a loved one , in order to be an agent of justice .
A . We are not entirely sure , but there are a number of theories .
For example , superpowerism likely has a genetic component .
Are you or your partner graced with some sort of superhuman ability ?
If so , you might very well have a toddler who can bend steel with his thoughts .
Is your child confident and strong - jawed ?
Then he might be able to lift buses one day .
Research has also shown that the first manifestations of special powers generally occur before the age of 8 , and on school nights .
But , above all , know that you are not alone .
I have counseled these special children , and their families , for nearly 25 years .
And I can tell you that having a superhero child should not be cause for distress .
It is also natural to have questions .
You no doubt feel you have been thrust into a confusing new world , with little guidance into how to balance their superpowers with , say , their schoolwork .
You might have no sewing experience , and are entirely at a loss as to how to fashion a cape and tights .
Or you might be afraid to change their diapers , for fear that their waste may be radioactive .
These are all common concerns .
Please do n’t be alarmed .
It ’s not easy to hear the truth , that your child is indeed different .
Some parents do not even hear the doctor ’s words : “ Your child has superpowers . ”
It is natural to feel afraid , and even to seek a second opinion .
But it is within every parent ’s power to handle such an occurrence .
Indeed , you will likely come to find your life with a superpowered child an enriching one , in addition to never fearing street toughs again .
You may have heard that it could happen at any time .
One moment your child might be playing with a toy truck and the next moment he or she is levitating a few feet above the ground .
Or your baby might suddenly transform into an ice sculpture .
Or - and I have heard this worry expressed by more than one parent - your child might become orange and rock - like , even though he was nowhere near any cosmic rays .
Q. My child would like to dress as Wonder Woman for Halloween .
Please help .
A. Halloween can be a confusing time for these children .
The number of costumed children alone can make them think that everyone is a superpowered crimefighter .
But you must also exercise caution in what your own child wears .
Do not dress her in a superhero costume , especially one that conflicts with her powers .
This will only introduce identity issues that can manifest later in life .
I personally have seen at least five cases of children who had a great deal of difficulty returning to their secret identities for months after Halloween .
In addition , amid the holiday ’s excitement , some children may try to use powers that they do n’t even have , with mixed results .
( Though I do recall one toddler who discovered he had latent X - ray vision . )
Q. Should I allow my child to participate in soccer , or other sports ?
A . There are no easy answers , though here is one thing to bear in mind : if they do decide to compete , they will be peeing into a lot of cups .
I personally recommend that you allow them to participate , but responsibly .
Q . Is there anything I should do differently regarding my child ’s schooling ?
A. Most superpowers have little effect on cognitive abilities , and this can actually provide a good life lesson for your superpowered little one : not everyone can be good at everything .
While it is jarring to realize that someone who can traverse the continent in 10 seconds can have sawdust for brains , this does happen and can be a valuable experience .
On the other hand , some superpowers are nearly entirely cognitive .
This is doubly true if your child is some sort of cyborg , infused with alien technology .
In this case , schoolwork would be dispatched nearly instantaneously .
I recommend home - schooling , combined with a nightly rereading of Wikipedia .
Q . My child wants to choose a crime - fighting pseudonym that I do not approve of .
How should I handle this ?
A. Gently discuss alternatives that are more palatable .
Explain that Awesome and Great Flying Boy might be more succinctly conveyed as Flyboy .
Emphasize nouns rather than sentences .
Of course , when they are young ( as a general rule , below the age of 7 ) , do n’t worry about their name choices ; they will outgrow it , just as they outgrow their desire to wear yellow rain boots as dress shoes .
Q. My super - kid just hit puberty .
Help !
A . The teenage years are a difficult time for any child , and this is especially true for the super child .
Their bodies are changing in complicated , and scientifically mystifying , ways .
If they do not wish to fight crime when their acne is acting up , be understanding .
If they wish someone were dead , before they slam their bedroom door , gently remind them that they can control things with their mind , and that they must therefore be careful .
Q. My child shows a strong interest in villainy .
Should I be concerned ?
A. Presumably you oppose your child ’s desire to become a super - villain , a position I wholeheartedly endorse .
However , my experience has taught me that being intent on world domination is a phase that everyone goes through .
If these feeling persist , however , consider allowing them to control a small region populated by self - aware robots .
This will give them a sense of responsibility and ownership , and make them aware of the burdens that come with dominion over a society .
Very likely , they will grow tired of the iron grip they hold over their mechanical citizenry , and revert to a life of defending humanity against the dark lords of evil and chaos .

The latest computing survey results from the University of Virginia 's freshman class show evidence of continued Apple marketshare growth in the higher education market ( via Daring Fireball ) .
The chart above shows that Apple has made steady gains since 2003 in the percentage of incoming UVA freshman who own a Mac .
The latest year ( 2008 ) shows that 37 % of incoming students owned a Mac while the percentage owning a Windows computer had shrunk to 62 % from a peak of 96 % in 2001 .
The growth tracks closely with the trend towards laptop ownership amongst the Virginia freshman .
In 2008 , 99 % of the incoming students owned a laptop .
The data adds to a number of anecdotal reports that Apple has been making major strides in higher educational marketshare .
Last year , Tim Cook confirmed that Apple had become the # 1 laptop supplier in higher education for 2007 .
Zugangserschwerungsgesetz
Hunderte Augen sehen die „ Geheimen Listen ”
Berlin Zum ersten Mal werden Sperren im Internet aufgebaut .
Das regelt das neue , zunächst auf drei Jahre befristetes „ Zugangserschwerungsgesetz “ , das der Bundestag derzeit diskutiert .
Die Internetnutzer wehren sich heftig gegen die vom Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) zu erstellende Sperrliste .
134.000 Bürger unterzeichneten eine Petition gegen das Gesetz .
Das wirkte : Die SPD setzte mehrere Einschränkungen durch , darunter eine fünfköpfige Kontrollkommission , die Zugriff auf die geheime Schwarze Liste hat .
Auch sollen Surfer , die eine verbotene Adresse besuchen , nicht automatisch strafrechtlich verfolgt werden , wie es zunächst vorgesehen war .
Kritikern geht das Gesetz dennoch viel zu weit .
Sie befürchten , das es weiterer Zensur die Tür öffnet .
Für viele ist es der Anfang vom Ende des freien Netzes .
Die Sperre funktioniert , indem bestimmt Internetnamen ( Domains ) nicht mehr in die Adresse – die „ IP - Nummer “ – des Webservers übersetzt werden , sondern auf eine Stoppschild - Seite geleitet werden .
So , als ob man hinter einem Telefonbucheintrag eine falsche Nummer angibt .
Weil es im Netz kein zentrales „ Telefonbuch “ gibt , müssen etwa 100 größere Anbieter einbezogen werden .
Auch Sonn - und Feiertags haben sie innerhalb von sechs Stunden die BKA - Liste auf ihren System einzuspielen .
Die streng geheime Liste wird also täglich einigen hundert Systemverwaltern zugänglich gemacht .
Viele von diesen leben im und durch das Netz und sind höchst misstrauisch gegenüber staatlicher Einmischungen .
Man darf gespannt sein , wie lange es dauern wird , bis die Schwarzen Listen im Web kursieren .
Die Verbreiter dürften kaum zu fassen sein , denn niemand kennt die Tricks im Netz besser als seine Verwalter .
Seltene Stichproben
Für die Überwindung der Sperren dagegen reicht geringer technischer Sachverstand aus .
Binnen einer Minute läßt sich ein anderer Nameserver , notfalls im Ausland eintragen – im Netz kursieren Anleitungen dazu .
Fraglich sind zudem die gelegentlichen Stichproben ( „ mindestens einmal im Quartal “ ) durch das Expertengremium : Das Herz des Netzes schlägt im Stundentakt , kriminelle Seiten sind dann längst weitergewandert und die monatelang zu Unrecht verdächtigten haben bleibenden Schaden genommen .
Das Internet wurde vor 40 Jahren als robustes , dezentrales Netz erfunden , das Ausfälle und Katastrophen aushalten kann .
Diese technischen Prinzipien sichern es heute auch gegen politische Einflüsse ab – sogar bei noch viel aufwändigeren Sperren – wie im Iran und in China bewiesen .

THE easiest way for a president to make his life miserable is to antagonise his fellow politicians on Capitol Hill .
Bill Clinton tried to steamroll Congress into passing a baked - in - the - White House version of health - care reform .
Congress took one look at his 1,342 - page draft bill and decided it had better things to do .
Jimmy Carter treated Congress as an embodiment of everything that was wrong with American politics .
Congress responded in kind .
Barack Obama has clearly learnt a lesson from his two Democratic predecessors .
One of the earliest signs of the impending troubles between Mr Carter and Congress came at a breakfast that the newly elected president threw for congressional leaders .
Tip O'Neill , the speaker , was appalled to find that the only victuals available were coffee , juice and a roll .
“ Hell , Nixon treated us better than this ! ” he roared — and demanded bacon , sausage , eggs and toast .
Mr Obama has made a point of entertaining generously .
Matt Bai , of the New York Times , says that he has created “ the most Congress - centric administration in modern history ” .
Thomas Mann , of the Brookings Institution , calculates that by late April , Mr Obama had already had personal meetings with more members of Congress than George Bush managed in his eight years in Washington .
As the first president to be elected from the Hill since 1960 , Mr Obama has surrounded himself with congressional colleagues .
Joe Biden , his vice - president , spent 36 years in the Senate .
Rahm Emanuel , his chief of staff , was chairman of the House Democratic caucus .
Pete Rouse , one of his most senior advisers , is a former chief of staff to Tom Daschle , and has been a fixture on the Hill since the early 1970s .
Peter Orszag , his budget chief , is a former head of the Congressional Budget Office .
Numerous other aides have deep roots on the Hill .
So far Mr Obama has been happy to leave much of the legislative heavy lifting to Congress .
But he makes sure his aides work closely with their congressional colleagues .
He occasionally resorts to the bully - pulpit to chivvy legislation along : this week he hammered away at the importance of health - care reform at a press conference on June 23rd and held a televised town - hall meeting in the White House on the health - care crisis next day .
But he argues that his job is to lay down a broad agenda and let Congress fill in many of the details .
This has got things done fast , including a $ 787 billion stimulus bill , a $ 3.6 trillion budget and an expanded health - care programme for children .
A cap - and - trade bill is well on the way to passing in the House .
It has also helped to shield Mr Obama from criticisms from his own left flank .
But the administration is also learning that deferring too much to Congress can produce as many problems as deferring too little .
The problem with Congress is that it is a many - headed monster , ill - suited to making hard choices or producing neat solutions .
Individual members of Congress are more concerned with their own districts than with the future of the republic .
The chairmen of committees are obsessed with defending their turf .
The House is dominated by veteran liberals , who are well to the left of the electorate , and the Senate is full of prima donnas .
Around 40 members of Congress have spouses who work in the health - care industry , as did Michelle Obama .
Mr Obama 's Congress - centric approach has also taken a serious toll on the quality of his policies .
The cap - and - trade bill does not do nearly enough to limit carbon emissions from politically powerful industries .
The recent reforms of the financial regulatory system fail to tackle one of its most conspicuous weaknesses — its complexity — because doing so would mean stripping congressional committees of their oversight powers .
Health scare
But the toughest test of Mr Obama 's approach will be health - care reform , the centrepiece of his domestic programme .
He had hoped to subcontract the issue to two Senate veterans who know both Congress and health care better than anybody else in the country : Mr Daschle , whom he tapped to be both health secretary and health - reform tsar , and Senator Edward Kennedy .
But Mr Daschle ran into tax problems and was unable to take up the jobs , and Mr Kennedy is seriously ill .
Now two competing health - care bills , both unacceptably expensive in their current forms , are winding their way through the Senate and seem to be on a collision course , while in the House there is a third bill that must be melded into a compromise Senate version .
Mr Obama 's goal of getting this done by the summer recess seems to be receding fast .
There is no ideal way to reconcile the competing claims of the executive and legislative branches of government ; America 's system of checks and balances is a puzzle without a right answer .
The Obama administration can argue that its governing style has produced plenty of successes , not least a timely response to the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s .
It can also point out that Mr Bush , who emphasised “ energy in the executive ” , succeeded in passing lots of bad and expensive legislation , but failed to reform either Social Security or immigration policy .
But a little more assertiveness on Mr Obama 's part would be no bad thing .
It is hard to see how he can bring spending under control without roughing up Congress a bit .
It is also hard to see how he can fulfil his promise to be a post - partisan president while he continues to give so much power to Democratic barons .
Back in 1962 , when he tried to rank America 's presidents according to their merits , Arthur Schlesinger concluded that “ mediocre presidents believe in negative government , in self - subordination to the legislative power . ”
Mr Obama does not give the slightest impression of being a man who wants to go down in history as a mediocre president .

Researchers in Gabon and France have discovered a new species of malaria parasite , one that lives in chimpanzees but is closely related to the species most deadly to humans .
The new species was described last week in the journal PLoS Pathogens .
It was named Plasmodium gaboni , and it is closely related to Plasmodium falciparum , which causes more than a million deaths each year , most of them of children in Africa .
In its search for malaria in apes , researchers from the Research Institute for Development in Montpellier , France , and the International Center of Medical Research in Franceville , Gabon , took blood from 17 chimpanzees captured by Gabonese hunters ; 2 of them had the new parasite .
In Central Africa , baby chimps may be kept or sold as pets after their parents are shot for meat .
Only one other species resembling falciparum malaria , called Plasmodium reichenowi , has been found in apes , so this discovery will help experts studying DNA work out how malaria evolved in apes , humans and , presumably , in their common ancestor .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Five American security contractors were detained in connection with the killing of another American contractor last month inside Baghdad 's Green Zone , sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Saturday .
The body of James Kitterman was found in a car in Baghdad 's heavily protected Green Zone .
Iraqi and U.S. personnel took the five into custody in an operation inside the Green Zone before dawn on Friday , according to an Iraqi official involved in the investigation into the killing of James Kitterman .
The five , who have not yet been charged , were being held by Iraqi security forces Saturday at a jail inside the heavily protected zone , he said .
The troops also confiscated weapons during the raid on the suspects ' firm at about 4 a.m. ( 11 a.m. ET ) , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The names of the suspects and the company they work for were not released .
The U.S. military declined comment and referred questions to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .
Embassy officials did not immediately respond to request for comments .
Kitterman was found bound , blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in the district , formally known as the International Zone , on May 22 .
The 60 - year - old Houston , Texas , resident owned a construction company that operated in Iraq .
The five suspects knew the victim , a source inside the Green Zone familiar with the investigation said .
Both the Iraqi and the Green Zone sources noted that the FBI has been involved in the investigation from the start .
Once the suspects are charged and referred to trial , the case would be sent to Iraq 's Central Criminal Court , the Iraqi official said .
If that happens , it would be the first time U.S. citizens were tried in Iraq since the United States returned the country 's government to the Iraqis .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Alan Duke contributed to this report .

NARRATION
This is the story of two great men - tested to the limits .
Gravity Probe B Principal Investigator , Francis Everitt has had his ingenuity and tenacity stretched to breaking point over the last 40 years - and he's about to find out if his life 's work will literally explode in front of him .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
I 've often been asked how I was feeling , and the answer is I was too busy to feel anything .
NARRATION
The other man - well Einstein may be gone , but his theories live on at the heart of modern physics ... some never tested ... until now .
And this is the craft that carries the burden of their legacies .
BRAD PARKINSON
You look at it and you say oh my goodness look , it 's a marvel of engineering , it 's a marvel of physics and science .
NARRATION
On board Gravity probe B are some of the most delicate and intricate devices ever crafted by human kind .
If just one of them fails over the next 11 months , we may never know the truth about gravity .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
Gravity is the first force in nature that anybody really , in some sense , namely Newton understood and of all the forces of nature it 's the probably the one we least understand to the day .
BRAD PARKINSON
See Newton was right , almost , and it was only when we pushed the limits that we discovered no , no , he 's not quite right .
NARRATION
In 1915 , Albert Einstein unleashed a revolutionary new understanding of the universe 's great force .
This was his theory of general relativity .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
Einstein realised you have to treat gravity not as a force but as a field .
It means that things do n't interact directly , it is n't that you have two objects which pull on each other , but each of them modifies the space around them in some way .
NARRATION
No longer was gravity Newton 's simple attraction between two bodies ... gravity was the curvature of spacetime itself .
Einstein saw a universe where mass warps spacetime around it ... and black holes suck spacetime into a vortex .
DR JONICA NEWBY
One of the consequences of Einstein 's understanding of gravity is a phenomenon known as Frame Dragging .
Complicated name - simple idea .
It suggests that as a massive celestial object like a planet rotates , it drags bits of spacetime with it
BRAD PARKINSON
I mean , drags space and time with it , what on earth does that mean ?
It means there 's a coupling and that a nearby object somehow gets dragged .
But it 's not a force , it 's not a force , it 's a rotation of the local coordinate frame and this is a really weird notion .
NARRATION
But it was just a theory .
While Einstein has since been proven right on most things , his theory about the nature of gravity has had surprisingly little experimental proof .
When Dr Francis Everitt took on that mission back 1964 , he was just 30 .
He had no idea he'd give his life to it .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
It 's still amazing how little testing Einstein 's had .
I , with the ignorance and simplicity of youth , thought I 'd like a bigger challenge , and , I certainly got it .
In the end , I think just sort of the sheer challenge of are we going to be able to pull this off became itself a driving force .
NARRATION
So what took so long ?
BRAD PARKINSON
Concept very simple .
Execution , real hard - real hard .
NARRATION
The concept did sound simple enough .
They 'd place a telescope - and a spinning gyroscope - in orbit above the earth .
The telescope would lock on to a distant reference point - a guide star .
Over the course of a year , they would see if there was a slight change in the angle of the gyroscope .
With this simple setup , they could test two key Einstein effects - and his theory on gravity with it .
First is called the geodetic effect .
This the amount by which the earth is curving its spacetime .
More important was to test the infinitely smaller , never measured frame - dragging effect - the amount the earth is dragging its spacetime .
The trouble was , the technology to measure such a tiny deviation was n't humanly possible .
BRAD PARKINSON
So it 's measuring something , an angle as seen from forty miles that is more like that .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
The kind of gyroscope you need is one million , no ten million times more accurate than the most accurate inertial navigation gyroscopes .
NARRATION
And that meant they had to invent an entirely new form of gyroscope .
This is where that mind - numbing engineering challenge was taken on - the machine shop at Stanford University , California .
Everitt was here ... year after year ... as his team struggled ... and failed ... to make the heart of the gyroscope they needed ... a sphere so perfect , it did n't exist on earth .
After 10 long frustrating years , they finally they hit the right formula , a quartz sphere coated in an element called niobium .
DR JONICA NEWBY
This is it - this is the gyroscope , the most perfect round object on earth .
It 's even listed in the Guiness book of records that way .
Put it this way - if you were to blow this up to the size of the earth , the tallest mountain would be just 2.4 metres high .
NARRATION
Like all gyroscopes , once set spinning simple momentum maintains its orientation .
But unlike our earthbound gyroscopes these have virtually no bumps , no touching parts , no disturbing friction of any kind .
Even its axis of spin will be detected without touch through the magic of superconductivity .
Chilled to almost absolute zero , the gyroscopes niobium coating becomes a superconductor ... emitting a magnetic field ... which can be measured .
Free from all external influences , its spin axis becomes an inviolable pointer , deviating only if there are changes in the very coordinates of local spacetime .
They 'd created the impossible .
But they still had to house the gyroscopes - four in total .
There was a spacecraft to build .
BRAD PARKINSON
The challenges of the space craft are pretty extreme .
Space craft had to actually chase one of the gyro's and by that we mean , one of the gyro 's separated by perhaps a third the width of a human hair , spinning at ten thousand RPM , if it touches , the experiment is over .
We had to use little puffs of gas and have the whole satellite chase this gyro and if the satellite got a little to this side of that gap , we had to get a little gas and puff it back .
And if we made a mistake , it would be fatal .
NARRATION
But it was the non technical challenges that really pushed Everitt 's perseverance to the limits - and beyond .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
I actually was doing some work at home and I received a phone call from home , ah , from a man high up in NASA , who said , are you sitting down ?
And I assured him I was sitting down and he said , well they 've just cancelled your program ... and I can't tell you what to do about it .
NARRATION
Seven times they were cancelled - 7 times they had to make the long trek to Congress to claw the program back .
And as the decades ticked by , their goal seemed to warp and recede like spacetime itself .
BRAD PARKINSON
We had some dark days .
We had some things that broke .
We had some things that did n't seem to work right .
We had a fire , burned our whole lab .
The glue that held it together , was Francis .
He kept us going somehow .
NARRATION
But on a clear day in 2004 , Everitt 's superhuman tenacity pays off .
The elegant gravity probe B is heading for the launchpad .
It 's taken 43 years , hundreds of scientists and more than 70 PhD 's to get to this point .
Now , the team 's precious gyroscopes - so lovingly made in the most protected conditions - are about to be flung into the harshest environment imaginable : space .
BRAD PARKINSON
Everyone was holding their breath , you know .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
Things do terribly happen sometimes .
BRAD PARKINSON
It was awesome when they finally said , " we 've got it in orbit " and we could watch , they had a camera and you could watch the last booster falling away .
We thought : " My golly , it 's up there , it 's up there " .
It was a pretty emotional moment .
NARRATION
Gravity Probe B unfurls its sails ... locks onto the guide star which will maintain its perfect alignment ... and begins to orbit the earth .
Now , the nail - biting wait for data collection - will a lifetime of planning pay off ... or fail at the last hurdle as so many space missions have done .
If Everitt 's patience was tested over the last 40 years , it 's nothing to the months , then years passing now .
In 2007 , they are able to make an announcement - the geodetic effect has been confirmed - that part of Einstein 's theory has stood up .
But the vital frame - dragging question has a problem - the gyroscope results just wo n't line up .
Now , in 2009 , they 're ready to go public .
DR JONICA NEWBY
Welcome and thank you for talking to the ABC .
Can I ask first - what took you so long ?
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
Well , when you 're making gyroscopes that are ten million times better than any gyros that have ever been before you might expect somewhere right down at the bottom of that there would be the odd little thing that you had n't totally predicted .
So it 's been a long saga .
DR JONICA NEWBY
So , million dollar question , was Einstein right about gravity ?
BARRY MULLFELDER
So if Einstein were wrong and there were no such thing as general relativity then the drift in the north south and east west directions would be identically zero rather than the values that we clearly see .
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
So , we can indeed say that when the earth spins it drags spacetime with it .
DR JONICA NEWBY
That must be a good feeling ?
DR FRANCIS EVERITT
It 's a good feeling .
Partly a sigh of relief and partly that we 've done an experiment people thought was impossible .
NARRATION
90 years after Einstein first revealed his thoughts on gravity , the test is in - his legacy stands .
Final measurements are being tidied up , and Gravity Probe B will soon enter the textbooks .
But perhaps the biggest legacy is the many minds - and technologies - that were inspired by this grand quest to prove the impossible possible - which is what it took to confirm one of the most astounding ideas ever conceived by one human mind .
True , we are still living in a material world , but cotton grown with pesticides is no longer the fabric of our lives .
The green movement is making huge strides replacing toxins and waste in the marketplace with organic fibers like bamboo and hemp , as well as good old corn starch , throw - away cork and used paper .
The brave , new soldiers of eco industry believe enough is enough when it comes to creating more waste and adding to our grossly overflowing landfills and plastic islands .
Bet you do , too !
Instead , the trend has been to meet a growing consumer demand for renewable and reusable resources , seeking out the scraps of industry ( glass , cork and plastic bottles ) and growing plants without pesticides to make healthy fibers with no trace of petroleum .
Here is a go - to list of the friendliest materials that have our planet covered .
1. Bamboo Fiber
The eco fiber option of choice , bamboo is woven into everything from fashionable dresses like those made by Spun in Seattle and other respected labels , to towels , totes and interior elements such as window treatments .
This natural textile is made from the pulp of the bamboo grass and is best in the organic form – pure and unbleached .
It is a strong fabric , considered more durable and sustainable than conventional textile fiber .
2. Bamboo Hardwood
Considered a renewable resource , bamboo is a grass that thrives quickly .
Oak trees can take 120 years to grow to maturity while bamboo can be harvested in three .
it also regenerates without need for replanting , and requires minimal fertilization or pesticides .
The jury is still out on whether or not bamboo flooring is as durable as traditional European hardwoods .
As Tree Hugger points out , now all bamboo products are alike .
Since it is mostly shipped from China , you have to determine if the product is treated according to environmental standards .
Companies like Teragren are careful about adhering to strict environmental specifications .
3. Cork
Got a surface that needs covering ?
Put a cork on it .
Whether molded into mosaics for floors by Mod Walls or adapted as a textile for chic handbags by Shop Cork Design , cork is a renewable resource from the industry ’s by - products .
It can be waterproofed to extend the life of the surface and also applied to walls as an unexpected modern surface .
4. Plantation Grown Teak
Teak is a deciduous hardwood tree from the highlands of southeast Asia and is considered a sustainable timber for indoor - outdoor furniture , as well as decking .
The Maku Chaise , below , is an example of outdoor designs sold by Design Public and other vendors .
Teak has a naturally high oil content which makes it both stable and resistant to rotting when exposed to extreme climates .
Much of it comes to us from the island of Java .
The Dutch started plantations there about 150 years ago .
The Indonesian government agency , Perum Perhutani , now manages the plantations , enforcing a strict policy regarding the size and quantity of trees felled each year together with annual replanting .
5. Corn Starch Biocompostables
Corn : it ’s what ’s for dinner and so much more .
These utensils from the Biodegradable Store made of sugar cane fiber , corn and potato starch are the green alternative to petroleum - based plastics and styrofoam materials which take thousands of years to degrade .
Thankfully , the new biocompostables are not restricted to the home pantry but are showing up at shopping mall food courts and school events where large crowds gather and consume disposables in bulk .
Corn has also been used for library cards in San Francisco and ringtone downloader cards .
And do n’t forget ethanol , a fuel helping to reduce greenhouse emissions and slow global warming .
6. Hemp
Hemp is grown without pesticides or fertilizers and is rapidly replacing plastic - based materials for clothing and home decor .
A member of the Cannabis Sativa plant family ( do n’t worry , it wo n’t get you high – other than environmentally ! ) , it yields 250 % more fiber than cotton per acre plus 500 % more pulp fiber than forest wood .
Sold by the yard or already woven into bedding , curtains or fashion garb by brands like Eco Fabrik , hemp dates back to more than 10,000 years ago with a myriad of uses such as paper making , cloth weaving and extracted oils for medicinal products and skincare .
7. Soybean Fabric
Soy fabric is friendly and soft and similar to cashmere or silk in texture .
It is found in luxury items , such as these cushy robes from Eco Body wear , and scrumptious baby rompers from Baby Soy USA .
Soybean protein fiber is a sustainable and botanical textile fiber made from renewable and biodegradable natural resources – the leftover soybean pulp from tofu and soy milk production .
Its 16 amino acids are healthy and nutritional for our skin .
8. Organic Cotton
The Organic Trade Association tells us organic cotton grown by farmers worldwide increased 152 percent during the 2007 - 2008 crop year .
Organic cotton is grown without harmful toxic pesticides and synthetic fertilizers meaning the farming methods and materials have a low impact on people and the environment .
Production replenishes and maintains soil fertility to build biologically diverse agriculture .
Genetically engineered seed for organic farming is strictly taboo , and all cotton sold as organic in the United States must meet strict federal regulations covering how the cotton is grown .
In terms of products , it is much easier to find now in upscale and everyday clothing and underwear , stylish bedding like this soft set from Pottery Barn , rugs , bags – you name it .
9. Recycled Glass
Companies like the inventive Vetrazzo are sparing landfills of post - industrial glass scraps , while giving new life to post consumer glass such as Corona Beer bottles which are made into countertops .
It all goes into the mix of making a sustainable recycled product that adds great beauty to the environment .
The same reusable resource is being molded into jewelry or new tumblers for entertaining .
One man ’s junk ” ¦you get the picture .
10 . Low VOC Paint and Finishes
You ’ve probably heard of VOC ’s , the solvents in paint which evaporate easily at room temperature .
They smell bad bad and are bad for people and other living things .
They contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer as well as poor indoor air quality .
That ’s why companies like Benjamin Moore and YOLO Colorhouse® are offering us alternatives .
The scientists and artists at YOLO produce a premium zero -VOC paint with an appealing designer palette of 40 hues for interiors , inspired by the natural world .
It seems to be the direction more makers of finishes are going .
Let ’s follow this path and refuse to buy anything less healthy for our homes .
11 . Recycled Polyester
Yes , rPET is the new polyester !
PET stands for Poly Ethylene Terephthalate , a plastic resin and a form of polyester .
PET is a polymer that is formed by combining two monomers called modified ethylene glycol and Purified Terephthalic Acid .
PET is labeled with the # 1 code on bottles and containers used to package soft drinks , water , juice , peanut butter , salad dressings and oil , cosmetics and household cleaners .
PET is a popular package for food and non -food products because it is inexpensive , lightweight , resalable , shatter - resistant and recyclable .
To source the post consumer bottles , they are sterilized and then dried and crushed into tiny chips .
The chips are heated in a vat and forced through spinnerets ( as with virgin polyester ) and then are spun into yarn and dyed without toxic properties .
What can you make with the Eco - fi material ?
Everything from carpets , bags and clothing to wall coverings , furnishings and craft felt .
12 . Recycled Paper
Did you know 57 million trees are killed each year to produce the paper catalog companies crank out to market their stuff ?
The catalog industry floods our mailboxes with over 17 billion catalogs a year in the United States , many produced on paper that comes from endangered forests , including those in the Canadian Boreal forest .
But businesses , such as Norm Thompson Outfitters of Portland , Oregon , are setting new standards by using recycled paper for their catalogs .
Many other companies are getting on the recycled paper bus , including card and stationary designers such as Papel Vino in Vancouver and Bird Dog Press .
Magazine strips are also coiled for trays and meshed into placemats for chic home decor .
For every ton of paper that is recycled , 17 trees are spared .
You can recycle most paper , including white office paper , newspaper and mixed - color paper , through a local curbside recycling program .
13 . Felt
No longer just the craft stuff of school kids , if you ’ve got an eye like Josh Jakus ( bags and coasters ) and Ronel Jordaan ( modern stones ) there is nothing you ca n’t glue together with this delightful , ecological textile .
Felt can come in many forms , from recycled wool from PET bottles to made the old fashion “ wet felting ” way by nomadic peoples in Central Asia .
The non -woven cloth is made by matting , condensing and pressing organic fibers while they are wet .
While some types of felt are very soft , some are tough enough to use on construction materials such as a tar paper called roofing felt .
14 . Solar Cells
A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect .
Assemblies of cells are used to make solar panels and solar modules to produce energy for practical use .
Harnessing energy from the sun is a major goal in slowing global warming .
Prefabricated solar panel systems for roofing usually range in capacity from 3 to 120 kilowatts .
According to Technology Review , solar roofing materials can “ cut the cost of household solar installations by doing double duty , generating electricity while protecting buildings from the elements . ”
Scientists tell us that on a bright , sunny day , the sun shines approximately 1,000 watts of energy per square meter of the planet ’s surface .
Collecting all of that energy would allow us to easily power our homes and offices for free .
15 . Aluminum Bottles
A question that might be posed by Dwight Schrute of The Office is “ which water bottle is best ? ”
Many athletes , backpackers and soccer moms who used to quaff from leaky plastic will tell you the Sigg aluminum is best when it comes to bottles free of Bisphenol - A ( BPA ) found in polycarbonate plastics .
Sometimes called Lexan , BPA is an endocrine disruptor that has been shown to affect reproduction and brain development in animal studies .
It can leach into foods and liquids and mimics estrogen when absorbed by the human body .
Sigg bottles are made from a single piece of aluminum ( no leaks ) and have a water - based , non -toxic interior coating .
The liner ’s finish keeps out bacteria and mold and is neutral and resistant to fruit acids and energy drinks .
SIGG bottles have been independently tested to prove they are completely leach - free and are 100 percent recyclable .
16.BPA - Free Plastic
While plastics have been shunned by environmentalists since The Graduate debuted , the new Better Bottle produced by CamelBak is a move in the right direction .
The company switched its 2008 Better Bottle line to Eastman Tritan copolyester , a new BPA - and phthalate - free material .
BPA - free bottles started shipping to retailers in January of 2008 and are popular choices for children following required packing lists for summer camps and school field trips .
Camelbak also makes stainless steel bottles , which are a close rival of aluminum in popularity and purity .
You can buy them at outdoorsy outlets such as REI .
17 . Cardboard
Recycling old cardboard to make recycling containers ?
Sure , that ’s what the inventive set , such as Amazing Recycled Products , is doing and much more .
Savvy products on the market include coasters , DIY speakers and journals .
The two types of cardboard that can be recycled are flat cardboard , which is typically used in cereal and shoe boxes , and corrugated cardboard , which has a ruffled layer between the two flat pieces of cardboard and is often used in packing boxes .
Both can usually be recycled through your local curbside recycling program .
18 . Reclaimed Rubber
Tired of tires sitting in landfills for indefinite periods of time ?
So are companies like Rubber Sidewalks , which use shredded tires to compose panels that fit together to form a rubber sidewalk .
The rubber is even good for trees , letting the sidewalk raise and bend around the roots .
You no longer have to remove entire trees to keep concrete from being torn up and replaced .
In 2006 , 60 cities from 15 different states tested rubber sidewalks .
Residents find the rubber feels good under their feet and sound is reduced , as well .
It ’s safe and non -toxic .
Rubber sidewalks also comes in different colors .
While the main motive is to save trees , recycled rubber also reduces the waste from tires each year .
In California alone , tires create an estimated 408 million pounds of waste rubber .
19 . Rice Hulls
Green
Pots are made from rice hulls and break down much quicker than traditional planters .
No pollutants are used or produced at any stage of the manufacturing process of the containers and there are no wasted materials because scraps are recycled back into the production process .
Consumer rice also enjoys afterlife as durable messenger bags that look pretty and help us conserve .
20 . Natural Earth Clay and Plaster
A friendly alternative to cement , gypsum , acrylic and lime plasters , products like American Clay Earth Plaster are pure and breathable , a popular choice in the new construction of walls and remodeling of old buildings .
As Countryside Magazine points out , using earth to make walls and houses has been done for thousands of years .
Uncle Sam invested in testing Rammed Earth construction from the 20s through the 40s as a practical way to achieve affordable housing .
Even Frank Lloyd Wright was said to be a fan of using adobe and other natural earth sources .
He drew up plans for a multi-family cooperative but due to the war that project was never fulfilled .
The process of making rammed earth involves the mixing of raw material from gravel , sand , silt and clay .
* BONUS MATERIAL
21 . Elbow Grease
Susie Homemaker is not staying slim these days by downing diuretics ( that was my mother ’s trick ) but by spinning her salads , washing and wiping dishes by hand , hand washing and line drying clothes , riding her bike to the market , walking to her volunteer meetings and other steps that burn calories while leaving a lighter carbon pump print .
The more we use our own body ’s energy the less we rely on oil , electricity and other sources that drain the planet .
And by the way , the exercise of cutting some of your pretty hair also can help the planet in the mopping up of oil spills in the form of hair mats .
Human hair has not caught on as fabric for clothing yet , as far as we can tell from Project Runway .
It 's remarkable to think that only ten years have passed since a pair of idealistic lads in a garage set up a company that would change the way many of us live .
What 's more surprising is that Larry Page and Sergey Brin have achieved global domination while preserving the cuddly image that always set Google apart .
Their search engine may have evolved to map the planet and spawn a swarm of products , but its breezy logo and fuzzy persona still evoke the cosy culture born in that Californian car port .
Nowhere is that ethos more visible than at Google 's offices , which famously eschew the stark trappings of corporatism in favour of fun .
Last week , Google released a video tour of the Googleplex , its global HQ near San Jose .
" Googlers " , as the company 's 20,000 employees are called , can be seen cavorting on buggies and bikes , playing volleyball and downing wheatgrass shots .
If this is the face of one of the world 's most recognisable brands , then it's one Google is increasingly having to protect .
The company 's most vocal critics paint it as a tentacled beast monopolising cyberspace and peering into our lives through our computer screens .
In March , when Google launched Streetview , its bid to photograph every corner ( and therefore front door ) of our cities , one commentator mused that where once we Googled , now it is Googling us .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
To find out what 's really happening behind the revolving doors , how the Googlers - in - chiefs are answering their critics , and what these people actually do when they 're not kicking back in a break - out space , The Independent took up an invitation to spend a day at Google London .
Is it really the greatest place to work in the world ?
The video star
The towering doors at the entrance in Victoria would n't look out of place at some Red Square ministry – they are distinctly un-Google and revolve slowly into a vast , echoing lobby .
You have to get to the sixth floor of the shared building for the fun to begin .
Google 's own reception desk is replete with sweet jars and lava lamps .
That 's more like it .
I 'm directed into the legendary canteen ( more of which later ) , where I stock up on coffee and croissants and sit down with my first Googler of the day .
Ed Sanders works on YouTube , the Google - owned video site .
He loves it here .
" It 's an amazing place to work , " he gushes .
" I 'm constantly staggered by the calibre of people and the culture of entrepreneurialism .
It 's just so exciting . "
Sanders 's most recent project was YouTube 's Symphony Orchestra project , in which thousands of amateurs auditioned to perform a live concert at Carnegie Hall .
" I do n't think a project like this would have got off the ground anywhere else , " Sanders says .
All very communal and cute , but surely there 's somebody here who hates their job ?
The mind reader
Negotiating the colourful corridors that are home to branded red phone boxes , or " Googleboxes " , I find Sian Townsend in her lab .
Her job is to read your mind .
Well , sort of .
She 's a researcher for Google 's " user experience " team .
Bright - eyed and fresh - faced , she does n't look like a dissenter .
" It 's super energetic and inspiring here .
It 's hard not to rave abou - " .
Enough !
What does Townsend actually do ?
She whips out an iPhone to demonstrate .
" I work in mobile search , " she says , tapping " pizza " into the Google application .
Do the same on a desktop and the Wikipedia entry for " pizza " comes top .
Useless if you 're out and about and hungry .
First result on Townsend 's phone is the Fresh Pizza Co , a local restaurant .
" Because modern phones know where you are we can tailor search results , " she says .
One technique she uses to better understand how people use their phones involves recruiting volunteers to go out and get searching .
" They log a diary at the end of each day and tell me about what they were thinking each time , " says Townsend , who feeds results to engineers to make searching better .
The Googler - in- chief
All very good , but it 's time to put the big questions to the big boss .
Matt Brittin , a former Olympic rower , was appointed Director of Operations in March .
Just days into his tenure he was plunged into the media storm that followed the launch of Streetview .
I find him , still reeling , at Kew Gardens – all the rooms on this floor are named after London Underground stations linked by tube lines painted on the ceilings .
" There 's an image of Google and a reality , " he says , launching into a well - practised defence .
" It 's easy for people to say Google knows a lot about us but it 's not the case .
We have a thin layer of information about what you 're searching for but that 's it .
It 's also easy to paint us as a big organisation trying to penetrate every area of life , but ultimately consumers can choose to use Gmail or Google Earth or something else . "
What about Google 's cosy workplace ethos , which staff evangelise with sometimes cloying zeal , often inciting derision among sceptics ?
" God knows why there are rubber ducks on the ceiling out there , " Brittin says pointing to a breakout space on the way to Earl 's Court .
" But what 's important is recognising people do n't necessarily work best sitting at a desk .
Playing on the Wii or going for a run might fuel new ideas .
We look after our staff so that they want to come to work . "
The Gooogle geek
Speaking of which , it 's lunchtime .
Never has a work canteen been so enticing .
Mountains of fresh salad stretch as far as the eye can see , while steaming joints of ham wait to be carved .
As staff trickle in ( they consult webcams from their desks to avoid the salivating queues ) , a chef lays out pastries that would make Escoffier drool .
And it 's all free !
I make a beeline for the sushi counter and take a seat with Dave Burke .
As an engineer , Burke ought to be every inch the Google geek but with his sharp suit jacket , he looks more like a contemporary Don Draper from " Mad Men " .
I do n't even bother asking him what he thinks of this place – he's too busy wolfing down a free smoked salmon sandwich .
But Burke knows about the work ethos .
Between mouthfuls , he demonstrates a tool he conceived during what 's known in Googlespeak as " 20 per cent time " – the day in the week staff are encouraged to devote to their own projects ( it gave rise to Gmail and Google News ) .
Without touching his phone 's screen , he raises it to his ear and says " pictures of the Empire State building . "
By the time Burke lowers the handset , images of the skyscraper have appeared .
Burke programmes phones to recognise the particular movement we use to raise them to our ear , as sensed by the position - detecting accelerometers built into most new devices .
The motion triggers the voice - activated search .
The brain feeder
After the lunchtime rush dies down , it 's time to meet the man who feeds 600 hungry Googlers .
Adrian Evans is head chef and honed his skills at some of London 's top restaurants .
His brief : to nourish brains .
This must be one of the only canteens in Britain without chips .
" We also put the desserts at the end of the line so there 's no space on people 's trays by the time they get there . "
Evans 's canteen is the site of TGIF ( Thank Google it 's Friday ) .
Fridges of beer are padlocked in preparation for the event , where the pool cues come out and musicians are invited to perform .
The canine consultant
Grabbing a chocolate éclair on my way out ( cannily side - stepping the chef's " full tray " approach to healthy eating ) I prepare to re-enter the real world .
First , though , the games room for a round of table football .
Or ping pong , or a jam on Guitar Hero , or a bash on the Wii .
There 's also an electric piano , where a Googler called Lee says he writes songs during his lunch hour .
What 's wrong with an M&S sandwich and a packet of a crisps on a park bench ?
Time to go .
On my way out , I bump into a Googler called Elwood .
He 's wearing his security pass , complete with passport photo , on a collar round his neck .
That 's because he 's a dog .
He belongs to a chap called Ash .
What 's Elwood 's job title ?
" General Morale Booster , " Ash says .
It 's a cutesy coda to a day in which I almost feel as if I 've been thrown into a Google washing machine .
Perhaps
I 've been shielded from the reputed sinister underbelly of this beast of the internet , but I leave secretly wishing I were a Googler .
It would be worth it just for the canteen .

Daily ejaculation may be the best way to improve sperm quality Having sex every day improves sperm quality and could boost the chances of getting pregnant , research suggests .
In a study of men with fertility problems , daily ejaculation for a week cut the amount of DNA damage seen in sperm samples .
Speaking at a fertility conference , the Australian researcher said general advice for couples had been to have sex every two or three days .
Early results from the trial had already shown promising results .
Perhaps we have been blaming the women as couples get older but perhaps there 's a contribution from the male because we 're not behaving as we should be
Dr David Greening
Sydney IVF
But 118 men have now been tested and the benefits for sperm have become clearer .
Dr David Greening , from Sydney IVF , told delegates at the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology meeting that eight in ten men taking part showed a 12 % drop in sperm DNA damage after the seven days .
Although there was a big drop in sperm numbers from 180 million to 70 million over the week , men were still within the normal " fertile " range .
Sperm also became more active over the seven days with a small rise in motility , he added .
Damage
The theory is the longer sperm hang around in the testes the more likely they are to accumulate DNA damage and the warm environment could also make them more sluggish after a while .
Sperm come under attack by free radicals - small reactive molecules which can damage DNA and cause cell death - in the tube that stores and carries sperm away from the testes .
Further work is needed to work out if daily sex for men without fertility problems has the same benefits but Dr Greening believes it is likely to be the case .
He warns that having daily sex for too long - say a fortnight - would probably cut sperm numbers too much .
But recommended " lots of sex daily " around the time the woman is ovulating .
He said it was best to " keep the river flowing " .
As men age they may not have as much sex as they did when they were younger , adding to the problem of infertility , Dr Greening told delegates .
" We are designed to breed in our youth .
" Perhaps we have been blaming the women as couples get older but perhaps there 's a contribution from the male because we 're not behaving as we should be . "
The findings may also have implications for couples undergoing IVF as men are commonly told to abstain from sex for a couple of days to try and boost sperm numbers .
Dr Alan Pacey , a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield , said the finding that daily ejaculation improved the chances of conception was interesting , but it would be wrong to apply the results to all men .
" For example , in cases where men have low sperm counts to start with , daily ejaculations may well reduce the sperm count still further and whilst sperm may be more healthy the reduced numbers could impede the chance of natural conception .
" The best general advice is that if couples are attempting to conceive naturally , intercourse every couple of days will make sure the sperm are as healthy as possible on each occasion .
" However , in preparation for IVF or ICSI treatment , this advice may well change in response to medical test results like DNA damage measurements . "

Testing the usability of your site is one of the smartest things you can do .
Usability involves making a website ’s interface easier to use and simpler to understand , so that the user ’s experience is as enjoyable as possible .
The more usable a site is , the more satisfying it will be to interact with it — and happy visitors translate into happy customers .
Ideas about what makes for the best website design do n’t always translate perfectly when put into practice .
Elements that one person might consider easy to use may actually turn out to be confusing for someone else .
In this article , we ’ll review 10 tools that you can use to improve your website ’s usability even if you ’re on a low budget .
As designers and developers , we have a natural bias towards the way our own products function : we built them , so we know exactly how they work .
Our visitors , however , do n’t have this advantage .
This means that testing for usability is the only reliable way to find out how well a website works .
Usability testing allows you to discover many ways in which your site can be improved .
How much testing should I do ?
Usability testing may sound daunting , but in reality , a small investment can yield large gains .
Jacob Nielsen , one of the best - known usability gurus , says :
“ The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford . ”
– Jacob Nielsen ( Why You Only Need to Test With 5 Users )
That ’s right .
Just 5 users will provide enough results to help you make effective updates to your website .
While you could test with 15 users to find most or all problem areas on your site , testing with just 5 will uncover 85 % of issues , which gives you the most value for your money .
Other trouble spots can be identified by testing a subsequent round of users , and with each additional test , the number of issues uncovered will decrease .
It ’s important to note that the very first usability test offers the greatest insight .
Even a small amount of testing can yield significant results and reveal big issues and problem areas early on .
This means that you do n’t need to spend a lot of time or money to benefit from usability testing .
On a tight budget ?
Usability testing sounds like a good idea , but you ’re probably wondering if any affordable options exist .
The answer is yes .
Plenty of free or cheap tools and services are available to help you test and optimize your site .
Here ’s our selection of some of the best and most affordable options to get started with .
1. Userfly
Userfly is an interesting new startup .
The service allows you to put a little bit of JavaScript on your website and then track a lot of your visitors ’ actions , from mouse movements to clicks and keystrokes ( except password entries , of course ) .
This means that you can replay a user ’s session exactly as it happened , and not just on a single page either , but across your entire site .
You can see where the user ’s mouse moved and exactly what they typed .
You can start using Userfly for free , with a limit of 10 captures .
The Basic plan gives you 100 captures at $ 10 per month , which should be plenty to get you started .
2. Feedback Army
Feedback
Army is probably the fastest way to get feedback about your website ( aside from asking your colleagues ) .
This service is powered by Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk engine .
As the name implies , Mechanical Turk is a human - powered “ engine ” designed to solve tasks that can be completed in a short period of time .
Feedback Army asks users questions about your site and quickly gathers feedback and impressions so that you can improve the user experience .
The cost is relatively cheap : $ 10 buys you 10 responses .
However , do n’t expect detailed reviews .
Also , it is important to construct your questions carefully to receive the highest quality and most effective feedback .
3. Five Second Test
Five Second
Test is a free usability testing service that offers three different ways of testing : “ Classic , ” “ Compare , ” and “ Sentiment . ”
The Classic test shows and then hides a screenshot of your page and asks users to recall elements that they remember .
The Compare test shows two screenshots and asks users which they prefer .
The Sentiment test shows one page and asks users to pick their favorite and least favorite elements .
As you can probably guess from the name , testers have only 5 seconds to provide feedback after seeing a question .
Also , each test can be marked as public or invitation - only , which is helpful if you need to limit exposure .
4. UserTesting
UserTesting offers a more traditional approach to usability testing .
Give UserTesting your website ’s demographic , and the service will select the right users to browse your site .
In return , you ’ll receive a video of the users ’ screens as they navigate your site , along with a running audio commentary of their responses .
You will also get a written report detailing the areas and functions that the users liked and disliked and anything that may have prompted them to leave the site .
All of this costs only $ 29 per test .
Such low - cost and high - quality deliverables make UserTesting a great option for those looking to perform detailed tests of their websites , without having to resort to more expensive , comprehensive usability testing .
5. ClickTale
Similar to Userfly , ClickTale captures the actions of your website ’s visitors , including clicks , scrolling , and keystrokes .
Other features offered include a scrolling heat map , form analytics , and individual link analysis ( e.g. how many clicks or hovers did each link get ? ) .
ClickTale has a free plan that records 400 page views per month for one domain .
Some of the features in the free plan are limited ; for example , the scrolling heat map is available only for your most popular page .
Paid plans start at $ 99 a month , which is still a competitive price for the features that this service offers .
6. Google Website Optimizer
A good way to improve the performance of your website is to do A/B testing ( also known as split testing ) .
This means running two different versions of a particular page simultaneously for different users and recording how well each one converts .
A more advanced version of this test is called multivariate testing , in which a multitude of variables are tested to discover the best combination .
Google offers a tool to do exactly this : Google Website Optimizer .
All you need to do is provide the various content elements ( for example , different headlines or product pictures ) and Google Website Optimizer will serve random combinations of them to your visitors while tracking how well each combination converts .
Best of all , Google Website Optimizer is free to use .
7. ClickHeat
ClickHeat is an interesting little tool that generates heat maps of all the clicks made on your website .
You ’ve probably seen heat maps generated by eye - tracking studies : this is the same concept , but for tracking clicks instead .
The service is free but needs to be downloaded and installed on a server , and so it has a couple of requirements , such as PHP support .
8. Chalkmark
Chalkmark is a usability testing app currently offered as a free beta .
Chalkmark allows you to set up a series of tests ; for example , a user could be shown your landing page and be asked to perform a task , such as find the sign - up page .
The location (s ) that the user clicks on are tracked .
These targeted tests allow you to find out how easy certain tasks on your website are to perform and whether the navigation and information you provide are clear .
While using Chalkmark is free , you ’ll still need to find people to perform the tests .
However , because they are online , the tests can be completed very quickly , and so recruiting users should be much easier than in traditional user testing .
9. Simple Mouse Tracking
Simple Mouse Tracking is another free tool to track a visitor ’s mouse movements and clicks on your site .
You ’ll need PHP on your server to run it , although the actual pages do n’t have to be PHP - based ; they just require a bit of JavaScript .
10 . Silverback
If you ’re using a Mac , then there ’s a great usability testing application called Silverback , which was created by the well - known design consulting firm Clearleft .
It comes in handy for conducting in - person user testing .
Instead of having to set up a bunch of cameras and recording equipment , you simply need to have a Mac with an iSight camera .
As in a traditional user test , you sit with the user in front of the computer and ask them to perform certain tasks , all while they say their thoughts aloud .
Silverback records a video of them and of what is happening on the screen .
The app also has some useful note - taking functionality and lets you set chapter markers ( using the Apple remote ) when something interesting occurs during a session .
The application costs $ 49.95 , which is a fair price for avoiding the hassle of setting up a user - testing environment .

By Kim RahnStaff ReporterActress Kim Bu-seon 's calls on national TV for marijuana use to be legalized are causing a public uproar .
In a pre-recorded interview on MBC 's live morning show on Friday , the 46 - year - old , who has advocated the legalization of the drug , said , ``Marijuana is not a narcotic ; it is technically an Oriental herbal medicine which Koreans have used for 5,000 years .'' Kim , who has been arrested for marijuana use several times , launched a campaign for the drug 's legalization in 2004 after being sentenced to a suspended jail term .
She then filed a petition with the Constitutional Court for a review of the constitutionality of the country 's marijuana - related laws .
In MBC interview , she took the opportunity to protest the recent arrest of actor Oh Gwang - rok on charges of marijuana use , saying his actions caused no harm and that the drug did not affect his ability to act .
`` Have you ever heard of any news that I committed a crime after smoking marijuana ?
I have never done anything harmful , as politicians or thieves have , " she said .
The actress also claimed that marijuana use can be beneficial to people with certain medical conditions .
`` If smoking it does n't do harm to others , those who do need it , such as those suffering from depression or cancer patients , should be allowed to use it .
Marijuana increases appetite and improves sleep , " she continued .
`` Korea has the highest ratio of death by suicide among OECD members .
The nation needs to take marijuana as a depression remedy and make depression patients come back to society .
" She also claimed that investigations into entertainers who smoke cannabis were politically motivated .
`` Whenever the government has troubles , it uses drug - taking entertainers to divert people 's attention .
It is the best way to make entertainers and artists obey the government , '' Kim said .
After the interview , the show 's host Shin Dong - ho said that he has a different opinion , but added that he would defend her right to speak out on her beliefs if she gets in trouble because of the remarks .
TV viewers and Internet users have attacked Kim and MBC over the comments .
A blogger identified as findsoul said , ``If marijuana is an Oriental medicine , is methamphetamine a Western medicine ?
It is not right to justify narcotics even though it is a minority opinion .
" Another called sinwoos2002 said , ``MBC , a public TV station , broadcast that marijuana could be helpful for society .
It is obviously quite a low - quality show .
" A number of people have demanded that MBC issue an apology for airing the controversial interview .
Warning : Long , technical post
One of the few remaining icky areas of the Nautilus codebase is the metadata store .
Its got some weird inefficient XML file format , the code is pretty nasty and its the data is not accessible to other apps .
Its been on my list of things to replace for quite some time , and yesterday I finally got rid of it .
The new system is actually pretty cool , both in the API to access is how it works internally .
So , I ’m gonna spend a few bits on explaining how it works .
Lets start with the requirements and then we can see how to fulfil these .
We want :
A generic per -file key - value store with string and string list values .
( String lists are required by Nautilus for e.g. emblems )
All apps should be able to access the store for both writing and reading .
Access , in particular read access , needs to be very efficient , even when used in typical I/O fashion ( lots of small calls intermixed with other file I/O ) .
Getting the metadata for a file should not be significantly more expensive than a stat syscall .
Removable media should be handled in a “ sane ” way , even if multiple volumes may be mounted in the same place .
We do n’t require transactional semantics for the database ( i.e. no need to guarantee that a returned metadata set is written to stable storage ) .
What we want is something I call “ desktop transaction semantics ” .
By this I means that in case of a crash , its fine to lose what you changed in the recent history .
However , things that were written a long time ago ( even if recently overwritten ) should not get lost .
You either get the “ old ” value or the “ new ” value , but you never ever get neither or a broken database .
By this I means that in case of a crash , its fine to lose what you changed in the recent history .
However , things that were written a long time ago ( even if recently overwritten ) should not get lost .
You either get the “ old ” value or the “ new ” value , but you never ever get neither or a broken database .
Homedirs on NFS should work , without risking database corruption if two logins with the same homedir write concurrently .
It is fine if doing so may lose some of these writes , as long as the database is not corrupted .
( NFS is still used in a lot of places like universities and enterprise corporations . )
Seems like a pretty tall order .
How would you do something like that ?
Performance
For performance reason its not a good idea to require IPC for reading data , as doing so can block things for a long time ( especially when data are contended , compare i.e. with how gconf reads are a performance issue on login ) .
To avoid this we steal an idea from dconf : all reads go through mmaped files .
These are opened once and the file format in them is designed to allow very fast lookups using a minimal amount of page faults .
This means that once things are in a steady state lookup is done without any syscalls at all , and is very fast .
Writes
Metadata writes are a handled by a single process that ensures that concurrent writes are serialized when writing to disk .
Clients talk to the metadata daemon via dbus .
The daemon is started automatically by dbus when first used , and it may exit when idle .
Desktop Transaction semantics
In order to give any consistancy guarantees for file writes fsync( ) is normally used .
However this is overkill and in some cases a serious system performance problem ( see the recent ext3/4 fsync discussion ) .
Even without the ext3 problem a fsync requires a disk spinup and rotation to guarantee some data on disk before we could return a metadata write call , which is quite costly ( on the order of several milliseconds at least ) .
In order to solve this I ’ve made the file format for a single database be in two files .
One file is the “ tree ” which contains a static , read only , metadata tree .
This file is replaced using the standard atomic replace model ( write to temp , fsync , rename over ) .
However , we rarely change this file , instead all writes go to another file , the “ journal ” .
As the name implies this is a journal oriented format where each new operation gets written at the end of the journal .
Each entry has a checksum so that we can validate the journal on read ( in case of crash ) and the journal is never fsynced .
After a timeout ( or when full ) the journal is “ rotated ” , i.e. we create a new “ tree ” file containing all the info from the journal and a new empty journal .
Once something is rotated into the “ tree ” it is generally safe for long term storage , but this slow operation happens rarely and not when a client is blocking for the result .
NFS homedirs
It turns out that this setup is mostly OK for the NFS homedir case too .
All we have to do is put the log file on a non-NFS location like / tmp so that multiple clients wo n’t scribble over each other .
Once a client rotates the journal it will be safely visible by every client in a safe fashion ( although some clients may lose recent writes in case of concurrent updates ) .
There is one detail with atomic replace on NFS that is problematic .
Due to the stateless nature of NFS an open file may be removed on the server by another client ( the server do n’t know you have the file open ) , which would later cause an error when we read from the file .
Fortunately we can workaround this by opening the database file in a specific way [ 1 ] .
Removable media
The current Nautilus metadata database uses a single tree based on pathnames to store metadata .
This becomes quite weird for removable media where the same path may be reused for multiple disks and where one disk can be mounted in different places .
Looking at the database it seems like all these files are merged into a single directory , causing various problems .
The new system uses multiple databases .
libudev is used to efficiently look up the filesystem UUID and label for as mount and if that is availible use that as the database id , storing paths relative to that mount .
We also have a standard database for your homedir ( not based on UUID etc , as the homedir often migrates between systems , etc ) and a fall - back “ root ” database for everything not matching the previous databases .
This means that we should seamlessly handle removable media as long as there are useful UUIDs or labels and have a somewhat ok fall - back otherwise .
Integration with platform
All this is pretty much invisible to applications .
Thanks to the gio / GVfs split and the extensible gio APIs things are automatically availible to all applications without using any new APIs once a new GVfs is installed .
Metadata can be gotten with the normal g_file_query_info( ) calls by requesting things from the “ metadata ” namespace .
Similar standard calls can be used to set metadata .
Also , the standard gio copy , move and remove operations automatically affect the metadata databases .
For instance , if you move a file its metadata will automatically move with it .
Here is an example :
$ touch / tmp / testfile $ gvfs - info - a " metadata : : * " / tmp/ testfile attributes : $ gvfs - set - attribute / tmp / testfile metadata :: some - key " A metadata value " $ gvfs - info - a " metadata : : * " / tmp/ testfile attributes : metadata:: some-key : A metadata value $ gvfs-copy / tmp/ testfile /tmp/testfile2 $ gvfs - info - a " metadata : : *" /tmp/testfile2 attributes : metadata:: some-key : A metadata value
Relation to Tracker
I think I have to mention this since the Tracker team want other developers to use Tracker as a data store for their applications , and I ’m instead creating my own database .
I ’ll try to explain my reasons and how I think these should cooperate .
First of all there are technical reasons why Tracker is not a good fit .
It uses sqlite which is not safe on NFS .
It uses a database , so each read operation is an IPC call that gets resolved to a database query , causing performance issues .
It is not impossible to make database use efficient , but it requires a different approach than how file I /O normally looks .
You need to do larger queries that does as much as possible in one operation , whereas we instead inject many small operations between the ordinary i/o calls ( after each stat when reading a directory of files , after each file copy , move or remove , etc ) .
Secondly , I do n’t feel good about storing the kind of metadata Nautilus uses in the Tracker database .
There are various vague problems here that all interact .
I do n’t like the mixing of user specified data like custom icons with auto - extracted or generated data .
The tracker database is a huge ( gigabytes ) complex database with information from lots of sources , mostly autogenerated .
This risks the data not being backed up .
Also , people having problems with tracker are prone to remove the databases and reindexing just to see if that “ fixes it ” , or due to database format changes on upgrades .
Also , the generic database model seems like overkill for the simple stuff we want to store , like icon positions and spatial window geometry .
Additionally , Tracker is a large dependency , and using it for metadata storage would make it a hard dependency for Nautilus to work at all ( to e.g. remember the position of the icons on the desktop ) .
Not everyone wants to use tracker at this point .
Some people may want to use another indexer , and some may not want to run Tracker for other reasons .
For instance , many people report that system performance when using Tracker suffer .
I ’m sure this is fixable , but at this point its imho not yet mature enought to force upon every Gnome user .
I do n’t want to be viewed like any kind of opponent of Tracker though .
I think it is an excellent project , and I ’m interested in using it , fixing issues it has and helping them work on it for integration with Nautilus and the new metadata store .
Tracker already indexes all kinds of information about files ( filename , filesize , mtime , etc ) so that you can do queries for these things .
Similarly it should extract metadata from the metadata store ( the size of this pales in comparison to the text indexes anyways , so no worries ) .
To facilitate this I want to work with the Tracker people to ensure tracker can efficiently index the metadata and get updates when metadata changes for a file .
Where to go from here
While some initial code has landed in git everything is not finished .
There are some lose ends in the metadata system itself , plus we need to add code to import the old nautilus metadata store into the new one .
We can also start using metadata in other places now .
For instance , the file selector could show emblems and custom icons , etc .
Footnotes
[ 1 ] Remove - safe opening a file on NFS :
Link the file to a temporary filename , open the temp file , unlink the tempfile .
Now the NFS client on you OS will “ magically ” rename the tempfile to .nfsXXXXX something and will track this fd to ensure this gets remove when the fd is closed .
Other clients removing the original file will not cause the .nfsXXXX link on the server to be removed .
Logan already gathered most of the relevant early details about the remarkable case of Shawna Forde , arrested yesterday for ordering the murder of a 9 - year - old girl and her father in Arizona .
My old friend Scott North , who has been around the block with reporting on the activities of the far right in Snohomish County -- where Forde is from -- reports this morning that Forde may have been involved in another violent home invasion in California already :
On Saturday , Arizona detectives were pursuing tips that members of Forde 's group may have staged a home invasion robbery in Shasta Lake , Calif . , on Monday .
The victims , friends of Forde 's mother , reported being robbed at gunpoint of nearly $ 12,000 by two men who showed up at the door and presented badges claiming they were U.S. Marshals .
Truck driver Peter Myers , 48 , said he recognized one of men who robbed him after he saw news reports about Forde 's arrest and photographs of her co-defendants .
He said the man who directed the robbery in his home was Jason Eugene Bush , 34 .
The ex-convict from Eastern Washington is a Forde associate now accused of being the gunman in the Arivaca killings .
" That is the guy .
He pointed a gun right at us , " Myers said .
*** Arizona officials have said Bush is recovering from a gunshot wound received during the home invasion there .
Myers said that description fits the tall man who bound him with zip ties and then took cash from the family 's lock box .
" He was moving real slow , " Meyers said .
Forde 's mother , Rena Caudle , said her daughter recently visited the area .
After Friday 's arrest , Caudle said she made certain that Arizona officials knew about the suspected link to the California robbery .
This may just be the tip of the iceberg with this gang .
Already Jim Gilchrist , the Minuteman leader with whom Forde has had a long association , is making the signs of the cross in her general direction and declaring he had nothing to do with her :
Jim Gilchrist , president of the California - based Minuteman Project and a longtime Forde ally , made it clear Saturday that his earlier support of Forde should in no way be construed as approving the actions now attributed to her .
" Am I going to come to her support at this time ?
Of course not .
How can I ? " Gilchrist said .
Forde ran her own organization , Gilchrist said .
" Unfortunately , some people in this Minutemen movement have used this movement to carry out sinister agendas , " he said .
We 'll see .
Investigators may not be done making arrests yet .
Indeed , it 's starting to look as though Forde may have been organizing basically a low - rent version of The Order : an ideological army turned into criminal moneymaking operation .
Only this time , anti-immigrant nativism instead of white supremacy is the ideological driver .
And when The Order crumbled in flames , it exposed all kinds of criminal dealings on the far right .
North reported yesterday on Forde 's background .
He also conducted a long interview ( see above ) in which she claimed to be an important figure in the Minuteman movement .
The problem , of course , is that you can't believe a word any of these people say :
Forde has a long and troubled history in Snohomish County , including juvenile convictions for felonies , prostitution and other street crime .
Some of her past was recounted by The Herald in a profile that appeared Feb. 22 .
Forde was at the center of a flurry of violence that began Dec. 22 when her ex-husband was shot in his Everett home .
A week later , she reported being beaten and raped by strangers at the same house .
On Jan. 15 , Forde was found in a north Everett alley with apparent gunshot wounds .
She claimed the violence was all retaliation for her activities targeting criminal groups operating on both sides of the border between Mexico and the U.S.
The cases here remain under investigation by Everett police .
Forde 's ex-husband was seriously wounded during the Dec. 22 shooting .
Reached Friday , he was distraught hearing that a child died .
He declined to comment on his former wife .
Forde 's mother , who lives in California , said she was not surprised to hear of her daughter 's arrest .
Rena Caudle said Forde visited her before heading to the border this year .
She talked of staging home invasions , Caudle said .
" She sat here and said that she was going to start a group where they went down and start taking things away from the Mexican mafia , " Caudle said .
" She was going to kick in their doors and take away the money and the drugs . "
Caudle said she was n't sure what to make of that at the time , in part because Forde has a history of exaggeration and lying .
Turns out , this time she was n't .
Now , back in October , I published an investigative piece on the Minutemen -- financed by The Nation Investigative Fund and published in The American Prospect -- which warned precisely of this kind of devolution of the Minuteman movement :
Welcome to the world of the Minutemen , where all - American values provide a nice storefront for a financial black hole that vacuums up hundreds of thousands of donors ' dollars .
The group fits into a long tradition of right - wing political organizing that runs from the resurrected Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s to the tax - protest movement of the 1980s and the militias of the 1990s .
In the end , these efforts are mostly scams :
They serve up a heady concoction of jingoistic fervor , bigoted xenophobia , and paranoid conspiracy theories as a means to salve all that ails the patriotic soul -- but largely they have the mysterious effect of separating their fellow right - wingers from their money .
And as these groups dissolve into scandal and infighting , they leave far more radical splinter groups in their wake .
...
Today the minuteman movement is beyond mere disarray ; it is in the early stages of complete decay .
The arc of the Minutemen 's decline and fall happens to trace almost precisely that of previous right - wing populist movements , notably the Klan of the 1920s and the militias of the 1990s .
The pattern goes like this :
The group is beset by financial manipulators who seem naturally drawn to them .
Then , following an initial wave of popularity , the group splinters under the pressure of competing egos into smaller , more virulent entities who then unleash acts of public ugliness and violence that eventually relegate them to the fringes .
The Minutemen have n't quite reached that final stage yet , but they are well on their way .
And while that may be welcome news to those who oppose the Minutemen 's nativist agenda , that last stage represents some natural and equally toxic consequences .
The broken promises and vicious infighting have meant , unsurprisingly , that the Minutemen 's original mission --- watching the border -- has receded to the background .
In 2007 , the MCDC claimed some 2,000 volunteers at various border watches , though the on - scene reports indicated far fewer participants .
In 2008 , the activity dropped further , so that the annual April border watch attracted only a few dozen participants and no media coverage .
The Minuteman movement has fallen on such hard times that even Gilchrist has publicly admitted that he regrets the " Saddam Hussein mentality " within its ranks , particularly some of its smaller , independent offshoots .
" Am I happy at the outcome of this whole movement ?
I am very , very sad , very disappointed , " Gilchrist told The Orange County Register in June .
His concern may have been disingenuous , but it was far from groundless .
Over the past year , several incidents of violence have been associated with various subfactions of the Minutemen .
Last summer , a couple of Minutemen created a video portraying the shooting of border - crossers -- which they later admitted was a hoax but decidedly a reflection of their real attitudes .
The men were in a group that had spun off from the San Diego Minutemen , itself an independent offshoot of the movement .
Considering that the Minutemen were largely built on the sort of nativist appeals long favored by racist organizations , it 's no surprise that racist and white - supremacist elements have been entwined with the movement since its inception .
Gilchrist and Simcox both made loud noises about weeding out racist members , though in reality their " background checks " were mostly shams and covert white supremacists were silently tolerated .
But even the stigma against overt racism appears to be disappearing among their organizations ' successors .
One border - watch group , headed by a former Minuteman Project official named Laine Lawless , went so far as to indulge in an e-mail exchange with a neo -Nazi organization offering tips on how to harass Latinos the old - fashioned way : steal from them , beat them up , mistreat their children , make death threats .
This behavior has started to infect the main Minutemen organizations themselves .
The MMP 's official Las Vegas chapter , Americans4America , recently co-hosted an anti-immigration strategy session with officials from the white - supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens .
It 's all part of the downward spiral of violence into which right - wing populist vigilante groups eventually descend .
Now , I 'm not claiming that spotting this in advance makes me particularly smart .
In fact , it is n't rocket science .
These groups have a long record of matching histories , and they all follow the same arc of flight .
I 'm just paying attention .
Gossiping good for women ’s health
Men might argue that the last thing women need is another reason to gossip but scientists have discovered that it could be good for their health .
The research reveals a woman is happier and healthier if she enjoys a regular chat with her female friend because it boosts levels of progesterone , a hormone shown to reduces levels of anxiety and stress .
Scientists at the University of Michigan , who carried out the study , said progesterone plays an important part in social bonding and also makes women more willing to help other people in trouble , even if it means risking their own lives in the process .
“ Many of the hormones involved in bonding and helping behaviour lead to reductions in stress and anxiety , ” said Professor Stephanie Brown , who led the research .
“ Now we see that higher levels of progesterone may be part of the underlying basis of these effects . ”
Progesterone is a hormone produced by the ovaries in women .
Among other things , it prepares the womb for pregnancy , fights infection and stops the over - production of oestrogen that could raise the risk of cancer .
Scientists already knew higher levels of progesterone increased a woman ’s desire to bond with others .
But the latest research , published in the journal Hormones and Behaviour , is the first to show gossiping and chatting can actually stimulate its production .
Researchers recruited 160 female students and took saliva samples to check their levels of progesterone .
They were then put in pairs .
Half were given questions to ask each other designed to bring them closer together .
These included “ Given the choice of anyone in the world , whom would you want as a dinner guest ? ” and “ What has been your greatest accomplishment ? ”
The other pairs were asked to proofread a research paper on botany together .
After 20 minutes , the volunteers had their hormone levels checked again .
The students who got to know each other through ‘ chatty ’ questions saw progesterone levels either stay the same or increase .
In the other group , progesterone actually declined .
Professor Brown added : “ It ’s important to find the links between biological mechanisms and human social behaviour .
These links help us understand why people in close relationships are happier , healthier and live longer than those who are socially isolated . ”

Deep - diving Carbon Explorer floats continuously collected data for over a year , straight through the Antarctic winter , following the SOFeX iron- fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean .
Analysis reveals that most of the carbon from lush plankton blooms , whether artificially fertilized or natural , never reaches the deep ocean .
BERKELEY , CA – Oceanographers Jim Bishop and Todd Wood of the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have measured the fate of carbon particles originating in plankton blooms in the Southern Ocean , using data that deep - diving Carbon Explorer floats collected around the clock for well over a year .
Their study reveals that most of the carbon from lush plankton blooms never reaches the deep ocean .
The surprising discovery deals a blow to the simplest version of the Iron Hypothesis , whose adherents believe global warming can be slowed or even reversed by fertilizing plankton with iron in regions that are iron - poor but rich in other nutrients like nitrogen , silicon , and phosphorus .
The Southern Ocean is one of the most important such regions .
“ Just adding iron to the ocean has n’t been demonstrated as a good plan for storing atmospheric carbon , ” says Bishop , a member of Berkeley Lab ’s Earth Sciences Division and a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California at Berkeley .
“ What counts is the carbon that reaches the deep sea , and a lot of the carbon tied up in plankton blooms appears not to sink very fast or very far . ”
The reasons , while complex , are most likely due to the seasonal feeding behavior of planktonic animal life , and specifically to the effects of the dark Antarctic winter on plant and animal growth and the mixing of surface and deep waters by winter storms .
Phytoplankton blooms in the spring may indicate that much of the zooplankton ( animal ) population essential for carbon sedimentation has starved during the winter .
The Carbon Explorers involved in the study were launched in January , 2002 , as part of the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment ( SOFeX ) , a collaboration led by scientists from Moss Landing Marine Laboratory and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute .
SOFeX was meant to test the Iron Hypothesis in waters between New Zealand and Antarctica during the Antarctic summer .
The Berkeley Lab Carbon Explorers were originally intended to monitor the iron-fertilization experiment for 60 days , but they continued to report by satellite throughout the Antarctic fall and winter and on into the following year .
“ We would never have made these surprising observations if the autonomous Carbon Explorer floats had n’t been recording data 24 hours a day , seven days a week , at depths down to 800 meters or more , for over a year after the experiment ’s original iron signature had disappeared , ” Bishop says .
He explains that “ assumptions about the biological pump – the way ocean life circulates carbon – are mostly based on averaging measurements that have been made from ships , at intervals widely separated in time .
Cost , not to mention the environment , would have made continuous ship - based observations impossible in this case .
Luckily one Carbon Explorer float costs only about as much as a single day of ship time . ”
Bishop and Wood report their results in a forthcoming issue of the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles .

The Iron Hypothesis , science and speculation
In the 1980s , oceanographer John Martin of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories , who died in 1993 , proposed that iron added to regions of the ocean that are otherwise rich in nutrients but poor in iron ( so - called high - nutrient , low - chlorophyl , or HNLC , regions ) can stimulate the growth of phytoplankton – a bold scientific hypothesis that has since been proven correct .
Martin went further , however , when he suggested that artificial iron fertilization of the oceans could change the climate .
“ Give me half a tankerful of iron and I ’ll give you an Ice Age , ” he boasted in 1988 .
In testing the Iron Hypothesis , SOFeX ’s investigators acknowledged that matters were not quite that simple , and that the crucial question was not whether plankton blooms could be induced but whether the carbon they captured was removed to the deep sea .
The SOFeX research vessels fertilized and measured two regions of ocean , one in an HNLC region at latitude 55 degrees south and another at 66 degrees south .
Carbon Explorers were launched at both these sites ; a third Carbon Explorer was launched well outside the iron - fertilized region at 55 °S as a control .
Berkeley Lab scientists Todd Wood , Christopher Guay , and Phoebe Lam were members of the expedition , while Bishop monitored and communicated with the Carbon Explorers from Berkeley over a computer link to communications satellites .
One question was whether the relatively silicate - poor waters of the more northerly 55° region would allow plankton known as diatoms to form silicon skeletons .
If large diatoms could not grow in this HNLC region , the SOFeX researchers theorized , enhanced carbon sinking would not occur .
Partly for this reason , most of the effort by the ships was at 66 °S , where silicon was n’t considered a limiting factor .
To the researchers ’ surprise , the iron- augmented region at 55 °N did form a vigorous plankton bloom .
Dubbed the North Patch , Carbon Explorers tracked this bloom throughout the Antarctic summer , measuring carbon particles , including waste from grazing zooplankton and other aggregates , sinking beneath the bloom and carrying 10 to 20 percent of the fixed carbon out of the surface layer – at least to below 100 meters .
The initial results of the SOFeX experiment , published in Science in April , 2004 , seemed to support the Iron Hypothesis in an unexpected way .
But the Carbon Explorers did n’t stop after 60 days .
The two North Patch floats operated for over 14 months , diving , recording , and surfacing to report data in the world ’s stormiest waters , traveling almost to South America before falling silent .
The Carbon Explorer launched at 66° south lasted 18 months , spending much of its first winter recording at 800 meters depth and surfacing at weekly intervals to report , although occasionally prevented by bumping into the underside of the sea ice .
The Carbon Explorer data accumulated , awaiting analysis .
Return to the Southern Ocean
In 2007 Bishop and Lam ( who was now at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ) published measurements from shipboard instruments deployed during SOFeX which suggested that the rosy picture of plankton blooms sending carbon to the deep ocean was n’t so simple after all .
Carbon reaching the deep ocean depended partly on particle size and weight ; more important , there seemed to be much less particulate matter reaching depth where the biomass was highest , e.g. , in plankton blooms .
“ This paper was criticized on the grounds that it was based on limited shipboard observations , ” says Bishop .
“ So Todd Wood and I turned to the treasure - trove of virtually continuous observations in the records of the Carbon Explorers . ”
The Carbon Explorers ’ records through the Antarctic summer and fall of 2002 and the winter and spring of 2003 ( and in the case of the float at 66° south , much longer ) not only confirmed the limited shipboard observations in greater detail but opened up a complex picture of life in the Southern Ocean .
The Carbon Explorer at 66 °S recorded data never before observed or reported .
During the SOFeX experiment , the float had measured the demise of a plankton bloom rich in particulate organic carbon .
Particulate carbon levels were severely reduced with the onset of perpetual darkness and sea ice formation , then modestly increased again with the return of light and the melting of the ice .
Strong sedimentation – the sinking of large numbers of carbon particles to the deep ocean – was never observed .
Data from the two floats deployed farther north at 55 °S produced a startling picture .
As noted above , the Explorer launched inside the original SOFeX iron - amended region , dubbed 55A , had recorded a long - lasting bloom immediately following iron fertilization , with sedimentation to 100 meters .
Remarkably , 55A found an equally strong bloom the next spring in the same region – long after the SOFeX iron was gone – with equally strong sedimentation down to 100 meters .
And while it was unsurprising that the original control float , dubbed 55 C , did not see a bloom , a bigger surprise came at depth : a rain of particulate organic carbon at 800 meters down .
Carbon Explorer 55C had measured sedimentation beneath a region with no plankton bloom much greater than the 55A float measured under the bloom itself .
To explain this counterintuitive “ High Biomass , Low Export ” result the researchers considered a number of ideas .
Perhaps current shears had separated the plankton blooms from their sedimentation ; or perhaps there were “ large rare particles ” of organic carbon that the Carbon Explorers had failed to observe ; or perhaps differences in mixing of surface and deep waters during winter storms had brought sequestered iron back to the surface .
The first two hypotheses were rejected , and the third , even if true , would imply that iron - stimulated blooms still lead to reduced carbon sedimentation at kilometer depths .
A fourth hypothesis , taking into account the lighting conditions that encourage or limit the growth of microscopic plants and zooplankton , emerged as the most convincing .
Latitude 55 °S is far enough north for light to reach into the water year round ( although in winter it is much reduced ) .
But mixing between near - surface and deeper waters can carry phytoplankton too deep to grow – out of the light , beneath the critical depth where growth is sufficient to meet the energy demands of the whole plant and animal community .
The latitudes where the Explorers operated are infamously stormy ; in wintertime the mixed layer can reach 400 or 500 meters deep .
To survive the winter , zooplankton have to stay deep , where it ’s too dark for the phytoplankton they live on to survive .
Storms and deep mixing keep the zooplankton alive .
“ Mixing is the dumbwaiter that brings food down , ” says Bishop .
“ The question is whether the dumbwaiter is empty or full . ”
When mixing is consistently below the critical level , phytoplankton are carried out of the light and can’t grow ; the dumbwaiter stays empty and the zooplankton starve .
When mixing stops in the spring , the fast growing phytoplankton rebound , but there are n’t enough survivors in the zooplankton population to keep up with the growth and resulting bloom .
Sinking carbon particles may be abundant at 100 meters down , but the starving animals intercept all the material they can reach as it falls between 100 and 800 meters , explaining why Carbon Explorer 55A observed a low carbon export to the deep ocean beneath the lush bloom .
Continual deep mixing can starve zooplankton , but if the mixing is regularly interrupted , more phytoplankton grow during the winter to supply the zooplankton lurking at depth .
In the region where Carbon Explorer 55 C spent the winter , storms were intermittent and mixing below 400 meters was interrupted on a daily basis .
When phytoplankton growth began in the spring , the healthy zooplankton were there to “ mow the lawn , ” as it were – probably accounting for the modest phytoplankton growth near the surface , with increased carbon sedimentation from the zooplankton .
Bishop says these observations point to an important lesson : “ Iron is not the only factor that determines phytoplankton growth in HNLC regions .
Light , mixing , and hungry zooplankton are fundamentally as important as iron . ”
The Iron Hypothesis is n’t wrong , but it ’s much more subtle than usually stated .
Achieving optimum carbon sedimentation from plankton growth may require the right “ recipe ” of iron and other trace nutrients to grow the right kind of phytoplankton .
Says Bishop , “ You can grow a lot of Brussels sprouts , but kids wo n’t eat it .
The same appears to be the case with diatom phytoplankton and zooplankton .
It ’s the zooplankton community that determines carbon sedimentation . ”
The new study brings one other important lesson : two Carbon Explorers deployed under similar circumstances experienced subtle differences in ocean physical conditions that resulted in very distinct biological responses .
A fleet of Carbon Explorers could yield essential data on the workings of the ocean ’s biological pump at far less cost than a shipborne expedition , and answer questions that cannot be answered now – such as how much man-made atmospheric carbon the ocean can absorb , and how much longer we can depend on it to soak up our excesses – and most important , how the biological carbon pump will respond to changing ocean conditions .
“ Year - round observations of carbon biomass and flux variability in the Southern Ocean , ” by James K. B. Bishop and Todd J. Wood , will appear in Global Biogeochemical Cycles .

If you think you face an uphill challenge at work today , spare a thought for Farah Ahmed Omar , the man in charge of Somalia 's navy .
He has neither boats nor equipment and admits he has not been to sea for 23 years .
The interim government does not control much of the 3,000 - km ( 1,860 - mile ) Somali coastline and then there is the headache of plentiful pirates .
Mr Omar said he was first put in charge of the navy in 1982 , but speaking to the BBC by phone from the capital , Mogadishu , he did not sound too daunted by the task ahead .
" Today there is a big piracy problem and we are ashamed .
But we think they [ the pirates ] do n't have sophisticated equipment as they just have fishing boats and small arms which are easy to get in Somalia , " he said .
Somalia 's navy chief said 500 new recruits had recently joined after adverts were aired through radio stations and the men would be paid $ 60 ( £ 36 ) per month .
Presumably the training will be classroom - based , given the situation at sea .
We used to be among the top navies in Africa , with ships carrying deadly missiles and 10 battalions covering the coast
Farah Ahmed Omar
Chasing the piracy money trail Royal Navy blows up pirate boat
The country has been without an effective central government for the best part of two decades , since the ousting of Siad Barre .
And this power vacuum has allowed the pirates to flourish as they demand multimillion dollar ransoms from passing ships .
More than 20 international vessels - operating under US , EU and Nato commands - patrol the seas off Somalia in an attempt to protect the vital shipping route .
The interim government seems to think it could do a better job , provided it was given a helping hand .
Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said on a recent trip to Nairobi : " If 5 % of the money being spent on the warships guarding those waters could be spent on building a security force that deals with the piracy , this could be much more effective because these guys have bases on the land and the best way to deal with them is to deny them a safe haven there . "
It is widely accepted that patrols at sea are not enough and the key to ending piracy is on land by targeting the pirates ' bases .
The prime minister appeared to be ignoring the fact that government troops are far from welcome at those bases , such as Harardhere , to the north of Mogadishu .
Another notorious pirates ' lair , Eyl , is in Puntland , which has broken away from Somalia altogether .
Coastguard ' turncoats '
But the international community may be smarting from previous mistakes and reluctant to turn on the funding taps .
" Previous efforts at security sector reform have seen money disappear into a black hole as there was no accountability , " says Rashid Abdi , a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group .
" Plus there is evidence that some of the people trained to tackle piracy as coastguards in Puntland ended up working as pirates themselves . "
Once upon a time Somalia had a proud navy which the Soviet Union had helped establish in the 1960s , with bases at Mogadishu and Kismayo .
During the Cold War the Soviets turned the port of Berbera into an important base that included a missile storage facility for the Soviet navy to counter United States military activities in the region .
But it was not just Russian assistance that helped build the Somali navy back then .
' Give us one year '
When Somalia cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1977 ( because of Russian support for Somalia 's arch rival Ethiopia ) , Mogadishu signed a deal with Washington three years later .
It gave the US access to Somali ports and airfields in exchange for tens of millions of dollars in military equipment and aid in subsequent years .
Help or hindrance ?
Some say foreign patrols have done little to deter pirates " We used to be among the top navies in Africa .
We had ships that carried deadly missiles and we had 10 battalions covering the whole coast , " said Mr Omar .
The navy has not been operational since the country descended into violence in 1991 , but its commander predicts a Somali naval renaissance .
" The international community should give us one year and let them see what we are going to do , " he said .
" I can promise on behalf of the government that I will eradicate piracy within that period if only they give us the resources and support in terms of equipment .
" That way the international community could be relieved of the burden . "
Mr Omar has certainly had time on his hands whilst the navy has been boat - less and sailor - less .
He set up his own university and has also been a professor of economics .
Perhaps a lecture on the economic cost of choosing to be a sailor on $ 60 a month , rather than a potentially rich pirate will be part of the training .

BLANDING —
The remnants of a people who lived in the cliffs surrounding this small southeastern
Utah town are not hard to find here .
Stumbling across pieces of pots and arrowheads is commonplace , locals say .
So , too , is keeping them .
With the federal indictment of 24 people , most of them from Blanding , accused of taking ancient American Indian artifacts from public lands in the Four Corners area , people here say officials have made much ado about nothing .
" A majority of homes probably do have artifacts , " said Holly Shumway , whose in - laws were among those indicted .
" I do n't know how they pick and choose the few that got arrested .
It 's just so common in this town to have things like that .
It 's not like just those 24 people have been doing this .
These people have just been doing what everyone does . "
Mitch Barnett , a Blanding resident , recalls his grandfather receiving Anasazi blankets as pay for work he did .
" Nobody thought it was a big deal , " he said .
Sandy Strom , whose husband , Aubry Patterson , is accused of stealing artifacts from caves in the La Sal Mountains and selling them to an undercover dealer , said she has a display case full of American Indian artifacts .
Otherwise , they would just be on the ground , she said .
" We were n't out grave - robbing , " Strom said outside a Moab courthouse .
It 's a sentiment shared among a number of people in the area .
" That 's the word I just can't stand : stealing , " Shumway said .
" Anyone can walk out their back door and probably find something .
Most of the houses in this town are built on old Indian ruins .
It 's everywhere .
It 's not like these people are going into someone 's home or a museum and taking these artifacts .
They 're just outside on the ground . "
But items taken from federal land could mean up to 10 years in prison for the " collectors . "
The crime is not about property being destroyed , said Blanding archaeologist Winston Hurst , it 's about preserving a priceless record of history .
" It 's not about who gets to own something , " Hurst said .
" It 's about the archaeological record .
It 's the only record we have of the huge majority of people who have ever lived .
It 's tremendously fragile , and it 's being looted on a worldwide scale .
They rip the guts out and leave us with nothing but objects to sell on eBay . "
Whether it 's pocketing an arrowhead or pillaging a ruin , " the net effect is , it all destroys evidence , " said the Bureau of Land Management 's Canyon Country district manager Shelley Smith .
" It 's a chronic problem " that strips artifacts of their context and value , she said .
In Blanding , the indictments and news reports have made " nice people " out to be " hardened criminals , " Shumway said .
Among those indicted :
David Lacy , 55 , who is a " great school teacher " and wrestling coach , Shumway said .
Harold Lyman , 78 , director of the San Juan Visitor Center , who was recently inducted into the Utah Tourism Hall of Fame for his role in creating the " Trail of the Ancients , " a scenic byway centered around the area 's American Indian heritage .
James Redd , 60 , the town 's longtime doctor .
He was found dead Thursday near his home outside Blanding .
Details of the death were not immediately released by authorities , but word was spreading quickly in the community about his passing .
" The federal government has so many things to worry about right now , " Shumway said .
" Our economy is in a crisis , and our government is in such a huge slump right now .
And this is what they choose to spend their money on right now — not drug dealers , not gang members , not people who are actually hurting their communities . "
Hurst lauded the efforts of law enforcement officers Thursday , just as he worried about the longterm impact the indictments might have on a community that does n't see the removal of artifacts from public land as a crime .
" Whenever we have one of these situations , that tends to stir up distrust , " he said .
" It closes their minds , so it becomes a cultural war . "
While he believed the indictments would discourage some looters , Hurst wondered if it was " the winning of a battle of questionable value . "
" Time will tell , " he said .
" I hope that 's not the case . "

Apple Slow To Fix Java Flaws
Instructions showing wannabe Mac - hackers a way to remotely take control over OS X systems through an unpatched security hole have been posted online .
The researcher who published the blueprints said he did so to nudge Apple into fixing the problem , which the company has known about for more than six months .
But Security
Fix has found that half a year is about the average time it takes Cupertino to plug these types of holes .
On Tuesday , renowned Apple researcher Landon Fuller published a proof - of - concept exploit for a particularly dangerous bug in Java that Sun Microsystems fixed in a patch released Dec. 3 , 2008 .
However , Apple -- which ships its own version of Sun 's Java with OS X -- has yet to push out an update to fix that particular flaw .
" Unfortunately , it seems that many Mac OS X security issues are ignored if the severity of the issue is not adequately demonstrated , " Fuller wrote on his blog .
" Due to the fact that an exploit for this issue is available in the wild , and the vulnerability has been public knowledge for six months , I have decided to release a my own proof of concept to demonstrate the issue . "
Six months may seem like a long time to address a particularly dangerous vulnerability , but it 's about par for the course with Apple and its record on patching Java flaws .
I have reviewed the last three Java updates that Apple shipped during the past 18 months , and found that Apple patched Java flaws on average about 166 days after Sun had shipped its own patch to fix the same vulnerabilities .
I put together a rudimentary chart comparing Sun and Apple 's Java patch times for the last three Java for Mac releases , available here :
HTML Version
Microsoft Excel version
Fuller 's blog includes some workarounds that Mac users can take to mitigate any threat from this vulnerability , until Apple issues a patch .
Researcher Julien Tinnes also has an extended discussion about the dangers of this vulnerability , and a decent back - and - forth between readers , over at at his blog .
Please join me today at 11 a.m. ET for Security Fix Live , where I will endeavor to answer your questions on all things security , tech and privacy related .
Drop by then , or send me a question in advance .

A reader writes , " Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore gave a speech this week that appears to suggest a surprising shift in Canadian policy on copyright .
Moore talked about the great opportunities presented by the Internet and how many older politicians do n't understand these opportunities . "
For context , this is the same government that recently tried to ram through a super - restrictive version of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act , refusing to meet with Canadian artists , filmmakers , academics , librarians or user - rights groups .
As Michael Geist says , " Last year 's experience with Bill C - 61 left thousands of Canadians deeply disappointed with government on copyright policy .
Yesterday 's remarks signal an important shift with both Clement and Moore clearly committed to more open consultation and to the development of a balanced copyright bill that better reflects the real - world realities of new technologies , innovation , new creators , and the reasonable expectations of Canadian consumers . "
The old way of doing things is over .
These things are all now one .
And it 's great .
And it 's never been better .
And we need to be enthusiastic and embrace these things .
I point out the average age of a member of parliament because do n't assume that those who are making the decisions and who are driving the debate understand all the dynamics that are at play here .
Do n't assume that everybody understands the opportunities that are at play here and how great this can be for Canada .
Tony is doing his job and I 'm going to do my job and be a cheerleader and push this and to fight for the right balance as we go forward .
The opportunities are unbelievable and unparalleled in human history .

I ’m having a hard time understanding what all this is going to mean :

The South Florida doctor who wrote Manny Ramirez a prescription for the female fertility drug that resulted in the All - Star outfielder ’s 50 - game suspension is under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Major League Baseball President Bob DuPuy said on Thursday that baseball is aware of the investigation and is working with the DEA .
Pedro Publio Bosch , 71 , is the Coral Gables doctor at the center of the federal inquiry , according to a source familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to discuss it .
Bosch ’s son , Anthony Bosch , 45 , is believed to have worked as a contact between the doctor and Ramirez .
Agents and former players in the large but tightknit South Florida baseball community say Anthony Bosch frequently attended parties and other social events hosted by big league players .

The DEA is looking to see if the source of Ramirez ’s prescription illegally procured prescriptions for others , a source told The Times .
Pedro Bosch did not immediately respond to a message left for him at his office and home .
Ramirez , who was preparing himself for his return to the Dodgers ’ lineup with the team ’s triple - A affiliate in Albuquerque , did not speak to reporters on Thursday .
Word of the probe was first reported by ESPN.com .

A federal law enforcement official also familiar with the probe confirmed that the DEA has opened a preliminary investigation into the elder Bosch , but said it was “ a little premature ” to call it a full - scale formal investigation .
“ There are some administrative steps that you go through in order to determine if we are actually going to open an investigation .
We are just gathering some things to see if an investigation should be opened , ” said the federal official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
One step taken so far is that authorities have issued administrative subpoenas , asking for the doctor ’s records , the official said .
“ We have n’t even begun to do an investigation so we do n’t know which [ DEA ] office would get involved .
Just because the doctor is in Miami does n’t mean they would be the ones to get involved , ” said the official .
“ We do n’t even know what we have yet . ”

Baseball suspended Ramirez on May 7 based on his prescription for HCG .
However , the drug test that Ramirez took in spring training found no trace of the banned substance in his system .
Ramirez ’s test was flagged for having an unusually high level of synthetic testosterone , which anti-doping experts said was likely an indication of steroid use .
Ramirez was prepared to appeal the test results , but baseball officials obtained his medical records and discovered the prescription for HCG .
Baseball suspended Ramirez for “ just cause ” based on “ non-analytical evidence ” and for which a “ therapeutic use ” exemption was available but never requested .
The outfielder has refused to say whether he used steroids or offer any details of what led to his suspension .

Ramirez is eligible to return to the Dodgers on July 3 , for which he is preparing himself by playing in the minor leagues .
The first two games of his warmup tour drew standing - room - only crowds to Isotopes Park in Albuquerque , home of the Dodgers ’ triple - A affiliate .
He did n’t play on Thursday because the field was hit by heavy rains .
Ramirez avoided reporters on Thursday , asking the Isotopes to limit pregame media access to the clubhouse .
Ramirez is expected to return to Los Angeles today .
He is scheduled to play for Class - A Inland Empire in Lake Elsinore on Saturday and in San Bernardino from Sunday through Tuesday .
Sun-Sentinel staff writer Bob LaMendola and Times staff writers Kevin Baxter and Bill Shaikin contributed to this report .

Course Summary
Computers , computing , and many things enabled by them are all around us .
Some of this is highly visible , like personal computers and the Internet ; much is invisible , like the computers in gadgets and appliances and cars , or the programs that fly our planes and keep our telephones and power systems and medical equipment working , or the myriad systems that quietly collect and share personal data about us .
Even though most people will not be directly involved with creating such systems , everyone is strongly affected by them .
COS 109 is intended to provide a broad , if rather high level , understanding of how computer hardware , software , networks , and systems operate .
Topics will be motivated by current issues and events , and will include discussion of how computers work ; what programming is and why it is hard ; how the Internet and the Web operate ; and how all of these affect security , privacy , property and other issues .
We will also touch on fundamental ideas from computer science , and some of the inherent limitations of computers .
This course is meant for humanities and social sciences students who want to understand how computing works and how it affects the world they live in .
No prior experience with computers is assumed , and there are no prerequisites .
COS 109 satisfies the QR requirement .
The labs are complementary to the classroom work , though intended to reinforce the basic ideas .
They will cover a spectrum of practical applications ; two of the labs are a gentle introduction to programming in Javascript .
The course will have fundamentally the same structure as in previous years , but lectures , case studies and examples change every year according to what 's happening .
Ubiquitous cameras and sites like MySpace and YouTube expose more and more of our private lives , and Viacom 's suit against Google and YouTube threatens to expose more .
Microsoft and Google are duking it out with each other and with a variety of governments .
Skirmishes in the forever war between students and the RIAA / MPAA affect Princeton students all the time .
The careless and the clueless continue to do bad things with technology .
Oh , yes -- it 's an election year and everyone uses computers to vote .
What could possibly go wrong ?

Lectures :
Regular class attendance is expected and class participation helps .
Frequent absences are grounds for a failing grade regardless of other performance .
I wo n't prohibit the use of laptops in class , but I would be grateful if you could use them primarily for course - related activities like following the notes , rather than for email , chat , YouTube , Twitter , Google , solitaire , poker , eBay , Facebook , or similarly compelling distractions .
( Additions to this list are welcome ; I can't keep up . )
There will be eight labs to give hands - on practice in important aspects of computing .
The labs are designed to be easily completed within three hours , if you have read through the instructions beforehand , which should take at most an hour .
Undergrad lab assistants will be available to help out during scheduled lab sections .
Labs are held in the Friend Center ; they can be done in dorm rooms or campus clusters , but there will be lab assistants in Friend , and no help elsewhere .
Labs are together worth about 20 percent of the course grade .
To receive credit , students must complete labs by midnight Friday of the week they are assigned , unless there are extraordinary circumstances .
Labs start the week of September 22 .
There will be no labs in the week before fall break , Thanksgiving week , or the last week of classes .
Lab sessions are PROBABLY Monday through Friday at 1:30 and 7:30 in the basement of Friend .
Eight weekly problem sets , together worth about 20 percent of the course grade , will be assigned .
Problems are intended to be straightforward , reinforcing material covered in class and providing practice in quantitative reasoning , and should take 1 - 2 hours to complete .
Problem set solutions will be due by 5:00 PM Wednesday , one week after they are assigned .
Turn in solutions in the box outside room 311 on the third floor of the CS building , or at the beginning of class .
There will be no problem set due in the week before Fall break ( midterm instead ) or the last week of the term .
No credit can be given for late submissions unless there are extraordinary circumstances , and in no case after solutions have been discussed in class .
For both labs and problem sets , extracurricular activities and heavy workloads in other classes do n't count as " extraordinary " , no matter how unexpected or important or time - consuming .
And I am unsympathetic to the appeal that " this is my fifth class , " since the same could be said of any one of the others .
Nevertheless , everyone gets truly behind from time to time .
In recognition of this , you are allowed two late submissions ( no more than 4 days late in each case ) .
Please let us know ahead of time that you will be submitting late so we can keep track .
Is it true that the foods and beverages you consume cause your blood to become more alkaline or acidic ?
Contrary to popular hype , the answer is : not to any significant degree .
The pH of your blood is tightly regulated by a complex system of buffers that are continuously at work to maintain a range of 7.35 to 7.45 , which is slightly more alkaline than pure water .
If the pH of your blood falls below 7.35 , the result is a condition called acidosis , a state that leads to central nervous system depression .
Severe acidosis - where blood pH falls below 7.00 - can lead to a coma and even death .
If the pH of your blood rises above 7.45 , the result is alkalosis .
Severe alkalosis can also lead to death , but through a different mechanism ; alkalosis causes all of the nerves in your body to become hypersensitive and over - excitable , often resulting in muscle spasms , nervousness , and convulsions ; it 's usually the convulsions that cause death in severe cases .
The bottom line is that if you 're breathing and going about your daily activities , your body is doing an adequate job of keeping your blood pH somewhere between 7.35 to 7.45 , and the foods that you are eating are not causing any wild deviations of your blood pH .
So what 's up with all the hype about the need to alkalize your body ?
And what 's to be made of the claim that being too acidic can cause osteoporosis , kidney stones , and a number of other undesirable health challenges ?
As usual , the answers to such questions about human health can be found in understanding basic principles of human physiology .
So let 's take a look at the fundamentals of pH and how your body regulates the acid - alkaline balance of its fluids on a moment - to - moment basis .
pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a liquid is .
With respect to your health , the liquids involved are your body fluids , which can be categorized into two main groups :
Intracellular fluid , which is the fluid found in all of your cells .
Intracellular fluid is often called cytosol , and makes up about two - thirds of the total amount of fluid in your body .
Extracellular fluid , which is the fluid found outside of your cells .
Extracellular fluids are further classified as one of two types : Plasma , which is fluid that makes up your blood .
Interstitial fluid , which occupies all of the spaces that surround your tissues .
Interstitial fluid includes the fluids found in your eyes , lymphatic system , joints , nervous system , and between the protective membranes that surround your cardiovascular , respiratory , and abdominal cavities .
Your blood ( plasma ) needs to maintain a pH of 7.35 to 7.45 for your cells to function properly .
Why your cells require your blood to maintain a pH in this range to stay healthy is beyond the scope of this article , but the most important reason is that all of the proteins that work in your body have to maintain a specific geometric shape to function , and the three - dimensional shapes of the proteins in your body are affected by the tiniest changes in the pH of your body fluids .
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14 .
A liquid that has a pH of 7 is considered to be neutral ( pure water is generally considered to have a neutral pH ) .
Fluids that have a pH below 7 - like lemon juice and coffee - are considered to be acidic .
And fluids that have a pH above 7 - like human blood and milk of magnesia - are considered to be alkaline .
It 's important to note that on the pH scale , each number represents a tenfold difference from adjacent numbers ; in other words , a liquid that has a pH of 6 is ten times more acidic than a liquid that has a pH of 7 , and a liquid with a pH of 5 is one hundred times more acidic than pure water .
Most carbonated soft drinks ( pop ) have a pH of about 3 , making them about ten thousand times more acidic than pure water .
Please remember this the next time you think about drinking a can of pop .
When you ingest foods and liquids , the end products of digestion and assimilation of nutrients often results in an acid or alkaline - forming effect - the end products are sometimes called acid ash or alkaline ash .
Also , as your cells produce energy on a continual basis , a number of different acids are formed and released into your body fluids .
These acids - generated by your everyday metabolic activities - are unavoidable ; as long as your body has to generate energy to survive , it will produce a continuous supply of acids .
So there are two main forces at work on a daily basis that can disrupt the pH of your body fluids - these forces are the acid or alkaline - forming effects of foods and liquids that you ingest , and the acids that you generate through regular metabolic activities .
Fortunately , your body has three major mechanisms at work at all times to prevent these forces from shifting the pH of your blood outside of the 7.35 to 7.45 range .
These mechanisms are :
Buffer Systems Carbonic Acid-Bicarbonate Buffer System
Protein Buffer System
Phosphate Buffer System Exhalation of Carbon Dioxide Elimination of Hydrogen Ions via Kidneys
It 's not in the scope of this post to discuss the mechanisms listed above in detail .
For this article , I only want to point out that these systems are in place to prevent dietary , metabolic , and other factors from pushing the pH of your blood outside of the 7.35 to 7.45 range .
When people encourage you to " alkalize your blood , " most of them mean that you should eat plenty of foods that have an alkaline - forming effect on your system .
The reason for making this suggestion is that the vast majority of highly processed foods - like white flour products and white sugar - have an acid - forming effect on your system , and if you spend years eating a poor diet that is mainly acid- forming , you will overwork some of the buffering systems mentioned above to a point where you could create undesirable changes in your health .
For example , your phosphate buffer system uses different phosphate ions in your body to neutralize strong acids and bases .
About 85 % of the phosphate ions that are used in your phosphate buffer system comes from calcium phosphate salts , which are structural components of your bones and teeth .
If your body fluids are regularly exposed to large quantities of acid - forming foods and liquids , your body will draw upon its calcium phosphate reserves to supply your phosphate buffer system to neutralize the acid - forming effects of your diet .
Over time , this may lead to structural weakness in your bones and teeth .
Drawing on your calcium phosphate reserves at a high rate can also increase the amount of calcium that is eliminated via your genito - urinary system , which is why a predominantly acid - forming diet can increase your risk of developing calcium - rich kidney stones .
This is just one example of how your buffering systems can be overtaxed to a point where you experience negative health consequences .
Since your buffering systems have to work all the time anyway to neutralize the acids that are formed from everyday metabolic activities , it 's in your best interest to follow a diet that does n't create unnecessary work for your buffering systems .
Acid and Alkaline - Forming Effects of Common Foods
Generally speaking , most vegetables and fruits have an alkaline - forming effect on your body fluids .
Most grains , animal foods , and highly processed foods have an acid - forming effect on your body fluids .
Your health is best served by a good mix of nutrient - dense , alkaline and acid - forming foods ; ideally , you want to eat more alkaline - forming foods than acid - forming foods to have the net acid and alkaline - forming effects of your diet match the slightly alkaline pH of your blood .
The following lists indicate which common foods have an alkaline - forming effect on your body fluids , and which ones result in acid ash formation when they are digested and assimilated into your system .
Foods that have a Moderate to Strong Alkaline - Forming Effect
Watermelon
Lemons
Cantaloupe
Celery
Limes
Mango
Honeydew
Papaya
Parsley
Seaweed
Sweet , seedless grapes
Watercress
Asparagus
Kiwi
Pears
Pineapple
Raisins
Vegetable juices
Apples
Apricots
Alfalfa sprouts
Avocados
Bananas
Garlic
Ginger
Peaches
Nectarines
Grapefruit
Oranges
Most herbs
Peas
Lettuce
Broccoli
Cauliflower
Foods that have a Moderate to Strong Acid-Forming Effect
Alcohol
Soft drinks ( pop )
Tobacco
Coffee
White sugar
Refined Salt
Artificial sweeteners
Antibiotics ( and most drugs )
White flour products ( including pasta )
Seafood
White vinegar
Barley
Most boxed cereals
Cheese
Most beans
Flesh meats
Most types of bread
Please note that these lists of acid and alkaline - forming foods are not comprehensive , nor are they meant to be .
If you 're eating mainly grains , flour products , animal foods , and washing these foods down with coffee , soda , and milk , you will almost certainly improve your health by replacing some of your food and beverage choices with fresh vegetables and fruits .
The primary purpose of this article is to offer information that explains why I believe that you do n't need to take one or more nutritional supplements or " alkalized water " for the sole purpose of alkalizing your body .
Your body is already designed to keep the pH of your body fluids in a tight , slightly alkaline range .
The ideal scenario is to make fresh vegetables and fruits the centerpieces of your diet , and to eat small amounts of any other nutrient - dense foods that your appetite calls for and that experience shows your body can tolerate .
I hope these thoughts bring some clarity to this often misunderstood health topic .
Incredible Animal Prosthetics
Fuji , the Dolphin with a Rubber Tail
For decades , Fuji the dolphin had delighted children visiting an aquarium in Okinawa until a mysterious disease began eating away her tail fin .
To save her life , almost all her tail fin had to be amputated .
A dolphin ’s tail fin is its engine .
Without it , dolphins can’t swim , jump or dive , so engineers from Bridgestone Tire Company worked to design a new rubber tail for Fuji .
The first designs did not work properly or had some other drawback .
Finally , Fuji accepted the third tail design , made of silicon rubber with a foam padding , and was able to swim almost as well as an intact dolphin .
Uzonka , the Stork with a Prosthetic bill
When a bird ’s beak is damaged , it may not be able to eat , drink , or hunt properly and could die as a result .
Uzonka the stork had her bill damaged by human assault .
She received a prosthetic beak after five preparatory operations and is in the care of an animal hospital in Uzon , Romania .
Tonka , the Turtle on Wheels
Tonka , a Bay Area Turtle , lost mobility after her legs were bitten by a dog , so Peninsula Humane Society workers fitted the three - legged tortoise with a set of toy wheels .
Suddenly , Tonka was off a rolling !
slowly of course .
And then , in the next couple of days , when her picture showed up in the morning newspaper , she was adopted almost immediately .
Stumpy , the kangaroo with a Prosthetic Limb
Stumpy the red kangaroo lives in Ohio , at the International Kangaroo Society ’s sanctuary .
She only has one leg .
Veterinarians at Ohio State University created an artificial limb for her .
Dr. David E. Anderson , Associate Professor of Surgery , Food Animal , of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Richard Nitsch , a licensed prosthesis orthotist for American Orthopedics , made sure it included a spring to replicate the natural movement of a kangaroo .
Motala , the elephant with a bag of woods
Motala the elephant stepped on a land mine near the Thai - Burma border in 1999 .
Veterinarians were able to repair her front leg , but it was left much shorter than the others .
At Friends of the Asian Elephant ’s hospital in Thailand , Motala began using a prosthetic leg in 2005 .
The prosthesis is a bag filled with wood shavings , which makes her damaged leg as long as the others .
She accepted the attachment , and is still using the same kind of prosthetic leg .
Molly , the Pony With A Prosthetic Leg
Meet Molly the pony .
She ’s a gray speckled pony who was abandoned by her owners when Hurricane Katrina hit southern Louisiana .
Molly then spent weeks on her own following the 2005 catastrophe before finally being rescued and taken to a farm where abandoned animals were stockpiled .
While there , she was attacked by a pit bull terrier and almost died .
Her right front leg was terribly damaged and became infected .
Vets thought that was it and Molly looked to be on her way to the knackers yard , but then surgeon Rustin Moore met Molly , he changed his mind .
He noticed how the pony was careful to lie down on different sides so she did n’t seem to get sores , and how she allowed people to handle her .
Moore agreed to remove her leg below the knee and a temporary artificial limb was built .
Molly walked out of the clinic under her own steam , and is now an inspiration for children … and horses around the world .
RAMALLAH , West Bank ( Reuters ) - Palestinians voiced dismay on Monday over terms Benjamin Netanyahu set for a peace deal but the Israeli leader won guarded approval in Washington and Brussels for at least accepting Palestinian statehood .
In a speech on Sunday , Netanyahu responded to weeks of U.S. pressure by endorsing for the first time establishment of a Palestinian state , on condition Israel received international guarantees in advance that the new nation would be demilitarized .
Palestinians were disappointed by Netanyahu ’s demand that they recognize Israel as a Jewish state and his failure to halt Jewish settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank .
Salam Fayyad , prime minister in the Western - backed government of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , said Netanyahu ’s speech “ dealt a new blow to efforts to salvage the peace process , and has undermined the possibility of resuming negotiations based on its terms of reference . ”
Netanyahu “ failed to meet the expectations of the international community ” and did not commit to obligations outlined in a 2003 U.S. - sponsored “ road map ” for peace , he said .
But U.S. President Barack Obama said he saw “ positive movement ” in Netanyahu ’s speech and again urged Israel to halt settlement construction .
“ Both sides are going to have to move in some politically difficult ways in order to achieve what is going to be in the long - term interests of the Israelis and the Palestinians and the international community , ” Obama said .
“ On the Israeli side , that means a cessation of settlements . ”
The European Union described the speech as “ a step in the right direction ” but said it was not enough to raise EU - Israel ties to a higher level .
The Foreign Ministry of Russia , a member of the quartet of peace negotiators , noted “ with satisfaction ” Netanyahu ’s “ adherence to the establishment of peace in the Middle East ” and “ his readiness to restart the negotiations immediately . ”
However , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in remarks to troops that the call to recognize Israel as a Jewish state “ increases the complexity of the matter and aborts the chance for peace . ”
Palestinians argue that granting such recognition would effectively rule out any return of Palestinian refugees to what is now Israel .
DIFFERENCES
Interviewed on U.S. television , Netanyahu said he hoped to narrow differences with Obama over settlements .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
Obama has called for a full settlement freeze , in line with the road map , but Netanyahu wants building to continue in existing West Bank enclaves .
“ President Obama and I are trying to reach a common understanding on this , ” Netanyahu told NBC television .
“ I think we ’ll find some common ground . ”
He pledged to keep all of Jerusalem as Israel ’s capital -- defying Palestinians ’ claim on the city -- and hedged on whether Israel would ever remove West Bank settlements .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
He also ruled out the admission of Palestinian refugees to Israel proper and said Abbas must impose his authority over the breakaway Hamas Islamists ruling the Gaza Strip .
An Arab League spokesman described Netanyahu ’s proposal as an attempt to embarrass Arab states by presenting them with impossible conditions .
“ He proposed this project so that the Palestinians and Arabs would reject it , as well as the international community , ” the spokesman was quoted as saying by Egypt ’s state news agency .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said mediators should challenge Netanyahu on whether he was prepared to tackle territorial issues such as borders , Jerusalem and settlements .
“ Netanyahu is talking about negotiations about cantons -- the canton of the state of Palestine , with a flag and an anthem , a state without borders , without sovereignty , without a capital , ” Erekat said .
Netanyahu ’s speech met circumspection across the political spectrum in Israel , which has seen almost two decades of stop - start talks about a “ two - state solution , ” a concept the right - wing Likud party chief had long balked at endorsing .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Ask a group of oil analysts about the recent surge in crude costs and here 's the consensus answer you 'll get :
Prices have run up too far , too fast and they are n't supported by the fundamentals .
Ask them about where prices will be two years from now , however , and the majority will offer this prediction : A lot higher .
" We 're concerned about oil prices rising so rapidly in the near - term , " says Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley .
" But the bet in the long - term is one way , and that 's just up . "
Oil shot past $ 70 a barrel last week , meaning the cost per barrel has doubled since hitting a low in mid-February .
And the swiftness of that move has plenty of observers wondering if we 're headed toward another period of even more dramatic price gains .
Among the oil insiders worried about such a scenario is Royal Dutch Shell CEO Jeroen van der Veer , a 38 - year veteran of the energy giant , who is scheduled to retire June 30 .
" If the oil prices stay volatile I 'm afraid there will be too much slowdown in investment , " he said at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi in early June , according to Reuters , while reiterating that Shell would follow through on its spending plans for this year .
" I think too low capacity means the next price spike is to come . "
The last spike , of course , was a year ago at this time , when oil zoomed all the way up to $ 147 per barrel and Congress began holding hearings to discuss whether speculators were manipulating prices .
Then a market correction that began in the middle of last summer was accelerated by the global financial crisis .
Oil plunged to multi- year lows , with the price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude dropping under $ 35 in December and again in February .
To understand the odds of oil moving back above $ 100 , it helps to first examine the reasons that the price has rebounded so strongly in recent weeks .
Much of the recent rally actually has nothing to do with the oil market 's current supply - and - demand situation .
The latest estimate from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) projects that worldwide oil use will be almost 2.5 million barrels a day lower on average this year than in 2008 .
And despite the fact that OPEC has been cutting back on production since last September to boost prices , oil inventories around the world are still high compared to historical levels .
" Considering that supply seems ample and demand is weak , the fact that oil is going up looks kind of weird , " says Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank .
" But those factors are being overwhelmed by a huge sigh of relief that we 're not going to have the Great Depression .
A lot of money is coming out of mattresses . "
That inflow is lifting stocks and commodities alike .
Research by Morgan Stanley found the correlation between crude oil prices and equities has recently been at a record high -- with both rising strongly on the hope that the economic cycle has already bottomed .
" Historically , equities have been a leading indicator of economic growth and commodities have been a coincident indicator , " says Morgan Stanley 's Allidina .
" Right now you 're seeing commodities and equities move up together as money comes back in at the same time . "
Just as important , Morgan Stanley found that the inverse correlation between a weakening U.S. dollar and rising crude prices was also closing in on a record high .
Because oil is priced in dollars , when the value of the dollar falls it makes oil cheaper in other currencies -- simultaneously boosting consumption outside the U.S. and motivating non-U.S. producers to raise prices to make up for the purchasing power they 've lost in the currency conversion .
Concerns about the ballooning deficit in the U.S. have caused investors to begin fleeing the dollar .
The U.S. dollar index , which measures the value of the greenback against six major world currencies , has dropped 9 % since the beginning of March .
As it falls , oil prices are rising .
If it falls further , they 'll rise higher .
But just how high oil prices go from here -- and how fast they get there -- will ultimately depend on the ability of producers to meet future demand .
And any robust rebound in consumption is sure to put a strain on global supply .
The investment cutbacks warned about by Shell 's Van der Veer only make that more likely .
In its World Energy Outlook 2008 , released last November , the IEA warned that production declines from existing supplies would keep the market tight and called for $ 26 trillion in new infrastructure spending worldwide over the next two decades .
Right now , the opposite is happening .
In May , the IEA said it expected a 21 % drop in oil and gas investment budgets globally in 2009 compared to 2008 , or nearly $ 100 billion less .
A cautious OPEC has said that a lot of its member countries ' new drilling projects remain on hold .
Meanwhile , there are signs that a demand recovery could be on the way in Asia .
China 's crude consumption averaged 7.6 million barrels per day in April , according to Allidina , the highest level on record , amid reports that the government was stockpiling commodities .
Goldman Sachs was confident enough of a demand rebound to come out in early June with a price target of $ 85 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude by the end of 2009 and $ 95 by the end of 2010 .
Deutsche Bank 's Sieminski agrees that prices are going higher over time .
" Our forecast has been that oil will be at $ 100 in 2015 and it could happen faster if the economy recovers , " he says .
Because oil is generally considered an " inelastic " commodity -- meaning it takes a big increase in price to produce a small change in demand -- the chances of a spike increase once supplies get tight .
" If you get close to the balance , prices can go haywire very quickly and there 's very little that can be done about it , " says Sieminski .
" Something happens on the margin to put pressure on the market and instead of the price adjustment being gradual it's a step change .
Last time gasoline had to go to $ 4 a gallon and crude had to go to $ 150 a barrel to rebalance things .
And that 's how we could get there again . "
Let 's hope we do n't get there for a while .

The Linux Journal Readers ' Choice Awards have become an annual ritual , almost as fun as the holiday season .
Our editorial team members can't wait to get their hands on the results to see what products and tools from the Linux space are keeping you productive , satisfied and wowed .
And , who better to ask than our readers , the most talented , informed and ( nearly always for the better ) opinionated group of Linux experts anywhere ?
These characteristics are what make the awards such a great snapshot of what 's hot and what 's not in Linux .
Before diving into the results , let me explain that the results , although insightful , inherently fail to capture the true diversity of preferences that exist in our community .
I wish we had space to show you the chaotic yet amazing mish - mash of responses to each question .
As we try to lasso you into organized responses , you are curiously galloping off in pursuit of your category - busting solution as we hang on to the rope for dear life .
The reality is that you are always experimenting ; your opinions are fluid , and filling in virtual bubbles does n't fully explain the nuance of your relationship to your tools .
This is a survey of big trends , and the trend underlying them all is that you embrace lots of tools .
One respondent summed it up with “ All of the above , many of the above ” , and another exclaimed , “ Variety is the spice , baby ! ”
Once again , in this year 's competition , we designated only one winner per category , with strong contenders receiving Honorable Mention awards .
For instance , in the categories where a cluster of formidable contenders followed the outright winner , we designated up to three honorable mentions .
Besides a few exceptions , a product or service had to get at least 10 % of the vote for Honorable Mention status .
Here then , ladies and gentlemen , are your 2009 Linux Journal Readers ' Choice Awards .
Favorite Primary Linux Distribution of Choice Ubuntu ( 45 % ) Honorable Mention Debian ( 10 % ) The Ubuntu phenomenon , even by Linux standards , is truly paradigm - shifting and it does n't appear that it will be tanking any time soon .
In the 2008 Readers ' Choice Awards , we dubbed the ubiquitous Ubuntu “ the big distro that did ” for unexpectedly leaving its myriad rivals as mere dots in the rear - view mirror .
In the 2009 tally , Ubuntu deserves an “ Energizer Bunny Award ” for winning the Favorite Primary Linux Distro category , increasing its popularity and becoming untouchable for the time being .
Ubuntu and its related Kubuntu and Edubuntu siblings raised their vote tally from 37 % in last year 's awards to 45 % this year .
At whose expense is Ubuntu gaining ?
Although Mandriva tumbled most dramatically from 14 % to 2 % , Fedora and Novell / SUSE hemorrhaged more than a few percentage points .
Meanwhile , Red Hat , CentOS and Debian ticked up a few points from last year , the latter enough to warrant Honorable Mention with its 10 % share of your vote .
Favorite Desktop Environment GNOME ( 53 % ) Honorable Mention KDE ( 30 % )
During the past year , GNOME has reached majority rule status , with 53 % of you electing it your favorite desktop environment .
This trend is despite the breakneck development of KDE 4 during the past year .
Although GNOME garnered only a few more votes than it did in 2008 , KDE 's vote count slipped as you 've warmed to Xfce , Fluxbox and Enlightenment .
The long and influential coattails of Ubuntu can only make any presidential candidate green with envy .
Favorite Web Browser Firefox ( 87 % ) Firefox takes first prize as both your Favorite Web Browser for 2009 and the most extreme “ category crusher ” of this competition .
No other application ( besides the competitor - less Apache ) racked up a higher share of votes ( 87 % ) than Firefox , although OpenOffice.org was n't far behind .
Who can argue , as Firefox keeps getting faster and accumulates more useful extensions ?
This year 's surprise gainer was the historically underappreciated Opera browser , which ratcheted up from 5 % to 8 % on the heels of its impressive 9.5 and 9.6 releases .
The worthy Konqueror and the browsers based on the Firefox Gecko engine ( for example , Flock and Epiphany ) were left behind in the catchall “ Other ” category .
How will this category look next year ?
Look for an inevitable battle royale if Google can deliver a polished Chrome for Linux in time for you to give it a test drive .
Favorite E-Mail Client Mozilla Thunderbird ( 38 % ) Honorable Mention Gmail Web Client ( 31 % ) Evolution ( 11 % ) Congratulations to Mozilla Thunderbird for its third consecutive win in the Favorite E - Mail Client category with 38 % of the vote .
The “ Holy how did that happen , Batman ? ” award , as well as Honorable Mention , go to the runner up , Gmail , which got 11 % more of your votes than last year , while Thunderbird dropped 7 % .
Meanwhile , other non-Web - based clients , Evolution and KMail , are ever more the favorites of fewer .
Is the trend toward Web - based clients inexorable , or can the non-Gmails of the world find a formula to stanch the decline ?
Favorite Office Program OpenOffice.org ( 85 % )
No news here , gang .
OpenOffice.org , bolstered no doubt by its recent 3.0 release , retains its crown as your Favorite Office Program with the same share of your vote as last year , 85 % .
The alternatives , AbiWord and KOffice , each similarly continue to be the favorites of merely 3 % of you .
As with Firefox , there seems to be some sort of correlation between a program 's cross-platform characteristics ( should any exist ) and its category - crusher status .
Honorable Mention for most definitive response in this category goes to “ I hate all office programs ” .
Favorite Audio Tool Audacity ( 73 % )
In this year 's competition , we decided it made sense to split up audio - related programs into two categories .
The first is Favorite Audio Tool — that is , program for creating , manipulating and modifying audio streams .
The second is Favorite Audio Player — that is , program for playing and organizing existing audio streams .
The cross-platform Audacity sound recorder and editor is yet another — cross - platform rule holds — category crusher in the Favorite Audio Tool department , garnering top marks from 73 % of you .
Although the applications LMMS and Ardour each have a critical mass of adherents , each is the favorite audio tool of only 6 % of you .
Favorite Audio Player Amarok ( 36 % ) Honorable Mention Rhythmbox ( 18 % ) XMMS ( 12 % )
Although alternatives have knocked Amarok back a few points from last year , its 36 % share of the vote tally helped the renowned audio player for KDE remain undisputed champion in the Favorite Audio Player category .
Many of you also are aficionados of the audio players Rhythmbox and XMMS , each of which received enough votes to warrant Honorable Mention .
It 's interesting to see KDE flagging as your favorite desktop , yet the KDE audio player , admittedly more feature - packed , has double the support of the GNOME audio player , Rhythmbox .
Favorite Media Player VLC ( 34 % ) Honorable Mention MPlayer ( 33 % ) Ladies and gentlemen , we have a new champion in the Favorite Media Player category .
VLC , which last year landed in a close second place behind MPlayer , won the category in a photo finish by a single percentage point .
Both players play pretty much any format you can throw at them , making usability a key factor in your decision .
Thus , more of you are opting for the single - console approach of VLC rather than MPlayer .
Other players that recorded respectable results were Totem ( 9 % ) , Kaffeine ( 8 % ) , SMPlayer ( 6 % ) and xine ( 5 % ) .
Favorite Communications Tool Pidgin ( 43 % ) Honorable Mention Skype ( 18 % ) Nothing changed in the Favorite Communications Tool category .
Once again , Pidgin Internet Messenger , the Swiss Army knife - esque messaging tool formerly known as Gaim , took top honors with a 43 % share of your votes .
Pidgin users appreciate the ability to monitor all of their messaging accounts in 15 different protocols .
Competitor Kopete , which slipped from its Honorable Mention status from last year , does only 11 protocols .
Meanwhile , the closed - source Skype retained its Honorable Mention laurels by earning 18 % of your votes .
That may be its ceiling until its improbable open - source resurrection , as a sizable contingent of us will never fill the bubble of any closed - source application , regardless of how good it is .
Favorite Graphics / Design Tool GIMP ( 76 % ) Honorable Mention Inkscape ( 11 % )
The legendary GIMP remains your unrivaled choice for Favorite Graphics / Design Tool , once again with 76 % of the votes .
It appears though , that the vector - graphics application Inkscape is emerging from the pack of graphics applications as a new favorite .
Inkscape left the single - digit vote - getters to reach 11 % of your votes , enough to win it Honorable Mention in the category .
Are the impressive , mature programs like Blender too specialized to warrant your vote ?
Maybe the category is too broad .
One write - in voter exclaimed , “ You 're making me choose between GIMP and Blender ? ! ” , and another explained , “ Blender , GIMP and Inkscape are totally different tools for different purposes .
They 're all my favorites in their respective categories ” .
Points well taken .
Favorite Digital Photo Management Tool Picasa ( 34 % ) Honorable Mention F - Spot ( 17 % ) digiKam ( 13 % ) g Thumb ( 11 % ) Although much has changed in the crowded category of Favorite Digital Photo Management Tool , one broad trend appears to hold .
If a Google application is around , it is likely to be slicing and dicing its rivals .
In the photo management category , the slicer - dicer is Picasa , and the sliced and diced is digiKam .
In the 2008 awards , Picasa and digiKam were neck and neck with 25 % of the votes .
This year , Picasa wins the category , leaving everyone else in the dust with its 34 % of the vote .
F - Spot ( at 17 % ) , digiKam ( at 13 % ) and gThumb ( at 11 % ) are still all popular enough to deserve Honorable Mention .
However , Picasa may continue to surge as unique features , such as the ability to sync photos between one 's PC and Web - based albums seamlessly , make it a tough act to follow .
Favorite Text Editor vi ( 36 % ) Honorable Mention gedit ( 19 % ) Kate ( 11 % )
The more things change , the more they stay the same in the Favorite Text Editor category .
Vi wins again with a solid 36 % , with gedit and Kate taking Honorable Mention honors .
Emacs and nano also are popular but just missed the cut .
Favorite Version Control System Subversion ( 47 % ) Honorable Mention CVS ( 16 % ) git ( 15 % )
You left little doubt about who deserves to win Favorite Version Control System , a new category in the 2009 Readers ' Choice Awards .
Subversion is the favorite of 47 % of you ; CVS and git win Honorable Mention at 16 % and 15 % , respectively .
Favorite Database MySQL ( 61 % ) Honorable Mention PostgreSQL ( 18 % ) MySQL 's move over to Sun Microsystems does n't appear to have dampened your admiration for the legendary open - source database .
Both this year and last year , you deemed MySQL your Favorite Database , with 61 % of your votes this year .
PostgreSQL also shared a similar fate as last year , registering 18 % , enough for Honorable Mention .
SQLite , Oracle and Firebird all polled in the single digits .
Favorite Linux Monitoring Application Nagios ( 51 % ) Honorable Mention Hyperic HQ ( 15 % ) up . time ( 11 % ) Nagios was not only recently dubbed one of the most important open - source apps of all time , but it also is the winner of the new Readers '
Choice category , Favorite Linux Monitoring Application .
A slim majority 51 % of you use Nagios to keep close tabs on your networks of all shapes , sizes and levels of complexity .
Most of you not using Nagios opt for the Honorable Mention candidates , Hyperic HQ ( with 15 % ) and up . time ( 11 % ) .
Ganglia and GroundWork also garnered respectable votes in the single digits .
Favorite Programming Language Python ( 20 % ) Honorable Mention C++ ( 19 % ) Java ( 17 % ) C ( 13 % ) Perl ( 12 % ) Last year , we created discord when we split programming languages into two categories : Favorite Programming Language and Favorite Scripting Language .
Then , we limited your choices according to our own definition of each .
In order to shield ourselves from the avalanche of “ WTFs ” ( whew , we succeeded ! ) , we gave you more latitude to decide which is which .
Therefore , the results look a bit different from last year .
In an interesting twist , Guido van Rossum 's venerable Python , which took First Place in last year 's Favorite Scripting Language category , wins this year 's Favorite Programming Language award with a hefty 20 % of your votes .
Close behind in the Honorable Mention group are your other favorites , with few surprises : C++ with 19 % , Java with 17 % , C with 13 % and Perl with 12 % .
Favorite Scripting Language bash ( 28 % ) Honorable Mention PHP ( 24 % ) Python ( 19 % ) Perl ( 14 % )
The results of the Favorite Scripting Language illustrate the diversity of opinions on what is a scripting language .
Although the prosaic workhorse bash ( shell ) wins the category with 28 % of the tally , three other quite different languages follow close behind in the Honorable Mention category : the Web- centric PHP , the flexible Python and the Swiss Army chainsaw of programming languages , Perl .
Favorite GUI Remote Access or Network Computing Solution SSH and X ( 40 % ) Honorable Mention TightVNC ( 14 % ) rdesktop ( 13 % ) RealVNC ( 12 % ) Your inaugural choice for Favorite GUI Remote Access or Network Computing Solution is clear .
SSH and X wins hands - down with a commanding 40 % share of the votes .
Meanwhile , a hefty chunk of you choose to go graphical , using variants of VNC , such as TightVNC , RealVNC and UltraVNC .
In fact , if you add those three user groups together , you 're just shy of winning the category .
TightVNC , rdesktop and RealVNC are all popular enough to share the platform for Honorable Mention .
Favorite Linux IDE Eclipse ( 42 % ) Honorable Mention NetBeans ( 14 % ) KDevelop ( 11 % ) Yet another new category in this year 's awards is Favorite Linux IDE , which the ubiquitous Eclipse won commandingly and unsurprisingly with 42 % of the votes cast .
The fact that in Eclipse one can work in a lean environment and add and subtract an incredible array functionality with its myriad modules has closed the deal for nearly a majority of you .
At the same time , the second largest vote - getter was “ Other ” .
Clearly the Linux developer community cannot be pigeonholed .
Favorite Platform for Developing Rich Internet Apps Adobe Air ( 21 % ) Honorable Mention Gears ( 18 % ) JavaFX ( 15 % )
When it comes to your Favorite Platform for Developing Rich Internet Apps ( yet another new category for 2009 ) , you are less decided than in the Linux IDE category .
Although Adobe Air is the favorite of the most of you at 21 % , you also are using Gears and JavaFX in solid numbers , 18 % and 15 % , respectively , among others .
Mono Moonlight and OpenLaszlo also were close to the 10 % mark .
Will one of these tools break away to be the next Eclipse in a few years ?
Tune in to this space next year to find out .
Favorite Linux Game Frozen Bubble ( 17 % ) Honorable Mention Doom ( 11 % ) Tux Racer , also Planet Penguin Racer and Extreme Tux Racer ( 10 % )
With some barely perceptible percentage changes , the Favorite Linux Game category remains the same as last year , led by Frozen Bubble and with Honorable Mention going to Doom and the Tux Racer series .
Besides being consistent , the Favorite Game category is characterized by having the largest share of “ Other ” votes , with 27 % , and the wittiest comments .
One of you commented “ Keeping it old school with SCUMM [ VM ] games ” .
On the flip side , a surprising number of you also commented that you “ have no time for games ” or “ do n't like games ” .
Meanwhile , this writer is wondering whether the many commercial game companies that now make Linux versions will ever break through with a runaway hit that could give Frozen Bubble a challenge one day .
Favorite Virtualization Solution VirtualBox ( 32 % ) Honorable Mention VMware ( 30 % ) Wine ( 13 % )
We 've been watching VirtualBox for a few years now , wondering when its popularity would finally match its technical prowess .
Well , 2009 is finally VirtualBox 's time in the sun , as this year it toppled VMware to win Favorite Virtualization Solution .
Last year , VirtualBox received roughly half the votes of VMware ( 20 % vs. 39 % ) .
This year , VirtualBox won the matchup 32 % to 30 % .
VMware and Wine , thus , took Honorable Mention honors .
Xen fell just short of 10 % of the vote .
[ See Marcel Gagné 's Cooking with Linux on page 26 for more on VirtualBox . ]
Favorite Backup System Amanda ( 16 % ) Honorable Mention Bacula ( 14 % ) Simple Linux Backup ( 14 % )
Once again , in the backup department we differentiated between comprehensive applications , or systems ( this category ) , and specific utilities ( see Favorite Backup Utility below ) .
Regarding the Favorite Backup System category , most of you continue to prefer the same systems as last year , although the deck chairs have been rearranged a bit .
This year , the open - source application Amanda took the victory lap , which Simple Linux Backup took last year .
Still , the latter won Honorable Mention this year along with Bacula ( yet again ) for network - based backup .
Favorite Backup System also has a variety of write - in votes with some variation of “ roll my own solution ” .
Favorite Backup Utility rsync ( 47 % ) Honorable Mention tar ( 34 % )
Though rsync and tar are your perennial favorites for Favorite Backup Utility , this year , the two flip - flopped positions , with tar taking the crown last year and rsync taking it this year .
rsync is the favorite backup utility of 47 % of you to tar 's 34 % .
Favorite Package Management Application apt ( 37 % ) Honorable Mention Synaptic ( 16 % ) Yum ( 13 % ) RPM ( 10 % )
As the fate of Ubuntu and siblings slopes ever upward , so too trends the popularity of apt , the principal package management system for Ubuntu and Debian .
Once again , apt , with 37 % of the votes , is the clear and even more dominant victor as Favorite Package Management Application .
More of you also are turning to Synaptic , the groovy front end to apt , to keep your system loaded with your favorite programs .
The classic RPM ( 10 % ) and its amigo Yum ( 13 % ) declined slightly from last year , as more of you are leaving Fedora and Novell / SUSE in favor of Ubuntu .
Favorite Content Management System WordPress ( 25 % ) Honorable Mention Joomla ! ( 23 % ) Drupal ( 19 % )
No surprise that the blog publishing application WordPress once again wins the category Favorite Content Management System with 25 % of the vote .
In the Honorable Mention department , your same two favorite Web content managers , Joomla ! and Drupal , are present only to flip in popularity .
This year , Joomla !
reached an impressive 23 % to Drupal 's 19 % .
Drupal got our vote — LinuxJournal.com runs on it .
Favorite Web Server Apache ( 89 % )
As with last year , the thought arises in Favorite Web Server category of whether we should just ask “ Do you use the Apache Web server , yes or no ? ” and leave it at that .
Apache wins again in 2009 with 89 % of your votes .
Favorite Linux - Friendly Web Hosting Company Contegix ( 15 % ) Honorable Mention Rackspace ( 12 % )
Talk about a meteoric rise , Contegix went from one write - in vote in 2008 to champion of the Favorite Linux - Friendly Web Hosting Company category in 2009 .
Otherwise , four well - known names have remained among your perennial favorites for years , namely Rackspace , GoDaddy.com , DreamHost and 1&1 .
Of the four , only Rackspace broke the 10 % barrier this year for Honorable Mention , while the other three were just shy of the mark .
GoDaddy.com was category winner last year , and DreamHost and 1&1 were the two Honorable Mentions .
Favorite Linux - Based Gadget ASUS Eee PC ( 24 % ) Honorable Mention Android G1 ( 22 % )
Last year , we admittedly were dorks for having the category Favorite Linux Handheld Device , which left so many cool Linux gadgets out in the cold .
The Nokia N800 won that one .
This year , however , we 've taken our smart pills and expanded the category , calling it Favorite Linux - Based Gadget .
Not surprisingly , one of the most well - known devices , the ASUS Eee PC won the category with 24 % of the vote , followed by the Android G1 , which achieved Honorable Mention status with 22 % .
After the G1 , the field was so crowded , making it impossible , unfortunately , for any other device to crack the 10 % barrier .
The Nokia N810 Tablet , Acer Aspire One , TomTom Navigation System , OpenMoko FreeRunner , Amazon Kindle , the Palm Pre and several write - ins all received a fair share of your vote , which shows how sophisticated , interesting and crowded the Linux device space has become .
Favorite Linux Laptop ASUS Eee PC ( 32 % ) Honorable Mention Lenovo T61 p ( 16 % ) Dell Inspiron Mini 9 ( 12 % ) Acer Aspire One ( 10 % )
There is something oddly liberating about the “ big guys ” pre-installing Linux on their PCs .
At long last , when we go to buy a PC , a device so central to our identities and livelihoods , we find the well - thought - out preference for Linux taken seriously by the companies we want to buy from .
After being shut out so long for being too smart , it sure feels good , does n't it ?
Your vote for the ASUS Eee PC as Favorite Linux Laptop ( with 32 % of the vote ) tells us how much you appreciate the opportunity to buy a laptop designed with Linux in mind and not just a feature - handicapped afterthought to placate the pesky geeks .
The group of Honorable Mentions includes not only the returning Lenovo T61 p ( 16 % ) but also the newcomers Dell Inspiron Mini 9 ( 12 % ) and Acer Aspire One ( 10 % ) .
Despite such euphoria over the big guys , you did n't forget our Linux - specialist friends like Linux Certified , EmperorLinux and R Cubed who kept us motoring during darker times .
They fared well as a group if you add up all the votes for their various models .
Favorite Linux Desktop Workstation Dell ( 41 % ) Honorable Mention Hewlett - Packard ( 16 % ) Let 's start with the official results for Favorite Linux Desktop Workstation .
Dell won the category with 41 % of your votes , and Hewlett - Packard earned Honorable Mention with 16 % .
Unfortunately , the official results fail to appreciate the “ roll - your - own ” spirit that is so vital to our community .
Because we did n't include a choice like “ I configure my own desktop PCs ” , you told us as much in your own words .
In a classic survey creator 's nightmare , the responses “ I do . :) ” and “ I do , as in self - built ” and “ Home - brewed ” all registered as separate votes worth 0.05 % each even though they mean the same thing .
Allow me put on my Katherine Harris hat and have a look at these “ hanging chads ” , Florida - election - style , to shed some light on your roll - your - own tendencies .
Hours of investigative sleuthing revealed that roughly 12 % of you configure your own desktop PCs .
Therefore , the honorary Honorable Mention award in this category goes to the roll - your - own spirit of the Linux Community .
Favorite Linux Server Dell ( 32 % ) Honorable Mention IBM ( 16 % ) Hewlett - Packard ( 15 % )
While the roll - your - own philosophy is alive and well when it comes to servers , you tend to feel more comfortable giving this business to the big guys .
Dell is the winner of the Favorite Linux Server category with 32 % of your votes .
Your Honorable Mention winners , IBM and HP , trailed Dell with 16 % and 15 % , respectively .
Favorite “ Green ” Linux Product or Solution Virtualization ( 45 % ) Honorable Mention PowerTOP Tool ( 16 % )
Last year , VMware took top honors as Favorite “ Green ” Linux Product or Solution partly because of how we phrased the question .
This year , to be more fair , we grouped virtualization solutions together , and they won the category with 45 % of your votes .
The win makes sense given the technology 's impressive improvement in the efficiency of servers .
The PowerTOP tool for finding energy wasters on your systems also is popular and won Honorable Mention with 16 % .
We failed to list the recent ( kernel 2.6.21 ) innovation of the tickless idle on Linux , which takes advantage of low power states in modern processors .
Are you taking advantage of this feature ?
Next year , we 'll ask you directly .
Finally , this author wishes to express his dismay at the significant number of disparaging remarks in this survey toward green solutions .
Although the vast majority of respondents are positive to neutral in this category , responses such as “ Do n't drink the green Kool - Aid ” and “ I do n't care ! ” were plentiful .
Will our progeny admire our arrogant proclivity to waste natural resources and do little to change our ways ?
I doubt it .
Favorite Linux Book of All Time Linux in a Nutshell by Ellen Siever , Stephen Spainhour , Stephen Figgins and Jessica P. Hekman ( 4 % ) Honorable Mention Just for Fun : The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond ( 3 % ) Running Linux by Matt Welsh , Matthias Kalle Dalheimer , Terry Dawson and Lar Kaufman ( 3 % ) The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond ( 2 % ) The Linux Bible by Christopher Negus ( 2 % )
Last year , we limited the selection in this category to books published from 2007 to the date of the survey ( February 2008 ) .
This year , we decided to try Favorite Linux Book of All Time , and the results did n't gel as easily .
Because this category is so crowded , we decided to toss out the 10 % rule for Honorable Mention and honor your top five books .
Interestingly , two of your favorites were not technical guides but rather required reading for understanding the Linux phenomenon , namely Just for Fun : The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary , the story of Linus Torvalds ' rise to fame , and The Cathedral and the Bazaar , Eric Raymond 's seminal book on the Open Source movement .
Rounding out the Honorable Mentions Running Linux and The Linux Bible .
The information - overloaded among you meanwhile opted for the popular write - in candidates “ Too many to choose ” or “ Very tough question ” .
Linux Journal Column FavoriteColumn
Tie : Marcel Gagné's Cooking with Linux ( 19 % ) and Kyle Rankin's Hack and / ( 19 % ) Honorable Mention Dave Taylor 's Work the Shell ( 10 % ) Mick Bauer 's Paranoid Penguin ( 10 % )
Here is some Linux Journal lore for you .
Our publication used to have a column called Kernel Korner , which many faithful readers certainly remember .
Kernel Korner dominated the Favorite Linux Journal Column category from the awards ' inception in 1996 until 2000 .
Things got competitive in 2001 when Marcel Gagné and his Cooking with Linux , the world 's first column ever to pair practical ( and hilarious ) Linux advice with appropriate wine selections .
Cooking with Linux has been so popular ever since that it won Favorite Linux Journal Column from 2001 to 2008 , and last year , I suggested that “ Marcel Gagné is going to have to be knocked off before anyone knocks him off the award stand . ”
My prediction was premature , because this year , although Marcel won this category again , he shares his title with Kyle Rankin 's more recent Hack and / column .
Believe it or not , Marcel and Kyle received the exact same number of votes , or 19 % each .
Congratulations are due to both excellent columnists who offer vastly different but equally useful content in their monthly musings .
Meanwhile , Dave Taylor 's Work the Shell and Mick Bauer 's Paranoid Penguin are both popular with 10 % of you , enough to award them Honorable Mention .
Just when you thought you were safe from the world of SEO acronyms comes another one – QDF , or Query Deserves Freshness .
This one is brought to us by Google and it is a part of the Google search algorithm to help it determine which queries ( not all ! ) should be updated to include new content because the subject matter of the search is changing rapidly .
In other words , the searches want to deliver the freshest material first instead of older material which may not contain relevant information .
You can think about the election of Barack Obama as an example of this – queries for Obama today will return news articles and information about the White House and his presidency , versus queries from a year ago that would have returned totally different results for the most part .
Google determines which queries qualify for QDF by observing search trends and which subjects are spiking over a period of time .
Think of it this way – current event topics traditionally happen in spikes , and so queries about them ( the election , a natural disaster , etc. ) are not steady searches , but rather are concentrated around the time of the event .
So , what does this have to do with SEO ?
A lot !
Because the thing about QDF queries is that sites that contain no link backs at all could potentially hit the top of the search queries at all could hit the top of the search engines because of their authority .
For example , a search on Barack Obama may return today ’s news from the New York Times as the # 1 result not because of the link building , but because of the authority of the New York Times as a reputable site , and because of the QDF of the search term “ Barack Obama ” .
In other words , fresh content gets the “ boost ” – the article from the NYT rates at the top because it is fresh and relevant .
QDF for SEO is best achieved by focusing on the freshness boost aspect of it .
You are in essence trying to ride the spike by being there at the front with fresh , relevant content .
How to do this ?
Web content optimization is the key here .
Getting bloggers involved in talking about this subject before it hits the mainstream is a great way to get Google noticing that something is going on .
You can also register domain names that contain the “ buzz ” topic that highlights the topic .
Over time , you might 301 this back to your main domain – but for spikes , it can really help .
PPC also comes into play here for these spikes .
Though pay per click advertising is not normally a tool that we use a lot in SEO , it plays an important role for QDF and topics that are buzzed up for a short period of time .
Here you want to make sure that you “ own ” the top clicks , and PPC is one of the easiest way to do this in the short run .
To summarize , QDF is all about the “ buzz ” .
What ’s happening what now – and who has the freshest information about it ?
Used correctly , it can be a powerful advantage that a SEO company can use to drive sales and visits to its sites – and a great way to use SEO to build brand awareness through buzz campaigns .
The US still has about 133,000 troops in Iraq
The Iraqi authorities are tightening security in preparation for next Tuesday 's deadline for US soldiers to pull out of the country 's cities .
All police leave has been cancelled and extra troops have been drafted in , amid a spate of bomb attacks this week which has left 250 people dead .
Prime Minister Nouri Maliki says the attacks may be aimed at stirring up sectarian tensions .
But he says he is confident his government can safeguard security .
" [ The attackers ] want to sweep delight from the Iraqi people 's hearts .
They have revealed their real intentions , " said Mr Maliki .
" But this will not bend our determination and will for what we have agreed upon - that is , to return security responsibilities to our military and police forces . "
Al - Qaeda blamed US forces have already left many bases in cities such as Baghdad .
But our correspondent says the troops are not far away , in positions just outside urban areas where they are poised to intervene should they be called on to help by the Iraqi forces .
Most of the deadly bombings this week have targeted Shia areas - leading the Iraqi authorities to blame Sunni militants from the al - Qaeda group .
The authorities have beefed up security across urban areas - with special attention given to controlling access to markets .
Militants have frequently targeted markets , hoping to inflict as many casualties as possible .
Under an agreement with the Iraqi authorities , most of the 133,000 US troops in Iraq are due to leave the country 's cities and towns and withdraw to military bases by 30 June .
Combat operations across Iraq are due to end by September 2010 and all US troops will be out of the country by the end of 2011 .

And let me tell you , you came to the right place .
Because the world is populated by guys like you ; in fact I 'm willing to bet there 's not one man in the whole wide world who does n't think he deserves an on - the - couch blow job the first time he makes out with someone , so fear not .
This is territory that any girl over the age of 15 has seen many , many times .
So do n't think I wo n't do it .
There 's just a few things I need from you first .
First , I would appreciate it if you would wash your genitals once a day .
Just once a day .
Heck , you can even do it while you 're IN the shower washing anyway .
Because guys like you -- do n't blame me for presuming -- often live under the gross misunderstanding that their genitals do not stink .
Oddly , this is simultaneously the VERY SAME reason they give for not giving us girls oral sex .
Listen while I compare the maintenance habits of me and you -- it 'll only take a second and I 'll get right to it , swear to God .
So .
Here 's what girls do .
We scrub our genitals -- front to back , inside and out -- every day under a high - pressure stream of hot water , using expensive soap designed to both moisturize and leave a pleasant scent .
Then we shave most of our genitals .
You might think that 's an easy task .
No , no , my friend .
It is not easy .
It requires bending , twisting , squatting , stretching and sometimes a hand - held mirror .
It must be done every day , but it can not be rushed .
What may be passed off as a " nick " on , say , my knees or your face , can rise to the level of emergency - room - visit when wielding a sharp object so near one 's particulars .
So .
The shaving .
Then once a month we go to a snooty spa and spend $ 80 -- without tip -- for a wax .
That 's even more fun .
That 's where we climb up on a table wearing paper panties and then a stranger walks in and starts applying hot wax to our genitals .
Often they ask us to assume a particalurly demeaning position -- on all fours , say , or holding one ankle above our heads -- to get every last hair off .
And , dude , it hurts .
Really .
Once we 're properly hairless , then we apply TendSkin to prevent red bumps , lotion to prevent any flaky skin and high - priced exfoliating scrub every other day to prevent ingrown hairs .
When all is well , we scent our panties and go about our dressing for our big date with you , the super cute boy .
Why all this preparation , you ask ?
It 's just so that when we DO manage to be making out with you , you can scrunch up your nose , look at our genitals and say that you " do n't do that . "
You 're like , " Sorry , it 's not you , I just do n't ... "
And we 're like , " Oh , no .
It 's OK , " secretly resenting every painful minute of our genital - prep time .
OK , OK , that 's us .
Now here 's you .
You probably run a wet bar of Irish Spring under your armpits every morning and , if we 're lucky , maybe take a swipe near your unmentionables .
That 's the beginning and the end , am I right ?
You might be surprised to find that Irish Spring or no , you STILL may be stinky .
It 's true !
See , guys secrete sweat and stuff down there , just like girls .
And it's an area that never gets any sunlight or fresh air , just like girls .
You piss and shit and sometimes it does n't all go away , just like girls .
You have hair down there , just like girls .
See where I 'm going with this ?
You may stink as bad -- nay , worse ! -- than me , the lucky lady about to put your cock and balls in my mouth .
But have you ever heard a girl say she " does n't do that " ?
Exactly .
We do n't say that .
So do me a favor , please , and tomorrow start scrubbing your gentials with the same fervor I scrub mine .
And consider buying wet toilet paper , it really does help you stay clean throughout the day .
Anytime you think you might be perfectly clean , just rub a finger around your testicles and butt crack , then smell it .
If comes up Irish Spring , perfect .
If not , just think .
I 'm going to have to put my face in that .
So .
Sorry to blabber on so long .
I promise I 'm almost done and we can start the fabuloso blow job I know you 've been thinking about ever since that fateful night when you looked at me and said , " ' Sup ? " Just a couple more things .
Listen to me now .
I give pretty good blowjobs .
Seriously .
I do .
For a non -porn - star , I 'm willing to bet this is about as good as you 're ever going to get .
But hear me out .
If you want to put your dick in my mouth , that is perfectly fine with me .
But you need to respect the fact that my teeth were there first .
I can't , sadly , do anything with them as the Good Lord has seen fit to leave me all my teeth at this late age of 26 and I do n't have dentures .
So if you have a serious problem with teeth touching your penis , here 's what I suggest you do :
Do n't put your dick in other people 's mouths .
See , that 's where all the teeth are .
It is soooo easy to avoid getting my teeth against your dick .
Just stop putting it in my mouth .
Voila !
If you insist on putting your dick in my mouth , and I can see that you do , I can promise to do my best to dis - locate my jaw to give you a blowjob that is all suck , spit and tongue .
But sometimes you may feel a tooth .
Whoops !
No need to freak out .
The same goes for anal sex , should we ever find ourselves down that path in the future .
If you ever want to put your dick up my ass , and do n't even pretend , I know you will , that 's OK .
As long as I feel like you care about me and respect me , that 's totally OK .
But if I let you put your dick up my butthole , please do n't freak out if , afterward , you discover a speck of fecal matter on your penis on our way to the shower .
Wow .
That really embarasses me , believe me .
No need to point it out .
And if you do point it out , I can tell you there 's a simple solution for not getting fecal matter on your penis .
What you do is , stop putting it in other people 's assholes .
See how easy that is ?
But I digress .
We 're not talking about anal sex here , are we ?
We 're talking about oral sex , about the blowjob you expect from me because you got me that Amstel Light at the show , when you totally could 've just gone Coors Light .
My hat 's off , sir .
You deserve a treat .
So here goes .
Now that we 've had this little talk , I hope our oral sex experiences can be positive for both of us .
Oh .
One last thing .
I 'm going to swallow , OK ? , and that does n't mean I love you and want to marry you .
That means I 'll taste it less and wo n't have your semen coursing over my tongue as I spit it out .
So do n't read anything into that .
Thanks for listening , and enjoy .

Amanpour of CNN , Robert Fisk of Independent boldy challenge Ahmadinejad in Press Conference
This is an IranNewsNow.com EXCLUSIVE and original report :
In an amazing turn of events after an even more amazing day in the history of Modern Iran , during a live televised Press Conference in Iran , the disputed Ahmadejad was very boldy challenged by Robert Fisk , reporter for the Independent .
He challenged Ahmadinejad with courage .
I will give the FULL TRANSCRIPT of the transaction between the two shortly here on IranNewsNow.com .
Fisk basically asked Ahmadinejad about the recent execution of a 23 year old girl and the Islamic Republic of Iran ’s use of executions and how Iran could ever claim to have justice .
Ahmadinejad replied “ We oppose killing human beings .
In fact we even refuse to kill an ant .
But speaking of judicial systems of other countries they all follow their own rules [ mentions US and Britain ] …
But execution can be used to make people avoid certain crimes …
I try to create the social atmosphere in order to avoid these kinds of crimes .
I will advise the judiciary to resolve this in a lenient manner . ”
Again , I am transcribing the full transaction between Fisk and Ahmadinejad .
I will publish this as soon is I can .
This is breaking news so I am multi-tasking between listening to the conference and typing the report .
Even as I am about to publish this , a reporter from the Economist has challenged Ahmadinejad even more boldy than .
More to come .
[ UPDATE @5:33 AM PT ]
Christian Amanpour asks Ahmadinejad if he can guarantee the safety of Mousavi .
[ UPDATE @5:43 AM PT ]
Christian Amanpour of CNN says , “ You said you are President of all Iranians … .
Mousavi , can you guarantee his safety and why have opposition officials been arrested ? ”
Ahmadinejad ’s reply “ The situation is very good in Iran .
It is the most stable country in the world .
There is rule of law in this country …
All the people are equal …
So some people are becoming excited and having confrontations with the police force .
This is like someone coming out of a stadium and getting into confrontations with the police … they will be fined . ”
She and he get into an actual verbal scuffle .
He angrily replied , “ I answered your question !
It ’s like someone who does a traffic violation !
He will be fined as if he violated the traffic rules …
Of course I am not happy with someone who violates the traffic rules . ”
[ EDIT @6:33 AM PT ]
Added picture of Amanpour to top of post .
More on this report soon .
By Charles Krauthammer - June 19 , 2009
WASHINGTON -- Millions of Iranians take to the streets to defy a theocratic dictatorship that , among its other finer qualities , is a self - declared enemy of America and the tolerance and liberties it represents .
The demonstrators are fighting on their own , but they await just a word that America is on their side .
And what do they hear from the president of the United States ?
Silence .
Then , worse .
Three days in , the president makes clear his policy : continued " dialogue " with their clerical masters .
Dialogue with a regime that is breaking heads , shooting demonstrators , expelling journalists , arresting activists .
Engagement with -- which inevitably confers legitimacy upon -- leaders elected in a process that begins as a sham ( only four handpicked candidates permitted out of 476 ) and ends in overt rigging .
Then , after treating this popular revolution as an inconvenience to the real business of Obama - Khamanei negotiations , the president speaks favorably of " some initial reaction from the Supreme Leader that indicates he understands the Iranian people have deep concerns about the election . "
Where to begin ?
" Supreme Leader " ?
Note the abject solicitousness with which the American president confers this honorific on a clerical dictator who , even as his minions attack demonstrators , offers to examine some returns in some electoral districts -- a farcical fix that will do nothing to alter the fraudulence of the election .
Moreover , this incipient revolution is no longer about the election .
Obama totally misses the point .
The election allowed the political space and provided the spark for the eruption of anti-regime fervor that has been simmering for years and awaiting its moment .
But people are n't dying in the street because they want a recount of hanging chads in suburban Isfahan .
They want to bring down the tyrannical , misogynist , corrupt theocracy that has imposed itself with the very baton - wielding goons that today attack the demonstrators .
This started out about election fraud .
But like all revolutions , it has far outgrown its origins .
What 's at stake now is the very legitimacy of this regime -- and the future of the entire Middle East .
This revolution will end either as a Tiananmen ( a hot Tiananmen with massive and bloody repression or a cold Tiananmen with a finer mix of brutality and co-optation ) or as a true revolution that brings down the Islamic Republic .
The latter is improbable but , for the first time in 30 years , not impossible .
Imagine the repercussions .
It would mark a decisive blow to Islamist radicalism , of which Iran today is not just standard - bearer and model , but financier and arms supplier .
It would do to Islamism what the collapse of the Soviet Union did to communism -- leave it forever spent and discredited .
In the region , it would launch a second Arab spring .
The first in 2005 -- the expulsion of Syria from Lebanon , first elections in Iraq and early liberalization in the Gulf states and Egypt -- was aborted by a fierce counterattack from the forces of repression and reaction , led and funded by Iran .
Now , with Hezbollah having lost elections in Lebanon and with Iraq establishing the institutions of a young democracy , the fall of the Islamist dictatorship in Iran would have an electric and contagious effect .
The exception -- Iraq and Lebanon -- becomes the rule .
Democracy becomes the wave .
Syria becomes isolated ; Hezbollah and Hamas , patronless .
The entire trajectory of the region is reversed .
All hangs in the balance .
The Khamenei regime is deciding whether to do a Tiananmen .
And what side is the Obama administration taking ?
None .
Except for the desire that this " vigorous debate " ( press secretary Robert Gibbs ' disgraceful euphemism ) over election " irregularities " not stand in the way of U.S. - Iranian engagement on nuclear weapons .
Even from the narrow perspective of the nuclear issue , the administration 's geopolitical calculus is absurd .
There is zero chance that any such talks will denuclearize Iran .
On Monday , Ahmadinejad declared yet again that the nuclear " file is shut , forever . "
The only hope for a resolution of the nuclear question is regime change , which ( if the successor regime were as moderate as pre-Khomeini Iran ) might either stop the program , or make it manageable and nonthreatening .
That 's our fundamental interest .
And our fundamental values demand that America stand with demonstrators opposing a regime that is the antithesis of all we believe .
And where is our president ?
Afraid of " meddling . "
Afraid to take sides between the head - breaking , women - shackling exporters of terror -- and the people in the street yearning to breathe free .
This from a president who fancies himself the restorer of America 's moral standing in the world .
In a nation that regularly bows its head in prayer -- and that begins many public meetings with the God- fearing Pledge of Allegiance -- atheists may be coming into their own .
As the National Journal 's Paul Starobin reported last month , exit polling suggests that nonbelievers represent a growing segment of the U.S. electorate .
In every presidential election since 1988 , he wrote , the ranks of what pollsters call " the religiously unaffiliated " has grown .
In 2008 , some 12 % of the electorate -- or 15 million voters -- identified themselves as nonbelievers .
That 's bigger than the Latino vote ( 9 % ) , the gay vote ( 4 % ) , or the Jewish vote ( 2 % ) , and it 's competitive with the African American vote ( 13 % ) .
During George W. Bush 's administration , they chafed at what they saw as the fudging of the line between church and state ( think faith - based initiatives ) .
Now , after President Obama reached out to them with a first - ever mention during his inaugural address ( " We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus — and nonbelievers , " Obama said ) , atheists think the time is right for a return to humanistic principles over religious influences in public policy .
" The climate is right in the country today for a major expansion of humanist ideals and humanist thinking -- atheism , free thought , " Louis J. Appignani , the Florida tycoon who has earmarked $ 30 million for various atheist causes , told the National Journal .
" I think we are on the threshold of a counter - revolution from the Bush years . "
Today the New York Times profiled the Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry in Charleston , S.C. , the beautiful community of southern gentility where the Civil War began .
This time , said the group 's founder , the mission is not to declare war but to declare themselves .
“ It ’s not about carrying banners or protesting , ” said Herb Silverman , a math professor at the College of Charleston who said the group has about 150 members on the coast of the Carolinas .
“ The most important thing is coming out of the closet . ”
Silverman said that 10 national organizations of " atheists , humanists and free - thinkers " recently united to form the Secular Coalition for America , pooling resources to lobby in Washington for separation of church and state .
And you know how that goes .
Once you have a lobbyist in Washington , you have power and influence .

I love Tattoos !
Always have , always will .
I remember the first time I was attracted to a man with tattoos .
I was sweet sixteen .
He was n’t your usual guy with a tattoo , we nicknamed him ‘ tattoo man ’ because his entire upper body was inked .
He used to hang out at the Canyon in the summer and cliff dive , shirtless of course .
I think he was my first real crush , the kind that makes you feel weird inside .
I had never met anyone who had a tattoo let alone a body full of them .
I am intrigued by tattoos and the reasons men and women get them .
The stories and meanings behind them can be so moving and inspiring or just plain quirky and odd .
I have decided to do a history of the tattoo for a post once a month until we cover the many styles and types of tattoos .
‘ A really good friend of mine ’
Scott has his upper body inked with what I think is the most incredible tattoo I have ever seen .
The process from start to finish took months of preparation because the entire tattoo was created from his vision .
He went through the creative process with the artist Cristoffer Fulton .
Cristoffer passed just days after the vision was complete .
His memory will forever live on in the art he has created .
There is a unique story here that I hope to share with you one day .
The word tattoo is said to have two major derivations , from the Polynesian word ‘ ta ’ which means striking something and a Tahitian word ‘ tatau ’ which means ‘ to mark something ’ .
The history of tattoo began over 5000 years ago and is as diverse as the people who wear them .
Polynesian ~
In pacific cultures tattooing has a huge historic significance .
Polynesian tattooing is considered the most intricate and skillful tattooing of the ancient world .
Polynesian peoples , believe that a person ’s mana , their spiritual power or life force , is displayed through their tattoo .
The vast majority of what we know today about these ancient arts has been passed down through legends , songs , and ritual ceremonies .
Elaborate geometrical designs which were often added to , renewed , and embellished throughout the life of the individual until they covered the entire body .
In Samoa , the tradition of applying tattoo , or ‘ tatau ’ , by hand , has long been defined by rank and title , with chiefs and their assistants , descending from notable families in the proper birth order .
The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs , typically conducted at the onset of puberty , were elaborate affairs and were a key part of their ascendance to a leadership role .
The permanent marks left by the tattoo artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions .
The Hawaiian people had their traditional tattoo art , known as ‘ kakau ’ .
It served them not only for ornamentation and distinction , but to guard their health and spiritual well - being .
Intricate patterns , mimicking woven reeds or other natural forms , graced men ’s arms , legs , torso and face .
Women were generally tattooed on the hand , fingers , wrists and sometimes on their tongue .
I will be inking my body at some point this year but it wo n’t be on my tongue !

$ 250,000 reward in phone cable vandalism TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Investigators review video , track down leads
Image 1 of / 14 Caption Close $ 250,000 reward in phone cable vandalism 1 / 14 Back to Gallery
Authorities hope a quarter - million - dollar reward will shake loose a tipster to lead them to the vandals who severed underground fiber - optic cables , cutting off phone service for tens of thousands of people and disrupting life throughout southern Santa Clara , Santa Cruz and San Benito counties .
Investigators said Friday they are tracking down at least 10 leads and reviewing traffic - camera footage taken near one of four sites where the cables were cut Thursday in hopes of a breakthrough .
AT&T , which owns many of the severed cables , increased the $ 100,000 reward it offered after the cables were sabotaged to $ 250,000 on Friday , an incentive that police believe will be compelling .
" This case is going to be solved through a citizen contact , " said San Jose police Sgt. Ronnie Lopez , calling the reward " huge . "
No suspects have been named .
Police revealed little about the investigation , saying some physical evidence had been found but providing no details .
The sabotage crippled parts of the three counties .
Public safety crews that rely on 911 calls , hospitals trying to access medical records and people who wanted to make a landline or cell phone call , use an ATM or make a purchase with a credit card found services down .
Repairs were completed , and full service was restored early Friday , about 24 hours after the first problems were reported .
Although many people trying to get emergency help via 911 were unable to do so for much of Thursday , officials were cautiously optimistic that no major problems had gone unreported .
" We 've been running around doing a lot of service calls , but nothing as far as any major crime or emergency that was discovered , " said Santa Cruz County sheriff 's Sgt. Christine Swannack .
Lifting manhole covers
Most of the 10 severed fiber - optic cables were in San Jose , where the first four were cut shortly before 1:30 a.m.
Thursday in an underground vault along Monterey Highway north of Blossom Hill Road .
Those belong to AT&T .
Four more underground cables , at least two of which belong to AT&T , were cut about two hours later at two locations near each other along Old County Road near Bing Street in San Carlos , authorities said .
Two others were cut in south San Jose .
Each time , the vandals had to pry up manhole covers , climb down into vaults and chop through the thick cables .
Considering their importance to public safety and the economy , fiber - optic cables are not highly secured .
The manholes are on public streets , and their covers generally are not that difficult to remove .
The typical manhole cover , a 250 - to 350 - pound disc of cast iron , can be removed with the use of a J - hook , a steel pole with a hook at one end , or any similar tool .
AT&T spokesman John Britton said the vandals must have had access to such tools , but he declined to discuss what extra security precautions the company 's manholes had , if any .
There are ways to deter thieves - or fiber - optic cable cutters - from getting into manholes , said Luke Menchl of the Neenah Foundry in Wisconsin , one of the nation 's largest manufacturers of manhole covers .
Manhole covers can be locked with five - or six - headed bolts that require special tools to remove , he said .
For those who want more security , there 's a lock that Menchl likened to " a big security lug nut on expensive automobile wheels . "
" U.S. embassies use them , " Menchl said .

Contract talks
The sabotage in the South Bay came as AT&T was negotiating with the Communications Workers of America for a contract covering more than 80,000 employees , who have been working under their old pact since it expired Sunday .
" We are working under an expired contract and are prepared to strike at any time , which makes the timing of this vandalism difficult for us , " said Libby Sayre , a regional director for the union .
" Neither the union nor its members are involved in this in any way , " she said .
" Our members spend their lives keeping up the equipment .
We 're confident they did n't do this . "
Sayre said AT&T brought in contract workers earlier this year to work on fiber - optic cables in the South Bay , apparently to prepare them to take over in the event of a strike .
" There are nonunion employees who have access to the sites and the information to do this , " Sayre said .
Britton said he had no specifics on contractors who have worked in the area .
" AT&T has used vendors at many times when different things come up , " Britton said .
" Do we have contingency plans for possible labor issues ?
Yes . "
FBI agents are helping San Jose and San Carlos police with the " tedious , methodical process " of running down leads , Lopez said .
The vandals could face federal and state charges .
In San Carlos , investigators reviewed footage from a red - light enforcement camera a few blocks from where the cables were cut in case the vandals were somehow recorded passing through , Cmdr. Rich Cinfio said .
" Everything 's a possibility right now , " Lopez said .
" We 're going to expect the unexpected . "

Copy and Paste
My favorite new feature in iPhone OS 3.0 is the combination of text selection and cut / copy / paste pasteboard commands .
I started using the developer program iPhone OS 3.0 seeds in March , but , initially , only on my old original iPhone .
But by mid-April I had installed OS 3 on my primary iPhone 3G , warnings regarding relying on the beta OS be damned .
1
The selection and pasteboard features were simply too good , too useful , to go back to using an iPhone without them .
One way I use my iPhone to actually “ work ” is with Movable Type ’s excellent iPhone - optimized web app interface , with which I can post and edit items to Daring Fireball .
I would n’t want to write a full - length essay with my thumbs , but it works great for posting short Linked List items .
I post new links to DF from my iPhone more frequently than you might imagine .
I no longer lug my MacBook Pro around during the day at conferences such as WWDC , for one thing , and my iPhone is often all I have with me when I ’m traveling with my family .
Just about any time I ’m out of my regular routine , it ’s all iPhone , all day .
The basic post - to - DF - from - my - iPhone workflow is like this :
I have a page open in MobileSafari that I want to post as a link to DF .
I invoke a customized bookmarklet in MobileSafari .
This bookmarklet sends me to the “ create new entry ” page on my installation of Movable Type , with the fields for the entry title and link URL pre-populated with the title and URL of the page in MobileSafari to which I ’m linking .
I almost always edit the title , but the big score is having the URL field populated automatically by the bookmarklet .
Prior to the arrival of copy - and - paste in OS 3.0 , the only other way I could have gotten the URL from one page in MobileSafari to the link URL field in Movable Type in a second page in MobileSafari would have been to type it out by hand — painstaking and error - prone .
And but then what about creating additional links within the body of the entry ?
In those cases I was stuck doing it the pain - in - the - ass way .
More often than not , I ’d just not add any additional links to the entry , even if I wanted to .
And blockquotes — cited passages from the page being linked to — were pretty much out of the question .
Without copy - and - paste , the only accurate way to quote even just a few sentences from one web page and insert them in the DF entry would have been to transcribe the passage by hand with paper and pen , then re-type the passage on the iPhone .
The copy - and - paste implementation in iPhone OS 3 has put an end to that .
It ’s everything I hoped for , and I use it all the time .
Do I wish this had been in the iPhone all along ?
Or that it had come a year ago in iPhone OS 2 ?
Sure .
But , as I wrote two years ago , given the way that most simple gestures had already been assigned in the iPhone OS user interface , it was n’t obvious or easy at all to see how text selection and copy / paste should have been added to the iPhone .
( And as much as I wanted the feature , I fully realized that most iPhone users do n’t publish full - time weblogs and therefore did n’t need the feature nearly as much as I do . )
The two main problems Apple needed to solve were ( a ) how to allow for the selection of a range of text , and ( b ) how to invoke cut / copy / paste commands on a system without a keyboard and without a menu bar .
Their solution to ( a ) was to make selection an extension of the existing magnifier loupe interface for placing the insertion point .
Their solution to ( b ) was to present the commands in what is effectively a pop-up contextual menu that appears only when you have made a selection or moved the insertion point .
It all seems fairly obvious once you ’ve used it , but there was nothing obvious about it before it was designed .
This is one area where Palm , in designing the WebOS interface , could n’t study what Apple had done ( because Apple had n’t shown it yet ) and had to devise their own implementation .
Despite the numerous fundamental similarities of the iPhone and WebOS interfaces , text selection and Cut / Copy / Paste are quite different on the Pre .
( And , I must say , in my 30 minutes or so of tinkering on the Pre , inferior to the iPhone ’s , especially with regard to selecting text . )
That we had to wait two years for the iPhone ’s text selection and pasteboard is a good example of one aspect of the Apple way : better nothing at all than something less than great .
That ’s not to say Apple never releases anything less than great , but they try not to .
2
This is contrary to the philosophy of most other tech companies — and diametrically opposed to the philosophy of Microsoft .
And it is very much what drives some people crazy about Apple — it ’s simply incomprehensible to some people that it might be better to have no text selection / pasteboard implementation while waiting for a great one than to have a poor implementation in the interim .
It ’s hard to prove that good is the enemy of great , but the evidence speaks for itself .

That proposal and its counterpart in the House , sponsored by Republican Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia and Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee , have been stymied for two years principally by the adamant opposition of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
So far , Obama has not challenged her , even though he knows as well as anyone that significant steps to avoid a succession of trillion - dollar annual deficits when we emerge from this recession clearly will require reform of entitlements and taxes .
Last week , in a courageous break with party solidarity , the House majority leader , Steny Hoyer , reiterated his support for the commission idea , suggesting that along with the overall health - care reform Obama has put on the agenda , Congress tackle Social Security .
More and more individual Democrats and Republicans are expressing a readiness for such an effort .
In response to Hoyer 's speech , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , who traveled the country last year with John McCain , told my Washington Post colleague , Lori Montgomery , " I think we can get double - digit Republican support for a reasonable compromise . "
As if to confirm his words , Republican Sen.
George Voinovich of Ohio and independent Democrat Joe Lieberman of Connecticut introduced an entitlement commission bill of their own last week .
Voinovich told me that he thinks " the prospects for action on the issue are very , very good , because the feeling is growing that we can't sustain the path we 're on . "
When I spoke with Graham by phone , he outlined a plan that would not only embrace Hoyer 's proposals but provide bigger benefits for retirees past 80 " who are outliving their 401 ( k ) s " in increasing numbers .
Graham said that with leadership from Obama , including a barnstorming tour with congressional supporters from both parties , such a compromise could pass Congress this year — with no need for a commission .
But while these Republicans are gung - ho , Hoyer is cautious .
He reminded me in an interview that both Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have thrown cold water on the commission idea , and said that signals from the White House suggest that Obama would not want anything to get in the way of his health care and energy initiatives this year .
If that means more futile gestures , like last week 's tiny budget cuts , the nation — and Obama — will have missed an opportunity .
( Video : CNBC 's Becky Quick discusses the undie indicator . )
During a recession , underwear is among the first things that people stop buying — because hardly anybody actually sees them .
This creates pent - up demand , and so when underwear sales level off and increase , it should signal an uptick in consumer demand .
According to the underwear indicator , an old favorite of Alan Greenspan , there needs to be a return to 2 to 3 percent annual growth in sales in order to claim a recovery .
However , consumer research group Mintel predicted underwear sales will see a continuing decline of 2.3 percent this year and no recovery until 2013 .
But NPD 's outlook for underwear sales offers more hope for the economy .
After a year long , 12 percent decline through the end of January , men ’s underwear sales leveled off in February and March , according to NPD .

The Legislature 's fractured Republican majority struggled Monday to reach a budget agreement , bringing Arizona within hours of a nearly total government shutdown .
With hours remaining before the start of fiscal 2010 , lawmakers had not yet sent a budget to Gov. Jan Brewer .
Without a budget , it is unclear which government functions could continue .
Arizona has never shut down for the lack of a budget , leaving state officials without a clear sense of how to proceed if lawmakers do not reach a deal with the governor .
State agency officials said they would need nearly $ 200 million a month for " essential " services , from the Highway Patrol to keeping prisons open .
But unless a deal is reached , scores of government functions would grind to a halt .
Under plans submitted by agencies to the Department of Administration , driver 's licenses would be unavailable , road construction would come to a standstill and reports of child abuse would not be investigated .
Across the state , parks would close , visitation at state prisons would be suspended and the Department of Health Services would be unable to track infectious diseases .
Meanwhile , state employees were uncertain whether medical appointments they make during a shutdown could be billed to their insurers .
Jimmy Chavez , president of the Arizona Highway Patrol Association , said a shutdown could idle nearly half the Highway Patrol .
" It 's an impact to public safety , " he said .
To avoid a shutdown , one of three scenarios would likely need to take place :
��Republican leaders reach a deal with Brewer , the budget is approved and signed , and lawmakers go home for the year .
� �Brewer agrees to sign a portion of the budget bills passed June 4 in order to preserve basic government functions , using her line - item veto to remove portions she opposes .
She could then call a special session to address other budget issues , such as her desire to refer a temporary sales - tax increase to voters .
� �Lawmakers pass a continuing resolution , which would fund limited government operations over a short period .
Senate Appropriations Chairman Russell Pearce said he is working on a plan to keep government operating if there is not a budget agreement by the end of today .
That plan would use the fiscal 2010 budget that lawmakers passed June 4 as a baseline for week - by - week spending .
After one week using the 2010 figures to keep government going , Pearce said , the Legislature would ratchet down the number of services and agencies that are financed .
He did not have details on which non-essential services would be cut .
A continuing resolution would require approval from the Legislature and a signature by the governor .
Because it is an appropriations bill , it would take effect immediately .
But , as of Monday evening , the Governor 's Office had not been briefed on which government functions would be contained in a continuing resolution .
Democrats criticized the slow pace of Republicans ' budget negotiations , saying that their contingency plans for a government shutdown should be made public .
" The citizens of Arizona deserve to know how government would function on at least an emergency basis , " said Sen. Paula Aboud , D - Tucson .
But Sen. Ron Gould , R - Lake Havasu City , said suspending the state 's operations could be necessary to bring Arizona 's expenses in line with revenue .
" We need to right - size Arizona 's government , and we need to do it quickly , " Gould said .
" If we have to shut down government to do that , so be it . "

TEHRAN 
The jokes among Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s detractors are legion .
In one , he looks in the mirror and says , “ Male lice to the right , female lice to the left . ”
In the West , one American tabloid rarely misses a chance to refer to him as “ Evil Madman ” and in the days before his re-election here he was taunted as a “ monkey ” and as a “ midget . ”
But the Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who was announced winner of a second four - year term this week is no cartoon character .
Whether his 63 percent victory is truly the will of the people or the result of fraud , it demonstrated that Mr. Ahmadinejad is the shrewd and ruthless front man for a clerical , military and political elite that is more unified and emboldened than at any time since the 1979 revolution .
As president , Mr. Ahmadinejad is subordinate to the country ’s true authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who commands final say over all matters of state and faith .
With this election , Mr. Khamenei and his protégé appear to have neutralized for now the reform forces that they saw as a threat to their power , political analysts said .

This Victory Stele is unique .
It was usurped by Merenptah from the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III at Thebes , and is dated to the third day of the third month of the third season so it may have been written around the summer of 1207 .
In it , Merenptah lists enemy conquests , but the most interesting reference is a very rare mention of Israel .
It may be the oldest non biblical reference to that country .
Because of this , Merenptah has often been thought to be the pharaoh of the Exodus , though modern opinion leans against such an identification .
In part , the stele states that :
The princes are prostrate saying : " Shalom ! "
Not one of the Nine Bows lifts his head :
Tjehenu is vanquished , Khatti at peace ,
Canaan is captive with all woe .
Ashkelon is conquered , Gezer seized ,
Yanoam made nonexistent ;
Israel is wasted , bare of seed ,
Khor is become a widow for Egypt .
All who roamed have been subdued .
By the King of Upper and Lower Egypt , Banere - meramun ,
Son of Re , Merenptah , Content with Maat ,
Given life like Re every day . "

Keynesianism works in Australia
The economic crisis has , as we ’ve been discussing , raised a lot of interest in Keynesian economics , but so far it ’s been based more on the obvious bankruptcy of alternatives than on successful examples of Keynesian fiscal stimulus .
Although there were some big financial bailouts late last year , few countries engaged in large - scale fiscal stimulus before the first few months of this year ( Obama ’s package was passed in February , and is only now being implemented , so we ca n’t expect to see evidence of impacts on GDP until late this year ) .
Australia went early and hard with a substantial cash handout to households in December 2008 , followed by another round of cash stimulus delivered a month or two ago , and then a large - scale infrastructure program .
The national accounts for the March quarter ( which should include the effects of the first round of stimulus ) have just come out , and show growth of 0.4 per cent , compared to a 0.6 per cent contraction in the December 2008 quarter [ 1 ]
On the face of it , this is a big success for Keynesian fiscal policy .
And , there ’s pretty general agreement that , despite some qualifications and plenty of concerns about the future , the prima facie interpretation is the correct one .
The outcome was helped by fortuitous growth in farm exports and by the fact that , since Australia does n’t have much of a capital goods producing sector , declining investment is largely offset by declining imports of capital goods .
But there is general agreement that the outcome would have been much worse without the stimulus .
The longer - term concerns are of two kinds .
First , independent of Australia ’s policy choices , there are more negative shocks to work their way through the economy .
People are losing jobs , and that will translate into lower demand and weaker future growth .
And the full impact of the slowdown in Asia has n’t yet hit our commodity export sector , which has been relying to a fair extent on contracts signed in the good times .
These concerns are significant , but do n’t affect the argument that fiscal policy has been successful .
The second concern is that we may be buying short term relief at the expense of longer term pain .
As regards the purely fiscal stimulus , this concern seems overstated .
The government has announced a broadly feasible plan to return the budget to surplus as the economy recovers , though higher taxes will almost certainly be necessary .
That presumably means a somewhat slower recovery , but the implied growth path looks a lot better than the one without fiscal stimulus .
The bigger concern relates to the housing market .
Australia had as big a bubble as any country and , although prices have come back a bit , the bubble has definitely not burst .
The government has used subsidies to prop up the bottom end of the market and these are to be phased out over the rest of this year .
Since we never had really bad lending practices , households should be able to absorb a 20 per cent fall in prices reasonably well .
But a bigger fall will cause trouble .
Overall , though , this is the first data point of the current crisis , as regards the effectiveness of Keynesian stimulus , and it is definitely a positive one .
fn1 . Please ignore silly stuff about two negative quarters constituting an “ official ” recession .
Also , these are n’t annualised in the way that is usually done in reporting US national accounts .
Why You Can't Trust Your Mind with Your Diet , Chapter 42 : Researchers have found that college students were three times as likely to order French fries as a side - order if they had the option of salad .

Photo by alisdair .
Sounds strange , until you think about how your deep - down desires for the worst possible food play against your sense of self - satisfaction .
Here 's how the study , soon to be released in the Journal of Consumer Research , played out :
... College students were given one of two menus .
One menu featured French fries , chicken nuggets and a baked potato ; the other included those same items as well as a salad .
The French fries , widely perceived as the least healthful option , were three times as popular with students selecting from the menu that had the salad as they were with the other group .

One researcher suggests that once you see the salad , realize it 's better for you and know that it 's an option , your inner sense of self - satisfaction is triggered , and then ... you let yourself order fries , just because you were oh - so - smart enough to think about the salad , if only fleetingly .
Or , at least , that 's what 's implied .
Nobody could say for certain why this happens , but it 's noted that those participants with the highest degrees of self - control , as measured by a standard test , were the weakest when it came to the potatoes - for - arugula switch - eroo .

The operators of Pirate Bay are standing trial in Stockholm next week .
Yikes , I know , but here 's the scariest part : if Pirate Bay falls , it could be big trouble for BitTorrent as a whole .
Advertisement
P2P researchers crunched the numbers and found that the Pirate Bay 's eight servers are responsible for tracking over 50 % of the internet 's torrents .
Should the Pirate Bay be shut down , the burden then placed on the next - largest BitTorrent trackers would likely overwhelm them , causing a chain reaction that could bring the whole torrenting infrastructure to its knees .
Advertisement
It is unlikely , of course , that BitTorrent as a protocol will fail .
Someone will rise up to take the place of the Pirate Bay , and trackerless torrents are also in the works .
But right now , the entire ecosystem depends on a single site , whose operators are about to go on trial for copyright violations .
Nevertheless , all eyes should be on Stockholm next week if you 're a torrenter .
You can watch the Pirate Bay trial live thanks to Swedish public TV .
And as many of you commenters are pointing out , this of course does not include private trackers , but when considering the ecosystem as a whole , private trackers represent a tiny slice of overall mainstream torrenting traffic .

May 13 , 2009  --
A mid-level Pentagon official working for U.S. Pacific Command now faces criminal charges in an ongoing espionage investigation for allegedly providing classified information to an agent of the Chinese government .
James Fondren served as the Deputy Director of Pacific Command 's liaison office and had a long friendship with Tai Shen Kuo , who was arrested and charged last year for passing sensitive information onto Chinese military and intelligence officials .
Fondren and Kuo were both friends and business associates .
Prior to working at the Pentagon as a civilian , Fondren served as a Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Air Force and retired in 1996 .
Two years later , according to the criminal complaint , Fondren established a consulting company in Virginia whose sole client was Kuo , a naturalized US citizen from Taiwan who lived in Louisiana and ran two companies in the United States .
Kuo is also linked to Gregg Bergersen , a former policy analyst at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency .
Kuo and Bergersen were arrested last February on espionage charges .
Bergersen was accused of providing information on weapon sales to Taiwan and passing military communications security information to Kuo.
Bergersen pleaded guilty to disclosing national defense information in March 2008 and was sentenced to 57 months in prison .
Kuo pleaded guilty to conspiracy to disclosing national defense information a year ago and is currently serving a 15 - year prison term .
The criminal complaint unsealed today alleges that between November 2004 and February 2008 , Fondren provided Kuo with documents he obtained from classified computers at the Pentagon .
Specifically , an FBI affidavit in the case alleges that Fondren provided State Department cables and information on Naval exercises and sold Kuo DoD " opinion papers " at prices ranging from $ 350 - 800 a piece .
Kuo allegedly represented to Bergersen and Fondren that he was passing information he obtained to a high ranking general in the Taiwanese military when in reality according to the FBI he was receiving tasking instructions and what information to collect from a Chinese government official .
According to the FBI , Kuo also maintained offices in China as part of his business ventures .
Kuo and Fondren 's friendship allowed the Chinese agent to stay at Fondren 's house in Annandale Virginia .
According to the affidavit , FBI surveillance conducted on Fondren 's home on March 3 , 2007 establishes that Fondren provided Kuo with a draft DoD assessment of China 's military power and told him , " This is the report I did n't want you to talk about over the phone … .[ if ] people find out I did that , it will cost me my job . "
According to the FBI affidavit , although the Pentagon assessment of China 's military strength was published 3 months later , many items in the draft report were not contained in the public version .
FBI Affidavit
In a statement today , Art Cummings , Executive Assistant Director of the FBI 's national Security Branch said , " The complaint unsealed today alleges that Mr. Fondren conspired to steal our nation 's secrets for a foreign government , placing his own interests over those of the citizens he served as a U.S. Government employee … .
Espionage is a profoundly serious crime . "
Fondren was initially approached by FBI agents in August 2007 , according to an FBI affidavit filed by Special Agent Robert Gibbs .
Fondren told agents he maintained some contacts with foreign military officials and also stated he would never tell anyone anything they could not find by doing their own research from public sources or from newspaper articles .
According to the FBI affidavit , two days after the initial visit from the FBI agents , Fondren e-mailed Kuo alerting him that he had been interviewed by FBI counterintelligence agents : " I could n't determine what they wanted , but I doubt that they are really interested in political , economic and security issues affecting Asian countries …
The discussion seemed to be in a bizarre direction so I wanted you to be aware of my surprise visit in case you get a surprise also ! "
When Kuo was arrested on February 12 , 2008 he was staying as a guest in Fondren 's house in Virginia .
According to the FBI affidavit , " Among his possessions , Kuo had a draft copy of a DOD document entitled " The National Military Strategy of the United States of America 2008 , Version 5 . "
Later that day Fondren was interviewed by FBI agents and told them that he had a copy of the strategy document at his house and had taken it home because he did not have enough time to read it at work .
Fondren is expected to appear before a federal magistrate this afternoon at the federal court in Alexandria .
Asa Hutchinson , the lawyer for Mr. Fondren , was not available for comment .

OTTAWA --
In a significant policy shift , the Canadian government now believes that telling the country ’s taxpayers the future cost of the war in Afghanistan would be a threat to national security , Canwest News Service has learned .
The Defence Department cited a national security exemption when it censored a request under Access to Information by the federal NDP for the military costs of Canada ’s military participation in the NATO - led , United Nations - sanctioned military mission to Afghanistan .
When the NDP asked for the identical figures last year , the military made them public .
Canwest News Service was able to disclose in April 2008 that the yearly incremental cost of the war would top $ 1 - billion for the first time since Canada ’s military became involved in Afghanistan in 2002 .
But this year , military censors cited Section 15 of the act in blocking out the figure .
In a June 3 letter to an NDP researcher , Julie Jansen , the director of the military ’s access branch , cited “ the defence of Canada or any state allied ” with it , in justifying the withholding of the figures for the three next fiscal years .
Section 15 of the act allows the withholding of any “ information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to be injurious to the conduct of international affairs , the defence of Canada or any state allied or associated with Canada or the detection , prevention or suppression of subversive or hostile activities . ”
Jansen also invoked a Section 21 exemption , which gives a government department the discretionary power to disclose records that include negotiation plans , deliberations or consultations , or “ administrative plans that have not yet been put into operation . ”
In an identical request last year , the Defence Department released the estimates for the fiscal years leading up to 2011 , the year that Parliament and the government has said Canada ’s current military mission in Afghanistan must end .
“ In the face of more public interest in the ongoing cost of the war , it is surprising the DND would now take the attitude that now is the time that we will start pulling back on information and not be as transparent as before , ” said NDP defence critic Jack Harris .
Military commanders commonly cite the need to withhold information in order not to give an edge to the Taliban and al - Qaida insurgency , which has gained strength in the Kandahar region in the last three years , driving up the Canadian Forces death toll to 120 .
Usually , the information blackouts cover the exact numbers of troops , tanks and other military assets .
Any mention of future military operations is deemed strictly off limits , and embedded journalists who cover the war in Kandahar sign a waiver agreeing not to publish such information in advance when they learn of it .
The military ’s new secrecy comes after the financial cost of the mission became a major issue for several days during last fall ’s federal election campaign .
During the campaign , after he secured the agreement of all parties including the ruling Conservatives , Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page released a detailed report that suggested the full cost of the mission could reach $ 18.1 - billion by 2011 .
Page ’s study took into account the long - term costs of caring for physically and mentally ill soldiers .
The Rudd Government 's boost to the first - home owners grant stirred up many old wives ' tales that have sustained the great Australian dream of home ownership .
It 's time to dismiss a few of them .
Across the country , baby boomer parents whisper in the ears of their progeny that now is the time to buy .
They warn : " You 'll never get in if you do n't . "
They say : " You 're better off paying off your own mortgage than your landlord 's . "
For those not yet convinced , they resort to the old catchcry : " Rent money is dead money . "
Kevin Rudd Credit : John Shakespeare
What they forget is that average house prices are now seven times the average annual salary , up from about three times when the boomers first bought in .
They forget , too , that in the months since the temporary boost to the first - home owners grant - $ 7000 for established homes and $ 14,000 for new ones - house prices in the sub - $ 500,000 category have ballooned .
Seemingly unaware of the false economy , first - home buyers have engaged in a game of mutually assured destruction , and in fact , have been bidding house prices up .
The British news media has never been so restricted , beset by the laws of an " authoritarian " government , greedy lawyers and dwindling editorial budgets , according to one of the industry 's most important representative bodies .
The Society of Editors has submitted a dossier of evidence to Jack Straw , the Justice Secretary , claiming that " meritorious " articles by local newspapers are increasingly being suppressed because of the danger that legal action would bring ruinous costs .
The dossier also contains examples of published stories exposing the behaviour of MPs , local authority leaders , owners of professional football and rugby clubs , business leaders and television personalities , which have been settled out of court for financial and not legal reasons , in order to avoid the danger of being bankrupted by the fees of the claimant 's solicitors .
Speaking to The Independent on the Society 's tenth anniversary , Robin Esser , executive managing editor of the Daily Mail , calls for a concerted effort to ensure that the concept of freedom of expression comes to be regarded as a constitutional right in Britain , as it is in America .
He says the current threats to a free press are comparable to a many - headed serpent .
" It 's a bit like the hydra , every time you cut off one head two more appear ... we 've got enormous issues at the moment . "

Esser , a former editor of The Sunday Express who is chairman of the society 's parliamentary and legal committee , criticises the police for abusing the Protection against Harassment Act 1997 ( originally introduced to deter stalkers ) and anti-terrorist legislation , in order to hamper the work of journalists .
" Situations occur on a fairly regular basis of photographers being prevented from taking pictures in public places , being arrested and having their film taken away or inspected . "
He complains of " the increasing authoritarianism of the present government which sometimes without realising it , and sometimes realising it , introduces measures which impinge further on the media 's rights and duty to ensure open democracy and open justice " .
Last week the prominent barrister Ken Macdonald , QC , suggested that the recent growth of privacy legislation was strangling the freedom of the press .
" We would pay a very high price indeed for underscoring the marketability of film stars and footballers , " he said .
According to Esser , who has worked in Fleet Street for more than 40 years and reported on the first landings on the moon , " I think we are more restricted now than we 've ever been before " .
The Society of Editors , which represents both newspapers and broadcasters , is concerned that the media , already weakened by the impact on editorial resources of falling advertising revenues , is being further cowed by the danger of incurring huge costs from libel actions brought by solicitors under " no win , no fee " conditional fee agreements ( CFAs ) , which allow successful lawyers to double their charges .
The issue is being investigated under a Litigation Costs Review being conducted for Mr Straw by Lord Justice Jackson .
The society has submitted to both the judge and Mr Straw a dossier which indicates that the local and regional media , in particular , has become terrified of the prospect of finding itself in court .
Cases cited include a light - hearted piece on a local MP 's views on expenses , which he complained about , leading to an out - of - court payment of £ 10,000 plus a bill for £ 26,000 in costs .
Another local paper piece containing comments from a contestant on the BBC show Dragons '
Den , who complained he had not been given the financial support promised by the dragons on screen , led to a settlement of £ 13,000 plus a further £ 7,000 paid in costs , despite the editor being advised that the piece was probably protected by the libel defence of " fair comment " .
A daily paper in the North of England paid out £ 10,000 ( plus £ 7,000 costs ) and made a full apology to a professional rugby league player for the local team who it had criticised after he was suspended for foul play by the league disciplinary committee .
The settlement was in spite of legal advice that a defence of fair comment had " a high prospect of success " .
A Welsh paper which featured a report by a conservation trust criticising plans to develop a building and land once occupied by the poet Dylan Thomas , provoked a writ from the property developer .
On being advised of the potential costs under a CFA – where London solicitors can charge £ 390 an hour and then double the sum with a 100 per cent uplift or " success fee " if they win – the paper caved in , paying £ 10,000 in damages to the property developer and still incurring £ 16,000 in costs .
The threat of a case brought under a CFA is often enough to ensure a story is withheld altogether .
The dossier cites an investigation by a regional Sunday newspaper into a money - making cult , which was not published after the editor was warned that an action would be brought using CFA .
" In the light of this threat , the editor felt obliged to give the undertaking demanded , not because of any concerns about the quality of the journalism , the accuracy of the story , or the public interest , but purely because he feared that an adverse costs order may cause the newspaper to cease publishing , " said the dossier .
The report also cites the suppression of a story about an offshore company bidding to take control of the local football club .
The paper had sought to expose the fact that the company had a subsidiary which had been criticised by business regulators in several EU countries but the article was dropped following a threat of an injunction and libel action .
Tony Jaffa , of Exeter - based solicitors Foot Anstey , who compiled the dossier , says large London law firms have become adept at exploiting the use of CFAs , which were originally introduced to increase public access to justice .
He confirms : " The issue of CFAs has become an important tactical weapon in the litigation process . "
Esser is adamant there has been a " chilling effect " on local papers and their willingness to investigate .
" They will settle or they wo n't print a story which exposes hypocrisy or double dealing or disgraceful behaviour on the part of public servants , and that is a terrible loss . "
The society continues to lobby ministers and their shadow counterparts to remove what it sees as unnecessary shackles on the media .
It was exasperated by a backlash against new plans to allow journalists into Family Courts , with judges and officials seeking to maintain a ban on reporting .
" It 's madness , " says Esser .
" What newspaper has got people to send along to sit in court and not be able to write a story ? "
He is hopeful , though , that progress is finally being made in introducing television cameras into courtrooms .
" We feel that will help open justice and bring instant pictures to the public , just as the people in the public gallery can see what goes on .
The judges fear some sort of OJ Simpson effect but that really is n't going to happen . "
Though proud of the society 's achievements over the difficult past decade , Esser knows that the hydra that threatens freedom of the press is far from slain .
" There will be two more heads tomorrow , " he says .
" We have to remain vigilant . "
JUNE 18 -- Nabbed yesterday for indecent exposure , a Memphis man offered cops a unique explanation for his alleged criminal behavior .
Augustus Hudgins , 41 , was arrested after witnesses reported seeing him " masturbating on the bench in Court Square , " according to the a police affidavit .
When questioned by cops , Hudgins denied fondling himself , explaining instead that he was " giving [ his ] penis some air . "
Despite that claim , Hudgins was booked into the Shelby County jail , where the mug shot at left was snapped .

The Hidden Evil
Those who expose the financial elite typically receive character assassination from radio , TV , print media , official " experts , " and " anti-hate " organizations .
A combination of framings , murders , " accidents , " and lawsuits may occur .
" Educational " material is distributed to law enforcement to help them understand the " paranoid extremists " who believe that multinational corporations are installing a global dictatorship .
Sutton and Wood warned , " Anyone in the U.S. who promotes unwelcome news for the elite receives some unwelcome attention in return . "
This attention includes the use of experts , mainstream media , and anti-hate organizations , for well - coordinated character assassination . (*)
According to author Perloff , a document released by the House Committee on Un- American Activities , on September 23 , 1956 entitled , Propaganda and the Alert Citizen outlined the tactics reportedly used by the Establishment to discredit opposition .
Quoting from this document , Perloff wrote , " The tactic used had a prototype in a directive issued by the Communist Party ...
It read :
When certain obstructionists become too irritating , label them , after suitable build - ups , as Fascist or Nazi or anti-Semitic , and use the prestige of anti-Fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them .
...
In the public mind constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell . "
" Because the Establishment controls the media , " wrote Allen , " anyone exposing the Insiders will be the recipient of a continuous fusillade of [ criticism ] ... from newspapers , magazines , TV and radio .
In this manner one is threatened with the loss of ' social respectability ' if he dares broach the idea that there is organization behind any of the problems currently wrecking America . "
" Smear tactics " from " left and right " are " standard operating procedure , " explained Sutton and Wood .
Even if you do n't believe in the phony left / right political spectrum and have no political affiliation , you may be assigned one .
Then the financial elite can use the opposite political party expressed in the mainstream news for character assassination .
These labels , describe Sutton and Wood , " divert attention from responsible reasoned criticism with no attachment to a synthetic political spectrum . "
" If you assemble the evidence , carefully present your proofs , and try to expose these power seekers , the Establishment 's mass media will accuse you of being a dangerous paranoid who is -- dividing - - our people , " Allen said .
In his book , With No Apologies , Senator Goldwater describes being on the receiving end of the Establishment 's " professional scandalmongers . "
Apparently , because he was not controlled by the Establishment , the New York Times and New York Herald Tribune were used to discredit him during his campaigns .
Perloff wrote , " Barry Goldwater was the Republican nominee and , as such , was the first GOP Presidential candidate in decades it [ the CFR ] had not controlled .
Indeed , Goldwater represented nearly everything the Establishment was against .
For that reason , the mass media was arrayed against him , and he was falsely characterized as a fanatic who would start a nuclear war and snatch social security checks from the elderly . "
Investigations into Crimes and Practices of the Financial Elite are Thwarted -- Witnesses Discredited
DeCamp explained that during his investigation of a child prostitution ring involving Satanism which lead to Washington D.C. , that " Articles began to appear in the Omaha World - Herald , aimed to discredit the witnesses and intimidate any other potential child victim - witnesses from testifying . "
He cites some examples including the World - Herald 's charge that it was a " hoax based on rumor . "
Editorial attacks ensued with titles such as , Grand Jury Did Its Job ; The Insults Are Intolerable , and Schmit Panel Ca n't Duck its Responsibility in Hoax .
The front page of the Omaha World - Herald on July 25 , 1990 ran the headline , Grand Jury Says Abuse Stories Were a Carefully Crafted Hoax .
And an article entitled , Former Legislator 's Angry Memo Turns Sober Nebraska on its Ear , which appeared in the March 17 , 1990 edition of the Kansas City Star , stated that the memo was , spawning swirls of gossip .
The same article described that the accusations against these prominent people was like " insulting God . "
Compare these attacks to the criticism General Butler received by the mainstream news after exposing the plot by Wall Street to overthrow the U.S. Government , or the harassment the Reece Committee received when investigating the Tax - exempt Foundations .
One of the most damaging dirty tricks used against DeCamp was an anonymous complaint from a concerned citizen , which was logged with the Department of Social Services , stating that he and his wife were abusing their daughter .
This tactic was apparently used to stop his investigation and knock him out of the senate race .
The cover -up of a similar event occurred in Minnesota , where prosecutor Kathleen Morris came under savage attack from the media when investigating a child sex ring that was apparently linked to the financial elite .
After experiencing considerable pressure , Morris relinquished the investigation to Attorney General Hubert Humphrey Jr. Humphrey soon closed the case due to insufficient evidence .
When the elite are linked to these types of crimes , evidence become missing , leads are not followed , people are discredited , jailed , disappear , or have accidents .
These occasional leaks are part of a steady stream of corruption that only occasionally surfaces in the mainstream news .
The discrediting and harassment tactics used during these cover-ups can happen anywhere the elite need to eliminate exposure to their activities .
DeCamp calls it an " international organized crime syndicate , engaged in pedophilia , pornography , satanism , drugs , and money - laundering , " which is " protected ... by federal authorities . "
William H. Kennedy describes an organized kidnapping ring in Belgium linked to the financial elite , in his book Satanic Crime : A Threat in the New Millennium .
Using mainstream news , Kennedy explains that during these investigations , the police were consistently incompetent , made frequent mistakes , and failed to follow leads .
These seemingly deliberate acts resulted in further deaths and kidnappings .
The presiding judge , Jean - Marc Connerotte , secured the arrest of suspect Marc Dutroux .
Dutroux escaped from prison once and was poised for a second escape before he was found with a handcuff key .
According to Kennedy , Dutroux provided kidnapped girls to a Satanic cult which included members of the Bilderbergers .
Judge Connerotte required a bulletproof vehicle and armed guards after learning that a contract had been taken out on his life .
He was eventually dismissed from the bench .
The removal of Connerotte , and the cover - up , triggered a peace march by 300,000 outraged Belgians who demanded reform of the political and judicial system .
The Hidden Evil is Beyond a Congressional Investigation
Similar tactics were used during the investigation of the Tax - exempt Foundations and their Think Tank interlocks during the Reece Committee hearings .
Wormser described the violence of the attacks against the committee as " amazing . "
The Reece Committee itself observed that because the Tax - exempt Foundations and Think Tanks control the mainstream news and the government , that they were unable to conduct their investigation .
The committee stated specifically , " The far - reaching power of the large foundations and of the interlock has so influenced the press , the radio , and even the government that it has become extremely difficult for objective criticism of foundation practices to get into news channels without having first been distorted , slanted , discredited , and at times ridiculed . "
In his book , How the World Really Works , Alan B. Jones considers the account of another Reece Committee insider , Norman Dodd , the Research Director .
Dodd attests that death threats , harassment of witnesses , stalking , surveillance , blackmail , and framings were the real reasons the trials were discontinued .
The Reece Committee declared , " The pressure against Congressional investigation has been almost incredible .
As indicated by their arrogance in dealing with this Committee , the major foundations and their associated intermediary organizations have intrenched ( sic ) themselves behind a totality of power which presumes to place them beyond serious criticism and attack . "
Smoot commented , " As we have seen , two different committees of Congress - - one Democrat - controlled and one Republican - controlled - - have tried to investigate the ... tax - exempt foundations which are interlocked with , and controlled by , and provide the primary source of revenue for , the Council on Foreign Relations and its affiliates . "
Smoot continues , " Both committees were gutted with ridicule and vicious denunciation ... by internationalists in the Congress , by spokesmen for the executive branch of government , and by big respected publishing and broadcasting firms which are a part of the controlled propaganda network of the Council on Foreign Relations . "
So according to the results of a congressional investigation , the Tax - exempt Foundations and Think Tanks are beyond investigation .
There was another attempt to investigate the Think Tanks by Congressman Larry McDonald .
" In 1980 , the American Legion national convention passed Resolution 773 , which called for a congressional investigation of the Trilateral Commission and its predecessor , the Council on Foreign Relations , " wrote author Marrs .
" The following year , " proclaimed Marrs " a similar resolution was approved by the veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) . "
" Congressman Larry McDonald , " continued Marrs , " introduced these resolutions in the House of Representatives but nothing came of it . "
Unfortunately Congressman McDonald , who opposed the Establishment , died in a curious incident involving a Russian missile which blew up Korean Airlines 007 on September 1 , 1983 .
The bottom line is simply this :
The Establishment will not allow the various organizations which it controls to stop the Hidden Evil .
According to these researchers , some with first - hand experience , anyone who exposes the activities of the elite usually receives an assortment of character assassination from the mainstream media , anti-hate organizations , and official experts .
Lawsuits may be filed .
An IRS audit may occur .
Other tactics are used , such as being threatened , framed , blackmailed , and murdered .
Accidents which result in death or injury may be reverse engineered to appear as though they were not planned . (**)
Many of these attacks are tactics within the Hidden Evil .
According to the HUAC document , some people are allowed to gain enough momentum until they are in pubic view so they may be smeared by the mainstream media or other organizations under elite control .
By this account , it is probably easier for the elite to ruin famous people , because they require no " suitable build - ups . "
Anyone who falls into disfavor with the elite can be ruined by these methods .
" The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity .
It is more despotic than a monarchy , more insolent than autocracy , and more selfish than bureaucracy .
It denounces as public enemies , all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes . "
- Abraham Lincoln
The Dangers of a Congressional Investigation
Congress , in general , is under the absolute control of this mafia .
As previously demonstrated , this has been accomplished through years of infiltration , blackmail , intimidation and bribery .
The elite , who own the United States , literally , will never allow an investigation into the Hidden Evil .
They will never allow the system which they control to stop this .
A congressional investigation may be done for the deliberate purpose of convincing the general population that it does not exist , and to publicly discredit those speaking about it by portraying them as a few paranoid conspiracy theorists .
Any investigation into the Hidden Evil by congress or another organization under the control of the Establishment will result in a whitewash .
These whitewashes by congress have unfolded repeatedly .
Consider that in addition to the outside attacks , the Reece Committee was also killed from within .
This included receiving " palpably inadequate " funding , a reduction in research staff , denial of evidence , and general stonewalling .
" Mr. Reece understood , soon after our investigation started , if not before , that we would be met with every obstacle which could be put in our way , " stated Wormser .
Other congressional whitewashes include the Roberts Commission ( Pearl Harbor cover - up ) , and the Kerry Subcommittee ( Iran Contra Scandal , Federal Drug Trafficking ) .
The Warren Commission ( investigating the death of JFK ) is said to have been heavily whitewashed , the 9/11 Commission was a whitewash , and the McCormack - Dickstein Commission was partly a whitewash . (***)
Some of these commissions were led by members of the CFR .
The United Nations
If the UN investigated the Hidden Evil it would be a maneuver to whitewash and discredit targets .
According to some researchers , the United Nations is a creation of the CFR .
The UN would like us to believe that they 're an organization that acts as a non-partisan referee , which reluctantly intervenes in world conflicts for the betterment of all parties concerned .
Apparently , the idea is that if enough chaos is caused and the UN is portrayed in a positive manner , then the masses will believe that a world government under the control of the UN is the only hope for world peace .
In a chapter entitled , United Nations and World Government Propaganda , Smoot commented , " All American advocates of supra-national government , or world government , claim their principal motive is to achieve world peace .
Yet , " he says , " these are generally the same Americans whose eager interventionism helped push America into two world wars . "
" By 1945 , the Rockefellers were ready , " wrote Allen .
" Grandson Nelson was one of the 74 CFR members at the founding meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco . "
Perloff added , " Of the American delegates at the founding UN conference in San Francisco , more than forty belonged to the CFR . "
On the left is a March 1947 picture , which shows John D. Rockefeller III presenting UN Secretary General Trygve Lie with an $ 8.5 million dollar check to purchase land for the UN headquarters .
Below it is the founding UN conference on June 15 , 1945 in San Francisco . ( * 1 )
" Nelson and his brothers donated the land for the United Nations complex along the East River in New York , " wrote Allen , and added , " possibly because they did not want the new headquarters of their World Government to be more than a short taxi- ride away from their penthouses . "
Author Marrs portrays the UN as , " an outgrowth of the old League of Nations , " which he describes as a failed attempt at , " world government . "
" A primary mover of this and subsequent actions to establish a United Nations was John Foster Dulles , who had helped found the Council on Foreign Relations , " wrote Marrs .
Marrs continued , " Considering Dulles and the other CFR members [ are ] behind the creation of the UN , it is no surprise to find that organization today supervising the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( commonly called the World Bank ) and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . "
Author Alan B. Jones sums up the UN as a front for the banking elites to be used as the core of a political structure for a world government , using the IMF as the world central bank .
" In 1948 , the State Department created the U.S. Committee for the UN ... as a semi-official organization to propagandize for the UN , " conveyed Smoot .
The CFR dominates this committee , he says .
He also contends that the UN Charter , which the CFR would like to have the US Constitution replaced with , is essentially a charter for enslavement .
" The ' world peace ' aspects of the United Nations were emphasized to enlist support of the American public , " wrote Smoot .
However , he adds , " the UN Charter really creates a worldwide social , cultural , economic , educational , and political alliance -- and commits each member nation to a program of total socialism . "
Project Megiddo
Project Megiddo is described by the FBI as a , " strategic assessment of the potential for domestic terrorism in the United States ... "
The document was apparently circulated to law enforcement throughout the country in 1999 to help identify domestic terrorist activities spawned by the year 2000 craze .
It basically says that anyone who holds , " political beliefs relating to the New World Order ( NWO ) conspiracy theory , " is " paranoid . "
" The challenge to law enforcement , " it states , " is to understand these extremist theories . "
And just what are these paranoid conspiracy theories that the FBI is " educating " law enforcement on ?
According to the FBI , " The NWO conspiracy theory holds that the United Nations ( UN ) will lead a military coup against the nations of the world to form a socialist or One World Government . "
The FBI lists other groups that a paranoid conspiracy theorist might say are part of this socialist overthrow as : the Council on Foreign Relations , the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission .
They add , " Law enforcement officials will probably notice different versions of this theory , depending upon the source . "
They continue , " Law enforcement officers , as well as military personnel , should be aware that the nation 's armed forces have been the subject of a great deal of rumor and paranoia circulating among many militia groups . "
They describe these militias as " Patriots , " and " right - wing " groups who , " believe they are being persecuted by the satanic government of the United States . "
It looks like the CFR - controlled FBI laid the groundwork to portray anyone telling the truth as a dangerous paranoid .
Megiddo is clearly CFR Damage Control .
It seems to be an employment of the tactics contained in the HUAC document that Perloff warned about .
Remember ?
" In the public mind constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell . "
Continuing , they stated , " Use of this term [ New World Order ] within militia circles became more common after President Bush starting using it to refer to ... using international organizations to assist in governing international relations , " and added , " The term One World Government is also used as a synonym for the New World Order . "
According to a document written by Dennis L. Cuddy , PhD , entitled , Chronological History of the New World Order , the term has been used since the mid 30s by a variety of people including multiple members of the CFR such as Nelson Rockefeller , Henry Kissinger , and Richard Nixon .
It has been mentioned in CFR 's publication Foreign Affairs .
H. G. Wells spoke of it , as did Mikhail Gorbachev .
It has been used by George H. W. Bush on multiple occasions .
" The term ' New World Order , ' " says Cuddy , " has been used thousands of times ... by proponents in high places of federalized world government . "
In the last several years it has been used by leaders of a variety of nations who are obviously under the control of the financial elite .
So according to Project Megiddo , the New World Order does exist and is beneficial .
However , when we consider the publications of the " international organizations " that are assisting with " governing international relations " that Bush has been a member of , such as the CFR , the TC , and the Bilderbergers , it becomes clear that their intentions are to reduce civil liberties and merge America into a single world government controlled by them .
It 's obvious to me that Megiddo is disinformation , used for the purpose of discrediting anyone who is attempting to warn law enforcement about the fate of America .
Speaking of Project Megiddo's predecessor , Former FBI Senior Special Agent Ted L. Gunderson wrote , " In 1996 the FBI Phoenix Division issued a pamphlet to local and state law enforcement agencies that set forth the profile of various terrorists in the United States .
...
This profile includes : Defenders of the U.S. constitution against the federal government and the UN ( Super Patriots ) [ and ] ... anyone who makes references to the United States Constitution ... "
He warns , " An active Federal Government Disinformation Program ... was instituted for the purpose of discrediting ... [ people ] who report the truth about the government . "
Apparently , according to Gunderson , federal agencies release these documents as disinformation for the sole purpose of discrediting people who begin to wake up and tell the truth .
I wonder -- if we know that these two documents exist , then is it possible that more damaging information has been given to law enforcement to discredit the truth movement ?
" Distrust of the government by not thousands but tens of millions of U.S. citizens is confirmed in public opinion surveys , " stated Dr. Alexander in his book , Future War .
" Many of these conspiracy theory adherents believe that the government -- or some other supranational organization -- is attempting to take freedom away from citizens . "
As expected , he lists these supranational organizations as , the Trilateral Commission , the Bilderbergers , and the Council on Foreign Relations , and The Order of Free and Accepted Masons .
He continues , " Some of them see non-lethal weapons as tools to facilitate those objectives .
They believe that these weapons potentially could be used to enslave them ... "
" Such systems , " he says , " are usually rumored to be designed and controlled by some unspecified ' They ' who are the ultimate powerbrokers . "
Evidence has already been provided which undeniably proves that the Trilateral Commission , and the Council on Foreign Relations have infiltrated the executive branch .
I wonder how many of those tens of millions of conspiracy theorists are targeted but do n't know it .
False Memory Syndrome Foundation
According to some researchers , one example of an organization that was launched for the sole purpose of discrediting people is the False Memory Syndrome Foundation ( FMSF ) .
In his book , Mass Control : Engineering Human Consciousness , author Jim Keith refers to the FMSF as a " pseudo - scholarly " front organization , consisting of " a group of psychiatrists whose mission is to prove that cult abuse and mind control are figments of the imagination . "
According to Keith , many of the psychiatrists on the FMSF board have been linked to mind - control experiments and the military .
They are called in to court cases to discredit ritual abuse survivors .
Author Constantine 's analysis is similar , he proclaims that the FMSF consists of a panel of experts which are used to discredit therapists and victims that come forward with cases of Satanic Ritual Abuse ( SRA ) and experimentation .
Professor Jennifer J. Freyd explains in her book , Betrayal Trauma , how the FMSF , her colleagues , and the mainstream media attempted to discredit her research into repressed memories .
Her mother , Pamela Freyd , a founding member of the FMSF , also participated in the attacks against her credibility .
In their book , Trance Formation of American , Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips arrive at the same conclusion .
These and other authors contend that the CIA found it necessary to create this professional organization in order to discredit abuse claims .
Mainstream News is Used to Discredit Targets
Anytime mainstream media addresses an issue like this there is a very real danger of it being an attack .
This was clearly the case with The Washington Post 's January 14 , 2007 article , entitled , Mind Games , or more appropriately , it should have been called , Word Games .
Catherine Graham , the owner of The Washington Post , is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission , and the Bilderbergers .
The Post and most other mainstream news are controlled by the very elite Think Tanks that I 'm alleging are responsible for this covert war against the civilian population .
While I can't say for sure how this story was arranged , my guess is that representatives from the Post approached some TIs and portrayed themselves to be genuinely interested in covering the issue .
Naturally ,
TIs anxious to get the word out , cooperated .
But what resulted was a standard discrediting article .
Although it did explain that thousands of people in the NATO countries claim to be targeted , it basically described them as delusional .
Some common tactics to discredit are to portray facts as beliefs , to ignore evidence , and portray people as a haters or paranoids .
This article has done all three .
They realize that most of their readers wo n't research this story for themselves .
Also , no websites devoted to this phenomenon were listed so their readers could follow - up .
" The idea of a group of people convinced they are targeted by weapons that can invade their minds has become a cultural joke , " they wrote .
Referring to targeted people they stated , " In their esoteric lexicon , ' gang stalking ' refers to the belief that they are being followed and harassed : by neighbors , strangers or colleagues who are agents for the government . "
Notice how they used the word , " belief . "
The article continued , " Gloria Naylor , a renowned African American writer , seems to defy many of the stereotypes of someone who believes in mind control . "
Once again , playing games with words .
In this case implying that mind - control is just a belief and that projects such as MKULTRA did not take place .
This is not a belief , it 's a fact .
Later in the article they acknowledged MKULTRA but portrayed it as simply an , " infamous CIA program that involved , in part , slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims . "
No mention was made of the other " parts , " such as the children who were sexually abused , or of the other people who were brutally tortured and had their lives destroyed .
This filtering out of information is basically , lying .
They described one TI , probably an informant , who " criticizes what he calls the ' wacky claims ' of TIs who blame various government agencies or groups of people without any proof . "
Of course this torturous program has not been proven in a court of law .
And for reasons previously mentioned -- it never will be .
But there is plenty of evidence that it exists .
The article went on to describe the TI mentioned above ( a doctor ) , who was " hoping to prove that V2 K , the technology to send voices into people 's heads , is real . "
Once again , playing games with words .
As previously demonstrated , mainstream publications announced that V2 K was possible in the 70s .
Once more , turning a fact into an opinion or belief .
They are fully aware that most people either do n't have the time or the inclination to do the research .
Of course no hit story would be complete without the Establishment 's use of official " experts " who assist them in damaging potential witnesses .
Regarding MKULTRA , the article quoted from their interview with Dr. John B. Alexander , one of the alleged creators of this program .
They wrote , Alexander acknowledged that " there were some abuses that took place , " but added that , on the whole , " I would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water . "
More games with words .
First , dismissing MKULTRA as just " some abuses , " leads those who have not studied it ( most of their readers ) to conclude that there were a few slip - ups in an otherwise beneficial program .
Second , implying that it stopped .
Funny , Dr. Alexander must know that it continues in its advance form .
As I 've demonstrated , he and his colleagues helped create these weapons on behalf of their CFR handlers , for the " New World Order " which they 've trumpeted in their articles .
The Post continues citing more " experts . "
" Ralph Hoffman , a professor of psychiatry at Yale who has studied auditory hallucinations , regularly sees people who believe the voices are a part of government harassment , " they said .
" Not all people who hear voices are schizophrenic , he says , noting that people can hear voices episodically in highly emotional states .
...
People who think the voices are caused by some external force are rarely dissuaded from their delusional belief , he says . "
Quoting Professor Hoffman , they wrote , " These are highly emotional and gripping experiences that are so compelling for them that ordinary reality seems bland . "
There are several assumptions that most readers of this statement will come away with .
First , that V2 K does n't exist .
Second , that all people complaining that an available technology is being used to harass them are definitely delusional .
Third , that the government has not targeted the civilian population with advanced technology in the past .
Continuing their assault , they stated , " Scott Temple , a professor of psychiatry at Penn State University who has been involved in two recent studies of auditory hallucinations , notes that those who suffer such hallucinations frequently lack insight into their illness .
Even among those who do understand they are sick , ' that awareness comes and goes ...
People feel overwhelmed , and the delusional interpretations return . ' "
So , Professor Temple studied auditory hallucinations , but did he study a technology that can cause them ?
The article does n't say .
Once more , the implication is that it does n't exist and that all of those complaining about it are delusional .
Remember , doctors are highly complicit in the cover - up of this program .
In addition , as previously demonstrated , the elite - owned Tax - exempt Complex provides the grants to these professors to do research projects with pre-determined outcomes .
In other words , when the Establishment wants an official " expert " to prove a point , they 'll provide them with grants to carry out a project which they have created .
These college professors are often owned by the Establishment .
" The very ' realness ' of the voices is the issue - how do you disbelieve something you perceive as real ?
That 's precisely what Hoffman , the Yale psychiatrist , points out :
So lucid are the voices that the sufferers -- regardless of their educational level or self - awareness -- are unable to see them as anything but real .
' One thing I can assure you ' Hoffman says , 'is that for them , it feels real . ' "
The people at the Post accomplished their obvious goal .
My guess is that this story ran because information was beginning to leak out to the public .
Summary
Those who expose the financial elite typically receive character assassination from radio , TV , print media , official " experts , " and " anti-hate " organizations .
A combination of framings , murders , " accidents , " and lawsuits may occur .
" Educational " material is distributed to law enforcement to help them understand the " paranoid extremists " who believe that multinational corporations are installing a global dictatorship .

At a time when President Obama is trying to convince opponents in the abortion battle that they can find middle ground -- in rhetoric , if not reality -- a new Gallup Poll shows that more Americans describe themselves as “ pro-life ” than “ pro-choice . ”
For the first time since it began asking the question in 1995 , Gallup reported Friday , a majority of adults questioned for its annual survey on values and beliefs -- 51 % -- said that when it comes to abortion , they consider themselves “ pro-life ” ; 42 % consider themselves “ pro-choice . ”
( The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points . )
This represents a significant shift , Gallup noted .
As recently as last year , 50 % of respondents called themselves “ pro-choice ” and 44 % identified themselves as “ pro-life . ”
Moderate and conservative Republicans accounted for the change ; Democrats ’ attitudes toward abortion remained constant .
“ It is possible , ” Gallup said in its analysis , that the president “ has pushed the public ’s understanding of what it means to be ‘ pro- choice ’ slightly to the left , politically . ”

Regarding abortion restrictions , the largest proportion of Americans supports legal abortion only in certain circumstances -- as has been true since 1975 -- according to Gallup .
This year the figure is 53 % .
At the ends of the spectrum , the number of people who think abortion should be illegal in all circumstances has risen , to 22 % , and the number who think it should be legal in any circumstances has fallen , to 23 % -- a virtual tie .
In the previous few years , people who opposed all restrictions outnumbered advocates of a total ban by a wider margin .
Still , said Nancy Keenan , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America : “ I am pretty confident that Americans really do n’t want Roe v. Wade overturned . ”
The larger number of Americans calling themselves “ pro-life , ” she said , “ does n’t square with what has happened in the last several elections . ”
Keenan cited the rejection of abortion bans by voters in politically conservative South Dakota in 2006 and 2008 , and the failure of five other antiabortion ballot measures in California , Oregon and Colorado since 2005 .
But antiabortion activists think they have more than the new poll on their side .
“ This is n’t new , ” said Charmaine Yoest , president of Americans United for Life .
“ It tracks pretty much with what we ’ve always known : People generally are pro-life depending on how you ask the question . ”

The poll comes at a delicate moment for Obama , who campaigned saying abortion should be “ safe , legal and rare . ”
During his first three months in office , he took a number of steps that infuriated abortion foes .
For example , he lifted abortion restrictions on foreign family - planning groups that receive U.S. funding , and he ended President George W. Bush ’s ban on embryonic stem cell research .
But Obama has tried at times to appease opponents of abortion rights .
Last month , he backpedaled on a campaign vow to enact the Freedom of Choice Act , which would guarantee the right to legal abortion even if Roe vs .
Wade were overturned .
He now says the legislation is not a priority .

But Yoest said abortion foes were not placated .
“ There has been such an avalanche of pro-abortion activity that it ’s jaw - dropping .
It ’s not just that his rhetoric does n’t square with reality ; the gap is Grand Canyon - size .
I think this administration has fundamentally miscalculated how out of step they are with the American people . ”

The " cash yield " from these numbers is much higher than the dividend yield for the market as a whole , confirming the intuition that our dividends - only calculations were extremely cautious .
For the market as a whole , the nominal growth rate for cash flow has been about 10 percent annually since the Second World War , as against a 7.3 percent growth in earnings ( using the Shiller data ) over this period ; for the past twenty years cash flow has grown at 12.5 percent , and earnings have grown at 6.7 percent .
More impressive , for all corporations the average cash - flow yield last year was 3.3 percent , as compared with the 1.5 percent dividend yield we found above .
The cash flow from owning stocks , then , may be more than double the lowly dividends of today , and it has grown faster than dividends as well .
If we use this alternative measure to evaluate how high the market needs to go to reach the PRP , then our conclusions become even more optimistic .
When we used dividends , it looked like the market would have to triple .
By this measure , which gives firms credit for money earned on behalf of shareholders but not paid out in dividends , the market would have to grow by a factor of six , even if we assume that cash flow will grow at about the same rate as dividends have grown in the past .
If we assume that the recent spurt in cash flow will continue , the PRP is even higher .
Our circumspect assumptions show that the PRP is much higher than the market valuation is today , but it cannot be calculated precisely .
For that reason we like to think of the perfectly reasonable price as defining the upper boundary of a " comfort zone . "
As long as you are a long - term investor with a diversified portfolio , you should not be concerned about warnings of overvaluation or manias or bubbles — provided that P / Es are under 100 and the Dow is below 36,000 .
One common warning is that stocks will fall as interest rates rise .
But unless the rate increase is dramatic and long - lasting , we are not greatly concerned .
The reason is that our theory depends on the level of real interest rates , which have been steady throughout modern U.S. history .
For example , if the nominal interest rate on Treasury bonds shoots up to eight percent , the reason for the rise will almost certainly be that investors are worried about higher inflation and are demanding extra compensation for lending their money to the government .
But higher inflation would also push up revenues , earnings , and dividends for corporations , so the increase would not change our bullish story .
If , however , inflation stays in check but interest rates climb to , say , 10 percent , then real rates will have reached a point where stocks are no longer cheap compared with bonds .
That is very much a long shot .
We can't know whether the PRP for the Dow is really 27,000 or 54,000 .
However , we are sure of two things : thinking about stocks in the way we have described forces investors to ask the right questions , and anyone who claims that the market is too high today is viewing matters from an outdated and flawed perspective .
The Decline of the Risk Premium
INVESTORS are n't familiar with our PRP calculations , and they 've been warned constantly that they are overvaluing the market , yet they have bid stock prices up dramatically .
Why ?
Earlier we presented evidence that stocks are less risky than bonds in the long run .
We decided to make the cautious assumption that stocks and bonds are equally risky ; then the PRP of a stock is the one that produces a flow of cash over time that equals the flow of cash from a Treasury bond .
But we have also shown that in the past investors who have owned stocks have put much more cash in their pockets than those who have owned bonds .
Remember that to find out the returns you can expect from a stock , you simply add the dividend yield to the anticipated growth rate of dividends .
That number has typically been much higher than the yield on a Treasury bond , whose interest payments do n't rise over time .
For example , early this year the stock of AlliedSignal , Inc. , a diversified manufacturer that makes aerospace and automotive products , was paying a dividend of 68 cents a year and trading at $ 45 a share , for a yield of about 1.5 percent .
The growth rate of the company 's dividends was projected at 11.5 percent .
Add 1.5 percent and 11.5 percent and you get the expected cash return from the stock — 13 percent .
Meanwhile , a long - term Treasury bond was yielding 5.5 percent .
Think of the 13 percent cash return on AlliedSignal stock as exactly comparable to the payments from a risky bond paying a fixed rate of 13 percent .
For a risky bond , that extra 7.5 points over the Treasury rate is called the risk premium , and so it is for the risky stock .
It is the extra cash flow that investors demand to compensate them for the extra risk of owning stocks instead of Treasury bonds .
But wait .
In truth there is no extra risk in stocks .
On average , stocks are actually less risky than bonds over long horizons .
But investors have historically not believed this .
They have perceived that stocks were riskier , so they have demanded higher returns .
How much higher ?
No official risk - premium figure is reported every year , but by making some assumptions we can construct a series — a historical record .
Once again using the raw data compiled by Robert Shiller , we can go all the way back to the 1870s .
The risk premium is the number of percentage points you have to add to the Treasury - bond rate in order to make the total equal to the dividend yield for stocks plus the growth rate of dividends .
It is easy to find the bond rate and the dividend yield , but we have to guess what people expected that the growth rate of dividends would be each year .
For simplicity we made the assumption that the expected growth rate was a consistent six percent — about the average for the entire postwar period .
Take a year when the dividend yield was three percent and the bond rate was five percent .
Yield ( three percent ) plus the growth rate of dividends ( six percent ) equals nine percent .
Subtract the bond rate ( five percent ) from nine percent and you get an estimate of the risk premium : four percent .
Now look at the actual results .
From 1872 to 1929 the risk premium averaged 6.5 percent a year .
The 1929 crash scared investors so badly that they boosted the premium even higher .
From 1933 to 1950 it hovered around 11 percent .
As the Second World War ended and the economy picked up , fears began to diminish , and during the 1950s the average premium dropped to about 9.5 percent .
In the 1960s it continued to fall .
The rate then fluctuated wildly as Paul Volcker , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , launched a war against inflation by hiking interest rates and creating enormous uncertainties .
But the premium fell all the way down to about 2.5 percent in the late 1990s .
What happened as investors wised up to reality ?
They gradually bid down the irrationally high risk premium .
What does this do to stock prices ?
Say you own a house in northern California in a neighborhood that everyone believes is an earthquake zone .
You rent out the house for $ 500 a month , or $ 6,000 a year — the going rate in that part of the country .
The market value of the house is $ 60,000 — a relatively low figure , because of the threat of quakes and the risk of losing the entire investment .
Therefore the annual return on your investment , if the investment is the value of the house , is 10 percent ( $ 6,000 divided by $ 60,000 ) .
Suddenly a new seismological study is released showing that in fact the neighborhood is not in an earthquake zone , so the risk of losing your house in a catastrophe plummets to practically zero .
The value of the house soars to $ 100,000 .
The income from the tenant , however , remains the same : it was set by the market , because the tenant could always move to another neighborhood .
Therefore your annual return is now six percent ( $ 6,000 divided by $ 100,000 ) .
This is a good illustration of what happens to the risk premium after a shift of perception .
The risk - free rate of return on the house turned out to be six percent , but you were getting a return of 10 percent when it appeared that you were in an earthquake zone .
So you were receiving a risk premium of four percentage points .
As the risk was unmasked as illusion , the premium vanished .
The value ( or price ) of the house rose , and the return fell .
This is exactly what has been happening in the stock market .
On average the risk premium has historically been about seven percent , and its sharp decline is what has been propelling stocks higher in the bull market of the late twentieth century .
Changes in other elements in the equation have been slight .
Although many analysts talk about the growth in corporate profits , the truth is that dividend increases have been remarkably steady .
Earnings growth has been fairly regular as well , and though nominal bond rates have gone up and down , the real rate has been notably consistent .
No , it is the declining risk premium that explains the market 's boom .
The historically high risk premium has posed a major intellectual challenge to financial scholars for a long time .
Hundreds of academic papers have offered explanations , but none has received wide acceptance .
Why has the risk premium now dropped ?
Scholars are again at a loss .
Without a theory , the experts have to fall back on the argument that the 458 percent return that was produced by the market from June of 1989 to June of this year reflected a temporary euphoria over stocks , and that the historical risk premium accurately reflects people 's preferences , as irrational as they may appear .
Investors are naturally scared to death of stocks , according to this view , and a huge correction is coming , in which the risk premium will revert to its historical norm .
If the risk premium did return to normal , the carnage would be devastating .
Add a seven percent risk premium to a 5.5 percent Treasury yield and you get a 12.5 percent target for the sum of the dividend yield and the growth rate of dividends .
Assume that growth is 6.5 percent — the yield would have to quadruple , from 1.5 percent to six percent .
For that to happen , stock prices would have to fall by 75 percent .
A $ 100 stock paying a $ 1.50 dividend would drop to $ 25 a share .
We are n't worried about a return to an absurdly high risk premium , however , because we have a different explanation for what has happened over the past few decades .
We see the decline in the risk premium as reasonable and long - lasting , not as insane and transitory .
Investors have gradually learned about stocks and how their prices move over time .
The prices that held in the past reflected an irrationally high aversion to risk as we measure it today , but in the past our understanding of risk and its calculation was in its infancy .
As stock ownership expands , so does education by mutual funds , banks , brokerage firms , journalists , and scholars .
Research is far better today than it was in the past , and it is easily disseminated on the Internet .
Seventy years ago few investors understood that excessive trading undermines profits , that stock - price fluctuations tend to cancel themselves out over time , making stocks less risky than they might appear at first glance , and that it is extremely difficult to outperform the market averages .
American investors have learned to buy and hold .
Over the past few decades investors have entered the stock market the way a cautious child enters cool water .
First he puts in a toe and pulls back .
Then he tentatively submerges his foot and leaves it there .
Then he wades in up to his knees , to his waist .
At last he dives in .
Americans are now diving into the stock market , having found that the water 's fine .
Having survived a 508 - point drop in the Dow in a single day in 1987 , a 554 - point drop in a single day in 1997 , and an 1,800 - point drop in just six weeks in 1998 , they feel that the risks are not nearly so great as they feared .
They are using their resources and energy to learn about stocks and the best strategies for owning them .
It makes good sense that such efforts would push the price of stocks toward the PRP .
As the information has arrived , investors have brought their beliefs up to date and become more willing to hold on to stocks .
To believe that the market is overvalued , you have to believe that the risk premium , once irrationally so large and getting rationally small , will become irrationally large again .
It is our strong belief that the risk premium will continue to shrink , and for good reasons .
The best reason is the one that has prevailed for the past 200 years : stocks are actually less risky , in the aggregate and over the long term , than bonds .
Every time an analyst says that P/E ratios are too high today in the light of historical experience , she is implicitly saying that the risk premium is too low .
In other words , she expects investors to go back to the days of being irrationally risk - averse .
Maybe they will — but we strongly doubt that the profitable lessons of the contemporary stock market , once learned , will quickly be unlearned .
Ralph Nader , Counterpunch
- Single payer is only supported by a majority of the American people , physicians and nurses .
They like the idea of public funding and private delivery .
They like the free choice of doctors and hospitals that many are now denied by the HMOs .
There are also great administrative efficiencies when single payer displaces the health insurance industry and its claims - denying , benefit - restricting , bureaucratically - heavy profiteering .
According to leading researchers in this area , Dr. David Himmelstein and Dr. Stephanie Woolhandler , single payer will save $ 350 billion annually .
Yet , on Capitol Hill and at the White House there are no meetings , briefings , hearings , and consultations about kinds of health care reforms that reform the basic price inflation , indifference to prevention , and discrimination by health insurers .
There is no place at the table for single payer advocates in the view of the Congressional leaders who set the agenda and muzzle dissenters .
Last month at a breakfast meeting with reporters , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) responded to a question about health care with these revealing and exasperating words : " Over and over again , we hear single payer , single payer , single payer .
Well , it 's not going to be a single payer . " . . . Never mind that 75 members of her party have signed onto H.R. 676 - the Conyers single payer legislation .
Never mind that in her San Francisco district , probably three out of four people want single payer .
And never mind that over 20,000 people die every year , according to the Institute of Medicine , because they cannot afford health insurance .
What is more remarkable is that many more than the 75 members of the House privately believe single payer is the best option .
Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , Ted Kennedy , and Nancy Pelosi are among them .
But they all say , single payer " is not practical " so it 's off the table .
What gives here ?
The Democrats have the numbers and procedures to pass any kind of health reform this year , including single payer .
President Obama could sign it into law .
But " it 's not practical " because these politicians fear the insurance and pharmaceutical industries - and seek their campaign contributions - more than they fear the American people .
It comes down to the corporations , who have no votes , are organized to the teeth and the people are not .
So , when Senator Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a large recipient of health insurance and drug company donations , held a public roundtable discussion on May 5 , fifteen witnesses were preparing to deliver their statements .
Not one of them was championing single payer .
America 's oil , gas and coal industry has increased its lobbying budget by 50 % , with key players spending $ 44.5 m in the first three months of this year in an intense effort to cut off support for Barack Obama 's plan to build a clean energy economy .
The spoiler campaign runs to hundreds of millions of dollars and involves industry front groups , lobbying firms , television , print and radio advertising , and donations to pivotal members of Congress .
Its intention is to water down or kill off plans by the Democratic leadership to pass " cap and trade " legislation this year , which would place limits on greenhouse gas emissions .
A defeat for the bill would have global consequences .
The international community is depending on America , as the world 's biggest per capita polluter , to set out a firm plan for getting off dirty fuels in the months before crucial UN negotiations in Copenhagen in December .
Without such action , the chances of getting a deal that scientists say is vital to limiting dangerous climate change are much reduced .
Those high stakes have intensified the fight for control over America 's energy future .
" There are an awful lot of people who have an awful lot to gain and lose and they have been acting accordingly , " said Evan Tracey , founder of the Campaign Media Analysis Group ( CMAG ) , who has tracked the proliferation of climate change ads .
But it is an unequal contest .
Liberal and environmental organisations , as well as the major corporations that support climate change legislation , say they are being vastly outspent by fossil fuel interests .
" These guys are spending a billion dollars this year convincing Americans that they are clean , green , cuddly and warm , " said Bob Perkowitz , founder of the eco- America PR firm .
Perkowitz is to brief the White House yesterday on a new environmental messaging strategy .
" The enviros are getting their message out , but they are being outspent by 10 to one . " he said .
On advertising , the ratio is about three to one .
The oil and coal industry spent $ 76.1 m on ads from 1 January to 27 April , according to CMAG data seen by the Guardian .
Environmental groups , led by Al Gore 's Alliance for Climate Protection , the Environmental Defence Fund and the Sierra Club , spent $ 28.6 m on ads in the same period , Tracey said .
Despite its global significance , the fate of the draft " cap and trade " bill now lies in the hands of just a dozen Democrats , who have yet to back Obama 's energy transformation .
The Democratic leadership cannot take their support for granted .
Seven of those pivotal Democrats received campaign donations in excess of $ 100,000 from the oil and gas industry , coal producers , and electricity firms during last year 's elections , according to an analysis provided to the Guardian by the Centre for Responsive Politics .
Another two received more than $ 90,000 last year .
Environmentalists say those Democrats , who hold the balance of power on the committee , pose a far greater threat to the chances of passing climate change legislation than a full vote in the House of Representatives .
" If they can get that bill through the subcommittee what is going to emerge is a piece of legislation , " said Tony Kreindler of the Environmental Defence Fund .
" So this is ground zero for the vote . "

Now , my wife , she is n’t an Atheist ( yet hehe ) .
She says she does n’t know , which is understandable , but that she definitely does n’t believe in Jesus or Christianity .
Now , let me just say , I did n’t have anything to do with this , somehow , some way , we ended up moving away from the faith at nearly the same exact time … one day we were sitting together talking and she brought it up …
I NEVER DID , this was during the time where i could n’t even express all my conflicting thoughts about my faith , so this was a HUGE relief for me .
So anyway , her brother called her Saturday and asked her if she was an Atheist .
Someone told her mother , I do n’t know who .
Now the parents want to have a talk with us .
This ca n’t be good .
It ’s not like I mind a whole lot , I have never really been ashamed of any of my beliefs or Non-beliefs … .
I was just trying to lay the hints in a more gentle manner …
I make jokes and smart remarks about church and Jesus all the time … just waiting for them to put the pieces together .
No one in the family really uses the internet … so i do n’t have to worry about that part … which is why i have been so open here … they do n’t know what Google is …i thought i was safe … why did i let you people on facebook know about this ?
Well at least I do n’t have to worry about being found out anymore huh ?
The reason I did n’t want them to know yet is multifold ; they refuse to listen to anyone , they think I have brainwashed Monica , they think we are going to hell , they want to preach at us , they will want to get their pastor involved to come talk to us…and my biggest concern …is Mema … Monica ’s grandmother …not only will she not understand , it will hurt her and make her anxious — that ’s the last thing i want .
So…i do n’t know if she even knows yet …if they are smart down there they will know better …and anyone else that reads the things I post here will know better too — in other words … keep your mouth shut to her…or anyone connected to her…none of this is her fault and she should n’t be punished for it ( nor should my Wife and I , but we will take it if we must )
I am afraid that Monica ’s parents are going to treat us like we are more social outcasts than we already are …like we are out worshipping Satan ( Ave Natas ) on the weekends , drinking goats blood , and providing free abortions in our home …. well that just isnt the case ( in fact , we are both still pro-life , though she is more adamant about it than I am ) .
Monica and I have always been outcasts , usually because of our viewpoints or faith … you see , when we were fervent Christians , they always thought we took that too far … they went as far to go to the church we attended to make sure that we were n’t joining a cult .
I think the most annoying part of this is that no one in her family , or my family for that matter , has ever been devoted to god , the church , christ , and our faith as we once were .
Her parents honestly are n’t very devoted at all in any way that I have ever seen .
So why would it bother them that we no longer believe ?
I will keep you updated on this …it might get rough .
1 . Buy lettuce by the head , not by the bag or box .
OK , so it may actually take you all of three minutes to cut , wash and dry a head of lettuce compared to buying the pre-washed bag or box , but on average you will save about $ 3.50 - $ 4.50 for the exact same amount of lettuce .
It 's also better for the environment ( not as much plastic being used ) and you probably want to wash the lettuce anyway , regardless of whether or not it 's in a bag or box .
The lettuce will also be fluffier and fresher .
2 . Buy your milk ( & orange juice ) from a convenience store rather than the grocery store .
This may vary depending on where you live , but where I am a gallon of milk in the grocery store ( store brand ) is about $ 3.19 - 3.75 and in the convenience store it is only $ 2.49 .
May not seem like much of a difference , but every little bit helps and in my house ( with 2 kids , 4 people total ) we go through about 4 gallons a week .
That equates to a savings of $ 22.50 per month !
Orange juice is also cheaper as a half gallon is typically $ 3.50 - 3.99 at the grocery store and only $ 2.50 at the convenience store .
3 . Do n't buy perishables in bulk , unless you will use them .
Every time I buy a 5 pound bag of potatoes I use about 1.5 pounds and the rest grows arms before I get to eat it .
I could have saved around $ 2.00 - 3.00 had I just bought the 4 potatoes I ate rather than the big bag that got tossed .
4 . You can also buy celery , carrots , and other veggies in singles .
Just as in point # 3 , if you do n't need an entire bag of celery sticks , do n't buy the whole bag .
Most grocery stores have a separate section where you can buy carrots , celery and other vegetables in any quantity .
Maybe you only need one stick of carrot and one celery for a soup you are making .
You can just buy one of each for a fraction of the cost of an entire bag .
5 . Prepare you vegetables yourself .
I know it is tempting to buy the pre-chopped onions , peppers , and zucchini , but it is a high price to pay to save 5 minutes of your time .
You will save anywhere from $ 2.00 - 5.00 cutting your own vegetables .
If time is a factor , my advice is to prepare all your vegetables ahead of time ( I usually do it after I get home from grocery shopping ) .
Place the vegetables in tupperware ( not plastic bags ) and add a crumbled up paper towel .
The paper towel will absorb the moisture , thus leading to longer shelf life , and your vegetables will be ready to go when you need them .
6 . Do n't buy watered - down juice .
If your a savvy mom or dad ( or at least health - conscious ) and you have heard that your kids should reduce their juice intake , that 's great !
Many companies are cashing in on this and are selling juices that are watered - down .
So you are paying the same amount as the regular juice ( whether in a bottle or in a juice - box ) , but you are getting half the juice and tap water that is free from your faucet .
In other words , the companies are making twice as much money off of you !
Buy 100 % juice ( in its entirety ) and mix it with water at home .
You will save around $ 2.75 to $ 4.99 .
7 . Do n't buy bottled water .
In case you have n't heard , most bottled water is tap water .
Only difference is you pay $ 1.50 per 20 oz .
if it comes in a plastic container .
Drink more water from your faucet , it really is the same quality ( may even be better ! ) .
You will be doing your wallet and the environment a big favor !
If your town water is questionable , you can always buy a water filter for your faucet .
A much more economical answer to filtered water .
If you only drank one 20 oz .
bottle of water a day , this would save you $ 45 per month .
And of course you need at least three times that .
8 . Always look through the flyer and ask the deli clerk , butcher , etc , to see if anything is on sale .
I know I have made the mistake of going to the deli counter , asking for the same meat I always get , just to find out a competing brand is on sale that week for $ 2.00 - 3.00 less per pound .
9 . Try to shop at the same store .
When you know a store 's layout , you spend less .
You 're familiar with the products they carry and spend less time looking for things .
In contrast , when you shop in places you are n't familiar you tend to " look " more and thus buy more because you notice items you have n't seen but want to try .
On average , whenever I venture out to a " new " store , I spend $ 30 more than normal .
Now , if you make every change I just mentioned ( on estimate ) you would save about $ 170 per month !

... Helen Keller
Quoting Helen Keller in a Linux blog may seem strange , but there are many parallels between this magnificent woman and Free Software / Linux .
We both started way behind the competition with handicaps and hindrances that made it almost laughable that we would compete .
First they Ignore you
Then they laugh at you
Then they fight you
Then you win ...
Of course you can only win if you compete .
Common sense .
And not being afraid .
We 've given much thought and study to the dynamics of change ... personal and sociological dynamics .
None here are scholars in the matter but some of us have had the educational background to at least pursue the rudimentary aspects of the topic .
We 've collected some extremely good empirical data , Our assessment of the situation ?
Getting Linux as a viable alternative to Windows on the desktop ?
We 're in for a slog .
But we can win , in time .
Personally , I have all but written off the current generation of computer users .
We have had and will have our victories , but the genius of Bill Gates was not in keeping an operating system cobbled together .
His genius was understanding human nature and behavior .
He only had to hold monopoly status long enough to ingrain Microsoft Windows into our society .
We would do the rest for him .
The Anti Trust sanctions leveled against him pale in comparison to the profits realized by his monopolization of the desktop .
We are lazy , and as a rule , most of us would rather deal with the devil we know than the devil we do n't .
We detest change .
Gates understood that ... and built the most powerful business and political lobby in our history based on that knowledge
So how do we win ?
We start with a clean slate ... the minds of those not yet corrupted .
Minds that can understand freedom without a mental boat anchor tied around their leg .
Linux Against Poverty is much more than an installfest .
It is an effort between the Free Software Community in any given place and the greater community that holds it .
Lynn Bender is a professional organizer and the brains behind Linux Against Poverty .
When Lynn first heard about The HeliOS Project , he immediately wanted to help and began outlining a plan to do so .
He would gather Geeks , Community Leaders , Corporates and City Leaders together to accomplish one goal .
Collect enough computers and money to give organizations like The HeliOS Project some breathing room .
Materials and funding for one year .
Lynn 's contacts are impressive .
He 's been doing this for 20 years and he 's either friend or acquaintance with mayors , City Administrators , Council Members , Police Chiefs and other leaders for at least a decade past .
Lynn has had some ragingly successful events and he hopes that Linux Against Poverty can be one of them .
Here 's the plan .
It all comes together on August first , 2009 .
Lynn 's people will now begin soliciting companies and corporations in the Austin area for physical donations .
He has secured the swank and popular nightspot known as Union Park for both the actual event and the party afterward .
The Park will be full of volunteer Austin Geeks , ready to accept the incoming machines , triage them and place them into different staging areas .
One of the brightest tech guys I know , Andy Krell from nFusion will be there in person to lend a hand .
There is a place to sign up as a geek extrordinaire if you want to be part of this event .
Email
Tom at the above link and he will get you scheduled .
Tom King - HeliOS Project Network Guru and volunteer coordinator
While LAP has been scheduled for a while , we went through some changes in getting to the point to announce the event .
Initially , it was planned as a global event ... several cities on 4 different continents would be doing the same thing at the same time .
We had the resources together to do it .
The HeliOS Project , being the technical arm of the project had built the servers to feed the different project sites ISO files and distro manuals ... we were all ready for it .
It did n't take long to realize that there were just too many people that did n't have the tools or know - how to do the actual organizing .
That 's when Lynn wisely decided that we would do the Austin event first , painstakingly document the process then let other cities digest the information and do their individual projects as they felt comfortable in doing so .
Rushing this would not have ended well .
It was a smart call .
Mayhem would have surely ensued .
This type of project , marrying the various components of the city to the techs in that city is brilliant in concept but not the easiest plan to successfully execute .
It 's the kids that need these computers ... and folks , having done this for several years , I am still in awe of the number of children in Austin Texas that do not have a computer or internet access in the home .
We 've barely made a dent .
I can hardly imagine what it is like in LA or New York City or London .
I receive emails on a daily basis , asking how to set up projects like The HeliOS Project and by those numbers , I am encouraged .
These kids are the future of Linux and Free Software proliferation .
It is up to us to see to it that they know they have a choice .
As of now , they do not .
A child 's exposure to technology should never be predicated on an ability to pay for it .
Period .
If you are a member or owner of a company and wish to schedule your donation or become a sponsor , contact Lynn here
If you have immediate hardware to donate and cannot drop it off at the actual event , contact Ken here .
We can make a difference ... if we care to , and keep the quotation of one of the most famous Americans to ever live in our forethoughts :
I am only one , but still I am one .
I cannot do everything , but still I can do something ;
And because I cannot do everything I will not refuse to do the something that I can do .
All - Righty
Then ...

Developers guide
0 . Quick geek tutorial
If you are experienced developer who just needs to start working with Blitz very quickly - read this " Quick Geek Tutorial " .
It 's quite old though - please refer to the Template or View API for new methods and features .
1. Introduction
The most probably question you ask , viewing this document for the first time is : " What ?
Yet another template engine ?
What for ? " .
Here comes a very short explanation .
Blitz is a templating engine with two main features :
Fast .
Blitz is written in C and built as PHP - extension which makes it one of the fastest template engines ( you may see the benchmarks section below )
Clear .
Blitz has quite simple and clear syntax and makes developer to build compact and easy - to - read - and - support code even for applications with very complex presentation logic

4. Basics : variables , contexts , methods 4.1 . Variables
The " view " component of your application will be built by templates and views ( " views " are also referred as template controllers .
Let 's start with the following example : $ View = new Blitz ( ) ; $ View -> load ( ' Where is the {{ $ what }} , Lebowski ? ' ) ; $ View - > display ( array ( ' what ' => ' money ' ) ) ; template loaded as string and a template controller $ View .
Normally you 'll load templates from files : $ View = new Blitz ( ' some.tpl ' ) ;
Template is an HTML file with some very simple syntax .
No complex code mixed with HTML .
Controller is a template logic master , an instance of Blitz class which operates template from opening to the final result .
Template controller is not your application controller which stands for " C " in MVC .
No HTML code inside template controller is needed .
4.2 . Contexts
The reason why Blitz objects are called " template controllers " is simple .
From the very early days template language in Blitz was designed to be as simple ( " non-programming " ) as possible .
For example , there is still no " for " or " foreach " statement in Blitz .
This surely does n't mean you can't do any looping :)
But you have to loop from your PHP - code , this is called " passive " templates ( in Blitz you can do a lot of " active " templating as well - conditions , callbacks , plugins - but loops like " foreach " , complex expressions , all these " programming " statements are still under the law ) .
To make a loop you need to use blocks in your templates .
Block , or context , is a part of template marked by {{ BEGIN }} and {{ END }} tags .
Blocks can be populated on demand but hidden by default : $ View = new Blitz ( ) ; $ View - > load ( ' hello {{ BEGIN block }} {{ $ name }} {{ END }} ' ) ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' block ' => array ( ' name ' => ' Dude ' ) ) ) ;
To make the code simpler to read one can put a block name after END statement : {{ END block }} .
There is a special ' block ' method that will perobably make your code a bit easier to read : $ View = new Blitz ( ) ; $ View - > load ( ' hello {{ BEGIN block }} {{ $ name }} {{ END block }} ' ) ; $ View - > block ( ' / block ' , array ( ' name ' => ' Dude ' ) ) ; $ View - > display ( ) ; foreach ( array ( ' Dude ' , ' Donny ' , ' Sobchak ' ) as $ i_name ) { $ T -> block ( ' / block ' , array ( ' name ' => $ i_name ) ; } " Hello Dude Donny Sobchak "
Every block is identified by it's path like " / block " .
A block placed inside another has path / parent / child .
Even things like '../../ some / path ' work .
As you could see there can be two ways of " controlling " template blocks .
The first is to use " block " methods ( there are also additional methods to set up active context , to iterate the current context and so on ) .
The second is just to set up complex data structures with keys named equal to block names .
In previous examples we set up a hash for ' block ' .
To produce a list you just need this hash to be an array of hashes : $ View = new Blitz ( ) ; $ View - > load ( ' hello {{ BEGIN block }} {{ $ name }} {{ END }} ' ) ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' block ' => array ( array ( ' name ' => ' Dude ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Donny ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Sobchak ' ) , ) ) ) ;
Honestly , using blocks as " if " substitution is crazy :)
See what you have to do if you just need a simple comma separated list in the previous example .
At first you have to add a special separator block : hello {{ BEGIN block }}{{ BEGIN comma }} , {{ END }} {{ $ name }} {{ END }} $ need_comma = FALSE ; foreach ( array ( ' Dude ' , ' Sobchak ' , ' Donny ' ) as $ i_name ) { if ( $ need_comma ) { $ T -> block ( ' / block / comma ' ) ; } else $ need_comma = TRUE ; } $ T - > block ( ' / block ' , array ( ' name ' => $ i_name ) ; } hello {{ BEGIN block }}{{ if ( $_first , '' , ' , ' ) }} {{ $ name }} {{ END }}. foreach ( array ( ' Dude ' , ' Donny ' , ' Sobchak ' ) as $ i_name ) { $ T -> block ( ' / block ' , array ( ' name ' => $ i_name ) ; }
Here we used a short form of " if " as a " method " .
You can use condition blocks as well : hello {{ BEGIN block }} {{ UNLESS $ _first }} , {{ END }} {{ $ name }} {{ END }} .
4.3 . Variable scope and contexts
Let 's finally take a complex list example $ body = <<< BODY {{ BEGIN list }} ==================================================
list # {{ \$_num }} , x = {{ \$x }} {{ UNLESS sublist }} empty {{ ELSE }} --------------------------------------------------
{{ BEGIN sublist }} row #{{ \$_num ; }} v = {{ \$v }} , x = {{ \$x }} {{ END }} {{ END }} {{ END }} BODY ; $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; $ data = array ( ' list ' => array ( 0 => array ( ' x ' => ' first ' ) , 1 => array ( ' x ' => ' second ' , ' sublist ' => array ( 0 => array ( ' v' => ' a ' ) , 1 => array ( 'v' => ' b ' ) , ) ) ) ) ; $ T-> display ( $ data ) ; ==================================================
list # 1 , x = first empty ==================================================
list # 2 , x = second
--------------------------------------------------
row # 1 v = a , x = row # 2 v = b , x =
pass it via params manually for every context iteration
pass it as global once
force Blitz to make " upper " lookups when parameter was not found
Globals are set by setGlobals ( ) method : // body remains the same ... $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; // data remains the same ... $ T-> setGlobals ( array ( ' x ' => ' global x ' ) ) ; $ T -> display ( $ data ) ; ==================================================
list # 1 , x = first empty ==================================================
list # 2 , x = second
--------------------------------------------------
row # 1 v = a , x = global x row # 2 v = b , x = global x ini_set ('blitz.scope_lookup_limit ' , 1 ) ; ==================================================
list # 1 , x = first empty ==================================================
list # 2 , x = second
--------------------------------------------------
row # 1 v = a , x = second row # 2 v = b , x = second
4.4 . Includes
In previous section you could see an example of so called " internal method " - if ( ) .
These are statements like function calls in the template code .
Blitz has several internal methods like this - and one of them is include ( ) .
Just say : {{ inlcude ( " some.tpl " ) }} or {{ include ( $ file ) }} - that 's it .
Works same way as PHP itself .
How does variable scope work with include ?
Right the same way as if the include statement was replaced by the content from the included file .
Let 's see the example .
Included template represents the list of names : Cast : {{ BEGIN cast }}{{ UNLESS $ _first }} , {{ END }}{{ $ name }}{{ END }} $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( '{ { include ( " include_ctx.tpl " ) }} ' ) ; $ data = array ( array ( ' name ' => ' Jeff Bridges ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' John Goodman ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Julianne Moore ' ) array ( ' name ' => ' Steve Buscemi ' ) ) ; $ T -> set ( array ( ' cast ' => $ data ) ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ; Cast : Jeff Bridges , John Goodman , Julianne Moore , Steve Buscemi Cast : {{ BEGIN cast }}{{ UNLESS $ _first }} , {{ END }}{{ $ name }}{{ END }} $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( '{ { include ( " include_ctx.tpl " ) }} ' ) ; $ list_names = array ( ' Jeff Bridges ' , ' John Goodman ' , ' Julianne Moore ' , ' Steve Buscemi ' ) ; foreach ( $ list_names as $ i_name ) { $ T -> block ( ' / cast ' , array ( ' name ' => $ i_name ) , TRUE ) ; } $ T - > display ( ) ; Cast : Jeff Bridges , John Goodman , Julianne Moore , Steve Buscemi Cast :
4.5 . Debugging Internal representation of a template stage in Blitz is just a complex data structure with key names equal to variable or block names .
This data is saved in template internally and can be dumped using method getIterations ( ) when debugging .
In the next example we iterate blocks sequentially using block ( ) method , set some additional data with set ( ) method , get the iteration data with getIterations ( ) method , clean all the iterations and display the template using previously dumpled data : $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( ' {{ include ( " test.tpl " ) }} ' ) ; $ list_names = array ( ' Jeff Bridges ' , ' John Goodman ' , ' Julianne Moore ' , ' Steve Buscemi ' ) ; foreach ( $ list_names as $ i_name ) { $ T -> block ( ' / cast ' , array ( ' name ' => $ i_name ) , TRUE ) ; } $ T - > set ( array ( ' film ' => ' The Big Lebowski ' ) ) ; $ data = $ T-> getIterations ( ) ; var_dump ( $ data ) ; $ T -> clean ( ) ; var_dump ( $T-> getIterations ( ) ) ; $ T -> display ( $ data ) ; array ( 1 ) { [ 0 ] => array ( 2 ) { [ " cast " ] => array ( 4 ) { [ 0 ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " name " ] => string ( 12 ) " Jeff Bridges " } [ 1 ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " name " ] => string ( 12 ) " John Goodman " } [ 2 ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " name " ] => string ( 14 ) " Julianne Moore " } [ 3 ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " name " ] => string ( 13 ) " Steve Buscemi " } } [ " film " ] => string ( 16 ) " The Big Lebowski " } } array ( 0 ) { } The Big Lebowski cast : Jeff Bridges , John Goodman , Julianne Moore , Steve Buscemi
Sometimes you have correct iterations but your code does n't work properly still .
Use getStruct ( ) / dumpStruct ( ) methods to check if there is everything OK with your template .
See View API for examples .
4.6 . Fetch
When working with large templates you oftenly want to get a part of template .
This is done by fetch ( ) method : $ body =<<< BODY {{ BEGIN test }} Hello , {{ $ name }}! {{ END }} BODY ; $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; echo $ T - > fetch ( ' test ' , array ( ' name ' => ' world ! ' ) ) ;
Hello , world !
$ body =< << BODY {{ fetch ( ' / test ' ) }} {{ BEGIN test }}Hello , world !{{ END }} BODY ; $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ;
4.7 . Other internal methods Basic internal methods are : if ( ) , include ( ) , date ( ) and escape ( ) .
Two first methods were mentioned above , and two last are new .
Let 's cover them briefly .
Method date ( format , argument ) used to format date / time values just from your template .
It works as follows : when argument is integer , date ( ) treats it as UNIX timestamp .
Otherwise it 's parsed with internal PHP function " php_parse_date " which recognize a lot of date formats .
When ARG is omitted - the current time is used .
Format string has the same conversion specifiers as PHP function " strftime " .
Method escape ( string ) is equal to htmlspecialchars ( string , ENT_COMPAT ) .
You can use additional second parameter to specify quoting style which is passed as string , named as the corresponding PHP constant : escape ( string , " ENT_QUOTES " ) or escape ( string , " ENT_NOQUOTES " ) etc.
Blitz supports all three quote styles : " ENT_COMPAT " , " ENT_QUOTES " and " ENT_NOQUOTES " .
5. Callbacks and plugins Blitz supports callbacks like {{ Some : : doSomething ( $ params ) }} or {{ doSomething ( $ param ) }} .
With this you can add any function calls to your template .
Basically you can :
1 ) extend Blitz and use your custom template methods in the template code
2 ) call any other PHP function like do ( $ something ) or Plugin : : do ( $ something )
Callbacks were added in 0.7.1.5 but changed in older versions .
Current callback API ( writing this for 0.7.1.14 ) works this way : {{ this :: method }} calls class method through the template object
{{ php :: method }} calls PHP function " method "
{{ helper : : method }} calls static PHP - method
{{ method }} calls class method first and PHP - method after ( if not found ) and vice versa - according to blitz.php_callbacks_first setting .
This was added in 0.7.1.14 and by default it 's 1 so PHP - method is called first .
This can be changed in next versions according to the community reaction .
See the following example :
fisher@fisher:~/prj/blitz/tests > cat calls.php <? ini_set ( " blitz.php_callbacks_first " , 1 ) ; $ body = < << BODY {{ php ::date ( " Y / m/d H:i " ) }} self - call : {{ this : :doSomething ( ) }} php-call : {{ php::doSomething ( ) }} this + php call : {{ doSomething ( ) }} this + php call : { { doSomething2 ( ) }} BODY ; function doSomething ( ) { return ' PHP :: did comething ' ; } class View extends Blitz { function doSomething ( ) { return ' THIS :: did something ' ; } function __call ( $a , $ b ) { return ' __call handler : '.var_export ( $a , true ) . ' , '. str_replace ( array ( "
" , " \r " ) , " " , var_export ( $b , true ) ) ; } } $ T = new View ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ; ?> fisher@fisher:~/prj/blitz/tests > php5 calls.php
2010/04/02 23:57 this - call : THIS :: did something php-call : PHP :: did comething this + php call : PHP :: did comething this + php call : __call handler : ' dosomething2 ' , array ()
When there is a namespace and a ' : :' before function , Blitz checks if the namespace is a " hint " .
" Hints " are reserved namespaces : {{ php : : do ( $ params ) }} , or {{ this : : do ( $ params ) }} When namespace is a " hint " ( " php " or " this " ) .
Having {{ php : : do ( $ params ) }} Blitz makes a static php-function call , having {{ this : : do ( $ param ) }} do ( ) method is called through the current template object .
When namespace is not a " hint " , Blitz makes a static PHP - call namespace : : do ( $ params ) .
If this namespace and function exists - the function will be called .
When there was just a function call with no namespace like {{ do ( $ params ) }} Blitz works according to priority settings .
When " blitz.php_callbacks_first " is set to 1 Blitz first tries to make a static PHP - function call .
If this function does n't exist - Blitz calls this method through your template controller .
When " blitz.php_callbacks_first " is set to 0 , vice versa .
Now we can go back to the example : {{ php ::date ( " Y / m/d H:i " ) }} - is a PHP - function call
{{ this ::doSomething ( ) }} - is a " hinted " doSomething ( ) method call through the View object $ T
{{ php::doSomething ( ) }} - is a " hinted " doSomething ( ) function call from the current function scope
{{ doSomething ( ) }} - is a function call from the current function scope because blitz .
php_callbacks_first was set to 1
{{ doSomething2 ( ) }} - Blitz tries to find doSomething2 ( ) function in the current scope because blitz .
php_callbacks_first was set to 1 .
There 's no such function , so then Blitz makes a method call through the View object $ T . This call is handled by __call ( ) because doSomething2 ( ) method does n't exist .
6. Performance notes 6.1 . Benchmarks
Unfortunately , I do n't know any simple , universal and really correct method to analyse template engine performance .
The only one right way to do this is to build your application using several template engines and measure the performance under the real conditions .
Should it be noted that nobody is going to do this ?
That 's why we always deal with artificial tests which results should be used very carefully .
Nevertheless , results of one " synthetic " test are listed here .
This test is much closer to real world conditions than most of tests you can find in the Internet ( like " wow , we have printed this variable 200 times !!! 11 " ) .
First we have a page of several non-trivial parts .
The code is written using different template engines .
This page is built by a webserver , and the performance is benchmarked using the standard apache ab utility .
The page simulates a some pseudo portal main page and contains : adverts ( 3 items )
news list ( 5 items , 5 vars each )
striped navigation ( 7 sections )
list of users online ( ~ 20 items )
vote with 3 possible answers
other variables ( ~10 items )
Tests include lot of different template engines .
Leaders are : PHP mess : PHP and HTML are messed in a single file .
This method is used in the real big projects in very specific cases only , but included into the tests just because it is obviously the fastest one .
blitz : single template , every functional block has it's own context
PHP includes : PHP and HTML are messed but functionally different blocks ( list elements ) are separated and included from the main code .
php_templates : single template , every functional block has it's own context
smarty : single template , compiled , output cache is off
The results of this test can be found below .
Software versions and settings were :
PHP 4.3.10 , ZPS 4.0.2 Sigma 1.1.5 ( cache on ) Smarty 2.6.15 ( tpl - compile on , output - cache off ) Blitz 0.4.3 FastTemplate 1.1.0 XTemplate 0.3.0 php_templates 1.7 cTemplate 0.8 ( ctemplate 0.4 , nothreads )
These measurements were made quite long time ago ( PHP 4.3. * with Zend Performance Suite , and old versions of template engines ) .
Now we need to make the same test with modern PHP 5.3.* with APC .
If you can help with this - please drop me an email .
I still need benchmark tests for some popular systems like CTPP , ClearSilver , Twig , Lapa , Quicky , Macro / WACT or possibly many others .
If you just send me how to implement the test with these systems - I 'll test it and add the results here .
The benchmark code is available to download and one can add benchmark code for any other template engine .
Results above should be interpreted in a very generalized way .
Native PHP - code is obviuosly the fastest .
What is more important , " native " here means written by hands , not " compiled " .
If you ever looked into a " compiled " template you probably know that its code has a lot of nested constructions , quite hard to execute ( with a lot of unnecessary hash lookups , for instance ) , much more complex than written by right hands code ;)
One more important thing is obvious as well : the less files you have the most effective your code is , and Blitz context methods are faster than include .
I used single file methods for both php_templates and Smarty to squeeze maximum from them , so i suppose Blitz to be visibly faster .
The difference between Blitz and commonly used " php includes " method is not very big .
In real world application any difference will be likely hidden against the background of other code especially database requests et cetera .
Thus both of the methods could be considered as practically equal .
You can notice that most of the tests were made using an accelerator from ZPS .
Using accelerator is very significant for PHP code - but you possibly can obtain different results using other products like APC / XCache / eAccelerator / whatever .
In general , one should not to rely on the quoted results entirely .
Make tests , play with real projects and choose solutions , which give a profit under your own particular conditions .
6.2 . Slowdowns Blitz performance receipes are the same as for any web - applications with CPU bottleneck .
Following things in Blitz may slow down your application :
lot of includes ( all the data will seat in VFS cache almost immediately , but includes always add some kernel syscalls and need CPU to parse / initialize objects ) .
lot of hash lookups to resolve path - variables $ obj.smth.blabla , performance downgrades proportionally to the product number_of_variables*average_path_length
lot of hash lookups back through the scope stack
lot of block ( ) / iterate ( ) calls instead of preparing set data and just calling $ View - > display ( $ data )
lot of non -built - in Blitz methods in templates ( user defined callbacks or PHP - functions )
7. Template API [ IF|UNLESS ]/ ELSEIF /ELSE statments
if ( predicate , output_true [ , output_false ] )
include ( filename )
escape ( html [ , " ENT_QUOTES " |" ENT_NOQUOTES " |" ENT_COMPAT " )
date ( format [ , arg ) 7.1 [ IF|UNLESS ]/ ELSEIF /ELSE statments
It 's a simple as {{ IF $ a }} if - a {{ ELSEIF $b }} else - if - b {{ ELSE }} default {{ END }}.
{{ UNLESS $ a }} will work instead of {{ IF $ a }} as well , but no " ELSEUNLESS " is provided .
Simple expressions are supported too : $ a >= $b , 2 < $ a , $ a == " bla- bla " .
The most usual example of these statements is a list which can be empty : {{ IF $ list }} some html code before the list {{ BEGIN list }} {{ $ data }} {{ END list }} some html code after the list {{ ELSE }} some html code for empty list {{ END if - list }}
7.2 if ( predicate , output_true [ , output_false ] ) If ( ) method is a short version for predicates .
If ( ) outputs arguments according to the first argument : $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( " {{ $ num }}. {{ $ name }} {{ if ( $rip , '[ R.I.P. ] ' ) }} " ) ; $ character = array ( array ( 1 , ' The Dude ' , 0 ) , array ( 2 , ' Walter Sobchak ' , 0 ) , array ( 3 , ' Donny ' , 1 ) , // RIP , Donny array ( 4 , ' Maude Lebowski ' , 0 ) , array ( 5 , ' The Big Lebowski ' , 0 ) , array ( 6 , ' Brandt ' , 0 ) , array ( 7 , ' Jesus Quintana ' , 0 ) , ) ; foreach ( $ character as $ i => $ i_data ) { echo $ T -> parse ( array ( ' num ' => $ i_data [ 0 ] , ' name ' => $ i_data [ 1 ] , 'rip ' => $ i_data [ 2 ] ) ) ; }
1. The Dude 2 . Walter Sobchak 3 . Donny [ R.I.P. ]
4 . Maude Lebowski 5 . The Big Lebowski 6 . Brandt 7 . Jesus Quintana
7.3 include ( filename ) Include ( ) method includes external template .
1.tpl : {{ $ what }} $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( " Where is the {{ include ( ' 1.tpl ' ) }} , Lebowski ?
" ) ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' what ' => ' money ' ) ) ;
Where 's the money , Lebowski ?
7.4 escape ( html [ , " ENT_QUOTES " |" ENT_NOQUOTES " |" ENT_COMPAT " ) Escape ( ) is a very simple html output wrapper , works like htmlspecialchars ( ) function in PHP .
There is a short alias : q ( ) .
Without second argument escape uses ENT_QUOTES as default and escapes both </> and both single and double quotes : $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( ' {{ q ( $a ) ; }} {{ q( $a , " ENT_COMPAT " ) }} {{ q( $a , " ENT_QUOTES " ) }} {{ q( $a , " ENT_NOQUOTES " ) }} ' ) ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' a ' => " here 's a \ " test \ " <>\'\ " " ) ) ; here 's a " test " <>\' " here 's a " test " <>\' " here 's a " test " <>\' " here 's a " test " <>\' "
7.5 date ( format [ , arg ) Date ( ) function formats a date .
When " arg " is numerical , it is treated as UNIX timestamp integer .
Otherwise it 's parsed using internal PHP function " php_parse_date " which recognizes a lot of date formats .
When " arg " is omitted - the current time is used .
Format string has the same conversion specifiers as PHP function " strftime " .
Consider the following PHP code : $ body = < << BODY {{ date ( " %d %m %Y %H :%M: %S " , \$ time_num ) ; }} {{ date ( " %d %m %Y %H :%M:%S " , \$ time_str ) ; }} BODY ; $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; $ time_num = mktime ( 11 , 22 , 33 , 7 , 22 , 1976 ) ; $ time_str = ' 1976-07-22 01:02:03 ' ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' time_num ' => $ time_num , ' time_str ' => $ time_str ) ) ; 22 07 1976 11:22:33 22 07 1976 01:02:03
8. View API load ( $ body ) - load template body from variable
set ( $vars ) - set iterations / variables
parse ( [ $ vars ] ) - set $vars and return rendered template as string
display ( [ $ vars ] ) - set $vars and output rendered template as string
block ( $ path , $ vars [ , $ iterate_nonexistant ] ) - iterate $ path with $ vars
fetch ( $ path , $ vars ) - output context $ path rendered as string with $ vars
include ( $ filename , $ vars ) - load template $ filename and return rendered with $vars as string
clean ( ) - clean internal iteration data
cleanGlobals ( ) - clean globals
getGlobals ( ) - return globals as hash
setGlobals ( $ global_vars ) - set globals
hasContext ( $ path ) - check if context $ path exists in the template
context ( $ path ) - set current context to $ path
iterate ( $ path [ , $ iterate_nonexistant ] ) - create new $ path iteration with empty data
getContext ( ) - get current working context
getStruct ( ) - return template structure as an array of paths .
dumpStruct ( ) - dump template structure in some internal
getIterations ( ) - get internal iteration data representing the current template state
NOTE : depending on your religious views you may use either CamelCaps or under_bars coding style .
For any doSomething Blitz can do_something as well .
depending on your religious views you may use eitherorcoding style .
For any Blitz canas well .
8.1. load ( $ body ) Load ( ) just loads template body from variable : $ T = new blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( ' Have a lot of {{ $ what}} ! ' ) ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' what ' => ' fun ' ) ) ;
8.2. set ( $vars )
Set variables or complex iteration data into the current context .
Set accepts mixed $vars that represent internal iteration state : when it 's array - it 's interpreted as list .
$ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( " {{ BEGIN characters }} {{ \$_num }}. {{ \ $name }} {{ if ( \$rip , '[ R.I.P. ] ' )
}}
{{ END characters}} " ) ; $ data = array ( ' characters ' => array ( array ( ' name ' => ' The Dude ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Walter Sobchak ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Donny ' , 'rip ' => TRUE ) , // RIP , Donny array ( ' name ' => ' Maude Lebowski ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' The Big Lebowski ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Brandt ' ) , array ( ' name ' => ' Jesus Quintana ' ) , ) ) ; $ T -> set ( $ data ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ; 1 . The Dude 2 . Walter Sobchak 3 . Donny [ R.I.P. ]
4 . Maude Lebowski 5 . The Big Lebowski 6 . Brandt 7 . Jesus Quintana T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( " Hello {{ \$name }} !
" ) ; $ T -> set ( array ( 0 => array ( ' name ' => ' dude ' ) , 1 => array ( ' name ' => ' world ' ) ) ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ; Hello dude !
Hello world !
8.3. parse ( [ $ vars ] ) Parse ( ) method sets $vars and returns rendered template as string .
Vars structure has the same semantics as for set ( ) .
You can just say " echo $ T - > parse ( $ vars ) " instead of $ T - > set ( $vars ) and $ T - > display ( ) in previous example .
8.4. display ( [ $ vars ] ) Display ( ) method sets $vars and outputs rendered template .
Vars structure has the same semantics as for set ( ) .
You can just say $ T - > display ( $ vars ) instead of $ T - > set ( $vars ) and $ T - > display ( ) in previous example .
8.5. block ( $ path , $ vars [ , $ iterate_nonexistant = FALSE ] ) Block ( ) populates context $ path with $vars .
When $ iterate_nonexistant is TRUE block ( ) will not check if this $ path is valid ( this may be useful for complex templates with includes ) .
main.tpl : {{ $ question }} {{ BEGIN answers }} - {{ $ text }} {{ END}} $ T = new Blitz ( 'ex3.tpl ' ) ; $ T -> display ( array ( ' question ' =>
' Do I make myself clear , Lebowski ? ' , ' answers ' => array ( 0 => array ( ' text ' => ' Yes ' ) , 1 => array ( ' text ' => ' No ' ) , 2 => array ( ' text ' =>
' Sorry , I was n\'t listening ' ) , ) ) ) ;
Do I make myself clear , Lebowski ? - Yes -
No - Sorry , I was n't listening
8.6. fetch ( $ path , $ vars ) Fetch ( ) method outputs context $ path rendered with $vars .
Example
8.7. include ( $ filename , $ vars )
In some cases you need to include a template from your PHP - code .
This happens quite rarely and basically it's a bad style cause this increases template controller / code coupling , but if you need to do this without creating Blitz instance - you can use include ( ) method .
Consider this php code : class View extends Blitz { var $ news = array ( ) ; function View ( $tmpl_name ) { return parent : : Blitz ( $tmpl_name ) ; } function setNews ( $ data ) { $ this -> news = $ data ; } function showNewsList ( ) { $ result = '' ; foreach ( $ this -> news as $ i_news ) { $ result .= $ this ->include (' news_list_item.tpl ' , $ i_news ) ; } return $ result ; } } $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( '{ { include ( " include_ctx.tpl " ) }} ' ) ; $ i = 0 ; while ( $ i < 5 ) { $ T -> block ( ' / test1 ' , array ( ' var ' => $ i ) , TRUE ) ; $ T -> block ( ' / test2 ' , array ( ' var ' => $ i + 1 ) , TRUE ) ; $ i++ ; } echo $ T - > parse ( ) ; test1 : {{ begin test1 }} v1= { { $var }} {{ end }} test2 : {{ begin test2 }} v2= { { $ var }} {{ end }} test1 : v1=0 v1=1 v1=2 v1=3 v1=4 test2 : v2=1 v2=2 v2=3 v2=4 v2=5
8.8. clean ( ) , cleanGlobals ( ) Clean ( ) method just cleans - up all template iterations and sets the template in the initial stage as if it was just created : $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T -> load ( '{{ IF question }} {{ BEGIN question }}Who the fuck are the {{ $ name }}? {{ END question }} {{ ELSE }} empty {{ END }} ' ) ; $ T -> set ( array ( ' question ' => array ( ' name ' => ' Knutsens ' ) ) ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ; var_dump ( $T-> getIterations ( ) ) ; $ T -> clean ( ) ; var_dump ( $T-> getIterations ( ) ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ;
Who the fuck are the Knutsens ? array ( 1 ) { [ 0 ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " question " ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " name " ] => string ( 8 ) " Knutsens " } } } array ( 0 ) { } empty
CleanGlobals ( ) is the same but cleans globals , not iteration data .
8.9. setGlobals ( $ global_vars ) , getGlobals ( ) getGlobals ( ) returns globals hash array , setGlobals ( $ global_vars ) - adds $ global_vars to the global variables hash : $ body = ' It \ 's like what {{ $ local }} said ...
It \'s like what {{ $ global }} said ... {{ BEGIN context }} It \'s like what {{ $ local }} said ...
It \'s like what {{ $ global }} said ... {{ END context }} '; $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; $ T -> set ( array ( ' local ' => ' Lennon ' ) ) ; $ T-> setGlobals ( array ( ' global ' => ' Lenin ' ) ) ; $ T -> block ( ' context ' , array ( ' local ' => ' Lenin ' ) ) ; $ T -> display ( ) ; var_dump ( $T-> getGlobals ( ) ) ; var_dump( $T-> getIterations ( ) ) ;
It 's like what Lennon said ...
It 's like what Lenin said ...
It 's like what Lenin said ...
It 's like what Lenin said ... array ( 1 ) { [ " global " ] => string ( 5 ) " Lenin " } array ( 1 ) { [ 0 ] => array ( 2 ) { [ " local " ] => string ( 6 ) " Lennon " [ " context " ] => array ( 1 ) { [ 0 ] => array ( 1 ) { [ " local " ] => string ( 5 ) " Lenin " } } } }
Please remember that usually you do n't need to pass local variables to every block - you can just use " scope lookups " with blitz .scope_lookup_limit and varibles from parent blocks will be visible in inner blocks .
Here $ local is passed to " / context " just because we needed this variable to have different values in the root " / " and " / context " .
8.12 . hasContext ( $ path )
This method just checks if the context exists or not and returns TRUE / FALSE correspondingly .
$ body = '{{ BEGIN walter }} I do n\'t roll on Shabbos {{ END }} ' ; $ T = new Blitz ( ) ; $ T - > load ( $ body ) ; var_dump ( $ T -> hasContext ( ' walter ' ) ) ; var_dump ( $ T -> hasContext ( ' donny ' ) ) ; bool ( true ) bool ( false )
8.13 . context ( $ path )
8.14 . iterate ( $ path [ , $ iterate_nonexistant ] ) 8.15 . getContext ( )
8.16 . getStruct ( ) getStruct ( ) - returns template structure as an array of available paths .
8.17 . dumpStruct ( ) 8.18 . getIterations ( ) getIterations ( ) - get internal iteration data representing the current template state .
Example
These are my own development values which were formed through my own experience with large - scale internet projects .
Note , this all comes mostly from " management " , not " programming " , and has influence on large projects particularly .
Let me explain this all briefly .
Is " fast " important ?
Talking about the speed I 'm sure 99,9 % of projects are not CPU - bound .
But large projects are .
Most of top projects have thousands frontends serving billions requests per day ( top of the top has even much more ) .
Performance management is a field of special importance here .
Usually storage / application services are tuned as much as possible and CPU usage on frontend boxes is , well , not bottleneck , but one of very important degrees of freedom .
Crooked solutions which scale badly will significantly increase your total cost .
From my personal experience presentation code may eat up to 30 - 50 % % CPU for the dynamic page generation in a " good " project and up to 100 % in " bad " .
Think of that : your frontend CPU spends most of the time just building result HTML !
It is very important to decrease this value .
With Blitz you wo n't spend much CPU on presentation level ( see benchmark results below ) .
Is " clear " important ?
Talking about the simplicity of presentation code I 'm absolutely sure 99,9 % of projects can be written in plain PHP and happily supported through years .
Plain PHP is probably the best solution from the performance point of view as well .
There 's one problem though .
Supporting the mess of PHP and HTML in a big project is usually just a nightmare .
Large projects usually have large codebase and a lot of problems appear while trying to manage PHP +HTML spaghetti in presentation code .
This happens because modern , personalized applications have very complex presentation logic and this all tend to change intensively .
This logic should be written , owned and supported by developer ( I also suppose here that HTML / CSS competence is much different from programming so developers better do n't touch this stuff at all - and vice versa ) .
But when you have PHP code together with HTML and Javascript in templates - the ownership and the responsibility is too fuzzy .
That 's why I always wanted HTML / JS guys to keep their hands off the presentation logic .
I do know what happens otherwise when this part of application is " shared " .
That 's why I wanted to maximally separate HTML and view logic .
I wanted to see the code , with no HTML / Smarty / PHP / Whatever spaghetti mess .
I wanted developers to work with the code , with no HTML or JS around .
Well , that is a some kind of management philosophy .
You just feel this " right " - or not :) ) ) I started this project in 2005 as a replacement of php_templates by Maxim Poltarak , a very fast PHP template engine which was popular in ealy 200x mostly among developers in former USSR countries .
This engine was unjustly rejected by PHP team long time ago ( they did n't let it into PECL for absolutely childish reasons ) so the project was frozen and got no further developments .
I took most of " design " concepts from php_templates and thank Maxim for his great project .
Blitz is a PHP extension distributed in source code ( Win32 users can download compiled DLL's ) .
To extract the code and build the extension just follow these simple steps :
To test blitz run the test script run-tests .sh..
Running the tests you will get something like this :
If Blitz was build as shared module you will probably need to edit your php.ini and include Blitz in extension list :
This list is based on 0.7 .* versions .
See the difference in old 0.6. * below .
Google just told the applicants for this year ’s Summer of Code whether they were accepted !
I ’ve put up GNOME ’s list of accepted projects .
Many congratulations to everyone we accepted as part of GNOME , and commiserations to students we had to turn down — we ’d love to keep working with you outside of the formal SoC .
GNOME had 181 submissions in total , and it was a pleasure to read all of them .
We got that down to a shortlist of 40 , and then had to try to go from there to our accepted list of 20 via votes , meetings , and long e-mail threads .
Since the list ’s going to be new to everyone outside SoC , I thought I ’d enthuse about a couple of the projects that I ’m going to be tracking excitedly over the summer .
( With apologies if I end up misrepresenting anyone ’s project ! )
Generic user - to - user connection interface for collaborative applications using telepathy
Telepathy is a freedesktop.org project working on a unified interface to different types of communication ( IM , VoIP , etc ) , and this proposal from Mads Chr.
Olesen aims to make direct connections with your Telepathy contacts possible over an IM layer .
For example , if I want to work on a document with a friend using the collaborative editor Gobby , we need a server to host the session .
What if we ’re both behind different NAT networks , as most people are ?
Well , then , we can ’t .
Same for VNC .
The proposal uses the Jabber stream extensions to tunnel application data , meaning that contacts can be treated as “ first - class objects ” for establishing connections .
( If you ’re using a different IM protocol and it also supports arbitrary streams , that ’s fine too ; the whole point of the project would be that application developers and users do n’t need to know exactly how the data is getting tunnelled unless they care . )
The reason I like this proposal so much is that it reminds me of the way this interview with Nat talks about how good programmers add a dose of empathy to their code .
Why should the user have to care how they connect with one of their contacts , or what NAT is , or what IP address each of them has ?
This is totally user - centric programming .
Improving Emblems in GNOME
This is a proposal by James Barrett .
The title does n’t tell the whole story — as well as emblems , think tags .
Everywhere .
James is going to integrate nautilus and leaftag , and gives some excellent use cases : using a “ backup ” tag to have those files / folders backed up automatically , viewing “ virtual folders ” of each tag in nautilus , being able to quickly bring up all your photos with a particular friend in after tagging them .
Emblems are going to be the visual representation of a tag , and will be integrated with nautilus / the panel / the file chooser .
People are getting comfortable with the idea of tags from experiences with Flickr and YouTube , and I think a well - designed use of tags for their files as well is going to be a killer feature .
This is exactly where we can innovate far past Windows and OS X , and I ’m pleased to say I got the same feeling from many of the proposals .
Bluetooth Manager
Matthew Garrett works on the kernel , GTK2 apps and everything inbetween , and he ’s going to spend the summer tidying up Bluetooth ; making sure that you can pair with keyboards , headsets and phones inside GNOME and have things Just Work , and ideally by having HAL do the heavy lifting so that you do n’t need root to do so .
Our bluetooth tools are in need of an overhaul , and this is valuable work .
Improving nautilus login performance & ease of profiling
Phillip Ezolt is a published expert in profiling and optimisation , and wants to help us out both with profiling nautilus and providing hooks to aid profiling in the future .
Phillip ’s in grad school working on visualisation at the moment , and knowing how to usefully represent profile data graphically is a problem we ’ve only recently started trying to solve .
He ’s interested in getting involved with Linux / GNOME in the long - term , and I ’m looking forward to everything we have to teach and learn from him ; it seems like hardcore profiling skills are something only a few of us have .
I liked this proposal so much that I offered to mentor it .
Thanks to Google for their sponsorship and the insane amount of work it must take to coordinate all this , to Behdad and Vincent for heading up GNOME ’s involvement , and welcome to all our new SoCers !
