On the Arantix Mountain Bike from newbie Delta 7 Sports , the typical solid - cylinder tubing has been replaced by an airy , see - through lattice woven from a carbon - fiber composite and bundled in Kevlar string .
The resulting gossamer web may look delicate , but pound for pound this quirky construction — called IsoTruss — is stronger than steel , aluminum , and titanium .
It ’s even stronger than solid carbon composites , the current front - runners among ultralight bike frames .
Like other carbon - fiber frames , this one is baked : Long , thin strands of carbon atoms , organized in a hexagonal pattern and coated with epoxy resin , are put in an oven at 255 degrees Fahrenheit for four hours of curing .
Unlike other carbon - fiber frames , though , the Arantix could withstand a direct shrapnel hit .
The lattice structure isolates damage to a single element instead of shattering under pressure , Delta 7 says .
Despite all its empty spaces , the handmade Arantix frame costs a hefty $ 6,995 ( a full bike is $ 11,995 ) .
At 2.75 pounds , it falls just short of a featherweight record among mountain bikes , but the IsoTruss easily supports the 200 - pound - plus Clydesdale racers that its competitors shun .

Recent findings are rapidly expanding researchers ' understanding of a new class of brain cells -- mirror neurons -- which are active both when people perform an action and when they watch it being performed .
Some scientists speculate that a mirror system in people forms the basis for social behavior , for our ability to imitate , acquire language , and show empathy and understanding .
It also may have played a role in the evolution of speech .
Mirror neurons were so named because , by firing both when an animal acts and when it simply watches the same action , they were thought to " mirror " movement , as though the observer itself were acting .
Advances in the past few years have newly defined different types of mirror neurons in monkeys and shown how finely tuned these subsets of mirror neurons can be .
New studies also have further characterized abnormal - as well as normal - mirror activity in the brains of children with the social communication disorder known as autism , suggesting new approaches to treatment .
" The tremendous excitement that has been generated in the field by the study of mirror neurons stems from the implications of the findings , which have led to numerous new hypotheses about behavior , human evolution , and neurodevelopmental disorders , " says Mahlon DeLong , MD , of Emory University School of Medicine .
Mirror neurons , a class of nerve cells in areas of the brain relaying signals for planning movement and carrying it out , were discovered 11 years ago , an offshoot of studies examining hand and mouth movements in monkeys .
Mirror neuron research in the intervening years has expanded into a diverse array of fields .
And the implications have been enormous , encompassing evolutionary development , theories of self and mind , and treatments for schizophrenia and stroke .
Findings being presented at Neuroscience 2007 include new research based on work in monkeys , showing that subsets of mirror neurons distinguish between observed actions carried out within hand 's reach and those beyond the animal 's personal space .

In his study , Peter Thier , PhD , at Tübingen University , first identified a group of mirror neurons by recording single nerve cell activity from electrodes when a monkey gripped different objects and when the monkey watched a person grasp the same objects , both nearby and farther away .
About half of the nerve cells that were active when the monkey picked up the objects also sprung into action when it watched a person do so .
Thier was assisted by research fellow Antonio Casile and PhD student Vittorio Caggiano , and worked closely with the lab of Giacomo Rizzolatti , MD , at the University of Parma .
They also noticed that some of these confirmed mirror neurons were active only when the monkey was watching activity within its personal space , defined as within reaching distance ; others responded only to actions performed in a place outside the monkey 's grasp .
Thier and colleagues recorded this preferential activity in 22 nerve cells , or together half of the mirror neurons .
The other half of the mirror neurons showed activity that did not depend on how close the grasping action was to the monkey .
Although at this stage assigning a functional role is still speculation , Thier suggests this proximity - specific activity in mirror neurons may play an important role when we monitor what goes on around us , or serve as the basis for inferring the intentions of others and for cooperative behavior .
" These neurons might encode actions of others that the observers might directly influence , or with which he or she can interact , " he says .
Other findings show that mirror neuron activity is instrumental for interpreting the facial expressions and actions of others but may not be sufficient for decoding their thoughts and intentions .
The studies examined changes in certain electroencephalograms ( EEG ) or brain wave patterns known as mu rhythms , which have a frequency of 8 - 13 hertz , or oscillations per second .
Previous findings based on EEG recordings from the part of the brain that is directly involved in relaying signals for movement and sensing stimuli , known as the sensorimotor cortex , indicate that mu rhythms typically are suppressed by mirror activity in premotor areas of the brain .
However , this does not happen in children with autism .
As a result , the new work suggests , alternative strategies for reading faces and understanding others develop in the brains of these children .

Pursuing two parallel studies , Jaime Pineda , PhD , at the University of California , San Diego , aimed to contribute evidence supporting one of two theories about the ways we evaluate the actions and intentions of other people - either implicitly or through language - based theoretical concepts .
Using EEG recordings to examine patterns of brain wave activity , Pineda first worked with 23 adults , who were asked to look at photos showing just the eye region of people making various facial expressions .
In three separate trials , the subjects were asked to identify either the emotion , race , or gender of the people in the photographs .
In a subsequent task , subjects looked at three - panel cartoon strips and were asked to choose a fourth panel that completed the strip - either the conclusion of a series of physical actions or the result of a person interacting with an object .
A sequence of a prisoner removing the window of his cell , then looking at his bed , for example , could be followed by a frame of the prisoner asleep , yawning , or using the bedsheet to make a rope .
Answering correctly depended on interpreting the cartoon character 's intentions appropriately or understanding how physical objects interact .
Pineda repeated the studies with 28 children , 7 to 17 years old , half of whom had autism .
The other half were typically developing children .
Recordings from the studies with adults showed a correlation between mu suppression , or mirror neuron activity , and accuracy for both tasks .
In fact , the suppression of mu rhythms during the facial expression task also correlated with accuracy in the exercise with the cartoons , suggesting that reading people 's expressions and interpreting their intentions may draw from similar activity in the brain .
Recordings from the typically developing children showed similar patterns of suppression during the two tasks , indicating that mirror neuron activity is fully developed by age 7 .
In contrast , recordings from the children with autism showed that mu rhythms were enhanced during both tasks .
Enhancement is an indication that the mirror neuron system is disengaged .
However , because the children still were able to perform the task , Pineda says , " we propose that children with autism develop alternative , non-mirror neuron - based coping strategies for understanding facial expressions and interpreting others ' mental states . "
He suggests that " these compensatory strategies involve inhibition of residual mirror neuron functioning . "
These results could be applied to the development of treatments for autism .
Pineda and his group have been using neurofeedback training to successfully renormalize functioning in this system .
That is , they see mu suppression that is more characteristic of the typically developing brain following such training .
" Our findings are consistent with the idea that mirror neurons are not absent in autism , " Pineda says , " but rather are abnormally responsive to stimuli and abnormally integrated into wider social - cognitive brain circuits .
" This idea implies that a retraining of mirror neurons to respond appropriately to stimuli and integrate normally into wider circuits may reduce the social symptoms of autism . "
Advances in recording brain activity also have made possible findings showing that mirror systems are active even when we are not observing an action with an eye to repeating it .
Suresh Muthukumaraswamy , PhD , at Cardiff University , found that the mirror system is activated when we watch specific actions , even when we are concentrating on a separate task .
The results are based on previous research showing that motor systems in the brain are activated when a person observes an action being performed and on interpretations suggesting that we understand and learn to imitate the actions of others through these brain mechanisms .
Working with 13 adults with an average age of 29 , Muthukumaraswamy compared brain activity recorded via magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) .
This monitoring technique measures the weak magnetic fields emitted by nerve cells , and , recording from 275 locations , Muthukumaraswamy was able to monitor changes in activity every 600th of a second .
" Although MEG has been in existence for more than 20 years , recent advances in hardware , computing technology , and the algorithms used to analyze the data allow much more detailed analysis of brain function than was previously possible , " he says .
Brain activity was recorded as the subjects passively watched a sequence of finger movements , watched the movements knowing they would be asked to repeat them , added up the number of fingers moved as they watched , and performed the sequence of movements themselves .
Results from these recordings showed similar activity when the subjects performed the movement sequence and when they watched someone else do it .
In addition , Muthukumaraswamy noted increased activity in areas of the brain regulating motor activity when subjects observed the movements knowing they would later do them , and when they added up the number of fingers used , compared with passive watching .
" These data suggest that activity of human mirror neuron systems is generally increased by attention relative to passive observation , even if that attention is not directed toward a specific motor activity , " says Muthukumaraswamy .
" Our results suggest that the mirror system remains active regardless of any concurrent task and hence is probably an automatic system .
" A good scientific understanding of the properties of the mirror system in normal humans is important , " he adds , " because this may help to understand clinical disorders such as autism where the mirror system may not be functioning normally . "
Other findings based on EEG recordings provide the first evidence of normal mirror activity in children with autism :
People familiar to children with autism may activate mirror areas of the brain in normal patterns when unfamiliar people do not .
Previous research has shown that mu rhythms are suppressed when a subject identifies with an active person being observed .
Based on this work , Lindsay Oberman , PhD , at the University of California , San Diego , examined the role of two separate factors in the mirror system response of children with autism .
Six videos were shown to a group of 26 boys , 8 to 12 years old ; half had autism .
Three videos showed images representing varying degrees of social interaction : two bouncing balls ( the baseline measurement ) , three people tossing a ball to themselves , and three people throwing the ball to each other and off the screen to the viewer .
The other set of videos showed people with varying degrees of familiarity to the subjects : strangers opening and closing their hand , family members making the same hand movement , and the subjects themselves doing the same .
EEG recordings from 13 electrodes in a cap showed that mu activity was suppressed most when subjects watched videos of themselves , indicating the greatest mirror neuron activity .
For both groups , the measurements showed a slightly lower level of suppression when subjects watched familiar people in the video and the least when watching strangers .
This indicates that normal mirror neuron activity was evoked when children with autism watched family members , but not strangers .
" Thus , to say that the mirror neuron system is nonfunctional may only be partially correct , " says Oberman .
" Perhaps individuals with autism have fewer mirror neurons and / or less functional mirror neurons that require a greater degree of activation than a typical child 's system in order to respond . "
The mirror neuron system may react to stimuli that the observer sees as " like me . "
If this is the case , suggests Oberman , " perhaps typical individuals apply this identification to all people ( both familiar and unfamiliar ) , resulting in activation of these areas in response to the observed stimuli , while individuals on the autism spectrum only consider familiar individuals ( including themselves ) as ' like me , ' " she says .
This evidence for normal mirror neuron activity in autistic children may indicate that mirror system dysfunction in these cases reflects an impairment in identifying with and assigning personal significance to unfamiliar people and things , Oberman suggests .
Whether deficits in relating to unfamiliar people that are characteristic of autism are the cause or the result of a dysfunctional mirror neuron system is unclear .
( Summation of the considerations and examinations of the human spirit and the material universe completed between 1923 and 1953 a.d. )
1 Before the beginning was a Cause and the entire purpose of the Cause was the creation of effect .
2 In the beginning and forever is the decision and the decision is TO BE .
3 The first action of beingness is to assume a viewpoint .
4 The second action of beingness is to extend from the viewpoint , points to view , which are dimension points .
5 Thus there is space created , for the definition of space is : viewpoint of dimension .
And the purpose of a dimension point is space and a point to view .
6 The action of a dimension point is reaching and withdrawing .
7 And from the viewpoint to the dimension points there are connection and interchange : thus new dimension points are made : thus there is communication .
8 And thus there is LIGHT .
9 And thus there is energy .
10 And thus there is life .
11 But there are other viewpoints and these viewpoints outthrust points to view .
And there comes about an interchange amongst viewpoints ; but the interchange is never otherwise than in terms of exchanging dimension points .
12 The dimension point can be moved by the viewpoint , for the viewpoint , in addition to creative ability and consideration , possesses volition and potential independence of action : and the viewpoint , viewing dimension points , can change in relation to its own or other dimension points or viewpoints and thus comes about all the fundamentals there are to motion .
13 The dimension points are each and every one , whether large or small , solid .
And they are solid solely because the viewpoints say they are solid .
14 Many dimension points combine into larger gases , fluids or solids : thus there is matter .
But the most valued point is admiration , and admiration is so strong its absence alone permits persistence .
15 The dimension point can be different from other dimension points and thus can possess an individual quality .
And many dimension points can possess a similar quality and others can possess a similar quality unto themselves .
Thus comes about the quality of classes of matter .
16 The viewpoint can combine dimension points into forms and the forms can be simple or complex and can be at different distances from the viewpoint and so there can be combinations of form .
And the forms are capable of motion and the viewpoints are capable of motion and so there can be motion of forms .
17 And the opinion of the viewpoint regulates the consideration of the forms , their stillness or their motion , and these considerations consist of assignment of beauty or ugliness to the forms and these considerations alone are art .
18 It is the opinions of the viewpoints that some of these forms should endure .
Thus there is survival .
19 And the viewpoint can never perish ; but the form can perish .
20 And the many viewpoints , interacting , become dependent upon one another ’s forms and do not choose to distinguish completely the ownership of dimension points and so comes about a dependency upon the dimension points and upon the other viewpoints .
21 From this comes a consistency of viewpoint of the interaction of dimension points and this , regulated , is TIME .
22 And there are universes .
23 The universes , then , are three in number : the universe created by one viewpoint , the universe created by every other viewpoint , the universe created by the mutual action of viewpoints which is agreed to be upheld — the physical universe .
24 And the viewpoints are never seen .
And the viewpoints consider more and more that the dimension points are valuable .
And the viewpoints try to become the anchor points and forget that they can create more points and space and forms .
Thus comes about scarcity .
And the dimension points can perish and so the viewpoints assume that they , too , can perish .
25 Thus comes about death .
26 The manifestations of pleasure and pain , of thought , emotion and effort , of thinking , of sensation , of affinity , reality , communication , of behavior and being are thus derived and the riddles of our universe are apparently contained and answered herein .
27 There is beingness , but Man believes there is only becomingness .
28 The resolution of any problem posed hereby is the establishment of viewpoints and dimension points , the betterment of condition and concourse amongst dimension points and , thereby , viewpoints , and the remedy of abundance or scarcity in all things , pleasant or ugly , by the rehabilitation of the ability of the viewpoint to assume points of view and create and uncreate , neglect , start , change and stop dimension points of any kind at the determinism of the viewpoint .
Certainty in all three universes must be regained , for certainty , not data , is knowledge .
29 In the opinion of the viewpoint , any beingness , any thing , is better than no thing , any effect is better than no effect , any universe better than no universe , any particle better than no particle , but the particle of admiration is best of all .
30 And above these things there might be speculation only .
And below these things there is the playing of the game .
But these things which are written here Man can experience and know .
And some may care to teach these things and some may care to use them to assist those in distress and some may desire to employ them to make individuals and organizations more able and so could give to Earth a culture of which Earth could be proud .

( Adds Russia quote , details )
CLEVELAND , Feb 26 ( Reuters ) - Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton clashed sharply in a high - stakes one - on - one debate on Tuesday , accusing each other of falsely portraying their stances on health care , trade and other issues .
Clinton , who needs to win next week in Ohio and Texas to keep her U.S. presidential campaign alive after Obama 's streak of 11 straight victories , went on the attack early in the debate at Cleveland State University in Ohio .
Obama fired back repeatedly in several testy but controlled exchanges during a debate that seemed unlikely to change the dynamic of the race before next Tuesday 's contests .
The debate was sharper in tone than last week 's encounter in Texas , but far less personal and angry than a Democratic debate last month in South Carolina .
Clinton kept up her recent criticism of Obama campaign literature sent to Ohio voters that she said mischaracterized her health care proposal , which includes mandates requiring Americans to purchase health insurance .
" We should have a good debate that uses accurate information , not false , misleading and discredited information , especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality , affordable health care for everyone , " the New York senator said .
Obama , an Illinois senator , said Clinton has frequently misrepresented his health care plan , which does not include mandates and which some critics suggest could leave 15 million Americans uninsured .
An estimated 47 million Americans -- about a sixth of the population -- now have no health insurance , either privately or through the government .
Clinton , once the odds - on favorite to win the Democratic nomination to contest November 's presidential election against the Republican candidate , has lost big leads in public opinion polls in Ohio and Texas as Obama has gained momentum and made inroads among her supporters .
Obama said he was interested in bringing the cost of health care down and enforcing mandates could create a burden on some low - income Americans .
Clinton 's criticisms , he said , were part of a consistent pattern .
" Senator Clinton has ... constantly sent out negative attacks on us , e-mail , robo-calls , flyers , television ads , radio calls , and we have n't whined about it because I understand that 's the nature of these campaigns , " he said .
" But to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that Senator Clinton has taken throughout this campaign I think is simply not accurate . "
AGGRESSIVE CLINTON
With her campaign on the line , Clinton has aggressively challenged Obama in the last few days , questioning his readiness to become commander in chief and chiding him for the health care campaign literature sent to Ohio voters .
In the debate , she attacked Obama for claiming she supported the North American Free Trade Agreement , which she said she believes should be renegotiated .
She was first lady when her husband , President Bill Clinton , approved the deal .
The trade agreement is unpopular in Ohio , where it has been blamed for contributing to a broad loss of manufacturing jobs in the state .
" You know , I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning .
I did n't have a public position on it because I was part of the administration .
But when I started running for the Senate , I have been a critic , " Clinton said .
Obama repeated the charge and said he would push to have NAFTA redone .
" I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she 's always opposed NAFTA .
In her campaign for Senate , she said that NAFTA , on balance , had been good for New York and good for America , " he said .
Clinton complained about having to take the first question more often than Obama , and made reference to her campaign 's charges that he gets an easier ride from the national media than she does .
She pointed to a television skit that portrayed a fawning press posing questions to Obama .
" If anybody saw ' Saturday Night Live , ' you know , maybe we should ask Barack if he 's comfortable and needs another pillow , " she said .
" I just find it kind of curious that I keep getting the first question on all of these issues . "
Clinton , who has questioned Obama 's foreign policy experience , also stumbled over the likely new Russian president when asked if she knew the name of the successor to President Vladimir Putin -- Dmitry Medvedev .
" Medvedev -- whatever , " she finally said .
The two contenders revisited their differences on the Iraq war .
Clinton said Obama , an early opponent of the war , had the advantage of not being in the Senate in 2002 when she voted to authorize the war .
But Obama said her vote " facilitated and enabled " President George W. Bush 's decision to go to war .
" Senator Clinton often says that she is ready on day one , but in fact she was ready to give into George Bush on this critical issue , " Obama said .

PBS Ties with Military Defense for Best Value for Tax Dollars
ARLINGTON , VA , March 22 , 2007 -
For the fourth consecutive year , a GfK Roper Public Affairs & Media poll shows Americans consider PBS the nation 's most trusted institution among nationally known organizations .
In this latest study , PBS was elevated to the # 1 value for tax dollars , tying with military defense .
The non-partisan , international research company released the comprehensive results from its national opinion survey , which was conducted to gauge the attitudes of Americans towards PBS and other major national institutions , including courts of law and commercial broadcast television networks .
According to 1,000 randomly - selected participants from across the country , PBS ' news and public affairs series are the most trustworthy among all networks , and the most fair and balanced programs available to Americans today .
" These results show once again that the American public believes they are getting their money 's worth in return for the funds that are invested in PBS .
The public places great trust in PBS , " said Barry Feinberg , Managing Director of GfK Roper Public Affairs and Media .
" PBS is deeply honored to serve as America 's most trusted institution for the past four years , " said Paula Kerger , PBS President and Chief Executive Officer .
" This is something we do n't take lightly .
PBS and its member stations strive each day to honor the trust the public has placed in us , and we look forward to continue serving the American people for many years to come . "
Additional survey highlights :
- PBS remains # 1 in public trust , with 49 % trusting PBS a great deal .
Second in trust are " courts of law , " which are trusted a great deal by 27 % .
- For the first time , PBS ties with military defense as # 1 in tax value among 20 federally funded services and institutions , with 20 % stating it as an excellent value for tax dollars .
- Americans are more satisfied with programs on PBS compared to cable and commercial broadcast .
Thirty - nine percent stated they were " very satisfied " with PBS programs , while Cable programming received 25 % and commercial broadcasting programming , 20 % .
- The majority of Americans think it 's very important to have public television ( 59 % ) .
Only two out of five Americans think the same about commercial broadcast television ( 41 % ) while even less think it 's very important that we have cable television ( 38 % ) .
- PBS remains the network with the most trusted news and public affairs programming , with 41 % trusting its programs a great deal .
CNN and Fox News trailed as second and third with 28 % and 25 % , respectively .
- Forty - three percent of Americans rated the news coverage , investigations and discussions of major issues on PBS programs as mostly fair .
NBC came in second at 37 % .
- Half of Americans believe the federal funding PBS receives is " too little . "
When informed that public broadcasting receives 15 % of its funding from the government , and that this amount translates to about one dollar per person per year of government support , 49 % believe this amount is " too little . "
Commissioned by PBS , Roper Public Affairs & Media independently administered the annual telephone survey to 1,002 adults between the ages of 25 to 75 during February 1 - 25 , 2007 .
To maintain objectivity throughout the survey , the questionnaire did not identify PBS as the sponsor , and wherever PBS and other media , organizations or services were evaluated together , a questioning randomization process was employed to ensure that both PBS and its competitors in a given category were treated equally in terms of positioning for any particular question .
Moreover , any questions asked about PBS only were asked at the end of the survey , after the comparison questions were completed .

Sick
I ’m sorry I have n’t been keeping up with Bubble City .
I ’ve spent a lot of the last few weeks lying in bed and drinking fluids .
( With occasional breaks to play Rock Band , much to the annoyance of my neighbors . )
Once again , I ’ve been sick — this time , with four different illnesses .
I have a lot of illnesses .
I do n’t talk about it much , for a variety of reasons .
I feel ashamed to have an illness .
( It sounds absurd , but there still is an enormous stigma around being sick . )
I do n’t want to use being ill as an excuse .
( Although I sometimes wonder how much more productive I ’d be if I was n’t so sick . )
And , to a large extent , I just do n’t find it an interesting subject .
( My friends are amazed by this ; why is such a curious person so uncurious about the things so directly affecting his life ? )
One of my goals for this blog is to describe what it ’s like to be in various situations and it struck me that I ’ve never said much about what it ’s like to be sick .
So I figured I ’d try to remedy that .
( Unfortunately , being sick has made this slightly more difficult .
I started this post on thanksgiving and now it ’s almost four days later . )
Cold :
All the time I feel tired and woozy .
My throat is sore and I ’m constantly searching for kleenex to address my nose .
Sometimes I feel too hot , like I ’m burning up .
I ’m always thirsty .
Concentrating on anything is difficult .
I just feel kind of wasted .
Upset stomach : Huge pains grind through my stomach , like it ’s trying to leap out of my body .
Food is always followed by pain , followed by running to the bathroom .
I ’m afraid to go out because I would n’t want to get too far from a toilet .
I ’m always thirsty and the dehydration makes me angry and confused .
At times the pain is excruciating and even after it goes I spend some time just reeling from it .
Migraine : Ever felt someone ’s nails dig into your scalp ?
Imagine that their nails are knives and they ’re scratching thru your brain and you can begin to imagine what a migraine feels like .
Light , sound , touch — everything makes it worse , making the most painful pains even more painful .
Even when you quell it with a pill , you still end up feeling woozy and disconnected , as if the pill is just barely keeping the pain at bay .
Depressed mood :
Surely there have been times when you ’ve been sad .
Perhaps a loved one has abandoned you or a plan has gone horribly awry .
Your face falls .
Perhaps you cry .
You feel worthless .
You wonder whether it ’s worth going on .
Everything you think about seems bleak — the things you ’ve done , the things you hope to do , the people around you .
You want to lie in bed and keep the lights off .
Depressed mood is like that , only it does n’t come for any reason and it does n’t go for any either .
Go outside and get some fresh air or cuddle with a loved one and you do n’t feel any better , only more upset at being unable to feel the joy that everyone else seems to feel .
Everything gets colored by the sadness .
At best , you tell yourself that your thinking is irrational , that it is simply a mood disorder , that you should get on with your life .
But sometimes that is worse .
You feel as if streaks of pain are running through your head , you thrash your body , you search for some escape but find none .
And this is one of the more moderate forms .
As George Scialabba put it , “ acute depression does not feel like falling ill , it feels like being tortured … the pain is not localized ; it runs along every nerve , an unconsuming fire . …
Even though one knows better , one cannot believe that it will ever end , or that anyone else has ever felt anything like it . ”
The economist Richard Layard , after advocating that the goal of public policy should be to maximize happiness , set out to learn what the greatest impediment to happiness was today .
His conclusion : depression .
Depression causes nearly half of all disability , it affects one in six , and explains more current unhappiness than poverty .
And ( important for public policy ) Cognitive - Behavioral Therapy has a short - term success rate of 50 % .
Sadly , depression ( like other mental illnesses , especially addiction ) is not seen as “ real ” enough to deserve the investment and awareness of conditions like breast cancer ( 1 in 8 ) or AIDS ( 1 in 150 ) .
And there is , of course , the shame .
So I hope you ’ll forgive me for not doing more .
And hey , it could be worse .
At least I have decent health insurance .
You should follow me on twitter here .

Missing Gold
Precious Metals in WTC 4 Vault : Only a Fraction Recovered ?
This image is found on the PBS.org website companion for the television documentary America Rebuilds under the section Uncovering Property .
The page , entitled A Treasure in Silver and Gold , describes the vault as two levels of 3,000 square feet each .
See the source for the full - sized image .
The page credits images to Leslie E. Robertson and Associates .
The basement of 4 World Trade Center housed vaults used to store gold and silver bullion .
Published articles about precious metals recovered from the World Trade Center ruins in the aftermath of the attack mention less than $ 300 million worth of gold .
All such reports appear to refer to a removal operation conducted in late October of 2001 .
On Nov. 1 , Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced that " more than $ 230 million " worth of gold and silver bars that had been stored in a bomb - proof vault had been recovered .
A New York Times article contained :
1 Two Brinks trucks were at ground zero on Wednesday to start hauling away the $ 200 million in gold and silver that the Bank of Nova Scotia had stored in a vault under the trade center ...
A team of 30 firefighters and police officers are helping to move the metals , a task that can be measured practically down to the flake but that has been rounded off at 379,036 ounces of gold and 29,942,619 ounces of silver ..
Reports describing the contents of the vaults before the attack suggest that nearly $ 1 billion in precious metals was stored in the vaults .
A figure of $ 650 million in a National Real Estate Investor article published after the attack is apparently based on pre-attack reports .
2 Unknown to most people at the time , $ 650 million in gold and silver was being kept in a special vault four floors beneath Four World Trade Center .
An article in the TimesOnline gives the following rundown of precious metals that were being stored in the WTC vault belonging to Comex .

Comex metals trading - 3,800 gold bars weighing 12 tonnes and worth more than $ 100 million
Comex clients - 800,000 ounces of gold with a value of about $ 220 million
Comex clients - 102 million ounces of silver , worth $ 430 million
Bank of Nova Scotia - $ 200 million of gold
The TimesOnline article is not clear as to whether the $ 200 million in gold reported by the Bank of Nova Scotia was part of the $ 220 million in gold held by Comex for clients .
If so , the total is $ 750 million ; otherwise $ 950 million .
There appear to be no reports of precious metals discovered between November of 2001 and the completion of excavation several months later .
Assuming that the above reports described the value of precious metals in the vaults before the attack , and that the $ 230 million mentioned by Giuliani represented the approxmiate value of metals recovered , it would seem that at least the better part of a billion dollars worth of precious metals went missing .
( It is not plausible , of course , that whatever destroyed the towers vaporized gold and silver , which are dense , inert metals that are extremely unlikely to participate in chemical reactions with other materials . )
An article in The Sierra Times suggests that gold was recovered from two trucks in a tunnel under 5 World Trade Center , giving rise to suspicions that the trucks were being used to remove the gold from the vaults before the South Tower fell .

However , this report may have been based on an erroneous reading of other reports that describe the removal of crushed vehicles from a tunnel under 5 WTC in order to gain access to the vaults under 4 WTC to remove their contents .

Why is there this huge discrepancy between the value of gold and silver reported recovered , and the value reported to have been stored in the vaults ?
There are a number of possible explanations , from outright theft using the attack as cover , to insurance fraud .
Until there is a genuine investigation that probes all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the attack , we can only speculate .

A. I try to educate them in exactly what these fields are .
That they are part of the full electromagnetic spectrum that goes all the way from the radio frequency and microwave bands , through infrared , ultraviolet , the gamma rays and all that .
And the difference between the ionizing X - ray , gamma ray region and the microwave frequency is in the quantum energy .
The lower you get in frequency the lower you get in quantum energy and the less it can do to the cells in your body .
If you have a really high quantum energy such as your X - rays and ionizing - radiation region of the spectrum , this energy is high enough that it can bump electrons out of the orbit in your cells and it can create serious changes in the cells of your body such that they can turn into cancers and various other things that are not good for you .
But down where we are working , in the microwave band , you are millions of times lower in frequency and there the quantum energy is so low that they can't do any damage to the cells whatsoever .
And most people do n't realize this .
Somehow , something is missing in their basic science education , which is something I keep trying to push .
Learn the spectrum .
Learn that you 're in far worse shape if you lie out on the beach in the middle of summer and you soak up that ultraviolet radiation than you are if you use your cell phone .
Q. Some people say that with the ever - increasing exposure of the population to microwaves -- cell phones have really taken off in the past few years -- we need to redouble our research efforts to look for dangerous effects of microwaves on cells and human tissues .
Do you agree ?
A. No .
All the emphasis that we need more research on power line fields , cell phones , police radar -- this involves billions of dollars that could be much better spent on other health problems .
Because there is really nothing there .
Why you should retire quickly
January 14 , 2008
A lthough I retired recently after working continuously in the United States for 35 years , I have been discussing retirement issues with family members , relatives and friends for about two years .
As everybody retires sooner or later , I have studied this issue thoroughly , and developed strong views I would like to share .
One very important thing to reinforce at the very outset is everyone will have to decide for oneself when to retire , where to live after retirement , and what criteria to use to make these decisions .
There are no silver bullets and a ' cookie - cutter ' approach or ' one - size - fits - all ' paradigm will simply not work .
For example , in our case , weather is the least important criterion because if we have retired , we do n't have to commute to work , so snow , sleet or ice does n't cramp our style .
Besides , my wife and I are not very outdoorsy and can do indoors all the exercises we want to do , all year around -- like stretching and exercise - biking .
We will ultimately want to move close to the kids after we both retire , irrespective of where they live .
With respect to the timing of the retirement , I strongly feel one should retire as soon as one can financially afford to do so , especially if the kids are financially independent .
Nobody on his deathbed regrets he did n't work long enough !
It 's best to enjoy life while one is still healthy enough to do so .
What 's the point in accumulating money all your life ?
After all , as they say , ' you ca n't take it with you , anyway ! '
Do n't pay attention to the formulae and spreadsheets financial planners use to scare you when they tell you how much money you should be making after retirement and what assets you must have in order to make sure you have the same standard of living after retirement as you do before it .
First of all , there is no need to maintain the same standard of living throughout your life .
You need to gradually simplify your lifestyle so you can save money for long term care in your old age and to make things relatively simple for your kids after you are gone .
Too often , people blow too much of their savings on travel and frivolous items , thinking Medicare will take care of health needs .
Well , Medicare does n't pay for care for an extended period of time and while Medicaid does , you have to be in a very low income bracket to qualify for it .
Therefore , unless you are filthy rich , you do need a lot saved up .
One very good reason to retire is to provide opportunities to the younger generation to move ahead .
I will never forget the smile on the face of the person who got promoted in the wake of my retirement .
Too often , people just keep working because they have no other interests outside of work .
That is bad for the employer , for other employees , even for themselves .
One needs to develop hobbies and non-work related interests way before one 's retirement .
I have also noticed some people get emotionally attached to their co-workers and the very thought of retiring is depressing to them .
Well , getting emotionally attached to co-workers makes as much sense as getting emotionally attached to a rental car !
However , it does make sense to keep a good working relationship with co-workers .
There are definitely certain distinct advantages to leading a retired life , in that it allows you the freedom to do the things you always wanted to but never had time for .
To me , retirement means I can do whatever I want to , whenever I want , as long as whatever I decide to do passes the ' SMEL ' test -- where S stands for ' sustainable ' ( physically , emotionally , intellectually , financially , socially , and spiritually ) , M for ' moral ' , E for ' ethical ' and L for ' legal ' .

The relationship between Bolivia and the United States turned worse on Sunday after Bolivia 's President Evo Morales accused the U.S. ambassador of conspiring against his government .
The U.S. ambassador Phillip Goldberg " aimed to be a counterweight to this government and erode its legitimacy , " Morales told reporters Sunday , calling on the U.S. government to practice diplomacy instead of politics .
Morales cited a photo of Goldberg with John Jairo Venegas , a Colombian citizen accused of crimes , and a leading opposition figure from the southern Bolivia department of Santa Cruz , during a business expo .
The photo , published last week by Spanish news agency EFE , was claimed by the United States to be a montage .
Diplomatic ties between the United States and Bolivia have frayed since Morales , a leftwing indigenous former coca farmer , took power last year .
Last month Goldberg was forced to apologize to the Bolivian government after he mocked a suggestion by Morales that the U.N. headquarters be moved away from New York as Bolivian officials had difficulty entering the United States to attend a U.N. General Assembly meeting .
Goldberg joked that Morales may also want to move the Walt Disney headquarters , triggering a diplomatic spat between the two countries .

A group of hackers calling itself " Anonymous " has hit the Church of Scientology 's Web site with an online attack .
The attack was launched January 19 by Anonymous , which is seeking media attention to help " save people from Scientology by reversing the brainwashing , " according to a Web page maintained by Anonymous .
Anonymous claims to have knocked the Church 's Web site offline with a distributed denial - of - service attack , in which many computers bombard the victim 's server with requests , overwhelming it with data in the hope of ultimately knocking the system offline .
True to its name , Anonymous does not disclose the true identities of its members .
Cruise Control
The attacks were spurred by the Church 's efforts to remove video of movie star Tom Cruise professing his admiration for the religion , according to an Anonymous video manifesto posted to Youtube .
" For the good of your followers , for the good of mankind and for our own enjoyment , we shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form , " a creepy computerized voice states in the video .
Anonymous followed up this dispatch with a second video blasting the media for failing to completely report the group 's criticisms of the church .
This video was taken down Friday by Youtube , citing a " terms of use violation . "
Measurable Attack
Anonymous has managed to generate a measurable attack against the Scientology.org Web site .
Over the past few days , the site was hit with several DDOS ( distributed denial - of - service ) attacks , which flooded it with as much as 220 M bps of traffic , according to Jose Nazario , a senior security engineer with Arbor Networks , whose company compiles data on Internet attacks .
The Anonymous campaign shows some level of organization .
" 220 M bps is probably about in the middle of attack sizes , " Nazario said .
" It 's not just one or two guys hanging out in the university dorms doing this . "
On average , the attacks lasted about 30 minutes and used up 168 M bps of bandwidth .
In the past year , Arbor has seen attacks on other sites hit 40G bps , or 200 times the strength of the Anonymous event .
Shortly after it was hit with the DDOS flood , the Scientology.org Web site was moved to a server hosted by Prolexic Technologies , according to dat compiled by Netcraft , an Internet monitoring company .
Prolexic specializes in protecting companies from DDOS attacks .
A Prolexic spokeswoman confirmed that the Church of Scientology is one of the company 's clients , but declined to offer more details on the matter .
The Church of Scientology did not answer questions relating to the online attacks , but in a statement it said that the controversy over the Tom Cruise video had driven traffic to its Web site .
Mixed Response
The secretive Church of Scientology 's practices , including its efforts to use copyright law to restrict the dissemination of information about the church , have engendered a lot of criticism within the Internet community .
But one Web site set up to criticize Scientology -- called Operation Clambake -- called the DDOS attacks a bad idea .
" Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card , " wrote Andreas Heldal - Lund , the Web site 's owner .
" They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy . "
If publicity was Anonymous ' ultimate goal , the group has had some success .
Late in the day Friday , seven of the top 10 stories on the Digg.com news - linking site related to Scientology or to Anonymous ' communiques .
Although the group 's
Web page exhorts participants to " begin bumping Digg , " Anonymous did not manipulate the news site 's promotional algorithm system , which determines which stories get top billing , according to Digg CEO Jay Adelson .
" They must have done a very good job of bringing in a diverse set of interests , " he said .
" It just happened to hit a nerve that the Digg community was interested in . "
It is unusual for Digg 's front page to be so dominated by a single topic , but not unprecedented , Adelson said .
Last year 's shootings at Virginia Tech and the 2005 terrorist bombings in London achieved a comparable level of coverage .
" In the history of Digg , there 's no question that the topic of Scientology has been of great interest to the community , " he said .
" I ca n't explain why . "
Book lovers have a message for e-book makers : you can have my paperback when you pry it from my cold , dead fingers .
We reported yesterday on the 2008 Digital Entertainment Survey from the UK , which found that 70 percent of Internet users would stop sharing files if they received notification from their ISP .
But tucked in the survey data was another fascinating finding about the strength of consumer attachment to traditional paper books .
According to the research , sponsored by UK media lawyers Wiggin , survey data shows books have the highest " attachment " rating of any leisure media activity .
People are more attached to their books than they are to their satellite television , radio stations , newspapers , magazines , social networks , video games , blogs , DVDs , and P2P file - swapping .
And it 's not like this high rate of affection for the book occurs only among a small group ; books came in second only to " listen to the radio " in terms of the number of people who engage in those activities .
I feel nothing for you
That 's not great news for the e-book market , and follow - up questions only showed how entrenched paper books are in the public imagination .
When the survey asked about people 's emotional attachment to paper books , 53 percent of respondents said that they would " never " or would " hate " to stop using them , and another 24 percent said they would be " uncomfortable . "
When asked directly about the appeal of e-book readers , 39 percent of the respondents said that the readers were appealing or very appealing , but 61 percent had the opposite reaction .
The survey notes that familiarity with the devices seems to boost their attractiveness to most people , and 17 percent of respondents did say they would almost certainly purchase a reader once they learned about all of its features and benefits .
Entertainment Media Research , which authored the study , notes that " the printed book remains one of the highest emotionally attached media we measured , so such innovations are likely to be somewhat slow in catching on in the mainstream . "

Barry was once considered one of America ’s best drug agents .
He was cross-trained and worked joint operations with the ATF , DEA , FBI , U.S. Military and Border Patrol .
Barry received specialized training in every known field of narcotics operations .
He has worked undercover operations , performed reverse stings , conducted scores of search warrants , trained drug dogs and worked highway interdiction .
Barry was the first to blow the whistle on drug dog false alerts in 2006 when he released footage of a certified drug detector dog false alerting .
Barry began his Texas law enforcement career as a police dispatcher for the Gladewater Police Department .
He was soon hired by the Big Sandy Police Department where he trained his own narcotic detector dog .
Although he had less than five miles of highway to practice his craft , Barry made over one hundred drug arrests and broke several drug seizure records .
“ He had a knack for finding drugs and made more arrests and more seizures than all of the other agents combined .
He was probably the best narcotics officer in the state and maybe the country during his time with the task force .
”-- Tom Finley / Drug Task Force Commander
Barry now admits his conscience often bothered him as he raided and jailed non-violent citizens .
Tearing the families apart never seemed right to him .
He explains ,
“ My parents , the public schools and the churches taught me any person who used drugs is evil and deserves to be harshly punished .
At times , I could feel I was doing something wrong but the brainwashing of antidrug propaganda , my addiction to adrenaline and my need for peer acceptance overrode my good conscience . ”
In 2006 , as a form of penance , Barry used his experience as a former drug agent to produce a series of instructional videos titled , NeverGetBusted .
The DVD series taught citizens how to avoid being arrested for drug crimes .
Flanking NeverGetBusted , he produced an Internet reality show called , KopBusters , where he set traps for police and filmed them committing crimes .
One particular sting brought attention to a mother of two who had been illegally incarcerated after police planted drugs in her car .
The sting was designed to embarrass the police and trick them into raiding a fake marijuana grow - house that was rigged with hidden cameras .
Although he and his family suffered severe retaliation , the sting was a success because Yolanda Madden was released from federal prison and remains free today .
Barry ’s critics viewed his style of activism as a personal attack against god , children and the police .
Now , most people see NeverGetBusted and KopBusters as a clever humanitarian operation that was designed to protect citizens from their abusive government .
The United States now holds the all - time world record for the number of citizens it incarcerates ... numerically and proportionately .
When Barry quit the police force he was tormented by the terror he had caused as a cop .
In 2005 , Barry released his NeverGetBusted DVD series to help prevent other families from suffering inhumane treatment at the hands of the American police and politicians .
The video series became world - famous for teaching citizens how to avoid being arrested for marijuana .
Watch Barry ’s NeverGetBusted videos for free here .
NeverGetBusted has since evolved into a humanitarian cause dedicated to freeing prisoners and defendants of the war on drugs .

Brazil 's lawyers have been shocked to find that a boy aged eight has managed to pass the entrance exam to law school .
The Bar Association said the achievement of Joao Victor Portellinha should be taken as a warning about the low standards of some of Brazil 's law schools .
" If this is confirmed , the Education Ministry should immediately intervene ... to investigate the circumstances of this case , " said the association 's president in Goias state , Miguel Angelo Cancado .
Joao Victor is still in fifth grade , two levels ahead of normal for his age , but his mother says he is not a cloistered genius .
" He is a regular boy , " she told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper .
" He is very dedicated , likes to read and study , but he has fun and makes friends . "
The Universidade Paulista , a multi-campus private university , said yesterday that the boy would not be enrolling any time soon : he still has to graduate from high school .
Still , the school said the " student 's performance , considering his age and level of education , was good , especially in the essay test , which revealed his good capacity to express himself and handle the language . "
" My dream is to be a federal judge , " the boy said , according to Globo TV's Web site .
" So I decided to take the test to see how I would do ... it was easy .
I studied a week before the test . "
Brazil requires every student to take an entrance exam before being admitted to college .
Each university administers its own test , and the exams from private institutions are usually considered to be easier than those of public universities , which are free and attract many more candidates .
University officials said they could not release figures on the number of people who pass and fail the law school entrance exam .
As a former colony , Brazilian civil law is largely based on that of Portugal with statutes derived from the Romano - Germanic legal tradition , but has been amended to include some precedent - based common law .
In the header file that declares class nsAutoString , there is an important comment : “ Do not allocate this class on the heap ” .
This rule , buried deep in a header file that almost nobody reads , is a small example of a problem that plagues the Mozilla codebase : it ’s easy to write incorrect code .
Mozilla , and XPCOM in particular , uses a meta - language on top of C ++.
This meta - language of helper classes and typesafe templates allows experienced XPCOM coders to avoid some of the complexities of XPCOM refcounting and memory management .
Unfortunately , it is possible , even easy , to use this meta - language incorrectly or inefficiently .
The following code , while correct C++ , is incorrect “ Mozilla C+ + ” :
class Foo { private : nsAutoString mStr ; ... } ; void Bad ( ) { Foo * foo = new Foo( ) ; // allocated nsAutoString on the heap ! }
Errors such as this are especially insidious because the code works correctly ; it is merely an inefficient use of memory which can add up quickly .
Taras and David have been working on a solution which will allow application - specific rules such as “ only allocate nsAutoString on the stack ” to be enforced at compile - time .
It is called Dehydra GCC .
It is a tool which translates the internal GCC representation of C++ code into a JavaScript object model , and allows application authors to write analysis passes as scripts .
This past week I hooked up Dehydra to the Mozilla build system .
It is now possible to configure -- with - static - checking= / path/to/gcc_dehydra.so and Dehydra will enforce a few basic rules : classes annotated with NS_STACK_CLASS may only be allocated on the stack , and classes annotated with NS_FINAL_CLASS may not be subclassed .
For an example of a more complicated analysis , see bug 420933 , ensuring that XPCOM methods handle outparams correctly .
Dehydra currently only works on Linux , and building it is a bit complicated : a custom patched GCC is required , as well as a spidermonkey package .
Complete directions are available on the Mozilla Developer Center .
Dehydra is still a work in progress .
We are working to complete the following tasks :
Treehydra : a sub-project to reflect the detailed GCC control - flow tree , instead of the higher - level syntax tree currently reflected by dehydra , which will allow for more detailed and accurate analyses
port Dehydra to Mac
allow Dehydra to process C , Objective - C , and Objective - C++ ( currently it only processes C++ )
port Dehydra for Mingw ( probably cross- compiled from Linux for sanity )
make the tinderbox build with static checking
We are actively looking for hackers to help out with this project .
There are many different kinds of tasks people can help with :
Write analysis passes to check for common bad - code patterns in Mozilla or other projects
Implement a webtool that allows users to browse code exactly
Help package up GCC - dehydra in RPMs and .deb packages for easy installation into Linux distros
I am very excited about the prospect of using static checking tools such as this one to improve our code quality and development cycle , and I ’m looking forward to new and unexpected uses for this code !
In future posts I will cover basics of writing a dehydra script .
I knew we were in trouble when the man in the shiny suit appeared with a trolley of bottled water and granola bars .
Our British Airways flight from Vancouver had already been delayed twice - trouble refuelling and trouble finding somewhere to dock - but even as we walked into the crowded but strangely inactive baggage hall in the new Terminal 5 , nobody was telling us that we had just flown into the sort of fiasco that the British seem to do so particularly well .
Queues had already formed at the customer assistance desks but the smiling , slightly wild - eyed staff had almost nothing to offer .
Even after six hours of chaos , nobody had been briefed .
Nobody knew anything .
The desks , probably knocked together by a carpenter some time during the night , were bare .
I 'm not even sure they had telephones .
Not that it would have helped if they had .
" I have tried calling , " one young woman told me , waving a sheet of contact numbers .
" But nobody 's answering . "
So , £ 4.3 bn spent .
Fifteen years to complete .
All manner of planning stipulations flouted .
( In 2001 , even the possibility of a third runway was deemed " totally unacceptable " . )
And all to create what the Queen in her opening address called " a 21st - century gateway to Britain " .
It felt more like a 19th - century doorway to Calcutta from where I was sitting .
According to the press , BA and the BAA were at each other 's throats from the moment things began to go wrong , ie almost from the second that this wretched place opened .
This was certainly reflected at ground level .
As the jet - lagged crowd slumped on the floor in the vast baggage claim area ( the genius of the Richard Rogers Partnership did not extend to a single chair or bench ) , BAA officials were keen to impress on us that they had done their job .
The lights were on .
The conveyor belts were turning .
BA officials meanwhile blamed the BAA computer systems .
And all the time , every 10 minutes , an Essex voice was cheerily announcing in a loop designed to send even a strong man insane : " British Airways would like to apologise for the delay to baggage collection .
British Airways are doing their best to address the situation . "
" Why ca n't you give out some proper information ? " I asked a BA manager .
" We can 't , " he wailed .
" We do n't have any - and anyway , they have n't given us a Tannoy . "
Since then , Willie Walsh , the chief executive of BA , has been doing the rounds with a bizarre performance of mea culpa .
He is entirely to blame for the poor performance , he tells us .
" I apologise to everyone and anyone . "
Strangely , this apology does n't extend to his resignation for what he admits was " a public relations disaster " for his airline and which Nigel Turner , chief executive of BMI , called " a severe embarrassment for the United Kingdom " .
Indeed , how is one to respond to this latest disaster , and what does it augur for the London Olympics in 2012 ?
How are we going to feel when the Olympic torch turns up in Walthamstow three days after the opening ceremony ?
What is so depressing is that T5 so obviously repeats the pattern of the Millennium Dome , Wembley stadium and the Scottish parliament which , you may remember , arrived three years late and 10 - times over budget .
When that unlovely building opened , Jack McConnell , the Scottish first minister , said : " It 's what we do in the building that really matters . "
And that , I suppose , is also true of Terminal 5 .
Except that what we do in T5 is to try to get out of it as quickly as possible .
Some people have praised Richard Rogers ' design , with its sense of scale and space , the use of natural light , the vast steel arches and back - painted glass .
But who really cares ?
There is not a shred of glamour or excitement in an oversized shed in the back end of Southall , even if you can shop at Paul Smith and get a meal cooked ( as if ) by Gordon Ramsay .
We go to airports reluctantly .
We leave them with heart - felt relief .
Speaking for myself , I have arrived at that very fine line when I wonder if a two - week holiday in the sun or the snow is actually worth the ordeal of air travel - the Byzantine ticket pricing schemes , the invasive and tedious security lines , the crying babies , the unexplained delays , before you get on to the plane , while you sit on the runway silently begging air traffic control to end the torture and give you a precious " slot " , and while you wait for your suitcase which will always be the last off the carousel , even assuming that it 's actually on it ...
The sheer misery of the whole experience .
Is there anyone who goes on holiday ( and 80 % of air travel in the UK is leisure based ) without the dread of the journey back again ?
And I 'm beginning to see that there are alternatives .
The real " 21st - century gateway " that opened this year did so at St Pancras , and it did so with enormous style and comfort .
All of Europe is suddenly available and I can reach it in less time than my bags reached me .
All the signs are that air travel is going to get worse .
Fuel prices and tax are going up .
Air space is decreasing .
The cabin crews are getting smugger .
The one thing I did n't see at Heathrow was the expected demonstration by environmental groups such as Greenpeace or Plane Stupid .
But perhaps they were n't needed .
There were , after all , thousands of people protesting for them , albeit in a rather lacklustre and disorganised way .
They were called passengers .
And at the end of the day , it is their voice that may put an end to the vexed question of airport expansion .
The bigger it gets the worse it gets , and I 'd guess that modern air travel carries with it the seeds of its own destruction .
There will have to come a time when everyone decides that anything is better than seat 27 K behind the lavatory ... even staying at home .
The environmentalists only have to wait , because in the end they 've simply got to win .

A white man who was wrongly charged with rape even though the victim said her attacker was black described his " nightmare " ordeal for the first time yesterday .
Mark Minick feared he would lose his girlfriend and children and contemplated suicide after he was charged on flawed DNA evidence .
Yet despite being cleared of all allegations , the 26 - year - old is suffering the " final injustice " of still having to wear an electronic tag .
It was fixed to his right ankle as a condition of bail when he was charged last October with raping the teenager seven years ago .
For four months he has been under virtual house arrest between 11 pm and 7 pm .
If he broke the curfew the tag would have set off an alarm and he could have faced jail .
Mr Minick , a father of two , told the Daily Mail : " I 'm a free man and everyone knows I did n't rape that poor girl .
" But here I am , forced to stay at home at night because the security company has n't come round to take the tag off .
" It is a terrible way to treat an innocent man who was charged with a crime he did not commit .
But after the way I 've been treated , I 'm not in the least bit surprised . "
He spent yesterday frantically calling the security firm which attached the tag to remove it .
Mr Minick was arrested by " cold case " detectives reinvestigating an attack on a 17 - year - old girl in Bexleyheath , Kent .
At the time , he was nearing the end of a year 's prison sentence for robbery .
It was a crime which he bitterly regrets and which was committed during a low point in his life shortly after his mother died of cancer three years ago .
He said the conviction made him an easy target for detectives desperate to solve the crime .
During hours of questioning , three police officers claimed they had watertight DNA evidence linking him to the attack .
They told him one of his hairs had been found on the victim 's ring .
But they did not mention her statement describing her attacker as " black , large and tall " .
Mr Minick is 5ft 6in and slim .
His only visit to Bexleyheath was during a shopping trip as a child with his mother .
" These allegations came like a bolt out of the blue and I began to suspect that a former lover was trying to set me up , " he said .
" I only discovered a lot later that the girl first noticed the hair when she was in bed in hospital .
" I was working as a hospital porter at the time and I was constantly moving beds and blankets .
Perhaps this is how the hair got into her ring .
" I can understand that the police would want to question me because of my hair .
" But to charge me with rape when they have the victim describing the rapist as black beggars belief .
I would have been happy to take part in an identity parade , but they never asked me to .
Now I know why . "
After he was charged , he made a tearful phone call to his girlfriend explaining the situation .
She stuck by him and has helped him cope with the depression he has suffered since .
" I really thought she was going to leave me and I feared I would never see my two children again , " said Mr Minick .
" There were times when I felt suicidal .
I did n't think my family would want to see me again . "
On Thursday at Southwark Crown Court , the prosecution admitted that it had no evidence against Mr Minick .

US foreign policy is becoming increasingly dominated by the Pentagon rather than the State Department , and Congress is doing virtually nothing about it , according to a new report released here Thursday by several human rights organizations .
That domination is being achieved not only by the creation of new military aid and training programs controlled by … Continue reading “ Foreign Policy Increasingly Flows Through Pentagon ”

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has filed a negligence suit against world - renowned architect Frank Gehry , charging that flaws in his design of the $ 300 million Stata Center in Cambridge , one of the most celebrated works of architecture unveiled in years , caused leaks to spring , masonry to crack , mold to grow , and drainage to back up .
The suit says that MIT paid Los Angeles - based Gehry Partners $ 15 million to design the Stata Center , which was hailed by critics as innovative and eye - catching with its unconventional walls and radical angles .
But soon after its completion in spring 2004 , the center 's outdoor amphitheater began to crack due to drainage problems , the suit says .
Snow and ice cascaded dangerously from window boxes and other projecting roof areas , blocking emergency exits and damaging other parts of the building , according to the suit .
Mold grew on the center 's brick exterior , the suit says , and there were persistent leaks throughout the building .
The suit says it cost MIT more than $ 1.5 million to hire another company to rebuild the amphitheater , with new bricks , seats , and a new drainage system .
The institute alleges that both Gehry Partners and the construction company , New Jersey - based Beacon Skanska Construction Company , now known as Skanska USA Building Inc. , violated their contracts with MIT and are responsible for construction and design failures on the project .
The 400,000 - square - foot Ray and Maria Stata Center , on Vassar Street , also houses labs , offices , classrooms , and meeting rooms , and features a " street " that winds through the ground floor .
" Gehry breached its duties by providing deficient design services and drawings , " says the suit , which was filed in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston on Oct. 31 and seeks unspecified damages for costs and expenses incurred by MIT .
Gehry Partners did not respond to repeated calls and e-mail yesterday from the Globe .
A spokesman for MIT declined to comment because of the pending lawsuit .
An executive at Skanska 's Boston office yesterday blamed Gehry for problems with the project and said Gehry ignored warnings from Skanska and a consulting company prior to construction that there were flaws in his design of the amphitheater .
" This is not a construction issue , never has been , " said Paul Hewins , executive vice president and area general manager of Skanska USA .
He said Gehry rejected Skanska 's formal request to create a design that included soft joints and a drainage system in the amphitheater , and " we were told to proceed with the original design . "
After the amphitheater began cracking and flooding , Skanska spent " a few hundred thousand dollars " trying to resolve the problems , but , he said , " it was difficult to make the original design work . "
He said Skanska , which built Gillette Stadium , the State Street Financial Center , and Terminal A at Logan International Airport , tried to work with MIT , and attended mediation with the university , but was unable to resolve all issues .

BBC Central Asia correspondent
Uzbekistan ordered US forces out of the country in 2005
The diplomat said that a return by the armed forces to the Central Asian state was not on the agenda .
The US withdrew from Uzbekistan following a dispute over human rights in 2005 .
But recent media reports had suggested that Washington was negotiating a possible return .
Warming ties ?
The diplomat categorically denied reports that the US was in negotiations to open a new airbase in Uzbekistan .
The reports were triggered by an agreement between Washington and Tashkent which will give the Americans limited access to the German airbase in Termez near the border with Afghanistan .
Under the arrangement , a handful of mainly civilian advisers to Nato generals will be granted permission , on a case by case basis , to fly to Afghanistan via the Termez airbase .
It is a very small gesture which will have little impact on the Nato campaign in Afghanistan .
But it does show that the relationship between Uzbekistan and the West is beginning to change .
Tashkent cut nearly all ties with the West after the European Union imposed sanctions on Uzbekistan in response to the events in Andijan , where government troops killed hundreds of civilian protestors in 2005 .
The US was forced to shut its airbase , and hundreds of Western organisations and companies left Uzbekistan .
Three years on , observers say that Uzbekistan 's human rights record has deteriorated even further , but the West has clearly had a change of heart .
There is now a strong lobby within the EU which wants to lift the sanctions .
While most people in the West resent the idea of a dialogue with President Karimov , increasingly many policy - makers say that alienating Uzbekistan has only pushed this strategic , energy - rich country closer to China and Russia .
They also argue that engagement is the only thing that could ease the dire human rights situation .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. economy may be " grinding to a halt , " the Conference Board said Thursday , reporting that the index of leading economic indicators fell 0.3 % in February for a fifth - straight decline .
The coincident indicators -- the best overview of the current economy -- have been flat for three straight months , the private research group said .
Read the full report .
" Growth will be weak this spring , " said Ken Goldstein , labor economist for the Conference Board .
" A small contraction in economic activity cannot be ruled out . "
The leading indicators are designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead .
The last time the leading index fell for five straight months was in early 2001 , at the beginning of the last recession .
The index " has sunk to levels that are generally seen only during recessions or the period immediately preceding one , " wrote Tim Quinlan , an economist for Wachovia .
The coincident indicators are the same four indicators used by the business - cycle dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research to judge whether the economy is in a recession or is expanding .
See the latest story on the recession indicators .
Five of the 10 leading indicators fell in February : jobless claims , building permits , delivery times , consumer expectations , and stock prices .
Four indicators rose : Real money supply , interest rate spreads , orders for capital goods and orders for consumer goods .
The factory workweek was unchanged .
The Fed 's massive stimulus efforts boosted money supply and the yield curve , Quinlan noted .
" Help is on the way . "
Several of the indicators -- such as real money supply and the orders data -- are estimated because they have not yet been officially reported .
The January leading index was revised lower to a 0.4 % decline from a 0.1 % decline .
In a separate report Thursday , the Labor Department said initial jobless claims -- one of the 10 leading indicators -- rose to 378,000 last week , a sign of a weaker labor market .
See full story .
In another report , the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said sentiment among manufacturing firms in its region improved in March but remained at a very low level .
The Philly Fed index improved to negative 17.4 from negative 24 .
Negative readings show that more firms think business conditions are bad than think they are good .
See full story .
Over the past six months , the leading index was down 1.5 % , a slight improvement from the 2.3 % decline from July through January .
Just two of the 10 indicators are up in the past six months .
The coincident index was flat over the past six months , with two of the four coincident indicators rising .
The lagging index rose 0.2 % in February and is up 1.7 % in the past six months .
Watchdog requests FBI investigation of missing White House e-mails Nick Juliano

This CREW claims possible obstruction of justice from deleting Plame e-mails A watchdog group is asking the FBI to investigate whether any White House officials obstructed justice in deleting internal e-mails relating to the outing of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
The Justice Department ordered the Bush administration to preserve any records relating to the exposure of the covert agent 's identity , but e-mails are missing from the very day that order was delivered and other key points surrounding Plame 's outing .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a plaintiff in an ongoing lawsuit brought against the White House regarding the e-mails , on Wednesday requested that FBI Director Robert Mueller open an investigation .
" The unexplained disappearance of an entire weeks ' worth of emails from the OVP [ Office of the Vice President ] at a time when the Department of Justice was investigating the actions of top White House officials , including officials within the OVP , warrants the initiation of a criminal investigation to determine whether White House officials obstructed justice and violated other criminal statutes , " CREW 's cheif counsel Anne Weismann wrote in a letter to Mueller ( .pdf ) .
" Similarly , the disappearance of over 10 million White House email records also justifies an investigation into the facts surrounding the knowing failure of the White House to comply with federal record - keeping laws . "
The letter to Mueller comes after Attorney General Michael Mukasey dismissed a previous CREW request to appoint a special counsel to investigate the missing e-mails .
On Sept. 30 , 2003 , Alberto Gonzales , who was then White House counsel , sent a letter to White House staff alerting them that the Justice Department was opening a criminal investigation into the leak of Plame 's name .
Conservative columnist Robert Novak had outed the CIA operative in a July 2003 column .
E-mails from Vice President Dick Cheney 's office were never recovered for the week of Sept. 30 through Oct. 6 , and they apparently were not preserved on a backup tape created Oct. 21 , Weismann said .
CREW 's request is based on evidence that has emerged from its own investigations and since the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began investigating the missing e-mails .
" It does seem that now the evidentiary record is out there now , it 's more specific .
... Sometime between Sept. 30 and Oct. 21 [ the e-mails ] were deleted , they went missing , " Weismann said in an interview with RAW STORY Wednesday .
The request for an FBI investigation comes as CREW and the National Security Archive , another open - government watchdog , are in the midst of lawsuits against the White House Office of Administration and Executive Office of the President regarding the missing e-mails .
Also on Wednesday , the Archive requested that a federal judge order an emergency deposition of Theresa Payton , the Office of Administration 's chief information officer , to clear up contradictory testimony Payton gave to the court and during an Oversight Committee hearing .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) -
The plan to include European Union air traffic in the bloc ’s emission trading system could trigger a trade war as countries outside the EU would not want to join it in its current form , Finnair said .
The European Parliament voted on Tuesday to set a tighter limit on aviation ’s carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions than first proposed by the European Commission .
Tuesday ’s vote was the first reading on the bill that has drawn ire from the United States and other nations .
“ The worst part is that this will be difficult to sell to countries outside the EU .
They will see it is senseless in many ways .
There are all the ingredients for a trade war , ” Finnair Chief Executive Jukka Hienonen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference .
“ We can start this in Europe but the system needs to be such that we can sell it to others as well , ” Hienonen said , adding that EU airlines only represented half a percent of all CO2 emissions .
The plan must now go to EU governments for potential changes .
It must be approved by parliament and EU ministers before it can become law .
The proposal has changed considerably in the past two weeks , Hienonen said , and added he thinks it might change further .
He added Finnair does not know the cost of the proposed regulation .
“ It is very difficult to say what the price tag for this will be .
Some say emission rights in the coming years could cost 3 euros per tonne but others say it could be 50 euros per tonne , ” Hienonen said .

Security flaw affecting all previous libxml2 releases
Date : Fri , 11 Jan 2008 07:05:01 - 0500
Unfortunately , a security flaw was found ( originally by Brad Fitzpatrick from Google ) and affecting all previous releases of libxml2 when parsing XML .
Two specially crafted broken UTF - 8 sequences when occuring at the wrong place lead the parser to go into an infinite loop .
Very annoying , as this lead to a relatively easy Denial of Service attack , the good part being that this is very unlikely to happen just by error , and to protect the community we wo n't release the way to reproduce this .
But all users are strongly invited to upgrade their libxml2 versions to 2.6.31 [ 1 ] , or apply the patch [ 2 ] ( or a derivative for 2.5 or 2.4 branches ) to their version .
Most OS vendors shipping libxml2 should have updates by now or very soon , if needed check your update stream , it is referenced as CVE - 2007 - 6284 .

House Judiciary witness : Destroyed CIA tapes are ' ultimate cover - up ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

This DOJ representative is no -show at hearing
The CIA 's official explanation for destroying at least two videotapes depicting severe interrogation techniques " fails the straight - face test , " an expert witness told the House Judiciary Committee Thursday .
In a hearing focused on the Justice Department 's role in the tapes ' destruction and the legality of torture tactics , George Washington University Law School professor Stephen Saltzburg heavily rebuked CIA reasoning that the decision was made in part to protect the identify of interrogators .
" The rationale for destroying the tapes to protect the identity of the interrogators is almost as embarrassing as the destruction itself , " said Saltzburg , who is also general counsel for the National Institute of Military Justice .
He said that the tapes could easily have been modified to obscure the faces of those involved , and that regardless , the CIA keeps a written record of which officers interrogated detainees .
" And so the explanation for destruction fails the straight - face test , " he said .
" The only plausible explanation , I believe , is that the CIA wanted to assure that those tapes would never be seen by any judicial tribunal -- not even a military commission -- and they would never be seen by a committee of Congress . "
Continued Saltzburg , " With [ the CIA tapes ] gone , we have the ultimate cover - up .
The indisputable evidence no longer exists , and memories will undoubtedly differ about what happened . "
He also chided Congress for not choosing to rein in CIA practices .
" It 's vitally important for this Congress to recognize that it's part of the interrogation process , " he said .
" This Congress decided not to restrict the CIA , at least not explicitly .
And it decided not to confine the CIA to interrogation techniques that are contained in the Army Field Manual . "
A representative from the Justice Department was invited to testify before the committee , but was not present at the hearing .
Another hearing witness , former CIA general counsel and DOJ prosecutor John Radsan , was pressed by committee member Rep. Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) as to whether interrogators resorting to torture could be prosecuted criminally if a legal definition of the practice could be agreed upon .
" If the tapes clearly depict torture , " said Scott , " let 's kind of think who could be guilty of a criminal offense . "
Responded Radsan , " If we agree that the conduct on those tapes [ is torture ] , that person who did the conduct is guilty ... that 's for sure . "
He offered the same analysis for those authorizing torture .
In statements before witnesses were called , Democratic committee members also admonished the White House for its alleged role , as reported by the New York Times , in participating in discussions about the tapes with the CIA .
" It is important that we investigate these allegations carefully , " said Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , " because if true , we may be facing the possibility of a dangerous and criminal abuse of powers at the highest levels of our government . "
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee ( D - TX ) called on the US to take a moral stand on the issue of torture , and said the country should separate itself from other nations engaging in the practice .
" This government has to be based on truth and transparency , and it certainly must be based on security , the protection of America , " she said .
" But the United States does not make those practices of violating the law , violating the Constitution , violating the international convention on torture -- it must not make that the norm ... therefore we must not draw to the practices of foreign dictators , but we must stand alone as a beacon of light shining around the world to ensure the principles of freedom and equality and justice reign strong in this nation .

Kevin Youkilis inked a one - year contract worth $ 3 million to avoid arbitration today :
Youkilis had come in far from the number offered by the team .
He asked for $ 3.7 million , while the team offered $ 2.525 million .
Last season the Red Sox ended up renewing his contract at $ 424,500 .
Relievers Kyle Snyder and Javier Lopez were the other Sox players who were eligible for arbitration this off - season .
Lopez signed for $ 840,000 .
Snyder exchanged numbers with the Sox before signing a one - year contract for $ 835,000 .
Great signing .
I 'm sure Youkilis would have liked a long - term contract but at this point the Red Sox are n't ready to offer that .
Soon , though , I 'm sure .
Youkilis was still slotted in to be our first baseman in 2007 before this signing , but here 's how the lineup looks now :
C Jason Varitek
1B Kevin Youkilis
2B Dustin Pedroia
3B Mike Lowell
SS Julio Lugo
LF Manny Ramirez
CF Jacoby Ellsbury
RF JD Drew
DH David Ortiz BN Sean Casey
BN Alex Cora

In almost all respects , the two laureates were different : nationality , cultural background , occupations and preoccupations .
Yet they were allied by their curiosity about the other 's contributions , their pursuit of truth and their love of music .
The Tagore - Einstein dialogues are filled with insights into the creativity and the philosophy of the two men , as well as their interest in the arts .
Tagore was an incredibly prolific poet , playwright , novelist and essayist .
Their first conversation dealt with truth and the nature of reality , with Einstein wondering if truth and beauty existed independently of man .
'' If there would be no human beings any more , '' Einstein offered as a hypothesis , '' the Apollo of Belvedere would no longer be beautiful . ''
When Tagore objected to that premise , Einstein said that he agreed with it in terms of Beauty , but not Truth .
Tagore said that Truth was realized through man : '' If there be some Truth which has no sensuous or rational relation to the human mind , it will ever remain as nothing so long as we remain human beings . ''
To which Einstein responded , '' Then I am more religious than you are ! ''
They met again in Berlin the next month -- the second of four meetings between 1930 and 1931 .
The men were photographed together , both hirsute -- Einstein with his moustache , Tagore with his long white beard -- hands identically clasped and each staring into the camera .
In that conversation , the two talked about family , the German youth movement and the interplay of chance and predetermination .
That led to a discussion about the differences between Western and Indian classical music .
Tagore commented that in human affairs there is '' an element of elasticity -- some freedom within a small range which is for the expression of our personality . ''
He compared that freedom to Indian music , saying that it is not as rigidly fixed as Western music , and added that '' in India the measure of a singer 's freedom is in his own creative personality -- he can make permutations and combinations of notes according to the law of the melody prescribed , '' but he had to be guided by his artistic conscience .
Nicholas Negroponte , co-founder of both the MIT Media Lab and the non-profit One Laptop Per Child , delivered the last keynote speech of the American Academy for the Advancement of Sciences annual meeting tonight .
The talk focused on the groundbreaking work of the OLPC , which has managed to deliver thousands of $ 187 laptops to children in the developing world .
Negroponte ran through a list of the organization 's accomplishments , noting that they had half a million machines in their pipeline and that production had reached 110,000 units per month .
The big key to large - scale adoption remains price going forward , and the former WIRED Magazine contributor promised big price drops in the coming years .
" The target has been $ 100 …
And we 'll get there before the end of 2009 , " Negroponte said .
" ( The price ) will get down to $ 50 in 2011 . "
Negroponte , a long - time MIT professor , provided a warm and fuzzy last lecture to the largest gathering of scientists in the world , complete with pictures of hundreds of children with the iconic green OLPC
machine .
In return , he got a mostly standing ovation from the several hundred audience members .
The annual AAAS
conference is a mix of workshops and lectures that emphasize the boundaries between science and society .
This year , the theme was
" Science and Technology from A Global Perspective " with dozens of speeches and symposia dedicated to development , sustainability , and climate change .
Negroponte explained that the basic idea of the OLPC computer was to use
Moore 's
Law to cut the price of the machine , instead of continually adding new features the way that electronics manufacturers in developed countries do .
" If you make anything electronic today , you know that eighteen months from today , it will cost you half of what it does today , " he said .
" But if you make ( electronics ) , you have no interest in that product being half price in eighteen months . "
So , as we all know , electronics manufacturers fatten up cell phones with cameras and MP3 players , etc. Negroponte termed this problem , " a general obesity in the electronics industry . "
He went on to say , " Most laptops are like SUVs .
You 're using most of the energy to move the car , not the person . "
He concluded his speech with a brief overview of the rollout of the machines , noting that Peru , Uruguay and Nigeria would see the first big rollouts in the coming months .
Then , rather mysteriously , he said the following :
Over the next few weeks … there 'll be partnerships and changes with companies that can start rolling this out .
What becomes pretty clear pretty quickly , you need people to copy it and do it at a larger scale .
No matter what we do as OLPC or laptop.org , you 're not going to be able to do the whole world .
You want to be able to influence efficiently enough to have other people do it .
He did n't really note what " this " referred to and I 'm not familiar enough with Negropontese to parse what he was trying to say , but one suspects that he 's trying to turn his ultracheap laptop competitors , like Asus with their $ 399 eee , into allies .

From at least Bass
Ale 's red triangle -- advertised as " the first registered trademark " -- commodity brands have exerted a powerful hold over modern Western society .
Marketers and critics alike have assumed that branding began in the West with the Industrial Revolution .
But a pioneering new study in the February 2008 issue of Current Anthropology finds that attachment to brands far predates modern capitalism , and indeed modern Western society .
In " Prehistories of Commodity Branding , " author David Wengrow challenges the widespread assumption that branding did not become an important force in social and economic life until the Industrial Revolution .
Wengrow presents compelling evidence that labels on ancient containers , which have long been assumed to be simple identifiers , as well as practices surrounding the production and distribution of commodities , actually functioned as branding strategies .
Furthermore , these strategies have deep cultural origins and cognitive foundations , beginning in the civilizations of Egypt and Iraq thousands of years ago .
Branding became necessary when large - scale economies started mass - producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks , cosmetics and textiles .
Ancient societies not only imposed strict forms of quality control over these commodities , but as today they needed to convey value to the consumer .
Wengrow finds that commodities in any complex , large society needs to pass through a " nexus of authenticity . "
Through history , these have taken the form of " the bodies of the ancestral dead , the gods , heads of state , secular business gurus , media celebrities , or that core fetish of post - modernity , the body of the sovereign consumer citizen in the act of self - fashioning . "
Although capitalism and branding find in each other a perfect complement , they have distinct origins .
Wengrow shows that branding has for millennia filled a deep - seated need for us humans to find value in the goods that we consume .
Sure to be provocative , " Prehistories of Commodity Branding " is necessary reading for a wide range of people , from those interested in the workings of ancient societies to anyone who is interested in understanding how marketing has developed into a powerful force in our lives .
Journal reference : Wengrow , David " Prehistories of Commodity Branding " Current Anthropology 49:1 .
Some scientists have proposed compressing carbon dioxide and sticking it in underground caves as a way to cut down on greenhouse gases .
Joe David Jones wants to make baking soda out of it .
Jones , the founder and CEO of Skyonic , has come up with an industrial process called SkyMine that captures 90 percent of the carbon dioxide coming out of smoke stacks and mixes it with sodium hydroxide to make sodium bicarbonate , or baking soda .
The energy required for the reaction to turn the chemicals into baking soda comes from the waste heat from the factory .
" It is cleaner than food - grade ( baking soda ) , " he said .
The system also removes 97 percent of the heavy metals , as well as most of the sulfur and nitrogen compounds , Jones said .
Luminant , a utility formerly known as TXU , installed a pilot version of the system at its Big Brown Steam Electric Station in Fairfield , Texas , last year .
Skyonic , meanwhile , hopes to install a system that will consume the greenhouse gas output of a large -- 500 megawatts or so -- power plant around 2009 .
Skyonic is currently designing one of these large systems .
" It has been working pretty well .
It does present a potential solution to emissions , " said a representative for Luminant .
" But right now there is still a lot of work to be done . "
If the concept works on a grand scale , it could help change some of the pernicious economics and daunting engineering challenges surrounding carbon capture and sequestration .
Carbon capture likely will be required to curb global warming , according to many scientists and companies that are currently experimenting with ways to effectively bury or fix greenhouse gases as they come out of smokestacks .
Coal accounted for 26 percent of energy consumed in 2004 worldwide , according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency , and will grow to 28 percent by 2030 .
Coal also accounted for 39 percent of carbon dioxide in 2004 ( behind oil ) but is expected to pass oil for the No. 1 spot in 2010 .
What about replacing every incandescent bulb in America with compact fluorescents ?
The benefits are eradicated by the carbon dioxide emitted by two coal - fired plants over a year , according to Ed Mazria , founder of Architecture 2030 , a nonprofit that encourages builders , suppliers , and architects to move toward making carbon - neutral buildings by 2030 .
Unfortunately , a lot of the proposed solutions for sequestration involve large amounts of capital and risk .
If you bury carbon dioxide underground , it could always leak out .
Other ideas include pumping it into underground saline aquifers or porous rock formations .
Because it 's a solid , storing baking soda is simply easier , and it allows greenhouse gas emitters to store a lot of carbon in one place .
The stuff piles up : A 500 - megawatt power plant will produce approximately 338,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year .
Multiply that weight by 1.9 and you get the number of tons of baking soda that the plant will produce .
Still , it can be sold , stored in containers , used for landfill or buried in abandoned mines .
" If you can use the waste heat , it strikes me as a potentially feasible approach , " said Alex Farrell , an assistant professor in the energy and resources group at the University of California at Berkeley .
" I 'm not willing to throw any of the ideas out yet . "
Barack Obama faced potential damage to his campaign yesterday after television networks aired footage of sermons by the former pastor of Obama 's church likening the Democratic frontrunner to Jesus and declaring : " God damn America . "
In the sermons the Rev Jeremiah Wright , who presided over Obama 's marriage and provided the title of his book Audacity of Hope , condemned what he described as a systemic effort to keep black people in poverty .
The accusations of racism could prove embarrassing to Obama who has based his candidacy around a message of unity .
In his sermons Wright reportedly refers to the US as being under the influence of the Ku Klux Klan , and describes black Republicans as sellouts .
" The government gives them the drugs , builds bigger prisons , passes a three - strike law and then wants us to sing God Bless America .
No , no , no , God damn America , that 's in the Bible for killing innocent people , " he said in a 2003 sermon which was aired by ABC television .
" God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human .
God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme . "
Obama has been a member of the congregation of Wright 's Trinity United Church of Christ in the south side of Chicago for nearly 20 years .
The pastor 's sermons are available for sale at the church and both ABC and Fox News broadcast the addresses .
In January , Wright spoke from the pulpit in praise of Obama 's leadership , comparing his campaign to Jesus 's struggles under the Romans , according to Fox television .
" Barack knows what it means living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people , " Wright said .
" Hillary would never know that . "
He went on : " Hillary ai n't never been called a nigger .
Hillary has never had a people defined as a non-person . "
Wright also took issue with the idea that Bill Clinton was a friend to African - Americans .
" Hillary is married to Bill , and Bill has been good to us .
No he ain't .

Incremental lambda lifting
Incremental lambda lifting lifts the internal definitions of known local procedures to the next outer lambda expression .
For example , the internal definition of .loop_3 in
( ( lambda ( ) ( begin ( set ! reverse-map ( lambda ( .f_2 .l_2 ) ( define .loop_3 ( lambda ( .l_5 .x_5 ) ( if ( pair ? .l_5 ) ( .loop_3 ( cdr .l_5 ) ( cons ( .f_2 ( car .l_5 ) ) .x_5 ) ) .x_5 ) ) ) ( .loop_3 .l_2 '( ) ) ) ) ' reverse-map ) ) )
is lifted to the outer lambda expression in
(( lambda ( ) ( define .loop_3 ( lambda ( .f_2 .l_5 .x_5 ) ( if ( pair ? .l_5 ) ( .loop_3 .f_2 ( cdr .l_5 ) ( cons ( .f_2 ( car .l_5 ) ) .x_5 ) ) .x_5 ) ) ) ( begin ( set ! reverse-map ( lambda ( .f_2 .l_2 ) ( .loop_3 .f_2 .l_2 '( ) ) ) ) ' reverse-map ) ) )
Because .loop_3 is lifted out of the scope of .f_2 , which occurs free within the original code for .loop_3 , .f_2 must become an additional formal parameter to .loop_3 , and all calls to .loop_3 must be changed to pass this additional parameter .
Lambda lifting is one of the most complex optimizations performed by Twobit , mainly because of complications that arise with groups of mutually recursive known local procedures .
Consider
( ( lambda ( ) ( begin ( set ! foo ( lambda ( n x y ) ( define ( f n ) ( if ( zero ? n ) x ( g (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( define ( g n ) ( if ( zero ? n ) y ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( f n ) ) ) ' foo ) ) )
If f were lifted to the outer lambda expression , then it would have to take g and x as extra parameters .
That means g would have to supply g and x as extra arguments when it calls f :
( ( lambda ( ) ( define ( f g x n ) ( if ( zero ? n ) x ( g (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( begin ( set ! foo ( lambda ( n x y ) ( define ( g n ) ( if ( zero ? n ) y ( f g x (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( f g x n ) ) ) ' foo ) ) )
Notice that g now escapes its scope , negating the earlier closure analysis .
Worse yet , if g were lifted to the outer lambda expression , it would have to take an extra parameter y .
That means f would have to supply y as an extra argument when it calls g .
But f is now outside the scope of y !
Lifting g can therefore add extra arguments not only to g but to procedures that call it .
Adding extra arguments to those procedures may in turn involve adding extra arguments to procedures that call the procedures that call g , and so on .
Eventually this process of adding arguments will stabilize .
For this example the result is
( ( lambda ( ) ( define ( f g x y n ) ( if ( zero ? n ) x ( g x y (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( define ( g x y n ) ( if ( zero ? n ) y ( f g x y (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( begin ( set ! foo ( lambda ( n x y ) ( f g x y n ) ) ) ' foo ) ) )
This is suboptimal : f is back within the scope of g , so it is unnecessary to pass g to f .
The flow equation for incremental lambda lifting
The solution is to lift each group of known local procedures as a unit , after performing a flow analysis to determine precisely which parameters must be added to each procedure .
Let V be the set of parameters for the lambda expression at whose head a group of known local procedures is defined , let f1 , ... be the names of those procedures , and let FV ( fi ) be the variables that occur free in the code for fi .
The set of variables
Ai that need to be added as parameters to fi is defined by the recursive flow equation
Ai = ( FV ( fi ) intersect V ) union ( union { Aj | fi calls fj} )
Compare this with the flow equation for conventional lambda lifting :
Ai = FV ( fi ) union ( union { Aj | fi calls fj} )
The only difference between these flow equations is that , by intersecting with V , incremental lambda lifting limits the flow problem to the formal parameters of the lambda expression from which the known local procedures are being lifted .
Another way of looking at it is that conventional lambda lifting takes V to be the set of all variables that occur within the program .
Solving these flow equations takes O ( m^3 * n ^2 ) time , where m is the number of procedures being lifted and n is the number of variables in the base set V .
For incremental lambda lifting , m and n are usually quite small .
On the other hand , incremental lambda lifting requires O( m ) different flow problems to be solved .
Twobit currently represents sets of variables as lists , so it actually uses an O ( m^3 * n ^3 ) algorithm to solve these flow equations .
When compiling Twobit itself , Pass 2 spends about 6 % of its time solving flow equations .
This is less than 1 % of the total compilation time .
Experiments using an O ( m^3 * n ^2 ) algorithm on synthetic benchmarks have shown that incremental lambda lifting can be either faster or slower than conventional lambda lifting , depending on the structure of the program being compiled .
In short , compilation time is not a major issue for incremental lambda lifting .
When and how to lift
Incremental lambda lifting is flexible because the lifting process can be halted at an intermediate scope .
Heuristics are applied at each stage of lifting to determine whether further lifting is desirable .
Interprocedural register targeting is performed by reordering the formal parameters of known local procedures when they are lifted .
Incremental lambda lifting is performed at the very end of Pass 2 .

WASHINGTON , D.C. --
Five years ago , Congress killed an experimental Pentagon antiterrorism program meant to vacuum up electronic data about people in the U.S. to search for suspicious patterns .
Opponents called it too broad an intrusion on Americans ' privacy , even after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
But the data - sifting effort did n't disappear .
The National Security Agency , once confined to foreign surveillance , has been building essentially the same system .
The central role the NSA has come to occupy in domestic intelligence gathering has never been publicly disclosed .
But an inquiry reveals that its efforts have evolved to reach more broadly into data about people 's communications , travel and finances in the U.S. than the domestic surveillance programs brought to light since the 2001 terrorist attacks .
Congress now is hotly debating domestic spying powers under the main law governing U.S. surveillance aimed at foreign threats .
An expansion of those powers expired last month and awaits renewal , which could be voted on in the House of Representatives this week .
The biggest point of contention over the law , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , is whether telecommunications and other companies should be made immune from liability for assisting government surveillance .
Largely missing from the public discussion is the role of the highly secretive NSA in analyzing that data , collected through little - known arrangements that can blur the lines between domestic and foreign intelligence gathering .
Supporters say the NSA is serving as a key bulwark against foreign terrorists and that it would be reckless to constrain the agency 's mission .
The NSA says it is scrupulously following all applicable laws and that it keeps Congress fully informed of its activities .
According to current and former intelligence officials , the spy agency now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic emails and Internet searches as well as bank transfers , credit - card transactions , travel and telephone records .
The NSA receives this so - called " transactional " data from other agencies or private companies , and its sophisticated software programs analyze the various transactions for suspicious patterns .
Then they spit out leads to be explored by counterterrorism programs across the U.S. government , such as the NSA 's own Terrorist Surveillance Program , formed to intercept phone calls and emails between the U.S. and overseas without a judge 's approval when a link to al Qaeda is suspected .
The NSA 's enterprise involves a cluster of powerful intelligence - gathering programs , all of which sparked civil - liberties complaints when they came to light .
They include a Federal Bureau of Investigation program to track telecommunications data once known as Carnivore , now called the Digital Collection System , and a U.S. arrangement with the world 's main international banking clearinghouse to track money movements .
The effort also ties into data from an ad - hoc collection of so - called " black programs " whose existence is undisclosed , the current and former officials say .
Many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9/11 attacks but have since been given greater reach .
Among them , current and former intelligence officials say , is a longstanding Treasury Department program to collect individual financial data including wire transfers and credit - card transactions .
It is n't clear how many of the different kinds of data are combined and analyzed together in one database by the NSA .
An intelligence official said the agency 's work links to about a dozen antiterror programs in all .
A number of NSA employees have expressed concerns that the agency may be overstepping its authority by veering into domestic surveillance .
And the constitutional question of whether the government can examine such a large array of information without violating an individual 's reasonable expectation of privacy " has never really been resolved , " said Suzanne Spaulding , a national - security lawyer who has worked for both parties on Capitol Hill .
NSA officials say the agency 's own investigations remain focused only on foreign threats , but it 's increasingly difficult to distinguish between domestic and international communications in a digital era , so they need to sweep up more information .
The Fourth Amendment
In response to the Sept. 11 attacks , then NSA - chief Gen. Michael Hayden has said he used his authority to expand the NSA 's capabilities under a 1981 executive order governing the agency .
Another presidential order issued shortly after the attacks , the text of which is classified , opened the door for the NSA to incorporate more domestic data in its searches , one senior intelligence official said .
The NSA " strictly follows laws and regulations designed to preserve every American 's privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , " agency spokeswoman Judith Emmel said in a statement , referring to the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence , which oversees the NSA in conjunction with the Pentagon , added in a statement that intelligence agencies operate " within an extensive legal and policy framework " and inform Congress of their activities " as required by the law . "
It pointed out that the 9/11 Commission recommended in 2004 that intelligence agencies analyze " all relevant sources of information " and share their databases .
Two former officials familiar with the data - sifting efforts said they work by starting with some sort of lead , like a phone number or Internet address .
In partnership with the FBI , the systems then can track all domestic and foreign transactions of people associated with that item -- and then the people who associated with them , and so on , casting a gradually wider net .
An intelligence official described more of a rapid - response effect :
If a person suspected of terrorist connections is believed to be in a U.S. city -- for instance , Detroit , a community with a high concentration of Muslim Americans -- the government 's spy systems may be directed to collect and analyze all electronic communications into and out of the city .
The haul can include records of phone calls , email headers and destinations , data on financial transactions and records of Internet browsing .
The system also would collect information about other people , including those in the U.S. , who communicated with people in Detroit .
The information does n't generally include the contents of conversations or emails .
But it can give such transactional information as a cellphone 's location , whom a person is calling , and what Web sites he or she is visiting .
For an email , the data haul can include the identities of the sender and recipient and the subject line , but not the content of the message .
Intelligence agencies have used administrative subpoenas issued by the FBI -- which do n't need a judge 's signature -- to collect and analyze such data , current and former intelligence officials said .
If that data provided " reasonable suspicion " that a person , whether foreign or from the U.S. , was linked to al Qaeda , intelligence officers could eavesdrop under the NSA 's Terrorist Surveillance Program .
The White House wants to give companies that assist government surveillance immunity from lawsuits alleging an invasion of privacy , but Democrats in Congress have been blocking it .
The Terrorist Surveillance Program has spurred 38 lawsuits against companies .
Current and former intelligence officials say telecom companies ' concern comes chiefly because they are giving the government unlimited access to a copy of the flow of communications , through a network of switches at U.S. telecommunications hubs that duplicate all the data running through it .
It is n't clear whether the government or telecom companies control the switches , but companies process some of the data for the NSA , the current and former officials say .
On Friday , the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a letter warning colleagues to look more deeply into how telecommunications data are being accessed , citing an allegation by the head of a New York - based computer security firm that a wireless carrier that hired him was giving unfettered access to data to an entity called " Quantico Circuit . "
Quantico is a Marine base that houses the FBI Academy ; senior FBI official Anthony DiClemente said the bureau " does not have ' unfettered access ' to any communication provider 's network . "
The political debate over the telecom information comes as intelligence agencies seek to change traditional definitions of how to balance privacy rights against investigative needs .
Donald Kerr , the deputy director of national intelligence , told a conference of intelligence officials in October that the government needs new rules .
Since many people routinely post details of their lives on social - networking sites such as MySpace , he said , their identity should n't need the same protection as in the past .
Instead , only their " essential privacy , " or " what they would wish to protect about their lives and affairs , " should be veiled , he said , without providing examples .
Social - Network Analysis
The NSA uses its own high - powered version of social - network analysis to search for possible new patterns and links to terrorism .
The Pentagon 's experimental Total Information Awareness program , later renamed Terrorism Information Awareness , was an early research effort on the same concept , designed to bring together and analyze as much and as many varied kinds of data as possible .
Congress eliminated funding for the program in 2003 before it began operating .
But it permitted some of the research to continue and TIA technology to be used for foreign surveillance .
Some of it was shifted to the NSA -- which also is funded by the Pentagon -- and put in the so - called black budget , where it would receive less scrutiny and bolster other data - sifting efforts , current and former intelligence officials said .
" When it got taken apart , it did n't get thrown away , " says a former top government official familiar with the TIA program .
Two current officials also said the NSA 's current combination of programs now largely mirrors the former TIA project .
But the NSA offers less privacy protection .
TIA developers researched ways to limit the use of the system for broad searches of individuals ' data , such as requiring intelligence officers to get leads from other sources first .
The NSA effort lacks those controls , as well as controls that it developed in the 1990s for an earlier data - sweeping attempt .
Sen .
Ron Wyden , an Oregon Democrat and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who led the charge to kill TIA , says " the administration is trying to bring as much of the philosophy of operation Total Information Awareness as it can into the programs they 're using today . "
The issue has been overshadowed by the fight over telecoms ' immunity , he said .
" There 's not been as much discussion in the Congress as there ought to be . "
Opportunity for Debate
But Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri , the ranking Republican on the committee , said by email his committee colleagues have had " ample opportunity for debate " behind closed doors and that each intelligence program has specific legal authorization and oversight .
He cautioned against seeing a group of intelligence programs as " a mythical ' big brother ' program , " adding , " that 's not what is happening today . "
The legality of data - sweeping relies largely on the government 's interpretation of a 1979 Supreme Court ruling allowing records of phone calls -- but not actual conversations -- to be collected without a judge issuing a warrant .
Multiple laws require a court order for so - called " transactional ' " records of electronic communications , but the 2001 Patriot Act lowered the standard for such an order in some cases , and in others made records accessible using FBI administrative subpoenas called " national security letters . "
( Read the ruling .

A debate is brewing among legal and technology scholars over whether there should be privacy protections when a wide variety of transactional data are brought together to paint what is essentially a profile of an individual 's behavior .
" You know everything I 'm doing , you know what happened , and you have n't listened to any of the contents " of the communications , said Susan Landau , co-author of a book on electronic privacy and a senior engineer at Sun Microsystems Laboratories .
" Transactional information is remarkably revelatory . "
Ms. Spaulding , the national - security lawyer , said it's " extremely questionable " to assume Americans do n't have a reasonable expectation of privacy for data such as the subject - header of an email or a Web address from an Internet search , because those are more like the content of a communication than a phone number .
" These are questions that require discussion and debate , " she said .
" This is one of the problems with doing it all in secret . "
Gen .
Hayden , the former NSA chief and now Central Intelligence Agency director , in January 2006 publicly defended the activities of the Terrorist Surveillance Program after it was disclosed by the New York Times .
He said it was " not a driftnet over Lackawanna or Fremont or Dearborn , grabbing all communications and then sifting them out . "
Rather , he said , it was carefully targeted at terrorists .
However , some intelligence officials now say the broader NSA effort amounts to a driftnet .
A portion of the activity , the NSA 's access to domestic phone records , was disclosed by a USA Today article in 2006 .
The NSA , which President Truman created in 1952 through a classified presidential order to be America 's ears abroad , has for decades been the country 's largest and most secretive intelligence agency .
The order confined NSA spying to " foreign governments , " and during the Cold War the NSA developed a reputation as the world 's premier code - breaking operation .
But in the 1970s , the NSA and other intelligence agencies were found to be using their spy tools to monitor Americans for political purposes .
That led to the original FISA legislation in 1978 , which included an explicit ban on the NSA eavesdropping in the U.S. without a warrant .
Big advances in telecommunications and database technology led to unprecedented data - collection efforts in the 1990s .
One was the FBI 's Carnivore program , which raised fears when it was in disclosed in 2000 that it might collect telecommunications information about law - abiding individuals .
But the ground shifted after 9/11 .
Requests for analysis of any data that might hint at terrorist activity flooded from the White House and other agencies into NSA 's Fort Meade , Md. , headquarters outside Washington , D.C. , one former NSA official recalls .
At the time , " We 're scrambling , trying to find any piece of data we can to find the answers , " the official said .
The 2002 congressional inquiry into the 9/11 attacks criticized the NSA for holding back information , which NSA officials said they were doing to protect the privacy of U.S. citizens .
" NSA did not want to be perceived as targeting individuals in the United States " and considered such surveillance the FBI 's job , the inquiry concluded .
FBI - NSA Projects
The NSA quietly redefined its role .
Joint FBI - NSA projects " expanded exponentially , " said Jack Cloonan , a longtime FBI veteran who investigated al Qaeda .
He pointed to national - security letter requests :
They rose from 8,500 in 2000 to 47,000 in 2005 , according to a Justice Department inspector general 's report last year .
It also said the letters permitted the potentially illegal collection of thousands of records of people in the U.S. from 2003 - 05 .
Last Wednesday , FBI Director Robert Mueller said the bureau had found additional instances in 2006 .
It is n't known how many Americans ' data have been swept into the NSA 's systems .
The Treasury , for instance , built its database " to look at all the world 's financial transactions " and gave the NSA access to it about 15 years ago , said a former NSA official .
The data include domestic and international money flows between bank accounts and credit - card information , according to current and former intelligence officials .
The NSA receives from Treasury weekly batches of this data and adds it to a database at its headquarters .
Prior to 9/11 , the database was used to pursue specific leads , but afterward , the effort was expanded to hunt for suspicious patterns .
Through the Treasury , the NSA also can access the database of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , or Swift , the Belgium - based clearinghouse for records of international transactions between financial institutions , current and former officials said .
The U.S. acknowledged in 2006 that the CIA and Treasury had access to Swift 's database , but said the NSA 's Terrorism Surveillance Program was separate and that the NSA provided only " technical assistance . "
A Treasury spokesman said the agency had no comment .
Through the Department of Homeland Security , airline passenger data also are accessed and analyzed for suspicious patterns , such as five unrelated people who repeatedly fly together , current and former intelligence officials said .
Homeland Security shares information with other agencies only " on a limited basis , " spokesman Russ Knocke said .
NSA gets access to the flow of data from telecommunications switches through the FBI , according to current and former officials .
It also has a partnership with FBI 's Digital Collection system , providing access to Internet providers and other companies .
The existence of a shadow hub to copy information about AT&T Corp. telecommunications in San Francisco is alleged in a lawsuit against AT&T filed by the civil - liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation , based on documents provided by a former AT&T official .
In that lawsuit , a former technology adviser to the Federal Communications Commission says in a sworn declaration that there could be 15 to 20 such operations around the country .
Current and former intelligence officials confirmed a domestic network of hubs , but did n't know the number .
" As a matter of policy and law , we can not discuss matters that are classified , " said FBI spokesman John Miller .
The budget for the NSA 's data - sifting effort is classified , but one official estimated it surpasses $ 1 billion .
The FBI is requesting to nearly double the budget for the Digital Collection System in 2009 , compared with last year , requesting $ 42 million .
" Not only do demands for information continue to increase , but also the requirement to facilitate information sharing does , " says a budget justification document , noting an " expansion of electronic surveillance activity in frequency , sophistication , and linguistic needs . "

Report : Al Qaeda a tougher target for spies than the Kremlin Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday March 20 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Efforts to penetrate al Qaeda with undercover spies or convince the terror group 's members to turn on their organization has confounded intelligence agencies in the US and its allies , even 10 years after the group founded by Osama bin Laden declared war on America , the Washington Post reports Thursday .
Based on conversations with current and former intelligence officials from the US and Europe , the paper 's Craig Whitlock reports that clandestine efforts against al Qaeda have been largely ineffective and the group is proving " tougher to penetrate than the Kremlin during the Cold War . "
Alain Chouet , a former French spy , tells Whitlock that al Qaeda penetration takes years , and that its Western foes may have missed their chance to insert agents into the group 's upper reaches .
" I think you cannot penetrate such a movement now , " he said .
Ten years ago , on Feb. 23 , 1998 , Osama bin Laden issued a fatwa declaring it " the individual duty of every Muslim " to kill Americans and their allies around the world .
Looking back , some U.S. and European intelligence officials said their governments had underestimated the enemy and thought they could rely on old methods to destabilize al - Qaeda .
During the Cold War , for example , the CIA had enjoyed some success in recruiting KGB moles and persuading Soviet officials to defect .
The agency was also able to buy off Afghan warlords with suitcases of cash , persuading them to fight Soviet forces in the 1980s and to turn on the Taliban in 2001 .
A similar approach has worked , to a limited extent , against insurgents in Iraq :
An informant 's tip led directly to the death of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , leader of the group al - Qaeda in Iraq , in 2006 .
But al - Qaeda 's core organization in Pakistan and Afghanistan has so far proved impervious to damaging leaks .
Part of the problem is that the CIA and FBI had very few Arabic - speaking officers who could handle or recruit informants .
Instead of making it a priority to develop human sources , the agencies assumed they could rely on spy satellites and other high - tech tools .
Where the Cold War saw US spies largely working out of embassies abroad , mingling with local officials at cocktail parties and convincing them to hand over intelligence about the Soviet Union , the fight against al Qaeda does not conform to traditional international borders .
The nature of new al Qaeda recruits also creates a difficult environment in which to insert undercover agents -- rookie terrorists are commonly tapped to carry out suicide - bombing missions or kill someone .
" You ca n't let them do " that , a former British official tells Whitlock .
" You have an obligation to prevent it from happening . "
If an undercover agent tried to squirm out of such a mission , though , it would tip off higher - ups in a terror cell .
Furthermore , prior to 9/11 , the CIA was limited in its ability to recruit potential operatives or informants abroad because of 1995 guidelines that limited its ability to recruiting anyone suspected of human rights violations ( i.e. just about anyone who would be able to hand over useful information from inside a terrorist group ) .
Those guidelines , oft - derided within the CIA , were repealed in 2002 a year after Congress passed a law to push the CIA to do so .
The fluid nature of terrorist groups , and their constant need for new recruits , does give intelligence officials hope of one day infiltrating al Qaeda , Whitlock reports .
A Moroccan - born informant who infiltrated al Qaeda training camps while working with French intelligence , tells Whitlock that infiltration of a paid operative is difficult , but not impossible .
" Every moment of my existence was a test , every little answer , every little movement , " the informant , who wrote of his experience under the pseudonym Omar Nasiri , told Whitlock of his time in the camps .
" You had to show complete devotion to the cause .
If someone does all this to blend in , even if it is deception , the risk is that sooner or later he will believe it . "
Maybe you ’ve heard of Reverend Robert Tilton .
Or maybe you ’re normal .
He ’s the original farting preacher known for his … “ expressions of passion ” .
Years ago , an 80’s TV appearance of his was uploaded to the internet , only it was overdubbed with farting sound effects .
At just the right moments , sounds of flatulence kicked in , producing a clip that was not only hilarious , but just pure genius .
When the Reverend found out , he threatened a lawsuit and forced the uploader to take down his video .
But of course , by then it was too late .
The video was spread all over the internet as most internet phenomenons are .
The original clip spawned numerous off - chutes , some better than others ; and as a result , I ’ve compiled a list of the top 5 funniest farting preacher videos :
The Original Farting Preacher ( Heaven Only Knows )
Here it is , the clip that started it all .
The quality may not be up to par , but that ’s because this was ripped from a VHS tape circulating in 1985 .
Word on the street is that the the tape was titled “ Pastor Gas ” .
Miss Farting Preacher
As the saying goes , “ Behind every good man , there is a greater woman . ”
She really is “ Cute sassy and gassy ! ”
Honestly , I think she does it better .
Farting Preacher 2 : Fart Harder
Here we have the sequel to the original .
Judging from the quality , it was most likely done by the same people as Farting Preacher 1 and ripped around the same time .
A Screaming and Farting Preacher
As if farting was n’t enough , this man had to bring in random screams .
I find it hilarious when he gets a caller that does n’t seem to feel “ it ” , or whatever “ it ” is that makes him scream for no apparent reason .
Farting Preacher 5 ( The Most Popular )
If you ’ve ever seen a farting preacher video before , then it was most likely this one .
It was the last of the series to be removed off YouTube and therefore received the most views .
So the next time you ’re flipping channels and come across a preacher , just think of these clips and you ’ll have a little chuckle .
Oh , and do n’t forget to thank Jesus .
Can you say Amen ?
Romney spent $ 42.3 million of own money on losing bid
A campaign fundraising report shows Republican presidential dropout Mitt Romney lent himself $ 7 million last month .
That means Romney spent more than $ 42 million of his personal fortune on his failed campaign .
The former venture capitalist and Massachusetts governor finished January with nearly $ 9 million in the bank .
But more than $ 3 million of those funds must be returned to donors because they were earmarked for the general election .
The report was filed Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission .
Romney dropped out after Super Tuesday , and later endorsed Sen. John McCain .
The Arizona senator is now assured the nomination .
Overall , Romney spent $ 98 million since beginning his campaign a year ago , including $ 10 million in January .
" Before abandoning his bid to become president , Mitt Romney put in at least $ 42.3 million of his own money , a big chunk of the $ 97 million he spent on the campaign , " the Boston Globe reports .
" The former Massachusetts governor 's total self - financing puts him ahead of Steve Forbes , the publisher who spent $ 38 million on his unsuccessful run for the GOP nomination in 1996 , but shy of the $ 63.5 million that H. Ross Perot spent on his 1992 third - party presidential campaign . "
The Globe adds , " Romney 's total loan also equates to about $ 167,000 for each of the 253 delegates he won before suspending his campaign .
By suspending his bid , Romney , who made an estimated $ 250 million as a venture capitalist , can keep raising money to possibly pay himself back . "

( CNN ) --
A spokesman for Ron Paul 's presidential campaign said Friday that the Texas congressman is ending his run for the White House .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988 .
" We are acknowledging that Ron will not be the nominee and that we are winding down the campaign , " said Jesse Benton , the Paul campaign 's communication manager .
Paul hinted the end was near in a video to supporters posted on YouTube on Thursday .
" Though victory in the conventional political sense is not available in the presidential race , many victories have been achieved due to your hard work and enthusiasm , " Paul said in the video .
His comments came two days after Sen. John McCain became the presumptive GOP nominee .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , announced Tuesday he was quitting the race after McCain victories in Tuesday 's primaries , leaving Paul as his only opponent .
Benton said the campaign encourages supporters to continue to take part in primary process and that Paul would honor requests from supporters to speak .
" We still think we can influence the debate and build an organization moving forward that brings the GOP back to its roots , " Benton said .
Paul , who ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988 , is the sole Republican candidate to call for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq .
He is a distant fourth in the GOP delegate count , behind McCain , Huckabee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
" We must remember , elections are short - term efforts , " Paul said .
" Revolutions are long - term projects . "
Paul 's " Hope for America " campaign has been a grassroots effort , focusing on a " limited constitutional government , low taxes , free markets , and a return to sound monetary policies , " according to his Web site .
" But even with the past year 's achievements , we 're still the early stages of bringing about the changes that this revolution is all about . "

Imprisoned in a tank hundreds of miles from a mate , Ibolya the female shark resorted to desperate measures .
To the astonishment of her keepers , she spontaneously produced a perfectly healthy pup .
The virgin birth is making biologists think again about one of the oldest and - in evolutionary terms - most successful creatures .
Scroll down for more ...
" When I saw the baby shark lying on the bottom of the tank I thought it was a joke , " said Attilia Varga , the director of the Nyiregyahaza Centre in Hungary .
" I was amazed when I realised it was a real shark . "
Ibolya , a white - tipped reef shark , has been with the aquarium for seven years .
In that time , she has never shared water with a male .
The pup has been a hit with visitors - but has left keepers looking for a bigger tank .
They also plan to find a male so Ibolya can breed conventionally next time .
Virgin birth - parthenogenesis - happens when an egg begins to divide without being fertilised .
Common in insects , it is rare in vertebrates such as fish , birds and reptiles .

Scientists believe that sharks use it as an emergency survival mechanism .
Normally animals rely on genetic diversity - the interplay of genes from two parents - to evolve .
However , reproduction without sex is a useful stopgap .
Sharks are one of Nature 's great survivors , appearing in the oceans 400 million years ago - before the dinosaurs .
Normally their eggs are fertilised inside the female .
In the white tip and most other species , the female gives birth to live young .

Car Cameras To Track What Happens In and Around Your Vehicle
Dash cams , or car cameras , are popular for use all around the world and for vehicle owners of many types .
Fleet managers , professional drivers , transporters carrying important assets , and private citizens alike can benefit from the many uses of car cameras .
Vehicle cameras are useful for a number of applications , whether the vehicle owner is looking to monitor the actions of their employees who drive their vehicle or to monitor the activity around their car while it ’s parked on the street .
They help vehicle owners monitor the things that happen in and around their vehicle , capture footage that can be used as evidence in legal cases , and , in some cases , to monitor the whereabouts of the car itself , depending on the features of the chosen car camera .
This Hubble Space Telescope map shows the four clumps of dark matter in the supercluster Abell 901/902 .
A new mapreveals dense pools of invisible matter tipping the scales at 10 trillion timesthe mass of the sun and housing a cosmic city of ancient galaxies .
The map , presented last week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society inAustin , Texas , provides indirect evidence for so - called dark matter and howthis mysterious substance affects galaxy formation .
Scientiststheorize that dark matter , considered to make up about 85 percent of the universe ' smatter , acts as scaffolding on which galaxies mature .
Asthe universe evolves , the tug from dark matter 's gravitational field causesgalaxies to collide and swirl into superclusters .
It 's allthese gravitational effects , from something that can't be seen , that indicatesdark matter exists .
" Thedark matter halos are what allow the galaxies to form in the first place .
Thedark matter is the underlying skeleton of the universe , " said Meghan Grayof the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom , who was part of themap - making team .
" Most of the universe is dark matter .
Galaxies are justfroth on this ocean of dark matter . "
Uncoveringinvisible matter
Gray , Catherine Heymans of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver andcolleagues used NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope to observe a supercluster called Abell 901/902 , which resides 2.6 billion light - years from Earth and spans morethan 16 million light - years across .
Theastrophysicists measured light from a backdrop of more than 60,000 galaxiesafter it passed through the supercluster and its dark matter .
According to Einstein 's generalrelativity theory , the presence of matter can bend spacetime , deflecting thepath of a light ray passing through the mass .
" Darkmatter leaves a signature in distant galaxies " explained study co-authorLudovic Van Waerbeke of the University of British Columbia .
?
For example , acircular galaxy will become more distorted to resemble the shape of a banana ifits light passes near a dense region of dark matter .?
Byaveraging the shape - distortions from the thousands of galaxies , the researchersfound four pools of dark matter .
And the invisible clumps matched up with thelocation of hundreds of ancient galaxies , which have experienced a violenthistory in their passage from the outskirts of the supercluster into thecentral hubs .
" Ifthe supercluster was n? t there , you 'd still see all of these galaxies in thebackground , " Gray told SPACE.com .
" But you put this massiveobject [ in front of them ] and your view gets distorted .
It 's a cosmic opticalillusion . "
Aginggalaxies
Thesurvey 's broader goal is to understand how galaxies are influenced by theenvironment in which they live .
? The newmap of the underlying dark matter in the supercluster is one key piece of thispuzzle , ?
Gray said .
?
At the same time , we ?re looking in detail at the galaxiesthemselves .?
The galaxies in the central hubs , they are finding , show signs of aging , as they are elliptical , red in color and are no longerforming stars .
Disk galaxies reside on the outskirts of the supercluster .
Theseyouthful galaxies are blue - hued and buzzing with star birth .
It 's theseyoung galaxies that constantly fall into the supercluster , adding to itsgalactic girth .
" Asthey come in , either they 're interacting with each other more or they 'reinteracting with the dark matter , " Gray explained .
" Something ishappening to change their properties . "

ARABS AND MUSLIMS IN ISRAEL
The freest Arabs , Christians , Jews and Muslims in Mideast are Israelis
Even after the " Palestine Liberation Organization " got authority over 95 % of the Arab Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , the more than one million Arab Palestinians in Israel chose to continue to live under Israeli sovereignty in the Jewish state of Israel rather than choosing to live under the all - too - unfortunate oppression which is the lot of their Arab and Muslim brothers throughout the Middle East .
77 % of Israeli Arabs would even live nowhere else than in Israel .
Moreover , millions of Arab Palestinian imagined " refugees " desire to " return " living in Israel .
Arabs in Israel have equal rights under the law
Arabs in Israel can vote for whoever they want
Arabs in Israel can worship freely
Arabs in Israel are entitled to the full same state education as all other Israelis
Arabs are members of the Israeli parliament and ministers in the government
Israeli society gives more opportunity to Arabs than do Arab states to their own citizens .
Israeli Arabs and Muslims have the right to vote and to hold public office , like every other Israeli citizen .
Nearly one - 10th of the Knesset , Israel 's parliament , is Arab ; there is a mosque in the Knesset building for those who are Muslim .
One of the justices of Israel 's Supreme Court is an Arab Muslim ; so is a minister in the Israeli cabinet .
Arabs are active in Israeli commerce , media , education , and law .
For headstrong Arabs , bent on protest , Israel is in every respect a paradise compared with any other state in the Middle East .

A mosque in Rome ?
Sure .
A non-Muslim in Mecca ?
No. ( Jonathan V. Last , Wall Street Journal , Aug 29 , 2003 ) : " If you judge by the pictures , the Makkah Hilton is a nice place to stay .
There 's just one catch , as the Web site notes .
The five - star hotel 'is exclusively sited within the Holy City which , by national and religious law , is only accessible to visitors of the Muslim Religion . '
This law is something of a singularity among major religions , because it is n't merely the Grand Mosque that is off - limits to nonbelievers , the way , for instance , a Mormon Temple is .
It 's a city - - a major city with hotels , supermarkets , schools and a population of 1.2 million people .
( The city of Medina , population 700,000 , also forbids non-Muslims . ) ...
The ban sometimes creates logistical woes .
Companies that rely on skilled workers often resort to using auxiliary offices outside the city .
Ms. Mackey tells of the building of a hotel designed by a Western architect .
The Saudis refused to allow him into the city and , she writes , ' insisted that he stand on a hill outside of town and direct the work through a telescope .' ...
But even at the State Department , the ban rankles .
' Every religion needs to have its own freedom of assembly and be able to protect the integrity of its holy places , ' said one State Department expert .
' But it 's just absurd that it goes to these great lengths .
. . .
Even if you do n't care about lofty ideals like religious freedom or openness , we 're starting to see some real connections between religious intolerance and terrorism . '"

This is absolutely forbidden in Saudi Arabia . ' ....
One of the ( still ) untold stories , however , is the cooperation of U.S. and other Western companies in enforcing sexual apartheid in Saudi Arabia .
McDonald's , Pizza Hut , Starbucks , and other U.S. firms , for instance , maintain strictly segregated eating zones in their restaurants .
The men's sections are typically lavish , comfortable and up to Western standards , whereas the women's or families ' sections are often run-down , neglected and , in the case of Starbucks , have no seats .
Worse , these firms will bar entrance to Western women who show up without their husbands .
My wife and other [ U.S. government affiliated ] women were regularly forbidden entrance to the local McDonald 's unless there was a man with them . "

Compare : Palestinians in Lebanon ( Julie Peteet , World Refugee Survey 1997 ) : " Despite international law governing the treatment of refugees , the Lebanese state implemented laws to restrict Palestinians in a variety of ways .
In 1962 , legislation placed Palestinians on a par with foreigners so that their gaining employment required a work permit .
While Palestinians circumscribed this requirement for nearly two decades , the post -1982 period has witnessed its vigorous implementation .
For example , Decision no.
289/1 , issued by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on December 18 , 1982 , set out the categories of employment closed to foreigners , which range from banking to barbering .
The ministry also issued a circular detailing the arenas of work open to foreigners , with work permits , as : ' construction workers and workers in ancillary tasks , excluding electrical installations , sanitation facilities and glass mounting ; agricultural workmen ; tanning and leather workers ; excavation workers ; textile and carpet workmen ; smelters ; sanitation workers ; nannies , nurses ; servants and cooks ; car wash and ubrication workers . '
In other words , Palestinians are forbidden to work in all but the most menial of positions . "
The Legal Status of Palestinian Refugees and their Relation with the Lebanese State ( Nasri Saleh Hajjaj , Shaml , the Palestinian Diaspora and Refugee Center )
Palestinians are driven from homes by armed Iraqis ( Jack Fairweather , The Daily Telegraph , Jun 9 , 2003 ) : For all its golden words in support of the Palestinian cause , the [ Iraqi ] government refused to let them own their homes and restricted their employment to manual labour ...
While the Palestinian cause may stir the passions of Arabs across the Middle East , Palestinians themselves are often regarded with suspicion .
Palestinian militants were involved in civil wars in Jordan and Lebanon .
In 1991 , hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were evicted from Kuwait after the emirate was liberated from the Iraqis .
And in 1993 and 1994 , hundreds were evicted from Libya on the grounds that Yasser Arafat had supported Saddam .
Now it is the Palestinians in Baghdad who are the victims of the political upheaval . "
Palestinians Expelled by Libya Stranded ( Salma Shawa , Washington Report , Aug / Sep 1996 )
Who Cares about Palestinians ?
( Arab - American journalist Joseph Farah , Aug. 23 , 2001 ) : " Who really cares about the human rights of Palestinian Arabs ?
Syria , Iraq , Iran , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Jordan and other Muslim nations have warned Israel , in various ways and with different degrees of intensity , over the Jewish state 's alleged mistreatment of Palestinian Arabs .
There 's one major problem with these threats .
These nations have done far less for Arab Palestinians than Israel has . "
The Jews took no one 's land ( Arab - American journalist Joseph Farah , WND , Apr 23 , 2002 )
Kill a Jew for Allah .
The Mideast problem .
( John Derbyshire , NRO , Mar 22 , 2002 ) : " Look : Possibly there would be some abstract justice in closing down the settlements , I do n't know .
I do n't see it myself , I must admit .
Why should Jews not live among Arabs ?
Lots of Arabs live in Israel , and do very well there .
There are rich Israeli Arabs ; there are Israeli - Arab pop stars and comedians ; there are Israeli - Arab intellectuals , teachers , writers , businessmen , athletes .
Why , when the whole thing gets sorted out , should there not be Jews living in Arab territory — as there were for centuries past ?
What , exactly , is wrong with the settlements ?
I do n't see it . "

Also note how the media is portraying Clinton 's ' victory ' as an ' upset ' ; and just so someone might think I 'm an Obama supporter whining , no , I 'm a Kucinich / Gravel supporter on the Dem side and a Ron Paul supporter on the Repub side .

I love that these polls were sooo wrong .
I think polls have a place but not when it comes to elections .
I think they can be manipulated easily , in a number of ways for a variety of motives --- they can be wrong entirely --- they can give voters a ' whats the point ' outlook and discourage voter participation --- they may produce an indirect but still effective peer pressure scenario --- or --- create an unfair ' jump on the bandwagon ' effect for the weak - minded who just want to say they were on the side of the winner ( who , as it may be , is n't truly the winner , at all ) .
I think polling should be removed ( or somehow , fairly regulated ) as a pre-election tool ---
I see it as a medium that carries too much harmful potential and may unfairly influence elections .
But then , thats just what " I " think -----

The results tonight defy all logic and reason .
Not even the Clinton campaign was prepared for this .
Not even for one second did they give themselves in any scenario a chance to win .
They were expecting a 5 - 10 % loss .
Something is rotten in Denmark .

So much for Obama saying he would n't put up with stolen elections .
I do n't know why he conceded so fast until he knew at least knew what the percentage of undecideds were on Monday .
Dumb .
Dumb .
Dumb .
I do n't think Edwards would have conceded if he'd had such a big lead over Clinton going into the vote .
I wonder if the NH Union Leader tracked it beyond Sunday and into Monday ?
Does MSNBC 's Olbermann know that these machines were the same as the one Hurtsi hacked ?
He seems the most likely to look into it ( if they let him look into it ) .

that voters who made up their minds at the polls
split evenly between Obama and Clinton .
Thus ,
there is no explanation .
Other than Democrats , and not all , just Obama and Clinton Democrats , all lied to pollsters .
Republicans did not lie .

Thanks for bringing this to our attention .
I think it will be interesting to see if those precincts which tallied the vote by hand differed considerably and followed more of what the pre-election polls showed .
On the other hand , I 'd like you to take a look at these exit polls done by the company which all the media outlets use :
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21225995/
If you take the results from the male / female results ( the first set of data ) and then calculate the total vote the exit polls read : Obama 18.06 + 19.38 = 37.44 Clinton 12.9 + 26.79 = 39.69
Which I think you will agree looks a lot like the final vote count .
All of this does n't matter , though , as Obama and all of us are going to carry on the fight and win this .

Papau --- are you trying to imply that this whole discussion is only because the " wrong " person --- Clinton --- won tonight ?
I can answer that for you --- NO .
Pre-election polls can be wrong , but it's out of the ordinary for EVERYONE to be this surprised by it --- even the internal polling numbers in the Obama camp and the Clinton camp reflected an Obama win , on top of every single other pre-election poll out there .
It does n't add up .
And here we pay attention to ANYTHING that does n't add up , without favor or regard to whether they are left or right , dem or repub .
The raw exit poll data are never released ( and no longer leaked ) , so there is no way to compare .
The exit poll data is " weighted " and re-adjusted to more closely align with the results .
There is no rumor , no suggestion , no hint at this time of any nefarious activity , as Brad makes crystal clear in his article .
The past seven years , however , of hinky exit polls and " surprise " upset election results has made most of us here suspicious of easy answers , especially when the data does n't match .
We 're concerned strictly with accurate , honest elections , no matter who ends up winning in the end .

The answer is that we do n't use them for caucuses .
Some Republican caucuses may have , but the ones I heard about just used index cards .
( Yes , actual paper ballots , of a sort . )
Democrats do a body count ; it 's not a secret election , and there 's a lot of cajoling to steal support and to pick up proponents of candidates who do n't meet the 15 % viability threshold .
But enough of our arcane practices .
Brad , here 's the issue with the " chicanery " idea , as I see it : this was a primary , not an all - or - nothing election .
Even if it had gone according to the polls , the outcome would 've shifted maybe one delegate .

Consider , please , that perceived " momentum " weighs heavily in these things , and it 's been ages since a Dem who won in both Iowa and NH did n't get the Dem. nomination .
Consider also that there 's been at least one study that predicts that Hillary would be the easiest Dem for the top GOP candidates to beat .
If it should turn out ( and now we 're just asking questions , not yet answering them ) that there was any foul play in this election , it does n't necessarily mean it was done by or on behalf of Hillary Clinton 's campaign .

First , IF there were election fraud I do n't think Brad is suggesting that the Clinton 's had anything to do with it .
The corporations that control vote counting , however , may think she is the most corporate friendly of the Democrats .
Second , the importance of winning NH is momentum for the next primaries AND the influx of donations from the bandwagon effect .

Your last comments kind of change the equation since Obama 's numbers did n't change ( assume no switching ) .
The only LEGITIMATE explanation is that Clinton - ( not Obama , nor any other Dem or any Republican ) miraculously " found " thousands of unlikely voters ( unpolled ) to get to the polls and vote for her .
We are talking in the neighborhood of 20,000 ?
Obama was ahead by 8 plus her 2 pt win - 10 % of 200 k ( not sure final total ) .
Now , how the people were " found " is the question .

First off , as EmLev says above , THIS IS ONLY ABOUT ASKING THE QUESTIONS .
Whenever there is a surprise election result , we look into it .
That 's what we do here .
Wildly differing polls vs. results is a pertinent question to the readers of this site , because we are concerned with ACCURATE ELECTIONS and not the name of the person / party that wins .
Matt , published exit polling does not reflect the raw data from the voters ---
Mitofsky said in 2004 that they re-weight and re-adjust the exit polls to align with the results .
Papau , this is not about whomever it was you wanted to win .
Besides , Zogby was dead - on in his predictions for Obama to win in Iowa , but he was wildly off in NH --- that is just plain weird .
CharlieL , the Pew Research Center concluded that race does n't seem to be a factor anymore .
Like you say , it can't be completely discounted , tho .
DmcD , apparently I misunderstood what you were trying to say , too .
It seemed that you were advocating abolishing exit polls .
I would have to disagree with that , too , because that information can't be obtained anywhere else in any other way .
Not sure what you mean .

First , I do n't believe I ever said anything was " rigged " .
But I have asked about what 's gone on during the secret voting counting procedures in New Hampshire .
Now the vote counting in Iowa was fairly transparent on the Dem side .
But it 's completely opaque in the Diebold machine counted counties of New Hampshire .
Couple that with the inexplicable results ( unlike prior to Iowa with Obama , there was no known " Hillary surge " under way ) .

Early WaPo conventional wisdom : But [ Rahm Emanuel ] took heart in the energy that emerged for both candidates --- tens of thousands more voters came out to vote for a Democrat yesterday than voted for a Republican .
... he got that right .
And another one : Most polls accurately reflected the large bloc of likely Democratic voters yet to make up their minds or who said they were open to switching their support in the closing days .
On the network exit poll , nearly 4 in 10 said they made their final decision within the last three days ; 17 percent said they decided how to vote yesterday .
Among those making up their minds on the day of the primary , 40 percent supported Clinton , 37 percent Obama .
Clinton did even better among the half of the electorate who settled on their choice a month or more ago .
But the late polls missed on how votes divided by gender .
Pre-election polls from CNN - WMUR - University of New Hampshire and USA Today - Gallup showed Obama and Clinton about evenly splitting female voters and Obama winning men by a margin of 2 to 1 .
But Clinton won among women by 13 percentage points , exit polls showed , and she lost among men more narrowly than suggested , drawing 30 percent to Obama 's 42 percent .
Yesterday 's result is sure to fuel speculation --- thought finally retired by a strong showing in 2006 --- that polls are less accurate when an African American is in the race .
A more likely culprit is voter modeling , with pollsters perhaps over - counting the boost of enthusiasm among Obama supporters following his victory in Iowa .
Another possibility is that independents opted at the last minute to vote in the Republican primary , depriving Obama of votes .

Great story , Brad .
About Iowa -
We will have a more formal report on Iowa , but here 's what happened : The Democratic Party pulled a last - minute manuever which made it almost impossible to rig the thing without getting caught .
They put a new , open source - driven program out from which anyone in America could capture time - slices of every precinct in Iowa every 30 seconds .
On the web site , this was n't obvious , but John Howard posted a quiet little link on the Black Box Voting forums , which was apparently deducible by those with good technical skills , and simply by clicking this link every 30 seconds you got a statewide data dump of every precinct in Iowa .
And maybe it 's better than posting poll tapes and comparing with the result , because you can do the input vs output check from a telephone anywhere in the world .
Here 's how : Jerry Depew , a resident of Iowa , simply arranged for a friend to TELEPHONE him at the precinct .
He reported to his friend the result he saw right in front of him and , while he was still on the phone , his friend confirmed that the results at the precinct matched those published by the Iowa Democratic Party on the Internet .
As I say , darn hard to rig that because they counted in public and had those incredibly detailed time slices downloadable in real time by anyone in the world .
( The Iowa Republican caucus was another matter altogether .
They finally got around to posting their results yesterday , and the thing was as opaque as mud . )
New Hampshire , for the Democrats , was the exact opposite of Iowa .
They used one of the worst voting systems in America and then handed programming of every memory card in New Hampshire over to a private outfit run by John Silvestro .
First order of business needs to be examining the published precinct results and comparing the hand count locations to the optical scam locations .
The results web site does not make this easy .
You have to hover your mouse over each one of about 250 municipalities and then take a screen grab and then type it into a spreadsheet .
So far , no one I know has completed that task .
Here is the site with the municipality results :
http://www.politico.com/...imaries/nhmap-popup.html
Here is a comma delimited data file I created with the municipalities and whether they are hand counted or opscam :
http://www.bbvdocs.org/N...-08-votingsystems-NH.txt
I took the information from the NH Sec State site .
A few of the locations do not have the voting system specified ; if they have a low population , they are probably hand count .
Whoever gets the handcount vs opscam spreadsheet done gets two points .
The tools are in the two links above .

Had they lost big tonight , the media ( and naturally , the public along with them ) would have written them off .
Probably .
That said , none of that means that if there was chicanery here , that the Clinton campaign would necessarily have known anything about it , or even have been the ones behind it .
I say if , of course , because at this hour , there is no actual evidence of any foul play .
But certainly a lot of questions .
Given that Diebold and LHS Associates ran the election on hackable systems which use secret software , that only they have control over , there is certainly reason to be concerned .
There are paper ballots here .

And Brad , how is this little nugget of information from today 's NYT to be explained away ?
One line of attack that Mrs. Clinton has used on Mr. Obama did not appear to work here : that she was more electable in a general election .
The survey of voters leaving the polls found that 46 percent of respondents named Mr. Obama as the candidate most likely to defeat a Republican in November ; 36 percent said that of Mrs. Clinton .
So basically , voters agreed , by a wide margin of 10 % , that Obama is their best chance in November , and yet they voted for Clinton anyway .

Yes Rosa , the same thing happened in Iowa : most voters there considered Edwards the most electable - yet they voted with their hearts , for Obama .
Also - yes , the Iowa Demo Caucus is a public head count , no voting machines involved , therefore nearly impossible to rig .
Yes , the Clinton campaign 's own internal polling showed them losing , but the exit polls show an unexpectedly huge turnout of women , with them breaking for Hillary much more than in Iowa , where women favored Obama 35 - 30 .
That really could be enough to be the difference , guys , I hate to break it to you .

It 's been happening for decades in that state .
I hate to rear the race issue , but it could have been a factor of a few points in New Hampshire , something to keep an eye on in the upcoming primary states ( should n't be an issue in the Nevada caucus ) .
I work for CBS , and I 've looked at the exit polling data , and I do n't see anything that makes me suspicious .

Notice almost all candidate lost votes on the machines and Hillary and Romney got massive boosts ...

So Obama won by 38.7 % to 34.8 % for Clinton ( ~4 % spread ) when counting only the hand - counted votes – those that can actually be verified .
The spread is actually about a 7 % shift if you take the % of votes Clinton picked up in the machine counts ( + 4.9 % ) and the % of votes taken away from Obama ( - 2.3 % ) .
Maybe there could be a recount of all the ballots that were put thru the scanners .
Would n’t it be a hoot if that was done and Obama actually won !
Problem is , who would call for such a recount ?
Certainly if Obama did , it would look like sour grapes and why would Clinton ask ?
Very strange that when corruptible machines are involved , Obama looses but without the machines counting , he wins .
A lot more analysis needs to be done , but something smells pretty bad here .

yeah I think it makes sense to just accept the numbers since some corporate controlled exit polls say the same thing as the corporate controlled voter machines .
Because in the past 6 years , the people controlling the machines have realized they must also control the exit polls ( duh ) .
Even the hand counts ( after the election ) have issues due to unsecured methods of transport and storage .
It is becoming more and more obvious to the Citizens of this country that the machines themselves give a negative return on investment .
I mean a real negative return .
Kind of like using a depleated uranium drill bit for building a new swing set .
But the most interesting thing of the entire fraud is the hunreds of apologists floating around all the blogs .
I mod a few blogs and caught 30 of them just in the past 12 hours .
It was wild , they really pulled out all the stops .
Whispering nonsensical talking points like ... " well people in New Hampshire are stupid . " " people must have felt that Hillary was finally genuine " " it goes to show you the polls do not mean anything " " well America wants stability more than change , and New Hampshire always votes for the establishment " " maybe a few random acts of fraud happened , but no one can rig so many machines at once "
Anyway , I have seen them here too .
After visiting this site for 2 years , I feel 1,000 x more confident in Bev and Brad then the obvious apologists for an ever degrading system of non-democratically elected appointees .

We had a discussion a day or so ago on the O - mentum thread , where I said :
The jist of my position is that when we do n't know something we should not talk as if we do know that something .
Wafting in and out of presumption upon presumption to discuss the merits of candidates , their base , and extrapolating that to election results is confusion posing as coherent dialogue .
If we do n't know which elections were rigged sufficiently to throw them and therefore render them false , then we have no basis for a philosophical discussion of the merits of candidates in terms of why they won or lost !
Which means Amurkan politics is nothing more than a nightmare posing as a wonderful American dream .

An exmination of all the hand - count votes v. the machine votes will tell the tale .
I certainly do n't think any fraud at all came from Hillary or Bill Clinton .
On that score , I absolutely respect their integrity .
I think they felt genuinely hurt , dismayed , upset , scared , even a bit passe , when Obama showed a double - digit lead going into the vote .
I believe they were bracing themselves , preparing themselves for a battering and strategizing on which upcoming primaries would give her the best chance at succeeding and , at least , restore a bit of saving grace .
As far as any vote manipulation goes , I believe they 'd feel aghast at the thought of fraud and never would condone any chicanery whatsoever .
Be repelled by it .
Anyone at all could have rigged the vote .
It 's even Rovian .
Have Hillary win so they can pummel her later when she 's the candidate .
( Because in a head - to - head I think Edwards , even Richardson are electable over the GOP candidate in '08 .
Even Obama because of his charisma , because charisma and hope seem to be enough to satisfy the majority of people and he was ridng a wave . )
My best guess is that GOP operatives wanted to put the kibosh on the tidal wave Obama was riding because it would change the whole consequent equation .

Exit polls prior to these treasonous war criminals stealing elections were traditionally extremely accurate usually well within +- 1 % .
If the Reich wing nutbaggery machine wants Clinton to win so that the S-election would be closer in order to make it easier to steal then Clinton is the nominee .
Honestly though it really makes little to no difference whom steals what anymore as they are ALL crooked & corrupt plus the Congress is utterly worthless and clearly in the pocket of that top 2 % so not a damn thing is ever going to change until we change EVERYTHING .
Until we the people can collectively OUST every single last politician from BOTH parties in Congress and replace at least 1/3 of them with Green Party candidates and the rest with anybody but the incumbent then we have zero chance of changing the tide of fascist corruption in this country .

Sorry to burst your bubble , but according to the exit polling posted on CNN , the results were almost EXACTLY the same as the exit polls .
http://www.cnn.com/ELECT.../epolls/index.html#NHDEM
Extrapolating from the Male / Female exit polling you get the following : HRC Male 43 * .29 = 12.47
HRC Female 57 * .46 = 26.22
HRC Total 38.69 BHO Male 43 * .40 = 17.2
BHO Female 57 * .34 = 19.38
BHO Total 36.58
The actuals were HRC 39 % and BHO 37 % .
So the exit polls and the actuals match up .
[ The Exit Poll data you point to , has already been adjusted to match election results .
You DO know that that 's what they do , with exit data , right ?

The AccuVote system is a pain in the ass , but there is no likelihood that the change in voting patterns were due to hacking ... just good , smart politics .

# 82 They match because they matched them .
It is just that simple to fool some of the people .
They matched them in Ohio in 2004 too but to match up the final " corrected " exit pole had to require that over 52 million of the voters who voted for Bush in 2000 returned to vote again in 2004 .
That is a bit hard to believe because no more than 48 and a fraction million of the 50 million who voted for Bush in 2000 would still be alive in 2004 .
That is why I titled my analysis of the 2004 election linked here http://customer.wcta.net/roberty/return.htm
" The Return of the Silent Majority " .
According to the CNN " corrected " exit poll Bush won in 2004 based on the HUGE turnout of Bush supporters who very clearly had to leave the graveyards to get to the polls to cast their votes in 2004 .

This can be broadcast live so anyone interested can observe the count .
This allows anyone to do an unofficial recount in a speedy and cost efficient manner .
Cameras should also record all activety in the polling place and counting rooms .
Electronic results can still be hacked , but video will help make switching cards more difficult , and will help spot suspicious activity in the area of the machines .
A return to paper ballots , video security in the polling place , and the use of live video feeds and recorded counts will eliminate the majority of opportunities for counts to be altered or manipulated at local polling places .
" They " will claim it would be too expensive , but I 'd rather my tax money be spent this way than on unsecure voting computers that do n't allow every vote to be accounted for !!

If this chart is close to accurate : http://ronrox.com/paulstats.php?party=DEMOCRATS
Then this : I think we were so sure that a double - digit obama was assured that some people may have voted for McCain to help him out , with a nod to his effort here in 2000 when Bradley enthusiasts voted for him independently - - is nothing more than guesswork to rationalize something that does n't add up .
The vote totals did n't show independents flocking to the Republican primary .
They did show them voting for Obama .

I work in Concord , NH and just visited SoS office .
They are working very hard to finalize vote totals , and will post them on their websit this afternoon .
I also got a printout of the towns that used Hand Counted Paper Ballots .
FYI , the " Unknowns " in the C : \Documents and Settings\mschauer \Desktop \2008 New Hampshire State Primary Results - A Closer Look At The Count.htm site are virtually all machine counted .
Wentworth and Hart are HCPB , but they were only given 20 ballots each .
You need to keep in mind that the HCPB are used in the smaller towns , the max printed for a town was 2420 for Plymouth .
Larger towns all use machines .
This could easily explain the discrepancy between HCPB and Machine .
BTW , the only machine counter used was Diebold Accuvote .
Note on the Exit Polls : The MSNBC poll separated votes by 76 catagories !
I was not polled , but if faced with that long a poll I would have refused , especially given the way we have been barraged in the last week .
This weekend we averaged about 3 calls per hour .
It has gotten very tiresome .

" I 'm bothered by the Edwards result too .
Everything I read indicated that enthusiasm and numbers were high at his events .
How did he seemingly fail to get any bounce at all out of Iowa ? "
---------------
It looks like the pre-election polls and election results were goofy for both Iowa and NH .
In both cases another candidate was pushed up to make Edwards appear much lower .
In Iowa Obama got about a 7pt boost and Edwards appeared to be clearly tied with Clinton .
In NH Clinton got about a 9pt boost and Edwards was way way down , despite having a recent increase in national polling of about 9pts .
I 'd say they do n't favor Obama or Clinton so much as they really really do n't like Edwards .
However , if Edwards has the money to continue then it will be harder for them to boost South Carolina .
It went for Edwards by 15 % in 2004 and now neither Obama nor Clinton can claim sole ownership of the lead .
Two other things : first , the early states have so much emotion behind them that there 's always going to be a boost to one 's support if you win early .
Obama 's boost is now burst and Clinton has the appearance of some momentum ; second , once you get past the early states where cheating is more likely , then it might become more fair for everyone except that a candidate with less money is very unfairly hindered .
What kind of election system do they use in SC ?
Will Edwards receive a ' favorite son ' advantage as Obama had in Illinois and Clinton got in NH ?
Will it be fair ?
Time will tell .
But , the race is definitely still on !

... Iowa Precinct Caucus Chair said on 1/9/2008 @ 10:13 am PT ...
Iowa is much easier to explain in that people had to show up and caucus at a precise time and it took at least an hour or more .
The pollsters have always had a hard time being precise w/ Iowa because of all the unknown factors .
N.H. pre-election polls were spot on for everyone but Obama and Clinton .
It makes no sense .
The rest of the country can say what they want about Iowa , but it 's hard to mess up the counts of warm bodies and at least it can't be hacked w/ a click of the mouse .
For a successful hack to take place it would have to be done with as few people as possible .
In N.H. , with all the Diebold machines , that is VERY possible .
For a hack to take place at the Iowa Caucus would take a huge conspiracy and a massive effort to skew the results right underneath the noses of everyone involved .
I made sure a captain from each viable preference group was looking over my shoulder when I called in the results at my precinct .
It was open , no monkey business .
I can't say the same thing about N.H. I would really like to know ... for all those who raised red flags on Ohio ' 04 , the long lines , the misinformation , the fact that it took the freakin ' Green Party to contest the results ... I gotta know , why is the primary illogic in N.H. any different ?
It looks like monkey business is afoot .
The numbers do n't jive and it takes a real leap of faith to manufacture a reason as to why 24 hours made such a huge difference in N.H. for Clinton .
Even she was planning for a loss .
The papers ' headlines were practically already written .
Ah , but CNN would n't talk about their exit polls until after the polling sites were closed .
Gee , I wonder if the ' 04 exit polls showing Kerry ahead at 4 p.m. EST had anything to do w/ that ???
Ca n't let the exit polls differ from the hacked results from the Diebold machines can we ?
Gotta give some time for CNN to tweek the numbers so they explain the hacked results .
To hell w/ their exit polls .
They only say what they need them to say .
I hope the legions of Obama supporters who know point blank that their candidate won in their precinct raise some questions and demand answers .
This looks like it could have been really hardcore blatant .
If so , it needs to be exposed , I do n't care who the candidate is .

Has it only been the last eight years that polls have been so wildly off ?
Did problems with polls begin in the eighties ?
Is there a correlation between the advent of increased computer counting and polls not matching outcomes ?
As for Obama asking for a recount in New Hampshire , his hands are tied because we have n’t yet gotten to the point where his opponents and the media wo n’t call that rotten apples .
Oprah has the money to do it but the apple card is still viable .
You ’d need New Hampshire democrats to call for a recount and that probably wo n’t happen .
Depending on New Hampshire laws , someone outside the system could ask for it but laws have a tendency to hamper recounts .
Were the ballots kept safe or are there chain - of - custody issues ?
The bigger fly in the ointment is why a seasoned politician like Hillary would resort to the tears thing .
That ’s a huge strategic blunder down the road if she becomes the Democratic candidate .
One potential page out of the playbook : Hillary is the Democratic candidate for President .
She could face any of the GOP nominees but let ’s say John McCain .
Hillary will get drowned in those tears , especially by a candidate that survived being a POW .
That ’s a marketing dream come true for her opposition .
Notice the Tonkin Gulf - like incident just as this primary was happening ?
I would not assume that the “ have to be fearful ” card is n’t played for other purposes than just to buoy the current administration .
If Bush / Cheney get us into a war or the potential is escalated , gosh , the country just could n’t have someone breaking into tears when the going gets tough .
Why would voters support someone who could n’t beat the GOP , according to other polls ?
That ought to be the kiss of death for Hillary , why is n’t it ?
Why would women vote for a woman who cries ?
Give me a break - that plays right into the hands of a “ woman ca n’t be tough enough for the job of President . ”
I agree with Brad that it may not have anything to do with the Clinton campaign - except that IMHO , the tear thing plays right into the hands of the opposition down the road quite conveniently .
Either Clinton knows that or she ’s not as bright as people think .
That bothers me and I hope we do n’t see more polls going one way and results another because I ’ve got a bad feeling about this .
Shades of Kerry “ coming out of nowhere ” , running a lackluster campaign for President , and refusing to fight for an accurate vote count .
That ’s one replay I could do without .
Why wait until a presidential election to subvert the people ’s choice ?
Stack the deck now , it ’s much safer .
Clinton has played the inevitability card , experience card , 35 years of non-change but she calls it change card , and now the tears card .
She 's running out of cards and that last card played right into the opposition 's hand .

Someone said he was " impartial " , great !
then prove it by making sure your screwy machines were n't miscalibrated or , worse , hacked .
And , Brad , you should contact NPR and see if they want to have a - serious - discussion about these machines ..
i.e. Joy Cardine here in Wisconsin had that guy from the Times ?
( wrote an article about " can we count on these machines " ) and the general statement to the Wisconsin public was " optical scanners are ok , they are n't hackable like the touch screens " ..
I about puked on my steering wheel ..
Had I not been in my car , I 'd have called in and corrected them , but I did n't have that option ..

It 's not just the difference in the hand count and machine count that is troubling .
For instance McCain beat Romney soundly in the hand count ( 15 % ) but by just a couple points on machines .
The hand counts are in rural areas , small towns .
I can see them really going for McCain and Romney would be more appealing to city republicans ( if he was appealing to anyone ) But Obama ?
Since when would rural and small town voters like a young , black upstart candidate so much more than urban voters would ?
He would do much better in large towns and cities than the rural areas so we do n't get a realistic sense of the margin just by assuming he'd do at least equally well with machine counts .
This is just so wrong .

He won despite trailing in most state and national polls .
He won despite an approval rating of less than 50 % , usually the death knell for an incumbent presidential candidate .
He won despite trailing in the three National Exit Polls three timelines from 4 pm to 12:22 am ( 13047 respondents ) by a steady 48 % - 51 % , miraculously winning the final exit poll ( with only 613 additional respondents , totaling 13,660 ) .
This poll was “ weighted ” ( altered ) to meet the reported election result on the assumption that the reported result was accurate --- quite an assumption .
The final poll showed a stunning reversal of the Kerry 51 % - 48 % poll margin , which had been measured consistently all day by the same polling group : major news / networks and polling firm Edison - Mitofsky . "

Put on your tinfoil hats .
Let me take you through a conspiratorial explanation of what New Hampshire means .
There is a permanent government , pro-corporate .
It controls the government and wants to keep on controlling it .
It uses the FBI , CIA , NSA , etc. , on one level , and it owns most of the media and has commenters and talking heads on their leashes .
They 've got a problem .
Their current President is so disliked that there is a chance to see a really progressive Congress ( comparatively ) get elected as well as a Democratic President .
What to do ?
Even though there is n't all that much difference between Obama and Clinton , she is their horse in the Democratic race .
Solution : Create divisions within the Democrats .
With the New Hampshire upset a narrative is created that exposes man v. woman and black v. white friction .
The Right already hates blacks and wants to keep women down .
Why not create a situation that gets the Left to do it to themselves ?
A tell or two ?
The New York Times prints a laughable op - ed by Gloria Steinem , " Women Can't Be Frontrunners , " when Hillary has been a frontrunner for all but four days of the campaign .
To understand you just have to know Steinem 's employment history .
Everyone in the MSM announces the end of Hillary 's campaign , the better to be impressed and amazed when she pulls this one out ( with the help of Diebold ) .
There 's the " Iron My Shirt Bitch " poster , as subtle as Lee Harvey Oswald handing out Fair Play For Cuba pamphlets .
All these reasons " explain " why women forget issues and political positions and " rush to defend another girl . "
The fix is good because it keeps the fight going .
Forget turning Demo guns on the Republicans .
They 'll have to shoot each other all the way to the convention .
And the fight ?
An orchestrated battle to divide the progressive movements within the Left.
Expect Tammy Bruce and the like to be getting lots of publicity really soon .
Maybe a dead female staffer working for Obama or Edwards will pull in Nancy Grace .
Around August or September when you think that the Dems have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory you will have been forewarned .

" However [ political parties ] may now and then answer popular ends , they are likely in the course of time and things , to become potent engines , by which cunning , ambitious , and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government , destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion . "
Women should be included in this quote .

You are right to be suspicious of election results that differ wildly from all the polls , but remember that there was a highly dynamic and changeable situation in the five days between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary .
The brutal , and in my estimation unfair attacks on Clinton ( and I am an Edwards supporter who does not particularly like her ) , may well have led to a last - minute backlash on her behalf .
Ditto for the effect of Obama 's snide comment to Clinton during the last debate that " you 're nice enough . "
Also , many of the previous responders are correct as to the possible effects of racism .
The possible impact of closet racism should never , never be discounted in evaluating U.S. election results when an African - American is on the ticket .
This is true regardless of how purportedly open - minded and liberal the jurisdiction is .

( Sorry , I 've had trouble getting this post to work )
According to the MSNBC Exit polls Clinton did much better than Obama in the under $ 50 K income group .
This generalization would still be valid if the numbers were changed to reflect the results .

The less than $ 50 K group , in general are going to be in the more populated areas in NH , which are all machine counted .
Hand counts were only done in small towns , which , in general , do not have a lot of services for the poor .
This is a possible explaination for the difference between the hand - counted towns , and the machine counted towns .
When the SoS posts the final numbers I will try to compare similar towns and get a better comparison of hand vs machine count .

Research shows the voting very close between Obama / Clinton in NH .
Most the towns are very close whether Diebold or paper ballot .
Three big cities , all Diebold show major differences .
Ranging from 40 - 80 % favoring Clinton are Manchester , Nashua , and Salem , the three biggest cities in NH .

I did do a diary but I make no claims to be a expert first off .
I am 26 and the only election I have voted in was John Kerry .
I do believe in fair elections .
I am leaning more towards Edwards or Obama , but I would vote for Clinton if she won .
I do not think Clinton personally would have done something like this , but the establishment in order to keep making money .
The tv networks know they make a big amount of money out of the election cycle commericals .
Plus news network do not want the election part to in otherwise it wo n't boost ratings .
That is the establishment I speak of .
BTW , I 'm not the best diariest or best person on stuff .

Is that all his opposition can come up with ?
I can do the same with Hillary ... let 's see , I 'll just call her a lying traitor lesbian , and a friend of mine said she called a black man a * igger once .
The secret service can't stand her ( they seem to like Bill just fine ) but I am actually stating facts here , are n't I ?
They really are .
These things said about Paul are completely untrue .
Paul is the only one that understands foreign policy needs to change dramatically as well as our economy .
The point Paul makes is that our economy and our currency is headed straight for the shitter .
IS HE WRONG ?
You think another trillion dollar " social initiative " program like health care will do us any better if we keep fighting these illegal wars ?
Where ' ya gonna get the money for that Hillary ?
From China of course .
Bring our troops back home where they belong , stop dumping depleted uranium all over the world , killing innocent children ( yes folks that 's what we do ) , then we can work on socialism .

The difference between the handcount districts and the machine count districts is significant , as is the difference between the polls and the results .
Partly because it creates an atmosphere of suspicion that undermines the legitimacy of the process .
In order to create confidence in the voting a 10 - 20 % handcount of all machine - count precincts needs to be conducted .
It can do no harm , and will increase confidence if the handcount matches the machine count .
If not , a full handcount needs to be conducted of all ballots .
Members of the election integrity community need to focus now on a calm but firm call for this to take place .
Contact the Secretary of State in New Hampshire , and write letters to the editor of your paper .

So we have one documented case of a township in NH claiming Ron Paul got 0 votes while in fact he got 31 .
The Town Clerk there admitted as much to Bev Harris this morning , blamed it on a human error and now the tallies in Sutton , NH have been changed to reflect the 31 votes .
http://prisonplanet.com/...8/010908_not_counted.htm
There were numerous other townships where Paul got very few votes compared to his polling numbers .
I believe Dr. Paul is going to be forced to pay for a recount .
If he does n't , I predict his campaign will be finished .
If he is n't willing to fight for democracy now , people have a right to know why .
A caller from Iowa who said he doublechecked the numbers in a precinct there also mentioned that the final numbers did n't add up from what he counted , swinging wildly in favor of Mike Huckster and seeing Dr. Paul 's vote total drop by about 40 % .
That information should be forthcoming soon as well .
They are setting us up for a stolen primary process where Hillary is already the heir apparent .
It looks like Obama was really screwed out of votes in NH , and it is strange that he conceeded so early .
( Remember John Kerry and Ohio ? )
This is not real choice but instead the illusion of choice in order to keep us quiet .
This should not be tolarated unless you enjoy living in a police state .
Wake up people before it is too late .
This is n't in anyone 's best interest , no matter who took what last night .

Hey folks , Remember that e-voting and e-counting is not bad ONLY because it can be hacked .
Programming errors and equipment errors can very easily skew results .
It 's natural to assume foul - play in situations like this , but we 've got to condition ourselves , and the media and general public , to realise that these junky machines can screw up all by themselves ....

Also ,
The problems with electronic voting and counting is only part of the problem .
It 's way down the line of problems .
The first problem is that we have a criminal corporate cabal incharge of the administration , the courts and the congress .
they also control the media .
We are living in a fascist state right now where any one of you can be taken off the street and sent to a torture camp right now , with no recourse to any help whatsoever .
That none of the top candidates have addressed the probelms sith the PATRIOT act is clue enough for any critical thinking citizen .

Brad ,
If you have n't already done so , you might consider contacting John Zogby about this .
I read his statement just a moment ago on his thoughts of what happened in NH , and there is *** not one word *** ( as per usual from John Zogby ) about the voting system (s ) used in NH .
Here 's the link to his statement :
http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1419
His poll turned out to be " wrong " in 2004 as well when he showed Kerry / Edwards winning .
Again , at that time , he did not mention a word about easily - hackable electronic voting machines after the fact .
From all that I 've seen from Zogby , he absolutely refuses to talk about e-voting systems and from what I 've seen from him he even refuses to consider the fact that there are " problems " with Diebold , in particular .
I 've lost a lot of respect for him because of this --- what appears to be --- denial on his part .
Zogby likes to pretend that we have a legitimate , honest and fair voting system here in the States where all the votes are counted accurately and honestly .
That 's the impression / message I 've gotten from him repeatedly .
And because of that , the man frustrates me to no end because of all the credible information available about e-voting , how can any intelligent pollster not even consider the easily - hackable e-voting system the public cast their vote on ?
And then the pollster ( Zogby in this case ) wonders why his poll was wrong ?!
Duh .
I suspect that the reason Zogby seemingly chooses to remain in denial about e-voting is because he does n't want to be labeled a " loony conspiracy theorist " by those who work in the bush state media for whom he works , and have his reputation tarnished or ruined .

Not saying it is or is n't .
But just who is fixing ( if there is fixing ) does n't necessarily have to be the candidates or their campaigns .
Create a scenario where , say the company who owns the Diebolds is approached by someone who claims to be in the Clinton campaign who goes and asks " How much for ten thousand votes ? "
And what about the suspicious bumps for Mitt ?
Would said company owner have one line for Demo bids and one line for Repub bids ?
The dynamics of fixing primaries goes beyond just party v. party dirty tricks .

Brad , A couple points : First , as stated by others , you are off in the weeds characterizing Daily Kos as favoring Clinton .
From time to time they have run reader polls , and Edwards has always been way out in front , with Obama somewhat behind and Clinton far back .
In fact I am not sure if she was doing as well as Kucinich among the Kos community .

BBC News , Srinagar
The half widows hold protest rallies every month
" Every day I wake up in the morning , I think he might be at the door .
In the evening while I lay the table for dinner , my eyes are fixed at the door in the hope that he may just come in , " says Zainab , whose husband went missing 10 years ago .
Zainab 's husband was allegedly arrested by soldiers fighting separatist militants in Indian - administered Kashmir in a conflict notorious for its human rights abuses .
There has been no information about him since then .
Zainab is someone that people in Kashmir refer to as a " half - widow " .
A prominent human rights organisation , the Coalition of Civil Society , says there are between 1,500 and 2000 half - widows in the state .
Most have given up hope that their men will ever return .
Yet hardly any are ready to marry again .
' Worse than a widow '
Shabnam was married to a lorry driver , Abdul Rashid , for 12 years when he disappeared in 1997 .
Shabnam has spent ' a fortune ' trying to find her husband
" My parents insisted that I should re-marry .
But I thought of my children .
I am both mother and father to them .
I cannot desert them , " she says .
Shabnam breaks down while talking about her husband .
" I miss Rashid so often and miss him so badly .
My heart bleeds for him .
He was such a good man .
I cannot find another Rashid , " she says .
" Had it not been for my children , I could n't have lived . "
Rafiqa , whose husband disappeared 13 years ago , says a half - widow is worse than a widow .
" If I knew for sure that my husband was dead , I would give up on him .
But , we have been kept in the dark .
We think he might still be alive .
The uncertainty is so agonising - for me , for the children , for everyone . "
The half - widows are worse off for one more reason .
They have to spend a " fortune " to search for their missing husbands .
Duped
" We visited every detention centre across the state .
We had to spend a huge sum of money .
We sold our house and several household articles .
But all in vain , " says Shabnam .
Many such women have been defrauded of their money by rogues .
" Many people came to me saying they had seen my husband .
I paid them a lot of money to buy his freedom .
I could have set aside the money for my children .
First I lost my husband and then my money too , " says Rafiqa .
Some half - widows have been supported by their parents , in - laws or other close relatives .
Thousands of civilians have disappeared in Kashmir since 1991
But in most cases the relatives themselves are too poor to do much for them .
Safia , who lives in Rajbagh in Srinagar , says : " My only brother is a meagrely paid salesman .
What can he do for me ?
Both my parents are ill .
Everyone from my husband 's family has been caring , but they have their own families to look after . "
Safia had to give up her teaching job for health reasons .
She has now set up a stationery shop to make a living .
The president of the Coalition of Civil Society , Pervez Imroz , says 85 % of the half - widows are poor as most of the disappeared men were from the weaker sections of society .
Traumatised
" It is the backward communities that are most vulnerable to human rights violations because they are voiceless , powerless , " he says .
Mr Imroz says a recent survey by his group in Baramullah district indicates that more than 60 % of the disappeared persons were civilians ; only the remaining were militants or those connected to them .
Mr Imroz says the half - widows and their children also suffer from post traumatic distress syndrome ( PTDS ) .
" They need counselling but none is available to them , " he says .
Many of the half - widows have been campaigning under the banner of the APDP ( Association of the Parents of Disappeared Persons ) .
They hold protest rallies and demonstrations at least once every month .
They have also filed petitions in the state high court which , given the slow pace of the Indian judiciary , makes justice a distant dream .
They have been demanding that the government declare their missing husbands dead if they are not alive .
Theoretically , the government has to pay 100,000 rupees ( $ 2,500 ) and provide job to one family member as compensation to the kin of any civilian killed by militants or the security forces .
But the family of a missing person has to wait for five years before they can apply for such benefits .
The APDP says fewer than 400 half - widows have received the relief .
The authorities put the number of missing people at 3,931 but APDP says 8,000 to 10,000 people , mostly civilians , have disappeared since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Kashmir 19 years ago .
QUEBEC CITY , Quebec ( Reuters ) - Although Canada is one of the snowiest countries in the world , a series of violent “ snow rage ” incidents reveal that even the locals have their limits .

Although Canada is one of the snowiest countries in the world , a series of violent " snow rage " incidents reveal that even the locals have their limits .
REUTERS / Mark Blinch
Police in the French - speaking province of Quebec said on Wednesday that people were fighting over snow clearing and even parking spaces .
Recent Canadian winters have been mild but this one looks set to break all - time records for snow .
One storm last weekend dumped 23 inches on the capital Ottawa and 19 inches on Quebec City , which has already received 210 inches this year .
Quebec
City police said they had been called to a dozen violent disputes about snow from one property ending up on someone else ’s .
The drifts outside some houses are 12 feet and higher .
Last Sunday , a man in an upscale Quebec City neighborhood became so upset a woman from a snow removal service was putting snow on his yard that he shouted at her and then took a shovel and hit the window of the vehicle she was driving .
“ The woman apologized and returned to work ... a bit later the man opened his garage door and emerged with a shotgun , pointed it at the ground and looked at her in a threatening way , ” said police spokeswoman Catherine Viel .
Police arrested the man , who will be charged with negligent use of a firearm , and seized a total of 13 weapons from his home .
Viel said snow - related fights were unusually common .
“ It ’s happened particularly often this year ... you have to be used to snow if you live in Quebec but it ’s been a bit extreme this year .
People are fed up , ” she said .
In Montreal , police said a man had produced a toy gun during a heated dispute Sunday between two drivers over a rare parking space .
He may face weapons charges .
There may be more trouble to come , since Environment Canada says there is no sign winter is about to end .
Snow fell again on Quebec City and Ottawa Wednesday .
Montreal is also having problems disposing of the snow .
One massive mound is around 80 - feet high and officials told reporters that unless steps were taken to dismantle the pile , much of it would still be there when next winter started .
Categorically no , if we 're to take a lesson from a recent experiment in Fresno , California .
Fresno's City Council conducted a year - long competition pitting private contractors against city public works crews to see who did a better job paving their assigned roads in the municipality .
The city crew and two contractors were each given five neighborhoods to pave .
The city crew finished its work in September - ahead of schedule and on budget .
One private contractor had finished only 20 % of its work by September and had its contract terminated .
The other contractor had n't even started paving one of its neighborhoods , and instead asked the city for $ 750,000 to complete the work .
The mayor still says the competition is too close to call (! ) .
Some council members saw the competition as a waste of money , and illustrative of how city contracts need closer consideration and accountability .
" Awarding these contracts out , the administration is playing Russian
roulette with taxpayer money , and it's been a costly , very expensive
experiment , " said Councilman Henry T. Perea .
Friday
IT 'S 4:30 AM , and I 'm hunched over a toilet bowl scrubbing until the porcelain shines .
“ House - mousing ” , as it's called , is nobody 's favourite task at the South Pole , but everyone is expected to contribute .
Despite backsliding tendencies that increase with time , almost everyone does .
Back from cleaning , I see the New York Times has the results of the Iowa caucuses , already several days past .
With limited phone and internet connections , the rest of the world tends to disappear at the Pole .
In many ways , being at the South Pole is a metaphor for the very enterprise of science itself — for the rapture that causes the scientist to drop all else , to stop eating , sleeping , and communicating in pursuit of some sort of truth .
Justin Vandenbroucke
End of the road
Even with that isolation though , finding solitude and quiet here can be hard .
With the shared facilities and constant hum of heavy machinery and construction vehicles , it 's difficult to imagine the South Pole as Scott and Amundsen would have known it .
Perhaps the only way to get even a glimpse of that Pole is to go out for a long walk .
Luckily , I 've made plans to get a tour of the Atmospheric Research Observatory ( ARO ) , one of the main scientific facilities here a short distance from the station .
I look up at the television monitors , which tell me that it's - 24 °C outside , with a wind chill of - 62 °C .
Better get my gear .
Getting dressed to go outside here involves more layers than a James Joyce novel .
First comes the polypropylene long underwear .
Then perhaps a fleece and heavy - duty overalls , followed by another fleece .
Boot liners and boots are next , followed by glove liners , wool mittens , a facemask , goggles , and a hat .
On top of it all goes Big Red — the bright , standard - issue , USAP down coat .
Each one has a nametag velcroed to the front , since , with only the tip of one 's nose showing , it would otherwise be impossible to distinguish people .
I head outside and begin walking .
Frost instantly adheres to my beard and eyelashes .
I put my head down and continue .
With a hat and a fur - lined hood pulled tightly over my ears , all noise fades out , except for the rhythm of my breath , the gusts of wind , and the sounds of shoes on snow .
On their better days , Amundsen and Scott must have experienced a similar exhilaration while walking in the sun here .
ARO is one of five global observatories run by NOAA , America 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Its mission is to conduct long - term monitoring of Earth 's atmosphere — of the trace gasses that contribute to global warming and of aerosols , ozone - destroying chemicals and other man-made pollutants .
Outside the blue building stands a tower with air inlets , which sample from air that has blown free from human interference for thousands of miles .
The air is so clean here , my tour guide tells me , that they would notice a bit of exhaust from a diesel engine thirty miles away .
Measuring the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of ARO 's main tasks , and it 's been monitored here at the South Pole for longer than anywhere else .
In 1957 , Charles Keeling came down and filled several flasks with air .
He brought them back home and measured their carbon dioxide concentrations , finding them to be around 315 parts per million .
Justin Vandenbroucke
The measure of man
The next year , Keeling began continuous measurements at Mauna Loa in Hawaii as well .
In the entrance way of ARO hangs a poster with his data , which he used to show for the first time the seemingly inexorable human - induced rise of the greenhouse gas .
Further along on the tour , we come to a small room with four windows that open inward like hatches .
On a table sits an instrument known as a Dobson interferometer , which technicians use to measure ozone .
Ozone is an atmospheric molecule that blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun .
In the 1970s , it was discovered that certain manmade chemicals were destroying ozone .
Even though the Montreal Protocol came into effect in 1989 , banning those chemicals , ARO technicians still measure the ozone hole that forms over Antarctica every winter : a reminder that it takes quite some time for nature to heal man 's damage .
At the end of our tour , my guide hands me a small glass test tube to hold out the window into the breeze .
I hand it back to her and she slaps on a label : “ The Cleanest Air On Earth . ”
Below that , a graph shows Keeling 's curve and today 's carbon dioxide concentration , measured right here at ARO .
At 382 parts per million , it 's quite a bit higher than it was in Keeling 's day , and it 's rising every day .
I think of that air blowing for tens of thousands of barren , uninhabited miles .
Across icy oceans and sea ice , past only penguins , seals , and whales .
Up mountains over which no human foot has ever tread , and over crevasses and frozen ice sheets .
Thinking about it all reminds me that I 'm just about ready to head out of here and back to civilization .

Thursday
I STUMBLE out into the midnight sun and pull on my goggles to cut the glare .
Still half - asleep , I walk twenty feet to the bathroom , desperately trying not to slip in my Birkenstock clogs ( for the record , these are not officially recommended Antarctic footwear ) .
A laminated sign greets me next to the sink : “ When you 're finished with your pee can , empty it and put it in food waste ” .
Maybe I should explain .
My South Pole living quarters are located in an area known as Summer Camp — overflow housing provided by green , Korean War -era tents known as Jamesways .
Most occupants of the Jamesways prefer using cans to leaving their tents and braving the elements to relieve themselves in the middle of the night .
Michelangelo D'Agostino
All fun and games
After readying myself for the day , I begin the five - minute walk over to the new state - of - the - art station .
I pass giant bulldozers flattening snow for roads , forklifts carrying cargo pallets and darting snowmobiles .
I have to pause twice going up the two flights of stairs to catch my breath .
Finally , I reach the six - inch thick stainless steel freezer door to the station .
I 'm not about to walk into a freezer , though : I 'm coming out of one .
Inside , it 's easy to appreciate what a marvel the new station is .
It has a library and lounges with televisions and pool tables .
Once I acclimatise , I promise myself that I 'll take advantage of the full gym and exercise room .
Unfortunately , altitude is n't the only harsh feature of life down here .
The South Pole is drier than the Sahara .
Skin flakes and cracks ; wounds do n't heal ; and static charges build up so easily that I get a shock whenever I touch a metal surface .
When I 'm in dire need of some humidity , I think I 'll go to the station 's hydroponic greenhouse to suck down some deliciously wet air .
The two previous , less luxurious incarnations of the Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station were slowly buried under snowdrifts as the years passed .
To avoid the same fate , the new building rests on 32 steel columns , elevating it twelve feet above the surface of the ice .
Its orientation and aerodynamic exterior accelerate the wind and channel it underneath the station .
The resulting gusts scour the ice surface , depositing snow on the other side instead of letting it build up against the station itself .
Michelangelo D'Agostino
Humidity fix
The new station was designed with enough capacity to support what America 's National Science Foundation expects will be an increasing array of activity at the Pole .
At the moment , the main scientific fields here are astrophysics , seismology , and atmospheric science .
Astrophysicists have been coming to the Pole for decades to set up their experiments .
For those trying to observe the remnant light that has been travelling through the universe since the Big Bang itself , the Pole is perhaps the best place on the planet .
Over the last two years , the giant ten - metre diameter dish of the new South Pole Telescope ( SPT ) has become the centrepiece of the Polar skyline .
Within a few years , the SPT should be providing key data that will help to pin down the nature of dark energy , the mysterious force that dominates the universe and speeds its expansion .
Several key properties make the Pole ideal for observing the microwave light of this “ cosmic microwave background ” .
The South Pole 's cold , dry , thin atmosphere emits few microwaves , which intrude on ground - level experimentation .
In addition , the atmosphere here is extremely stable , minimising stray fluctuations that mask the intrinsic fluctuations scientists want to find .
Another group of astrophysicists ( myself included ) is here to study something else coming from the heavens .
The IceCube experiment is building a giant detector out of the polar ice sheet itself in an attempt to collect extraterrestrial neutrinos — ghostly subatomic particles that interact only very weakly with normal matter .
Using a high - pressure jet of hot water , IceCube drillers melt a hole over 2.5 kilometres down into the ice sheet .
Very sensitive light detectors are lowered into the hole , which is then allowed to refreeze .
Eventually , the team will embed such sensors throughout a cubic kilometre volume of ice in their effort to detect high - energy neutrinos .
These neutrinos , we hope , will tell us about some of the most violent objects in the universe , like supermassive black holes and exploding stars .
Coming to the farthest reaches of the Earth helps scientists explore the farthest reaches of the universe .

Wednesday
A SLOW , bumpy ride on a contraption known as “ Ivan the Terra Bus ” brings a group of us from McMurdo to several LC - 130 Hercules cargo planes parked on the sea-ice for our journey to the South Pole .
The LC - 130s are the real workhorses of the US Antarctic Programme .
Outfitted with hydraulic skis so that they can land in soft snow , they bring supplies to the South Pole as well as the other , more remote field camps scattered over the continent .
Inside , we find our seats : red cargo netting attached to the sides of the plane .
There are only about 30 of us today , but seasoned vets say that in the old days , when older planes flew less frequently , people packed in like sardines in rows of facing seats .
Michelangelo D'Agostino
Flying first class
After flying over the Transantarctic Mountains , a seemingly endless expanse of white spreads out beneath us .
This is the East Antarctic Ice Sheet ( EAIS ) , the world 's largest .
By itself , this sleeping giant contains enough water to raise global sea levels by 60 meters .
Because of its size and remoteness , less is known about the EAIS than about Greenland 's ice sheets or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , both of which are rapidly warming and losing ice .
The EAIS , conversely , may actually be getting thicker as more snow falls in a wetter , warmer climate .
Climatologists are actively working to determine the exact mass balance of Antarctica 's ice sheets , an endeavor that has important ramifications for coastlines everywhere .
Three hours and a soft ski-landing later , we 've arrived at the South Pole .
We exit the plane to the right , away from the propellers , which must keep running so that they do n't freeze .
The reflection of the bright sun off the snow is almost blinding , and my eyes begin to water from the wind , which bites at any exposed patch of skin .
After donning the ski goggles I was issued in Christchurch , I can see the gleaming new Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station a short distance away .

Eyes of a scientist
Standing atop this ice sheet , words like “ vast ” or “ immense ” or “ expansive ” come readily to the tip of the tongue , but words cannot capture its immensity .
And though it seems eternal and unchanging , the pole markers I see in the snow tell a different story .
A modest metal post sits next to a sign marking the location of the geographical South Pole , the exact point through which the Earth 's axis of rotation passes .
I look off to the right to see a series of older posts .
The position of the geographical Pole is fixed , of course , but the ice sheet is actually flowing and sliding in a slow march to the sea , carrying the marker nine meters from the actual geographical Pole each year .
Every January 1st , the station holds a ceremony to put a new marker at the true location .
And then there 's the ceremonial , red - and - white striped pole with a mirrored ball on top .
Surrounding it are the 12 flags of the original signers of the Antarctic Treaty , the document governing the continent .
In 1958 , after the successful completion of the International Geophysical Year , Dwight Eisenhower invited the other IGY nations to Washington to craft a treaty to ensure that “ the vast uninhabited wastes of Antarctica shall be used only for peaceful purposes ” .
Today , the 45 signatories to the resulting treaty have agreed to suspend territorial claims and disputes , to forego all military and mining activities here , to protect the Antarctic environment , and to preserve the continent as “ a natural reserve , devoted to peace and to science ” .
As Richard Nixon reaffirmed in 1970 , Antarctica remains “ the only continent where science serves as the principal expression of national policy and interest ” .
The Antarctic Treaty has been one of the most successful international agreements the world has known .
To ensure its continued success , it provides for an inspection regime that would make Iran or North Korea blush .
All parties have the right to inspect all stations and equipment at any time to ensure that the treaty is being adhered to .
And the parties meet on a yearly basis to discuss plans and concerns , all decisions being reached by consensus .
Out - of - breath and quite dizzy , I decide to take a nap .
While bedrock at the South Pole is pretty close to sea level , the ice sheet itself stretches to an altitude of 9,300 feet .
Combined with the cold air and effects from the Earth 's rotation , the altitude felt by the body is actually closer to 10,500 feet .
This fluctuates from day to day with the weather and is listed along with the temperature and the wind chill on television monitors throughout the station .
As I huff and puff off to sleep , I hope that maybe tomorrow will feel a bit lower .

Tuesday
FOR veteran “ Polies ” , a stopover at McMurdo Station ( pictured below ) is like passing through Heathrow : an uncomfortable , often prolonged , but necessary evil .
McMurdo , the logistical hub of American Antarctic operations , is on Ross Island , just off the coast of mainland Antarctica .
A short drive around the island 's corner are the distinctive lime - green buildings of Scott Base , home of New Zealand 's Antarctic programme .
Off in the distance , on the other side of the island , smoky plumes come off Mount Erebus , the southernmost active volcano in the world .
Ross 's volcanic heritage makes for dramatic scenery — hills of black rock butt up against the expansive white of the ice shelf .
The peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains off in the distance mark the mainland .
I 've often heard McMurdo compared to a Wild West mining town .
With its swirling black dust , squat buildings , and work - hard , drink - hard attitude , it 's easy to see why .
Instead of cowboys and outlaws , though , it 's full of over a thousand staff , technicians and , of course , scientists — lots of scientists .
Or , to use the Antarctic sobriquet , “ beakers ” .
The orange - haired Beaker , from Jim Henson 's Muppets , was a disaster - prone lab assistant who communicated solely in high - pitched shrieks .
Antarctic workers tend to look on scientists with a mixture of humour and disdain ( the precise blend of the two varies widely , depending on the worker and , of course , the scientist ) .
Michelangelo D'Agostino
The wild south
Beakers come to McMurdo for a variety of reasons .
For climatologists who are trying to study how Antarctica 's ice sheets might respond to a warming world , the ice shelf here is a perfect place .
From a platform of sea-ice , a team of researchers from Germany , Italy , New Zealand and the United States has been drilling down into the sea floor beneath the McMurdo Sound .
They 're retrieving a record of how the ice sheets have been behaving over the last tens of millions of years .
The Antarctic Geological Drill ( ANDRILL ) team , as they 're known , has just completed its second field - season here , retrieving an 1,100 - metre core of rock and sediment .
By studying the core 's rocks and fossils , the team has been learning about the past temperature and behaviour of Antarctica 's massive ice sheets .
When the ice sheets were thick and advancing , more pebbles , stones , and dirty sediment would have been carried into the core by the moving ice .
During warm interglacial periods , when there may have been no sea-ice at all , an abundance of marine organisms would have left behind fossilised shells .
The advance and retreat of the ice sheets can thus be discerned quite accurately from such sediment cores .
The team hopes that understanding how the ice sheets have responded to subtle increases in temperature in the past will provide important clues to what they 'll do in the future .
McMurdo is also the staging ground for another group of scientists drilling into the continent to look into the planet 's past .
Several hours from the South Pole , in the barren expanses of western Antarctica , a small team of American researchers has just finished their second field - season with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS ) Divide Ice Core project .
Over the next five years , the team will use a long , hollow , rotating drill to cut and retrieve a cylinder of ice roughly 12 centimetres across .
Such ice cores hold detailed information on the last 100,000 years of Antarctic weather .
This is because ice sheets do n't form instantaneously .
In any given year , some snow falls ; over many years , accumulation traps the original snow underneath , along with a small amount of air and dust .
Weight and time crush this snow into a thin layer of ice .
The bits of trapped air are now forever encapsulated inside tiny bubbles in the ice layer — they tell climatologists what gases were in the air when the snow fell .
Scientists think the WAIS Divide core should provide the most accurate record to date of atmospheric carbon dioxide , which will allow them to better ascertain the role of carbon dioxide in climate change .
Furthermore , the high - quality dating of the WAIS Divide core will make it easy to correlate with cores from Greenland 's ice sheet , allowing for a tighter coupling of records from the Artic and the Antarctic .
Trying to take all of this in , I walk out to Hut Point , the location of Scott 's still - intact hut , hoping in vain to see a penguin or two .
Disappointed , I head bank to my bunk to get some rest for tomorrow 's journey to the South Pole .

Monday
SOMEWHERE above the icy Southern Ocean , I start to fidget in my seat .
Pulling out my earplugs and shouting to be heard above the roar of the jet engines , I ask a burly New York Air Guardsman if we 've reached the fabled point - of - no - return , the point past which our cargo plane no longer has enough fuel to turn around and “ boomerang ” back to New Zealand .
These boomerangs occur when the notoriously fickle Antarctic weather gets too dicey to land at McMurdo Station , the American coastal base there .
He has n't heard anything about the weather yet , he shouts back , and does n't know how far into the journey we 've gone .
I 'm reminded anew just how much I hate flying .
Michelangelo D'Agostino
No boomerang here
My journey to the South Pole began several hours earlier at the headquarters of the US Antarctic Programme , a series of sprawling warehouses and buildings located next to the airport in Christchurch , which has long been the travellers ' gateway to Antarctica .
On his first southern journey in 1901 , Robert Falcon Scott was blessed by the local bishop and regaled at a farewell banquet at the Warners Hotel .
Today , fresh from the plane , many a burned - out Antarctic traveller heads directly to Bailie 's Bar at the same Warners Hotel for a pint or ten .
Indeed , the Kiwis are so familiar with Antarctic travellers that a customs officer in Auckland took one look at my declaration form and gave me a broad smile : “ So you 're heading to the Ice . ”
Bleary - eyed , we reported to the airport at 0600 to don our cold weather gear and to pack all our personal items into two bright orange duffel bags .
Squinting on the tarmac in the hot summer sun , sweating and squirming in heavy boots , long underwear , fleeces , and overalls , it was hard to imagine that a mere five hour journey would bring me to the coldest , most inhospitable place on earth .
With winds that can exceed 300 kilometres per hour and average winter temperatures of - 40 °C , Antarctica is the windiest , coldest , driest , and highest continent on Earth .
At 14 million square kilometres , its landmass is bigger than the United States , though 98 % of it is covered by a thick blanket of ice .
This ice sheet comprises roughly 90 % of the world 's ice , locking up 70 % of the planet 's fresh water , and in some places is half a kilometre thick .
Antarctica is also the emptiest continent .
Just 4,000 people work there in the summer , and only 1,000 stay through the long , dark winter .
Michelangelo D'Agostino
The destination
Still , the journey has a convivial air .
For many long - time Antarctic workers , this is a trip home , a familiar journey with familiar faces .
To scientists who are studying Earth 's climatic history , or to those who have come to take advantage of one of the myriad unique features of the Ice to do their research , this is a chance to collect valuable data .
I meet a geologist heading to the Dry Valleys , a protected area a short helicopter ride from McMurdo where long - term ecological research has been carried out for decades .
I chat with a graduate student on his first trip down to the South Pole to make radio measurements of the southern auroras .
My seatmate is a marine biologist studying how plankton , the base of the marine food chain , will survive in oceans becoming increasingly acidified due to the build - up of atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Through a light sleep , I hear the husky voice of the Guardsman again .
We 've begun our descent to McMurdo .
A few minutes and a slight bump later , the C - 17 has touched down .
Considering the runway we 've landed on is made of hard snow packed down on top of sea-ice , our landing is surprisingly smooth .
Light floods the plane when the cargo bay opens .
The excitement is palpable now as we begin to move towards the door .
A colleague once called the moment he stepped off the plane in Antarctica for the first time the best moment of his life .
I did n't quite believe him then .
Now , though , stepping gingerly down the stairs and onto the ice , a blast of cold air hits my face , but it 's the brilliant white of the ice - shelf extending in all directions , ending in snow - covered mountains , that takes my breath away .
Any fan of Futurama will recognize Slurm as the official soft drink of the 31st century .
You remember the slogan —
" It 's highly addictive . "
But if a recent trademark filing by Twentieth Century Fox is any indication , Slurm could be coming to store shelves sometime in the less distant future .
The " Slurm " trademark includes :
... carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks ; fruit drinks ; fruit juices ; mineral and aerated water ; bottled drinking water ; energy drinks ; syrups and powders for making soft drinks and other beverages , namely soft drinks , fruit drinks and tea ; coffee - flavored soft drinks ; Ramune ( Japanese soda pops ) ; powders used in the preparation of isotonic sports drinks and sports beverages .

The best part of this is whole scenario is that a bunch of Fox execs and lawyers sat around a board room and discussed the possibility of a future in which Slurm could become one of many " sports beverages . "
Philip J. Fry , the epitome of an athlete .
While the trademark filing could be defensive in nature , preventing others from marketing Slurms of their own , our stomachs are aflutter at the possibility of ingesting some giant slug ass juice .

An insightful speaker raised a massive cheer from the audience at an education conference this week .
No , he had not called for a doubling of teachers ' pay , the abolition of national tests , or even a ban on lumpy custard in school canteens .
No , his rallying cry was much simpler and involves no complex administrative changes or financial costs .
Yet it went to the heart of what education is about .
He urged everyone to stop talking about " delivery " in education and to return to talking about " teaching " .
The speaker was Professor Richard Pring , of Oxford University , and he was not just being fussy about the use of language .
A quick look at any recent government documents quickly provides further examples
His point was that education has been taken over by an " Orwellian language " which has started to control the way we think and act .
Professor Pring is the lead author of a report , published this week by the Nuffield Review of 14 - 19 Education and Training , which looks at how the aims and values of education have come to be " dominated by the language of management " .
So when judging schools and universities we now talk about " performance indicators " as a substitute for assessing the quality of their teaching .
Learning has to be measured by an " audit " of the qualifications achieved rather than a more qualitative judgement of what students have learned .
This approach has certainly driven policy in adult education , where courses that do not lead to an accredited qualification seem to be dismissed as mere hobbies by policy - makers .
A quick look at any recent government documents quickly provides further examples .
For example , they talk about " new providers " instead of schools .
' What is education for ? '
Repeated phrases refer to " efficiency gains " , " choice for customers " , " the market " , and " funding systems that respond to customer demand " .
The phraseology of " inputs " and " outputs " is more like the language of industrial production than of education .
It implies there is an exact specification for the finished product .
The Nuffield paper wonders whether we have lost sight of earlier descriptions of education such as " the conversation between the generations of mankind " ( Michael Oakeshott ) or an introduction to " the best that has been thought and said " ( Matthew Arnold ) ?
I suppose this could seem unfair .
After all , the authors of government documents are not attempting to do the same thing as philosophers of education .
Yet this matters because the language we use shapes the answers to the question : " what is education for ? "
And there is no doubt that it is the model of workforce preparation and employability that currently dominates the current education discourse .
Hence we now have " enterprise " as a compulsory part of the school curriculum , while history , geography and foreign languages are no longer required after the age of 14 .
' Bigger picture '
Nor is this simply about a neglect of certain types of traditional academic learning .
Equally overlooked is the value of practical , hands - on learning or of creativity .
Yes , we are about to get new Diplomas in vocation subjects such as engineering , IT , Creative and Media and Health and Beauty .
But the government does not describe these as vocational qualifications but prefers to describe them as " academic " qualifications and to stress their A - level equivalence .
This may make practical sense in the face of British snobbery towards non-academic qualifications .
But it also suggests a lack of confidence in the value of practical education .
' Academic frippery '
The need to measure everything and to find equivalents for different types of education arises from a natural enough desire to achieve value - for - money , and to promote different routes for young people .
But it can also be a strait - jacket , implying that all types of learning can , and should , be forced into the same model .
As Professor Pring pointed out , one of the problems with the General National Vocational Qualifications ( GNVQs ) - and a future risk for Diplomas - is that in an attempt to achieve parity with GCSEs and A - levels , students were assessed not so much on what they could " do " but how well they could write about and analyse their " doing " .
Students were forced into a model of academic learning , even when they had chosen something that had a hands - on and practical approach .
The same applies to creativity ; the latest government initiative is an investigation into how to measure the levels of creativity amongst school pupils .
The Nuffield Review paper concludes that we should recognise , and value , many different aims for education .
These include : critical thinking and an introduction to knowledge in the physical and social sciences , the humanities and the arts ; development of practical capabilities ; preparation for citizenship ; and development of the ideals and values needed to face the big issues affecting our communities .
Taking us back to consider the big question - " what is education for ? " - may seem like an academic frippery compared to the day - to - day hard questions about the curriculum and testing .
But at a time when 14 - 19 education in England is going through its biggest upheaval for over 50 years , it is an essential reminder of the need to keep an eye on the bigger picture .

( Let me point out at the very beginning that I am aware that Mozilla Prism is still in beta .
This commentary is specifically based on Mozila Prism 0.8 for Mac OS X. )
I love the idea of Mozilla Prism .
As an avid user of Gmail and other web - based applications , I can see the usefulness of a stripped down version of Firefox that makes my web applications behave similarly to a desktop application .
Additionally , since Prism runs in a separate process , I do n't have to worry about Firefox crashes killing my Gmail session , or losing unsaved data from a Google Docs Document .
So , I 'm very excited about using Prism , but unfortunately , it 's just not quite ready for production yet .
Here are the problems I 've discovered so far .
Keep in mind , these problems are specific to Mozilla Prism 0.8 on Mac OS X 10.4 ( Tiger ) .
Only one copy of Prism can be open at a time .
This is the deal breaker for me .
Unfortunately , I have more than one web application that I need open at a time , and the allure of Prism is dulled if I can't do that .
Why do I need to resize every time !
Every time I open an application in Prism , the window size has been reset to the default .
Unfortunately , the default size is not perfect for me , so I am forced to resize .
Windows spawned by a running Prism process do not appear to inherent the parent 's size .
Why not use the application 's FAVICON if available ?
I believe this one is already on the upcoming feature list , so this is really just registering my annoyance .
At the moment , all Prism shortcuts use the blue " world " icon .
This is replaceable via Mac OS X's normal icon changing methods .
As I mentioned in the list , the inability to open multiple Prism applications , makes Prism unworkable for me .
The other issues I could live with easily .
It 's worth noting that Mac users do have a working application that probably already fits the bill : Fluid .

HealthDay Reporter
MONDAY , Jan. 14 ( HealthDay News ) --
The long - awaited results of a trial of Zetia , a cholesterol - lowering drug prescribed to about a million Americans , shows the drug confers no medical benefit to users .
In fact , the pace at which artery - clogging plaques formed within vessels almost doubled in patients taking Zetia ( ezetimibe ) along with another cholesterol - lowering drug , Zocor ( simvastatin ) , compared to those taking Zocor alone , the study found .
The two medications -- ezetimibe plus simvastatin -- are also marketed in one prescription pill , called Vytorin .
About 60 percent of U.S. patients who are taking Zetia now receive the drug as part of Vytorin .
But the new two - year trial of 720 patients sheds doubt on whether it makes any sense for people battling cholesterol to take Vytorin versus Zocor alone , experts said .
The study was funded by the two companies that make Zetia , Merck and Schering - Plough .
" This wraps it up , " said Dr. Steven E. Nissen , chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic .
" That 's all there is .
There just is n't any evidence that adding ezetimibe to simvastatin produces any advantage . "
No one is disputing that Zetia can lower levels of LDL " bad " cholesterol by 15 percent to 20 percent -- that had been shown in previous trials .
However , whether that reduction led to any greater lowering of heart attack or stroke risk had remained unclear .
The new ENHANCE trial -- which involved patients with a genetic condition that causes abnormally high levels of blood cholesterol -- found no such added benefit .
According to a statement released by the two drug companies Monday , researchers found no statistically significant difference in heart attacks or stroke among trial participants who took Zetia plus Zocor , a widely used cholesterol - lower drug , versus those who got Zocor alone .
The study also noted that the speed at which arteries thickened with plaque almost doubled among those on the two - drug regimen compared to those taking Zocor alone .
Safety profiles were similar for Zetia / Zocor versus Zocor alone , the team added .
" These results are very important considerations on how we treat patients with elevated cholesterol and will very likely impact the way we choose drugs to lower cholesterol and eliminate plaque , " said Dr. Howard Weintraub , clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardio - Vascular Disease at New York University Medical Center , New York City , and clinical associate professor at the NYU School of Medicine .
" ENHANCE found that plaque got slightly worse when the drug combination was used , " Weintraub noted in a statement .
" But , the real take - home message here is that getting LDL down is important , and that 's not something that should be lost as a consequence of this study . "
The ENHANCE study was completed in April 2006 , but the results were only released Monday by Merck and Schering - Plough after continual prodding by medical professionals .
According to The New York Times , the companies had initially planned to release the findings by March 2007 , but then missed several self - imposed deadlines , blaming the delay on the complexities of necessary data analysis .
Now that the results have arrived , Zetia and Vytorin should be viewed as " drugs of last resort , " for patients not helped by standard statin therapy , Nissen said .
Only if you can't tolerate full doses of simvastatin should you take ezetimibe , he said .
" This is one of the most widely advertised and widely used drugs out there , so it 's obviously good to get these study results , " Nissen added .
Another group questioned why patients should be prescribed more expensive cholesterol - lowering drugs , such as Vytorin , versus cheaper , generic statins such as Zocor .
" We already know that millions of people who take these brand drugs probably do n't need to ; they could be taking a less expensive generic instead .
This study lends support to that cost - saving strategy for the health system and for consumers , " said Steven Findlay , managing editor of Consumer Reports Best Buy Drugs , a public information and education project of Consumers Union , publisher of Consumer Reports .
" If there is no apparent clinical benefit , why take a drug that cost three or four times more ? "
Findlay said in a statement .
" Most people do not need that magnitude of cholesterol reduction anyway . "
Sales of Zetia and Vytorin totaled $ 3.7 billion in the nine months ending Sept. 30 , up 33 percent from a year ago .
Analysts estimate that about 70 percent of Schering - Plough 's earnings depend on the drugs , the Times noted .

The immense popularity of sites like YouTube has unexpectedly turned Flash Video ( FLV ) into one of the de facto standards for Internet video .
The proliferation of sites using FLV has been a boon for remix culture , as creators made their own versions of posted videos .
And thus far there has been no widespread DRM standard for Flash or Flash Video formats ; indeed , most sites that use these formats simply serve standalone , unencrypted files via ordinary web servers .
Now Adobe , which controls Flash and Flash Video , is trying to change that with the introduction of DRM restrictions in version 9 of its Flash Player and version 3 of its Flash Media Server software .
Instead of an ordinary web download , these programs can use a proprietary , secret Adobe protocol to talk to each other , encrypting the communication and locking out non-Adobe software players and video tools .
We imagine that Adobe has no illusions that this will stop copyright infringement -- any more than dozens of other DRM systems have done so -- but the introduction of encryption does give Adobe and its customers a powerful new legal weapon against competitors and ordinary users through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
Recall that the DMCA sets out a blanket ban on tools that help " circumvent " any DRM system ( as well as the act of circumvention itself ) .
When Flash Video files are simply hosted on a web site with no encryption , it 's unlikely that tools to download , edit , or remix them are illegal .
But when encryption enters the picture , entertainment companies argue that fair use is no excuse ; Adobe , or customers using Flash Media Server 3 , can try to shut down users who break the encryption without having to prove that the users are doing anything copyright - infringing .
Even if users are n't targeted directly , technology developers may be threatened and the technologies the users need driven underground .
Users may also have to upgrade their Flash Player software ( and open source alternatives like Gnash , which has been making rapid progress , may be unable to play the encrypted streams at all ) .
Third - party software that can download Flash Video , like the most recent RealPlayer , will also break .
But Adobe now has an incentive to push the use of DRM : it 's only available to sites that use Flash Media Server 3 software , which starts at over $ 4,000 ( with extra fees depending on the number of simultaneous streams ) .
Furthermore , the prospect of widespread adoption of DRM restrictions on Flash threatens to squash a growing tradition of expressive fair use of online video -- a practice effectively in its infancy that , left unfettered , would be a dynamic solution to our failing effort to teach media literacy .
Before we understand how to read media messages , we must first learn how to speak their language -- and we learn that language by playing with and remixing the efforts of others .
DRM , by restricting the remixing of Flash videos , stands to bankrupt a rich store of educational value by foreclosing the ability of students and teachers to " echo others " by remixing videos posted online .
Take the example of " A Vision of Students Today " vs. " ( Re ) Visions of Students Today " .
The first " Vision " YouTube video is an artful critique of higher education 's failure to come up with new models of instruction that engage the modern student ; the second " ( Re ) Vision " YouTube video is an incisive observation of higher education 's crisis in diversity ( summarily expressed by the lack of diversity in the original " Vision " video ) .
The original and the remix support each other to instruct with an influence above and beyond the power of either video alone .
Outside the halls of academia , we can see that the ability to openly download and remix video is part of a new ecosystem of amateur entertainment -- watch Drama Prairie Dog and its countless responses :
As we noted above , remixers who find and use tools that break the Flash Video encryption could be sued , even if their transformative creations would otherwise have been fair use .
Finally , there 's a classic suite of arguments against DRM that will be as true for online video as they were for music .
DRM does n't move additional product .
DRM is grief for honest end -users .
And there 's no reason to imagine that new DRM systems will stop copyright infringement any more effectively than previous systems .
First , Stephen Spielberg upset Chinese internet users after resigning as artistic adviser to the Olympics over Darfur .
Now , Bjork is under attack after
shouting " Tibet ! Tibet ! " at the end of her song Declare Independence at a concert in Shanghai .
Her remark was not reported in the official media , but led to angry criticism when it began to circulate on the web .
While China 's 58 - year occupation remains controversial internationally , most Chinese people see Tibet as an integral part of their nation and regard calls for its independence as intrusive and divisive .
One comment , on the Sina website , read : " If she really did this , then this woman really makes people throw up . "
Even a fan complained it was " disrespectful " and " very selfish " to raise the issue while visiting .
The Icelandic singer initially dedicated Declare independence to Greenland
and the Faroe Islands , which still have formal links to Denmark .
The video for the song shows her in clothing bearing their flags .
Its lyrics include : " Do n't let them do that to you .
Raise your flag ! "
While performing in Japan last month , she dedicated the song to Kosovo .
Bjork also played at several fundraising concerts supporting Tibetan independence in the US in the 1990s .
Raising the issue on Chinese soil , as she did on Sunday , was bound to prove more contentious .
Stephen Gow , a Briton who was present , told the Associated Press news agency : " The atmosphere was very strange : uncomfortable , compared to the
rest of the concert . "
But another audience member , Gabriel Monroe , told the Guardian most people did not register the remark at first .
" One of my friends thought she was saying ' to bed ' , because she had mentioned it was the last song , " he said .
He said that , up until then , Bjork had delighted Chinese fans by saying " xie xie " ( thank you ) after every song .
Comments from Chinese discussion boards ( translated by the media blog Danwei ) , however , were mostly outraged .
" Those who put on the show should be severely fined and not allowed to bring this kind of trash in for performances , " wrote one angry commenter .
Another wrote : " Why do western stars give a shit about Tibet .
Is n't Tibet ours ?!
Mind your own business ! "
But at least one spoke up in her defence , arguing : " So what if she sang a few lines about Tibet ?
We do n't need to berate the woman to death . "
Matt Whitticase , spokesman for the London - based Free Tibet Movement , said the group was delighted by her remarks , contrasting them with Gordon Brown and David Miliband 's " shameful " decision not to raise the issue publicly on their recent visits to Beijing .
" Speaking out while in China has shown it is perfectly possible to make a high - profile visit and raise the ongoing plight of the Tibetan people , " he said .
Bjork 's spokespeople could not be contacted .
Asked last month about criticism of the Chinese presence and human rights record , the foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang
Yu said : " Tibetan affairs are
domestic issues of China .
Tibet has been an inseparable part of Chinese territories since ancient times , which is universally recognised by the international community .
" Some overseas forces advocating Tibet independence have been engaged in anti-China separatist activities . "

OSLO ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said on Monday he was not interested in serving in a new administration after elections next year , and the only way he would return to politics would be a new run for the White House .
But Gore , who received the Nobel Peace Prize in the Norwegian capital on Monday for his work to raise awareness about climate change , repeated in a live televised interview on CNN that he has no plan to jump into the 2008 election .
“ I have no plans to run , ” he said in the interview at Oslo ’s City Hall .
Gore , a Democrat , lost the 2000 election to George W. Bush .
“ I have n’t ruled out the idea of getting back into the political process at some point in the future -- ( I ) do n’t expect to , ” Gore said .
“ But if I did get back , it would be as a candidate for president , not in any other position . ”
Gore shared the 2007 peace prize with the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a body of some 2,500 climate scientists from around the globe .
When the prize was announced in mid-October , it briefly sparked speculation that it could trigger a Gore candidacy , though he has repeatedly said he has no plan to run .
Prepare for Emergencies
With faculty and students who study hundreds of disciplines and thousands of subjects , Appalachian is certainly a diverse and vibrant campus .
Unfortunately , recent surveys conducted by the Office of Environmental Health , Safety , and Emergency Management indicate that many of our faculty , staff , and students are simply not prepared for one of the most fundamental and basic subject areas -- personal safety and preparedness .
Most people do not prepare for emergencies until they personally experience one .
Preparing for emergencies , even the most basic , will help you respond quicker and more effectively should the need arise .
If you would like to request a workshop or training in your department , contact the Office of Environmental Health , Safety , and Emergency Management .

University leaders have taken steps to protect the safety and welfare of our students , faculty , staff , and campus visitors .
They also have developed guidelines addressing the continuation of campus services should a disruption of services occur .
Functions and Partial Orders
In a few other blogs ( especially here ) , there has been some discussion of the mathematical foundations of functions in programming languages , starting from topology .
Just for fun , I will approach from the other direction , describing functions that can be defined in various languages in terms of partially ordered sets .
Of course , for those of you who know this already , then you can go on and define topologies on these posets a la Dana Scott , so it amounts to the same thing .
But this way has more pretty pictures .
Functions and Partial Information
Suppose we want to look at functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers .
( By the natural numbers , I mean non-negative integers . )
There are , of course , infinitely many such functions .
Let ’s pick a few that are interesting :
The constant function f( x ) =
5 . The identity function g(x ) = x .
The successor function h( x ) = x +
1 . The doubling function p(x ) = 2 x .
The square function q( x ) = x2 .
That should give us a good start .
These functions are all quite well - defined over the integers .
Indeed , I can implement them all in my favorite programming language , and I ’ll get exactly that ( note : only because my favorite programming language does arbitrary precision integers , of course . )
The next question is this : what happens if I do n’t know everything about the input to the function ?
What can I infer about the output given partial information about the input ?
Here ’s some of the things I might ask of that sort :
x x = 2 x is even x is at least 5 x could be anything f( x ) f( x ) = 5 f( x ) = 5 f( x ) = 5 f( x ) = 5 g( x ) g(x ) = 2 g( x ) is even g(x ) is at least 5 g( x ) could be anything h( x ) h( x ) = 3 h( x ) is odd h(x ) is at least 6 h( x ) is at least 1 p( x ) p( x ) = 4 p(x ) is even p(x ) is at least 10
p( x ) is even p( x ) is even q( x ) q( x ) = 4 q( x ) is even
q (x ) is a perfect square q(x ) is at least 25
q (x ) is a perfect square q(x ) is a perfect square
Getting back this sort of partial information is trickier than implementing the function over totally known arguments .
That ’s what this blog post is about .
Partial Orders and Up - Sets
The trick is to build a partial order on the domain of the function .
A partial order is some relation , ≤ , that has three properties :
Reflexive : For all x , x ≤ x .
For all x , x ≤ x .
Anti-symmetric :
If x ≤ y and y ≤ x , then x = y .
If x ≤ y and y ≤ x , then x = y .
Transitive :
If x ≤ y and y ≤ z , then x ≤ z .
Everyone is familiar with the ≤ that means “ is no larger than . ”
But there are other perfectly good definitions as well .
For example “ is a factor of ” is a perfectly good meaning for ≤ .
Now here ’s where the pretty pictures come in .
We can draw a diagram for a partial order , where there ’s an upward path from x to y precisely when x ≤ y .
For example , here is part of the diagram for the familiar partial order “ is no larger than ” on the natural numbers :
And here is part of the diagram for “ is a factor of ” :
Each of these partial orders contains some information about the relationships between natural numbers .
In particular , one can identify certain properties of the natural numbers as belonging to up - sets : sets that have the property that if they contain something , they also contain everything that it greater than it .
So “ at least 5 ” is the up - set of naturals in the familiar order that contains 5 and everything above it .
We can call this the up - set generated by 5 .
In the second ( divisibility ) order , the up - set generated by 5 can be described as “ divisible by 5 ” .
To use these orders to get information about partial inputs to functions , we need two things :
Up-sets that capture the partial information we have .
Functions that preserve that order .
Let ’s shoot for the first one .
Looking at the kinds of partial information we had :
x is even .
This is the up - set generated by 2 in the divisibility order .
x is at least 5 .
This is the up - set generated by 5 in the familiar order .
x could be anything .
This is the up - set generated by the bottom element of any partial order we like , so long as it has a bottom element .
x is a perfect square .
We ’ll need a quite complicated order for this one .
We can order the natural numbers by the divisibility order on the least common divisor of the exponents of their prime factorizations .
It turns out this is n’t even a valid partial order ( it violates anti-symmetry ) , but I can treat it as a partial order on equivalence classes , and things work out .
Then perfect squares are the up - set generated by [ 2 ] ( the equivalence class of numbers whose gcd of the exponents in their prime factorization is precisely 2 ) in this order .
Once we ’ve chosen a partial order whose up - sets capture the information we want , we have to verify that the function actually preserves the order .
That is , if we take an up - set generated by x , and pass everything in it through the function , will the result live in the up - set generated by f( x ) .
The successor function h( x ) = x + 1 that we defined earlier has this property in the familiar order .
If I have a set of all numbers bigger than 4 , and I add one to them all , I get all the numbers bigger than 5 .
However , h( x ) does not preserve up - sets in the divisibility order .
If I have all numbers divisible by 3 , and I add one to them all , there ’s no guarantee that the resulting numbers will be divisible by 4 !
So I have to be careful about using an order - preserving function , if I want any kind of partial information from up - sets .
What a mess !
Sure , if I can define the right partial order , and then prove that the function preserves up - sets on the partial order , and sometimes pull this trick with equivalence classes , and then I get to say something about the behavior of my function on partial information .
But that seems less than fulfilling somehow .
It feels like I ’m working too hard , and now I ca n’t even define some functions , depending on which order I choose .
Sorting Out the Mess
So what do we do with all of this ?
The first thing to do is to pick an order and stick with it .
We ’ll lose some partial information , but we ’ll get to keep other partial information .
The logical choice for natural numbers is the familiar order .
It ’s fairly common for me to want to know that a number is at least 3 .
It ’s somewhat less common for me to want to know that a number is a multiple of 3 .
But I wo n’t assume any choice , and in a future blog post , I ’ll demonstrate how to build numeric data types in Haskell that parallel several possible choices , and exhibit different laziness characteristics as a result .
The next thing we want to do is recover the ability to define all functions again .
The problem with defining some functions is that there ’s something “ greater than ” the number we ’re looking at that wo n’t stay that way once we ’re done .
The obvious solution is to just make sure there ’s nothing “ greater than ” a number .
We can invent a whole set of pseudo - numbers : ~0 , ~1 , ~2 , and so on .
Then we ’ll put the numbers themselves above that .
Here ’s the new set of natural numbers with the familiar order :
And voila !
I can define all my favorite functions with the actual numbers .
What remains is to extend my function onto the pseudo - numbers as well .
In this order , the pseudo - number ~n means “ at least n “ .
There ’s always one safe way to do this : just map everything to ~0 , the minimal element .
However , if I still want to get partial information about the function , I need to do better .
Here ’s the result for the divisibility order :
Here we have the same thing , except that “ ~n ” now means “ divisible by n “ .
Again , I need to extend my functions to the pseudo - numbers .
I can still map everything to the bottom element ( in this case , “ ~1 ” ) , but this throws away any partial information I may have been keeping .
Finally , one more option .
This corresponds to a partial order on an equivalence class , sort of like what came out of the perfect squares example .
This one , though , is the trivial equivalence class that lumps everything together .
The result is the strict natural numbers , in which I must know the entire number to get any information out of any ( non-constant ) function .
Here only a constant function could do anything except map ~0 back to ~0 .
Therefore , unless your function is constant , the only way to get any information back from your input is to know the precise value of the input .
This is an important arrangement of the natural numbers because for efficiency reasons , in the particular case of integers , this is precisely what all real programming languages do .
We ’re just using natural numbers as an example , though ; the ideas here apply equally well to more complex structures where laziness exists .
It turns out , now , that once we ’ve chosen a partial order for the pseudo - numbers , there is sometimes a best possible way to extend any function over the naturals to include pseudo - numbers .
To determine the value of any function f at ~n , we ’d like to find the greatest lower bound of f(x ) for all x ≥ ~n .
Now if the partial order we chose happens to be something called a complete meet - semilattice ( all of the orders we ’ve talked about are ) , then that greatest lower bound exists .
Connections to Programming Languages
As you may have guessed by now by my occasional references , this is all connected to laziness of functions in programming languages .
I had intended to write about that now , but this has gotten too long already , so I am instead going to stop here and finish the other half at a later time .
Hope you enjoyed it !
SimCity has just been released as free software under the GPL version 3 license ( though the name has been changed to Micropolis for trademark reasons ; it was the original working title ) .
This was precipitated by the inclusion of SimCity on the One Laptop Per Child XO machines , but no reason the kids should have all the fun .
Can't wait to see the SimCity hacks that emerge now :
The " MicropolisCore " project includes the latest Micropolis ( SimCity ) source code , cleaned up and recast into C++ classes , integrated into Python , using the wonderful SWIG interface generator tool .
It also includes a Cairo based TileEngine , and a cellular automata machine CellEngine , which are independent but can be plugged together , so the tile engine can display cellular automata cells as well as SimCity tiles , or any other application 's tiles .
The key thing here is to peek inside the mind of the original Maxis programmers when they built it .
Remember , this was back in the day when games had to fit inside of 640 k so some " creative " programming techniques were employed .
SimCity has been long a model used for urban planning and while it 's just a game , there are a lot of business rules , ecosystem modeling , social dependencies , and other cool stuff going on in this codebase .
It may not be pretty code but it 's content sure is interesting to see .
In any case , it 's out there for you to grab and have fun with .
It was originally written in C and of course is old ( created before 1983 which is ancient in Internet time ) .
Don spent a lot of time cleaning the code up ( including ANSIfying it , reformatting it , optimizing , and bullet - proofing it ) as best he could .
Don ported the Mac version of SimCity to SunOS Unix running the NeWS window system about 15 years ago , writing the user interface in PostScript .
A year or so later he ported it to various versions of Unix running X - Windows , using the TCL / Tk scripting language and gui toolkit .
Several years later when Linux became viable , it was fairly straightforward to port that code to Linux , and then to port that to the OLPC .

AUSTIN , Texas –
They came expecting a civilized , one - on - one discussion , but they got what some attendees described as " a train wreck . "
Ballroom A of the Austin Convention Center was packed to capacity Sunday evening for an hour - long interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , the keynote speaker at this year 's South by Southwest Interactive festival .
The 23 - year - old billionaire founder of the social networking site was interviewed on stage by author and journalist Sarah Lacy .
Using her unique , friendly style of interviewing – closer to two friends chatting than a straight question - and - answer session – Lacy tried to get the notoriously tight - lipped Zuckerberg to open up .
But the discussion rarely strayed beyond the usual business fare and eventually descended into a string of awkward moments punctuated by the audience 's heckling .
" Talk about something interesting , " one attendee yelled about halfway through the keynote .
The remark was met with waves of cheering and applause .
Meanwhile , members of the audience participated in a back - channel discussion on Twitter , with users of the microblogging site directing most of their animosity at Lacy 's unorthodox interview technique .
" Never , ever have I seen such a train wreck of an interview , " said Jason Pontin on Twitter .
" Poor girl , flirtatiously awful tho ' she was . "
A quick search for " Zuckerberg " on Twitter search service Tweetscan reveals hundreds of posts written by those who witnessed the disastrous interview .
After some more shouted remarks , Lacy turned the microphones over to the members of the audience , challenging them to come up with better questions .
Attendees rushed to the microphones and got right to it , asking Zuckerberg about privacy and data portability , and requesting tools to help manage the growing flood of information on their Facebook profiles .
Blogger Robert Scoble offered his observations over Twitter : " The audience is asking Zuckerburg better questions than Lacy did . "
Her attempt at a friendly interview derailed , Lacy retreated to the role of moderator .
At least one heckler thought the backlash was because of Lacy 's gender instead of her questions .
MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier , who twittered a few swipes against Lacy during the talk , told Wired.com after the keynote that Lacy 's gender might have been behind the reaction of the geeky masses .
" I think there 's some degree of sexism , " he said .
" Because she 's a chick , her ingratiating nature is taken as ass - kissing .
If it were some guy at Forbes asking the same questions in the same manner , we just would have thought he was drawing Mark out . "
There were some eye - opening moments during the talk , like when Zuckerberg addressed the issue of Beacon , Facebook 's advertising platform that launched to much controversy when media outlets decried it as an invasion of privacy .
" We probably got a little ahead of ourselves , " Zuckerberg admitted .
He talked about Yahoo's bid for Facebook , confirming publicly for the first time the $ 1 billion offer price .
Zuckerberg also touched on Microsoft 's investment in his company and fielded questions about the site 's application platform .
Zuckerberg largely stuck to the same script throughout the interview , repeating the same phrases multiple times and falling back on platitudes – often to comical effect .
Switching gears ,
Lacy began telling stories about Zuckerberg ( more than a few of which alluded to her book , which will be published later this year ) in an attempt to get him to loosen up .
" You 're supposed to ask questions , " he said .
The audience erupted in a sustained cheer as Lacy tried in vain to quiet the mob .
After the interview , Lacy vented her frustration on her own post to Twitter .
" Seriously screw all you guys .
I did my best to ask a range of things , " she said .
Conference attendees were still buzzing about the free - for - all keynote hours later .
" It was the most brilliant thing ever , " a young man said after describing the scene to a friend on his mobile phone .
He continued to chuckle as he walked into a panel discussion , appropriately enough , about internet gossip .

The digital revolution in music has made the future of album cover art somewhat uncertain .
Some say this art form will gradually disappear or at least be relegated to a secondary role , losing all of its importance as an integral part of the whole music experience .
But what is certain is that during the decades when the album covers still were tangible , the visual art that accompanied the music has been a fundamental element which has served as a visible representation of the albums acoustic content .
The covers have also functioned as a type of calling card for musicians , and the bands – especially the most transgressor ones – have always known how to use this resource to grab public ’s and media ’s attention , to shock … or simply just to warn everyone about the music the cover holds .
The list of the censured album covers is endless , but for now we ’ll concentrate exclusively on the most sinister ones .
The Beatles were the first to provoke their fans with a harsh photography – which by the way is kind of hard to understand if you keep in mind that the album contained all those sweet and lovely Let It Be - like songs .
Well , since The Beatles a lot of blood and barbarity has accompanied albums of every possible musical genre out there , although , as you ’ll soon see , there ’s no doubt that Metal is the one with a clearest tendency to create sometimes terribly twisted cover art .
It ’s by no means difficult to find extreme album covers , but if what you ’re looking for is singularity , it becomes a lot more complicated .
The criteria we used for the following ranking was based on the cover ’s originality and historic and artistic value .
It ’s been done with heart and soul , after long debate and numerous , hot - headed conversations .
To gather information our primary resource has been the internet along with some specialized magazines , but we also had some valuable help from some competent experts – like our friend Razor , a true connoisseur of Metal culture , who we would like to give a big shout out to here .
A special thanks goes also to Malou , Patxi and Kiwi for helping with the translation .
13 . The Beatles : Yesterday and today , 1966
This Beatles album , also known as the “ Butcher ” album , came out just shortly after John Lennon claimed the band was bigger than Jesus .
This controversial statement had already sparked a firestorm of reaction in the United States , and the release of Yesterday And Today made the angry conservative moralists even angrier .
The cover shows the four mop heads wearing butcher ’s smocks bloodied by cuts of raw beef and heads of dismembered dolls .
The album was pulled from distribution the very day it was released , which of course made it a prized rarity for collectors .
Although the cover ’s impact has without a doubt lost some of its original impact in the course of time , we think it deserves to be number 13 on our list for being such an important precursor .
The fact that Beatles chose to make an album cover this macabre is still confusing – just look at the face of George Harrison if you disagree .
12 . Scorpions : Virgin Killer , 1977
The German edition of Scorpions ’ Virgin Killer features a naked twelve - year - old girl in a very suggestive pose .
Her genitals are barely covered by a glass fragment , which makes quite a clear allusion to her lost virginity .
The sleeve was considered to be child pornography and was substituted with a vulgar photo of the band .
11 . Slayer :
God hate us all , 2001
We could n’t have left out of our extreme list the group that has been so consistently condemned , particularly in the form of censure , by the conservative forces in American society .
We are talking about Slayer of course , the leader of the American thrash metal movement , who already generated criticism , boycotts and lawsuits in the ‘ 80s with the cover art of Reign in Blood and South of Heaven .
It seems that with their 2001 release God hates us all , the band decided to get back to the good ol ’ satanic aesthetics : the sleeve depicts a bloody Bible with an upside - down pentagram spiked with nails in it .
As it can be expected , WalMart and many other retail outlets did n’t quite like the cover ’s spirit , and anticipating trouble a ‘ cover of the cover ’ was made to disguise the actual artwork we are showing here .
While we ’re talking about Slayer and covers , a detail on the sleeve of Christ Illusion made us wonder if Mother Teresa has never before been seen in such a macabre situation …
10 . Burzum : Aske , 1995
The grindcore groups ’ twisted competition about who had the most grotesque and impressive album cover got more and more deadly serious with the influence of the gore genre in movies .
This religion - like tendency started with Reek of Putrefaction from Carcass – number two on our list – and took a radical turn in 1993 with the EP Aske from the Norwegian Black Metal group Burzum .
The sleeve , which makes a clear declaration of intentions , features the ruins of “ Fantoftkirke ” , a church burnt down by the band ’s lead singer in 1992 .
It was n’t the first torched church , nor the last : during the next four years , 22 churches , some of them medieval , were burnt to the ground in Norway .
9. Pabellón Psiquiátrico : La primera en la frente , 1987
This spine - chilling album cover comes from Spanish group Pabellón Psiquiátrico ( Psychiatric Pavilion ) .
The guy with the machine - gun in his mouth is the lead singer Juan Antonio “ Patuchas ” Canta , who was known for his surrealistic lyrics like the one of the popular summer hit “ La Danza de los 40 Limones ” ( Dance of the 40 Lemons ) .
That hot summer of 1987 few could predict the sad destiny of the album cover ’s protagonist .
“ Patuchas ” committed suicide nine years later at the age of 30 .
8. Exhumed : Exhumed , 1998
Welcome to the Exhumed ’s flesh feast !
In this cover the gore - obsessed band has used all necessary means to create a maximum splatter experience to accompany the listening of the album .
Although the cover ’s scene is not real , the bizarre artwork , with the bloody chainsaw close - up and the head in the microwave , makes it worthy of mentioning .
All in all , it is a true delicacy for lovers of Ruggero Deodato ’s Cannibal Holocaust .
7. Pungent Stench : Been Caught Buttering , 1991
It took two long years of Kafkaesque bureaucratic procedures for an American photographer Joel - Peter Witkin to obtain a permission for a one - day photo - shoot in a morgue in México City .
The result can be seen in this Pungent Stench album cover from the year 1991 .
Of all the body parts Witkin saw that day , he was especially interested in a bisected head .
The photographer set up the tripod and loaded the camera with film , but he could n’t really figure out how to create the composition he was looking for .
After spending a day thinking of that severed head , he finally came to the conclusion that sometimes the two - piece puzzles are the most difficult ones .
That simple conclusion made him create one of his most famous work , The Kiss .
6. Cannibal Corpse : Butchered at Birth , 1991
It is mentioned in the highly recommended documentary “ Metal : A Headbanger ’s Journey ” , that almost every single one of the Cannibal Corpse ’s covers have been censured .
The covers ’ illustrations are known for their peculiar , unique style loved by band ’s fans .
As the lead singer George“ Corpsegrinder ” Fisher puts it : “ it ’s art , just look at it as art .
Yeah , it ’s disgusting … but go to the Vatican and look at some of the art there .
That ’s real , that ’s representing something that ’s real , that could happen .
This [ artwork ] , you know , that ’s never going to happen … ”
It was n’t an easy task to choose which Cannibal Corpse cover should we honour on our Top 13 list .
Tomb of the Mutilated was a great contender , but it was Butchered at Birth that finally made it .
The truth is that all of the covers would have fitted perfectly in this macabre position .
If you want to take a closer look at these censured covers , you should definitely check the excellent Cannibal Corpse monograph at Sleevage .
5. Christian Death : Sex , Drugs and Jesus Christ , 1988
The most recent polemic Christian Death ’s album cover was the one of the Pornographic Messiah , which featured Christ having wild doggy style sex .
However , the band ’s first – and by so far the most plain - spoken – iconoclastic attack against Jesus Christ ’s figure was made back in 1988 when the album Sex , Drugs and Jesus Christ came out .
The cover shows an explicit photograph of Christ shooting heroin while piously looking up towards the sky .
We suppose it goes without saying that the cover was immediately censured in United States and substituted with a far more softer one .
Without the participation of Rozz Williams , Valor Kand and Gitane Demone launched with this godless cover what was about to be one of their best albums .
4. Cripple Bastards : Almost Human , 1999
Cripple Bastards ’ grind core is n’t maybe the most remarkable in the extreme music fiend .
However there ’s one thing that has grabbed as well the critics ’ as the specialized audience ’s attention ever since their debut in 1999 , and that is the album cover featured above .
The highly controversial sleeve features a violent blowjob scene taken from a pornographic gore flick ” Forced Entry ” , today considered a cult classic among underground film cinephiles ( check out the trailer here ) .
And why would someone choose to use a photo of a girl forced to a blowjob at gunpoint as an album cover ?
The band explains that there ’s a clear the relation between the title and the blowjob pic : “ the basic idea was human insensitivity , the progressive decay of feelings and emotions in modern man ’s ethics , in few words .. the loss of humanity of humans in the contemporary world (…)
The title ‘ Almost human ’ gives a sense to that cover art .
If someone reads the CB lyrics one by one they ’ll certainly get a clear idea of what it ’s all about and will certainly figure out that the cover of our CD is obviously NOT meant to inspire rape , sexual control or sexism of any form .
(…)
The “ Almost human ” CD is all about giving a portrait of human degradation , insensibility , feelings and naturalness being castrated by a hallucinating reality of abuse , indifference , resignation ” .
3. Brujería : Matando Güeros , 1993
The Mexican death - grind band Brujería ( a Spanish word meaning “ witchcraft ” ) decided to illustrate their first long play with this photo taken from Mexican newspaper Alarma , although there are also rumours that the head on the photo belonged to a victim of the band ’s satanic sacrifices .
They gave an indication on what was to come with the cover of the single Machetazos , but it is definitely the cover of Matando Güeros they will be remembered for .
Evidently it was banned – by covering the photo with a black paper board – but word had already gotten around and many bought the album just because they were probably dying to know if the music was as brutal as the cover .
2. Carcass : Reek of Putrefaction , 1988
The debut album of English Death Metal group Carcass has without a doubt one of the most repulsive covers ever made .
It was the band ’s record label Earache which encouraged them to make a cover as intense as possible , and that ’s why it is somewhat strange that the CD version was later illustrated with a lot less controversial artwork .
The design was made by an agency called Gruesome Graphics , behind which was the group ’s vocalist and bass player Jeff Walker , who also did the cover of Nappalm Death ’s Scum .
The sleeve ’s collage consists of autopsy photos taken from medical journals .
Although the details are deeply disgusting , they are carefully put together in order to construct a captivating collage .
As Lasse Margaug describes in Wire Magazine ( 282/2007 ) : “ … it reaches the level of absurdism and deconstruction ; placing it closer to the tradition of dada , Stan Brakhage , Hermann Nitsch and Damien Hirst than the usual teenage Metal sensationalism ” .
Knowing that Carcass were a vegan group with strong roots in the punk scene , you can also interpret the cover as a clear ‘ meat is murder ’ statement .
Great cover , great album !
1. Mayhem : Dawn of the black hearts , 1991
The most macabre album cover in music history certainly deserves its number one position on our list – not so much for the obvious brutality of its photo as for the dreadful story behind it .
Dead , the vocalist of Norwegian black metal group Mayhem , killed himself with a shotgun and a knife .
When the other band members found him dead at his home , they decided to take some photos of their late friend .
Some rumours say they did n’t just do that , but was also bone pendants made from Dead ’s skull .
The person most responsible for this dark photo session was the group ’s guitarist , Euronymous .
He was friends with Mauricio “ Bull Metal ” Montoya , the founding member of Columbian Death group Masacre and the owner of the record label Warmasters Records .
It is said to have been his idea to use the photo of the late vocalist ’s corpse as a sleeve of Dawn of the Black Hearts , a live bootleg which was originally limited to 300 copies but has later on been reissued countless of times .

Print This Email This Hillary Clinton 's campaign called a Barack Obama adviser 's comparison of Bill Clinton to Joseph McCarthy , and another Obama aide 's off - color joke about " Monica 's blue dress " examples of the " gutter tactics " that is not in line with the kind of campaign Obama says he is running .
On a conference call with reporters Monday , Clinton spokesmen Howard Wolfson and Phil Singer lashed out at Obama and his aides , while continuing to attack their opponent 's credentials and simultaneously demurring when asked about questionable comparisons from figures close to Clinton .
" The Obama campaign is being fueled by insults and slander , " Singer told reporters .
When Bill Clinton spoke to veterans in North Carolina over the weekend and said it " would be great " to have an election between " two people who loved this country " -- referring to Hillary Clinton and John McCain -- an adviser to Barack Obama likened the comments to McCarthyism .
The comparison of the former Democratic president to the Red Scare - stoking former Republican Congressman was too much for the Clinton camp , especially coming from an Obama campaign that has pledged to pursue a new form of politics .
" It 's not the campaign that Sen . Obama says he 's running , " Wolfson said , accusing Obama of a concerted effort to go negative after losses in Ohio and Texas this month .
Clinton 's camp has argued she won those primaries -- ending an 12 - straight losing streak -- because voters decided Obama had not yet passed the " Commander in Chief test . "
" They clearly made a decision that they cannot address those concerns in a positive way , so rather than build Sen .
Obama up they have chosen to tear Sen. Clinton down , " he said .
As any close observer is aware , politics is often a dirty business , and the Clinton campaign has not been immune from its share of dust-ups .
These include Geraldine Ferraro 's intimation that Obama 's success is based on his race to James Carville 's juxtaposition of Bill Richardson 's Obama endorsement and Judas 's betrayal of Jesus Christ .
Wolfson said the campaign did not agree with Carville 's assessment , but a reporter had to ask three times before getting a response as to whether Bill Clinton 's former campaign manager should apologize for the crack .
" If I had said it , I would apologize , " Wolfson said , repeating his denunciation of Obama adviser Gen.
Tony McPeak for " calling Bill Clinton Joe McCarthy . "
The former president was speaking at a VFW hall in North Carolina last Friday when he said : " I think it would be a great thing if we had an election year where you had two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interest of this country .
And people could actually ask themselves who is right on these issues , instead of all this other stuff that always seems to intrude itself on our politics . "
Clinton 's campaign quickly tried to shot down the accusation that Clinton was questioning Obama 's patriotism .
Before that clarification , McPeak , a former Clinton administration official , said he was disappointed in his onetime boss .
" It sounds more like McCarthy .
I grew up , I was going to college when Joe McCarthy was accusing good Americans of being traitors , so I 've had enough of it , " he said .
DEVELOPING ...
The fall of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer holds many lessons , and the press will surely be examining them in coming months .
But do n't expect the press corps to delve into the biggest lesson of all -- its own role as his enabler .
Journalists have spent the past two days asking how a man of Mr. Spitzer 's stature would allow himself to get involved in a prostitution ring .
The answer , in my mind , is clear .
The former New York attorney general never believed normal rules applied to him , and his view was validated time and again by ...

For the first time in history , more than one in every 100 American adults is in jail or prison , according to a new report tracking the surge in inmate population and urging states to rein in corrections costs with alternative sentencing programs .
The report , released Thursday by the Pew Center on the States , said the 50 states spent more than $ 49 billion on corrections last year , up from less than $ 11 billion 20 years earlier .
The rate of increase for prison costs was six times greater than for higher education spending , the report said .
Using updated state - by - state data , the report said 2,319,258 adults were held in U.S. prisons or jails at the start of 2008 – one out of every 99.1 adults , and more than any other country in the world .
The steadily growing inmate population “ is saddling cash - strapped states with soaring costs they can ill afford and failing to have a clear impact either on recidivism or overall crime , ” said the report .
Susan Urahn , managing director of the Pew Center on the States , said budget woes are prompting officials in many states to consider new , cost - saving corrections policies that might have been shunned in the recent past for fear of appearing soft in crime .
“ We ’re seeing more and more states being creative because of tight budgets , ” she said in an interview .
“ They want to be tough on crime , they want to be a law - and - order state – but they also want to save money , and they want to be effective . ”
The report cited Kansas and Texas as states which have acted decisively to slow the growth of their inmate population .
Their actions include greater use of community supervision for low - risk offenders and employing sanctions other than re-imprisonment for ex-offenders who commit technical violations of parole and probation rules .
“ The new approach , born of bipartisan leadership , is allowing the two states to ensure they have enough prison beds for violent offenders while helping less dangerous lawbreakers become productive , taxpaying citizens , ” the report said .
According to the report , the inmate population increased last year in 36 states and the federal prison system .
The largest percentage increase – 12 percent – was in Kentucky , where Gov. Steve Beshear highlighted the cost of corrections in his budget speech last month .
He noted that the state ’s crime rate had increased only about 3 percent in the past 30 years , while the state ’s inmate population has increased by 600 percent .
The Pew report was compiled by the Center on the State ’s Public Safety Performance Project , which is working directly with 13 states on developing programs to divert offenders from prison without jeopardizing public safety .
“ For all the money spent on corrections today , there has n’t been a clear and convincing return for public safety , ” said the project ’s director , Adam Gelb .
“ More and more states are beginning to rethink their reliance on prisons for lower - level offenders and finding strategies that are tough on crime without being so tough on taxpayers . ”
The report said prison growth and higher incarceration rates do not reflect a parallel increase in crime or in the nation ’s overall population .
Instead , it said , more people are behind bars mainly because of tough sentencing measures , such as “ three - strikes ” laws , that result in longer prison stays .
“ For some groups , the incarceration numbers are especially startling , ” the report said .
“ While one in 30 men between the ages of 20 and 34 is behind bars , for black males in that age group the figure is one in nine . ”
The nationwide figures , as of Jan. 1 , include 1,596,127 people in state and federal prisons and 723,131 in local jails – a total 2,319,258 out of almost 230 million American adults .
The report said the United States is the world ’s incarceration leader , far ahead of more populous China with 1.5 million people behind bars .
It said the U.S. also is the leader in inmates per capita ( 750 per 100,000 people ) , ahead of Russia ( 628 per 100,000 ) and other former Soviet bloc nations which make up the rest of the Top 10 .
Hillary bests Obama in third quarter fundraising , though Obama maintains edge overall
Sen. Hillary Clinton bested Sen. Barack Obama in third quarter fundraising for 2008 's Democratic primaries , raising $ 27 million to Obama 's $ 20 million , which he reported yesterday .
Clinton has 100,000 new donors , according to her filing .
Obama had 93,000 .
But Obama still maintains a slim lead in overall fundraising , his total being $ 75 million to Clinton 's $ 73 .
Yesterday , Obama 's campaign immediately styled the figures as a slap to many pundits who have already predicted Clinton will coast to the Democratic nomination .
" Many in Washington have spent the last weeks declaring the outcome of this race to be pre-ordained , and the primary process a mere formality , " said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe .
" Yet , in this quarter alone , 93,000 more Americans joined our campaign , because they desire real change and believe Barack Obama is the one candidate who can deliver it . "
A further one million dollars raised by Obama in the period , can be used only in the general election next year , if he wins the Democratic nomination .
Quarterly fundraising figures are a closely watched barometer of the presidential race , offering hints on a candidate 's popularity , and capacity to buy crucial television advertising and wage a long nominating campaign .
Leading Republicans had also to officially announce the fruits of their latest campaign financing drives , though Republicans have lagged far behind their Democratic counterparts .

PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti —
U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti say they are battling an image of fear that is keeping the Caribbean nation mired in hunger and disease , with little hope of attracting foreign visitors and investment .
Forbes magazine has named Haiti one of the world ’s 10 most dangerous destinations , along with Iraq , Afghanistan and Somalia .
The Associated Press has called Port - au - Prince the kidnapping capital of the Americas .
The U.S. government maintains a perpetual travel warning on Haiti , while diplomats , journalists and aid workers spend much of their time holed up in fortified hotels .
The image stems largely from two violent years after the 2004 U.S. ouster of President Jean - Bertrand Aristide when the slums of Port - au - Prince erupted in gunbattles between gangs , Haitian police and U.N. peacekeepers , plus a wave of kidnappings .
Today , Haiti ’s reputation is undeserved , say security analysts and officials from the U.N. peacekeeping mission .
They argue that Haiti is no more violent than any other Latin American country .
“ It ’s a big myth , ” said Fred Blaise , spokesman for the U.N. police force in Haiti .
“ Port - au - Prince is no more dangerous than any big city .
You can go to New York and get pickpocketed and held at gunpoint . ”
Reliable statistics are scarce in Haiti , but U.N. data indicate that the country could be among the safest in the region .
The U.N. peacekeeping mission recorded 487 homicides in Haiti last year , or about 5.6 per 100,000 people .
A U.N. - World Bank study last year estimated the Caribbean ’s average homicide rate at 30 per 100,000 , with Jamaica registering nearly nine times as many — 49 homicides per 100,000 people — as those recorded by the United Nations in Haiti .
In 2006 , the neighboring Dominican Republic notched more than four times more homicides per capita than those registered in Haiti : 23.6 per 100,000 , according to the Central American Observatory on Violence .
Even the United States would appear to have a higher homicide rate : 5.7 per 100,000 in 2006 , according to the U.S. Justice Department .
“ There is not a large amount of violence [ in Haiti ] , ” said Gen. Jose Elito Carvalho Siquiera , the former Brazilian commander of the U.N. military force in Haiti .
“ If you compare the levels of poverty here with those of Sao Paolo [ Brazil ] or other cities , there is more violence there than here . ”
The U.N. peacekeeping mission , known as Minustah , arrived in Haiti in June 2004 , three months after U.S. troops whisked Mr. Aristide into exile amid an armed rebellion .
The U.S. - backed interim government then waged a campaign against Mr. Aristide ’s supporters , igniting two years of gunfights in Port - au - Prince ’s slums .
A wave of kidnappings also swept panic through the capital .
From 2005 until 2006 , Minustah registered 1,356 kidnappings .
Kidnappings have become common in many Latin American countries , but were rare in Haiti before Mr. Aristide ’s ouster .
“ The kidnappings shocked everyone because they had n’t happened in the past , ” said Mr. Blaise , the U.N. police spokesman .
“ Still , when you compare the number of kidnappings here , I do n’t think it ’s more than anywhere else . ”
Security improved markedly last year .
The number of kidnappings dropped by nearly 70 percent , and the U.N. peacekeeping mission wrested control of Port - au - Prince ’s battle - torn slums from armed groups .
President Rene Preval , elected in a landslide in February 2006 , has mollified Haiti ’s political opposition .
Gunshots are now seldom heard in Port - au - Prince .
Violent crime in the countryside has always been rare .
Attacks on foreigners are few and far between , and in recent months American Airlines flights from Miami to the capital have been packed with Christian missionaries and aid workers .
Even when the instability was at its peak , observers say , violence usually was limited to a few Port - au - Prince slums .
“ If you compare Haiti to Iraq , to Afghanistan , to Rwanda , we do n’t even appear on the same scale , ” said Patrick Elie , who heads a government commission studying the creation of a new security force .
“ We ’ve had a tumultuous history , that is true , one characterized by political instability , ” said Mr. Elie .
“ But except for the war that we had to wage to obtain our freedom and independence from the French , Haiti has never known a level of violence comparable to that which has been waged in Europe , in America and the European countries in Africa and Asia .
Our country has been one of the least violent . ”
Viva Rio , a Brazilian - based violence reduction group that came to Haiti at the request of the U.N. mission ’s disarmament program , has found Port - au - Prince ’s armed groups more receptive than those in Rio de Janeiro ’s slums .
Last March , the organization persuaded warring gangs in Bel Air and neighboring downtown slums to sign a peace treaty , in which they swore to abstain from violence in exchange for youth scholarships .
Since then , the area has been peaceful .
“ This would be unthinkable in Rio , ” said Rubem Cesar Fernandes , Viva Rio ’s director .
The humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders classified the “ raging violence ” in Port - au - Prince as one of the world ’s 10 most underreported stories in 2006 .
Even then , only one of every 10 patients at its trauma hospital was the victim of a bullet wound .
Most had been injured in car crashes and domestic accidents .
“ It ’s not the insecurity , not the bullets , not the conflict between gangs and police , ” said Yann Libessart , the former head of the Doctors Without Borders mission .
“ What ’s killing people in Haiti is not being able to give birth to a baby in a hospital or not having access to medical care because they do n’t have enough money to pay . ”
While the international community has made security the priority , the dominant concern for most poor Haitians is the rising cost of food .
The prices of staples such as rice and beans have nearly doubled in the past three years , a devastating trend in a country where about 80 percent of the population earns less than $ 2 a day .
“ Our problem is n’t violence , ” said Yvner Meneide , an artisan living in downtown Port - au - Prince .
“ If we were violent , we would organize demonstrations every day , we would be destroying things .
But the Haitian people are very moderate .
We might be hungry , but we are calm . ”

How to get drunk at the airport / Can you make an airport bomb from chocolate , iPod wire and port wine ?
Passing through the cute , harmless , relatively tiny Spokane airport on the way back to the goodly San Francisco bubble after spending a week and change up in the Pacific Northwest with the family for the holidays , entering the security checkpoint and of course doing my all - American duty and basically taking off all my clothes so as to help protect my country because , you know , it 's Spokane .
Islamo - fascist terrorists really hate Spokane .
Off came the jacket and the belt and the boots and the jewelry and out came the laptop and into about five plastic bins went everything , all the while figuring I 'd zip right through , given how careful I 'd been in my carry - on packing , nothing to raise any alarms and nothing to cause any sort of delay , no liquids and no lotions and no Astroglide travel packs and this time I even had the foresight to remove the tiny 1 - inch Leatherman Squirt from my keychain ( my third one — I keep forgetting ) because everyone knows how easy it would be to hijack a goddamn jetliner by , say , threatening to give the pilot a really awful pedicure with that badass 1 - inch nail file .
Except , oh holy hell no , something 's amiss , they need to inspect my bag , probably something weird showing up in the scanner with my camera gear or the various rechargeable battery packs or maybe the handmade candles I 'd received as a gift or ... well , it 's airport security .
Who the hell knows what it could be .
And suddenly , I saw it .
The port .
Oh holy dammit , that 's right .
Last minute of my of packing , I 'd switched the new , sealed 375 - milliliter bottle of 16 - year - old vintage port wine from my checked suitcase over to my carry - on due to concern for the former 's overall weight , somehow completely blocking out the no-liquids thing and despite all my careful packing and awareness just prior .
My hand went to my forehead , and slapped .
Idiot .
The security guard carried the bottle over to me , shaking his head , but in a nice way .
" Sorry , this ca n't go . "
No kidding .
Damn .
What a waste .
I pondered my options : Lots of time before my flight , but no real way to check the bottle , no way to ship it to myself , and I was n't about to call the sister who'd dropped me at the airport and was now well on her way to Seattle and who did n't even drink alcohol to tell her to come back to pick up a small bottle of really good booze , just so I did n't have to toss it .
I was ready to suggest the security guy take the port home and have a lovely new year , ready to extol the virtues of this particular not - at - all inexpensive Krohn 1991 vintage and say it was n't no cheap swill , that he should maybe light a fire and sip it carefully after dinner and would n't that be nice , when he said the words I did n't expect to hear .
" You want to go have a few sips before you come back through ? "
Wait , what ?
I paused .
This was cute little Spokane airport .
There were no bars back down by the entrance , no restaurants or even little cafes ( the few the airport had were all up beyond security ) , nothing but a sterile , bare - bones baggage claim and a handful of ticket counters back where he was gesturing and , beyond that , 19 degrees of bitter cold winter .
" But there 's no bar down there , " I stammered , momentarily confused and momentarily trying to be some sort of upstanding , law - abiding citizen .
Or something .
" You mean I can just swig an open container of booze out in the open ?
I do n't need to be in some sort of designated bar area ? "
Duh .
He looked at me curiously , like I 'd just returned from the jungles of Malaysia and had clearly lost all sense of how civilized society functioned .
Then he shrugged , and smiled .
" I do n't think that matters .
Up to you . "
It was 11 a.m. I had two egg salad sandwiches , some spelt pretzels , a small bag of gourmet chocolate mints , a well - loaded iPod , a laptop .
And an hour and a half .
I did n't ponder for long .
" Well hell , OK then . "
I strolled back around and back down to the baggage claim area , found a seat in a quiet , empty corner , got comfortable , opened the first sandwich and peeled the foil from the port , popped the cork , and glanced around .
Horrible fluorescent lighting , random airport stragglers , assorted families picking up or dropping off , baby strollers and assorted screams and yelps and car horns and no one really caring about much of anything in the calm after the holiday storm .
I took my first big swig , and proceeded to enjoy one of the stranger , warmer , fuzzier late - morning lunches I 've had in awhile .
It was pretty good port .
At least , for 11 a.m. on a Saturday in an airport baggage claim .
Dark , fruity , sticky and chocolatey and thick like murky dreams .
After about the fifth sip , I had the profound insight that I was sharing this surreal moment with roughly one million other travelers worldwide who had equally ( or rather , likely far more ) obnoxious , annoying , unusual airport security tales to tell , from the profound to the silly to the stupid .
I recalled the story on the Associated Press newswires just before Christmas about the 64 - year - old German genius who , furious at having his bottle of vodka yanked from his carry - on in a Nuremberg airport , decided to chug the entire bottle right there in line , thus guaranteeing himself a trip to the emergency room , permanent liver damage and charming international headlines .
Also , the tale I 'd heard from my own mother of her friend who was returning from a vacation in Italy , a new bottle of limoncello lemon liqueur in her carry - on , and was stopped at a Milan airport checkpoint .
Rather than toss the bottle , she headed for the nearest place available to enjoy a sip or two — the airport restroom .
In the restroom , she saw another woman standing over the sink , shaking , breathing heavily , trying to calm her nerves .
The woman was , it turns out , terrified of flying .
Limoncello was promptly proffered , gratefully accepted .
And so , for a few minutes , there they stood , chatting , laughing , drinking most of the bottle , the latter woman 's nerves sufficiently marinated until she could fly and the former 's sufficiently entertained so she'd have a tale to tell of the limoncello that never made it back home but that might have very well saved someone 's sanity .
Wishing to remain upright and mostly coherent , I did n't finish my bottle .
An elderly Spokanite sat down not far from me and I turned to him , asked if he was a fan of port wine .
He looked at me oddly , said he'd never tried it before .
I explained what it was , and my situation , showed him the half bottle remaining , told him this was premium stuff and might he like to take the rest home and kick back and perhaps sip a couple glasses after dinner with the wife in front of the fire and have an even happier new year ?
" Well sure , " he said .
" I 'll try some of that .
What the hell .
Thanks very much . "
And lo , the world shrinks , the year is off to a good start , and the terrorists lose again .

( idestroy ) there 's a facebook group " who pooped on the stairs "
Here 's a question for you , and maybe you 'd like to ask your Senators this one , too :
What exactly does this FISA bill authorize in the way of domestic surveillance ?
I 've been wondering this myself -- literally to myself -- but Declan McCullagh has done us all the favor of writing it down :
Although most of the attention has focused on how the Senate bill might offer telecommunications service providers retroactive immunity ( and derail the lawsuits against AT&T ) , the actual language appears to cover physical intrusions too : ASSISTANCE -- The term ' assistance ' means the provision of , or the provision of access to , information ... facilities , or another form of assistance PERSON -- The term ' person ' means ... a landlord , custodian , or other person who may be authorized and required to furnish assistance ...
IN GENERAL -- Notwithstanding any other provision of law , no civil action may lie or be maintained in a Federal or State court against any person for providing assistance to an element of the intelligence community , and shall be promptly dismissed , if the Attorney General certifies to the court that ... any assistance by that person was provided pursuant to a directive under sections 102 ( a ) ( 4 ) , 105B ( e ) ...
ELEMENT OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY -- The term ' element of the intelligence community ' means an element of the intelligence community as specified or designated under section 3 ( 4 ) of the National Security Act ... [ Ed. Note :
That includes the FBI , CIA , NSA , Homeland Security , the Defense Department , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , the State Department , the Treasury Department , and any other agency the president chooses . ]
Let 's translate that .
A hotel manager who lets FBI agents into a guest 's room to copy a laptop 's hard drive in secret would not be liable .
An apartment manager who gives Homeland Security the key to a tenant 's unit to place a key logger in a PC would not be liable .
A private security firm that divulges a customer 's alarm code would not be liable .
A university that agrees to forward a student 's e-mail messages to the Defense Department would not be liable .
An antivirus company that helps the NSA implant spyware in an unsuspecting customer 's computer would not be liable .
No court order is required .
And if an eventual lawsuit accuses the hotel manager or antivirus firm of unlawful activities , it 'll be thrown out of court as long as the attorney general or the director of national intelligence can provide a " certification . "
The " certification " is , of course , secret -- all a judge may say publicly is that the rules were followed , and then dismiss the case .
McCullagh follows up by noting , quite correctly , that the bill borrows certain restrictions from the August FISA bill , meant to reduce the risk of " accidentally " snooping on Americans , or on domestic - to - domestic communications .
But when was the last time you trusted this " administration " not to do whatever the hell it felt like doing because " the law " said it could n't ?
We did n't fare all that well under their regime of " National Security Letters , " as I recall .
How much faith do you have in their willingness to play by this rule , even though they never played by that one ?
When we think of the ways in which oxidation contributes to age - related decline , it ’s usually in the context of individual cells :
Throughout the body , oxygen radicals accumulate within cells , perhaps as a result of damage to mitochondria , and these reactive oxygen species in turn wreak havoc throughout the cell .
This happens , certainly , but the picture is incomplete until we take into account the active cellular response to oxidative damage .
Much of this response is beneficial — e.g. , upregulation of antioxidant defenses — but some can be deleterious .
An excellent example of a deleterious response to oxidative damage is provided by Laurent et al. , who describe how a failure in antioxidant defenses ( here the result of knockout of the JunD transcription factor ) causes angiogenesis in the pancreas .
The increase in blood flow causes hyperinsulinemia , which causes downregulation of pro-longevity factors throughout the body :
Oxidative Stress Contributes to Aging by Enhancing Pancreatic Angiogenesis and Insulin Signaling JunD , a transcription factor of the AP - 1 family , protects cells against oxidative stress .
Here , we show that junD− / − mice exhibit features of premature aging and shortened life span .
They also display persistent hypoglycemia due to enhanced insulin secretion .
Consequently , the insulin / IGF - 1 signaling pathways are constitutively stimulated , leading to inactivation of FoxO1 , a positive regulator of longevity .
Hyperinsulinemia most likely results from enhanced pancreatic islet vascularization owing to chronic oxidative stress .
Indeed , accumulation of free radicals in β cells enhances VEGF - A transcription , which in turn increases pancreatic angiogenesis and insulin secretion .
Accordingly , long - term treatment with an antioxidant rescues the phenotype of junD− / − mice .
Indeed , dietary antioxidant supplementation was protective against pancreatic angiogenesis , hyperinsulinemia , and subsequent activation of insulin signaling cascades in peripheral tissues .
Taken together , these data establish a pivotal role for oxidative stress in systemic regulation of insulin and define a key role for the JunD protein in longevity .
One wonders whether chronic hyperinsulinemia might further stress pancreatic beta cells , as cells throughout the body downregulate the insulin response and become insulin resistant , generating a vicious cycle in which even more insulin resistance is required .
Such a mechanism could provide a bridge between oxidation and late - life diabetes , one of the scourges of old age .
French Defence Minister Herve Morin said France , Chad 's former colonial power which has been accused by the rebels of propping up Deby , would remain " neutral " in the conflict in the oil - producing central African state .
But French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner condemned what he called " a brutal attack against an elected and legitimate president " .
He called for a ceasefire and negotiations .
The African Union also condemned the rebels ' entry into N'Djamena and threatened to kick Chad out of the 53 - nation body if they took power .
A French air force plane began evacuating several hundred French and other foreign nationals to Gabon , an official at the French military base in N'Djamena told Reuters .
The US embassy said its non-essential staff and family members would also be evacuated .
Fighting went on during most of the day and residents reported hearing the sound of machine gun , tank and mortar fire .
" The palace looked to be taking the brunt of it ; the palace is only less than a kilometre away , so we could hear and feel the attack here , " Gabriel Stauring of the humanitarian action group Stop Genocide Now told Reuters in an email from N'Djamena .
Stauring , who has also been writing internet blogs , said the Meridien hotel where he and other foreign citizens were sheltering , protected by French troops , had come under fire .
The French marines fought back , he said .
Despite the rebels saying they had taken over the city , a minister of state in Deby 's government , Mahamat Ali Abdallah Nassour , told Radio France International ( RFI ) that Chad 's security forces were " in control in the capital " .
No details of casualties were available .
Saudi-owned Al Arabiya Television reported a bomb had been thrown at the residence of the Saudi ambassador to Chad which killed the wife and daughter of an embassy employee .
Rebel spokesman Abderamane Koullamalah told RFI rebel forces were holding back from taking the presidency complex to allow the French evacuation operation to proceed safely .
" It 's a gesture of good will , " he said .
The rebels had met little resistance as they advanced across the country from the eastern border with Sudan 's Darfur region .
Chad says the rebels are armed and backed by the Sudanese government .
Khartoum routinely denies such accusations .
A Chadian opposition website , Alwihda , said the capital had fallen to the insurgents and added civilians were fleeing the capital towards the border with Cameroon in the south .
Diplomats and residents said it was difficult to tell who controlled the city , where outbreaks of looting were reported .
" We 're watching the ebb and flow of battle , " one diplomat said , adding army soldiers and rebels on foot and in vehicles were moving around the capital .
The AU said Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Congo Republic President Denis Sassou - Nguesso had been asked to monitor the situation in landlocked Chad .
This week 's fighting delayed the imminent deployment of a European Union peacekeeping force to eastern Chad .
The leaders of the Chadian rebels include Timane Erdimi , a former member of Deby 's ruling clan , and Mahamat Nouri , a former defence minister .
They are among several high - level officials who have defected to the rebels in recent years , accusing Deby of ruling like a dictator and favouring his family and friends .
Deby seized power in a revolt from the east in 1990 .
He won elections in 1996 , 2001 and 2006 .

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei could gain from the election
Top election official Ali Reza Afshar said turnout had been " glorious " and higher than in previous polls .
But observers had predicted turnout would not be much above 50 % , perhaps lower in the capital , Tehran .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says the lack of choice among candidates could have discouraged voters .
Voting was extended by five hours so polling stations could cope with the large numbers , officials said .
But polling stations in Tehran were quiet , our correspondent says .
With the field narrowed thanks to the disqualification of reformist candidates , he says the only question is how seats will be shared out between competing conservatives .
IRANIAN POLL Eighth parliamentary election since 1979 revolution 43 million eligible voters 290 seats from 30 provinces About 40 % of those who applied to stand disqualified by the Guardian Council
Analysis : Election foretold Iran in facts and figures
In pictures : Iran votes
The Iranian authorities had called for a big turnout to defy the US and other countries they say are Iran 's enemies .
The election will shape the political map ahead of 2009 's presidential poll .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad flew in from an Islamic summit in Senegal to cast his vote .
He said the world had chosen Iran as its " role model and saviour " .
Real winners
The reformists seem to have given up the fight after many of their candidates were disqualified on the grounds of alleged lack of loyalty to Islamic values , says our correspondent .
It is Iran 's eighth parliamentary poll since its 1979 Islamic revolution
They made up the bulk of about 1,700 candidates barred from running by Iran 's Guardian Council - an unelected body of clerics and jurists that vets election candidates .
The Guardian Council has denied bias .
Analysts expect the poll 's real winners to be former members of the hardline Revolutionary Guards , who could replace the Muslim clergy as the biggest force in the assembly .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could also gain strength if , as forecast , a new younger generation of hard - line loyalists gains positions of power .
Going nuclear
The likely effect of a further increase in conservative self - confidence , our correspondent says , will be even less chance of compromise over Iran 's nuclear programme , and a yet more assertive foreign policy .
It is thought the reformists may struggle to hang on to the 40 or so seats they hold in the assembly .
They say the election is unfair but still urged Iran 's 44 million eligible voters to turn out for the country 's eighth parliamentary elections since its 1979 Islamic revolution .
President Ahmadinejad 's political opponents blame him for the three rounds of sanctions imposed on Iran by the United Nations over its nuclear programme .
The US , Israel and key Western powers accuse Iran of attempting to build a nuclear bomb , but Tehran insists it is only enriching uranium for a civilian energy programme .
And when I say “ we , ” I think I speak for more than just the liberal Democrats who ’ve favored Obama in his bid for the presidency .
I think I speak also for vast segments of independent and Republican voters who saw in Obama a reassuring , even self - flattering transcendence of race .
We wanted his success at the polls to put the politics of bigotry and of grievance in their respective places .
We wanted him to show that the majority of Americans have moved beyond fear , mistrust , polarization and resentment and can , at last , in the hopeful words of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , judge people not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character .
We did n’t want Barack Obama to start a national conversation about race .
We wanted him to end it .
And , sure , ours was a naïve desire .
Not only is race too complex an issue to be settled by the rise of one candidate , but Obama himself is too complex a man to float serenely above it .
Years ago , he wrote an autobiography that wrestled with his identity and anger , and it should come as no surprise that his bond with the occasionally incendiary retiring pastor of his Afrocentric Chicago church defies easy understanding .
I ’m not sure I understand it myself .
Over the past week , I ’ve had numerous conversations with friends and readers of all persuasions who are wondering — some in sorrow , some with triumphant scorn — why Obama did n’t act years ago to defuse the obvious political time bomb contained in the rhetoric of Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Even those who , like me , are inclined to draw a sharp distinction between what Obama believes and what his longtime pastor believes , still shake their heads wondering why he did n’t begin creating distance from Wright back in 2003 when he began running for the U.S. Senate .
Yes , the two were like family in some ways , and Wright , his scorching excesses in the pulpit notwithstanding , is a brilliant man whose church has done considerable good on the South Side .
But still .....
You do n’t have to be a knuckle - dragging racist to doubt Obama ’s judgment here and to wonder why voters should believe he can elevate the tone in America when he apparently could n’t even do so in his own house of worship .
I do n’t mean to argue the point either way today , only to say that I do n’t yet see how Obama ’s presidential aspirations can survive what some are calling the “ Pastor Disaster . ”
Some polls suggest that his searching , subtle and challenging speech in Philadelphia last week put the issue behind him and that voters have moved on .
I do n’t buy it .
Obama ’s transformation from the candidate who puts race behind us into the candidate who puts race front and center is no one - week dust - up or overblown campaign spat .
It ’s a shift that , along with the unavoidable video clips of Wright at his most discomfiting , seems destined to erode Obama ’s support among independents and white working - class Democrats — voters he ’ll need , assuming he holds on to his primary lead and faces John McCain in November .
There ’s no way around this problem for Obama .
He could n’t renounce or minimize his 20 years in those pews even if he wanted to .
His only way is straight through it , guided by the most audacious hope he ’s ever had — that talk will lead to understanding and healing .
If we must have a national conversation about race , then I , for one , want Barack Obama to lead it .

NOTE :
Driving instructor Stephen Cooney , 51 , groped three female learner drivers in a series of attacks on Teesside dating back to 2002 .
A jury at Teesside Crown Court found him guilty of two indecent assaults and two sexual assaults .
Cooney , of Marske - by - the - Sea near Redcar , told the court the carrot incident was a " practical joke " .
The court heard how Cooney put the 12 - inch carrot down his trousers and told a pupil in her 40s that a perfectly executed manoeuvre was so good that it had given him an erection .
He then took her hand and made her touch the vegetable before showing her the carrot , the court heard .
He denied placing her hand on his groin , but admitted hiding the vegetable in his pocket .
Naked photos
He told the jury : " I admit it was unprofessional , stupid , and I regret doing it .
" I just thought maybe I would play a practical joke , but obviously it was stupid . "
Jailing him , Judge George Moorhouse , said : " You were in a position of trust . "
Giving evidence , another of Cooney 's pupils said when she failed her test he offered to waive the £ 80 she owed him if she pulled over into a lay - by and had sex with him .
She told the court : " I just said ' No thank you , Steve ' . "
He regularly groped her during lessons between August 2005 and February last year , the court heard .
When police arrested him they also found naked photos in the glove box of his Vauxhall Corsa .
The only problem with this doco , which asks why men are obsessed with the size of their penises , is that the focus is too narrow - although the length is about right .
Arf-arf .
There is plenty of interesting stuff here : did you know that in ancient Greece small was considered beautiful and having a big willy marked you as an uncultured lout ?
The presenter , Lawrence Barraclough , uses some novel techniques to get his point across , such as pacing the high street wearing a sandwich board emblazoned with the message : " I want to talk about penises . "
Hillary Rodham Clinton took another sharp jab at the Bush administration as she outlined her science policy Thursday .
The front - runner in the 2008 Democratic presidential campaign unveiled her agenda for the scientific community at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington , D.C .
Under her administration , she said , the federal government would return to funding " ethical embryonic stem - cell research , " ban political appointees ' interference with government scientists ' conclusions , elevate a science advisor to report directly to the president , and boost research into space exploration , the earth sciences and alternative energy .
Many scientists have criticized President Bush , charging that he's had political appointees interfere with the conclusions of scientific research , muzzled agency officials who have independent points of view , and not paid enough attention to evidence that human activities are causing global climate change .
Clinton used the 50th anniversary of the Sputnik launch to outline a broad science policy that would reverse Bush 's overall approach to federally funded science programs .
She also addressed the science community 's increasingly vocal allegations that the Bush administration has politicized scientific research .
" For six - and - a - half years under this president , it 's been open season on open inquiry , " Clinton said in a statement .
" By ignoring or manipulating science , the Bush administration is letting our economic competitors get an edge in the global economy . "
" I was impressed .
She seemed to know the concerns of the science community , and she pushed all the right buttons , " said Al Teich , the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's director of policy , who heard Clinton speak Thursday morning .
" The positions that she pressed will be very well - received by the science community , " he added .
The AAAS has disagreed with Bush administration policies in several areas of science , most notably in the area of funding , Teich said .
Teich was particularly struck by an anecdote that Clinton shared with her audience about how Bush 's stem - cell policy had made research in this area particularly difficult .
Clinton recalled a story she 'd been told about a stem - cell researcher 's experiment that had been ruined when the lab suffered a power failure .
Because the rules ban researchers from using federally funded facilities for privately funded stem - cell research , the scientist was unable transfer the laboratory samples to a working refrigerator paid for by the federal government .
The experiment was ruined .
" The point was about how difficult it is to do that kind of research now because of the need to create these separations , " said Teich .
" She understood this issue , and this is of considerable concern to many scientists . "
President Bush in 2001 issued an executive order that banned federal funding for starting new lines of stem cells for research purposes .
That reversed a policy put in place by the Clinton administration , which assembled a committee of scientists , philosophers and religious leaders to advise the White House on rules for funding ethical stem - cell research .
The rules ended up being similar to those outlined by the AAAS , Teich said .
Sources who attended Jon Stewart ’s The Daily Show taping today got an earful of complaining from the comic host about his dealings with the Writers Guild .
This was his show ’s first day back after its strike hiatus and Jon ’s jawing came prior to taping .
That ’s when audience coordinator Teri Abrams , and then Stewart in more detail , talked about how they joined with cable channel Comedy Central to lobby the WGA to accept the same deal that the writers guild made with David Letterman ’s Worldwide Pants .
Stewart told the audience that he was turned down by the WGA last Thursday .
It was apparent that Stewart was completely flummoxed by the Guild ’s decision and questioned the logic behind the rejection .
But what the audience was n’t told , however , is that the two situations are very different : Comedy Central , a division of Viacom , owns Stewart ’s show , whereas Worldwide Pants owns The Late Show with David Letterman as well as the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson .
Viacom is one of the 8 biggest members of the AMPTP which is refusing to bargain with the WGA at present .
During the pre-show , Stewart became serious and said he believed what the writers want is important and he supports them all the way .
Asked what he did during the strike hiatus , he said without the show he ’s just an old guy yelling at the TV .
Mr Feith left the Pentagon in 2005
As under secretary of defence until 2005 Douglas Feith was closely involved with the planning of the invasion .
However , in " War and Decision " , he blames officials outside the Pentagon for seriously mismanaging the invasion and occupation , the Post reports .
Out next month , it is the first insider account of Pentagon decision - making .
The newspaper says that Mr Feith accuses intelligence officials and the US state department , led at the time by Mr Powell , of repeatedly scuppering defence department plans for the invasion .
According to the Post , Mr Feith claims that US President George W Bush told a National Security Council meeting " war is inevitable " weeks before a team of UN weapons inspectors , headed by Hans Blix , had made their final report on Saddam Hussein 's weapons capabilities .
' More harm than good '
Mr Feith reportedly singles Mr Powell out for criticism , saying that though he allowed himself to be portrayed as a dove , he never spoke out against the war .
He also criticises Condoleezza Rice , who took over from Mr Powell as secretary of state , for having failed in her then role as national security adviser , saying that she did not unite the US 's war planning , the Post says .
And , according to the paper , he castigates Paul Bremer , the US official in charge of the subsequent US occupancy as having done more harm in Iraq than good and says military chief Gen Tommy Franks had no interest in post - war planning .
In stark contrast , Mr Feith is reportedly full of praise for former defence secretary Donald H Rumsfeld - one of the chief architects of the war .
Mr Feith was investigated by the Pentagon 's inspector general last year for his department 's pre-war assessments which linked Saddam Hussein 's regime to the al - Qaeda terror group .
The assessments were judged " inappropriate " but not illegal .
On January 16 , 2008 , Dr. James Hansen of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Sciences ( GISS ) released the summation of temperature data for 2007 with apparently very little fanfare .
Given the data collected by Dr. Hansen , the lack of fanfare itself might well be notable .
But regardless , the data itself bears more public attention that it ’s had .
2007 is now tied with 1998 as the second hottest year for global temperature in a century .
According to the the GISS 2007 summation press release online , all eight of the hottest years for global temperature have been since 1998 , and 14 of the hottest years have been since 1990 .
The global temperature map ( shown in image above – larger version available ) , the Arctic and Siberia had the greatest temperature increase , between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius .
This heating was responsible for , or a direct result of , the smallest Arctic ice cap since records have been kept .
If you look closely at the eastern Pacific ocean in that map , though , you ’ll notice a horizontal strip of blue right about the equator , indicating a strip of cooling .
The 1998 temperature spike was caused by one of the hotter and bigger El NiÃ±os recorded – 2007 was as hot even though the Pacific Ocean had a La NiÃ±a cooling event instead .
Not only that , but in 1998 , total solar output was on its way up toward its solar maximum ( a result of the solar sunspot cycle ) instead of being pretty much at minimum solar irradiance ( for this solar cycle ) in 2007 .
In other words , we had the second hottest year in the last century even though the sun ’s output was low and the Pacific had a cooling La NiÃ±a event .
Any bets what will happen in the next 5 years or so as the solar irradiance goes up , we have our next El NiÃ±o , and while greenhouse gas concentrations continue increasing ?
Global heating skeptics said last year that the earth had already started cooling down – the data does n’t support this conclusion .
Skeptics have also said this year that the unusually cool January put the lie into global heating – given that 2007 was so hot even though there were cooling events , the data suggests that a cooler 2008 is entirely reasonable and even expected .
And it ’s not like a single year , or even two or 5 years of below average temperatures negate the fact that , as the image above shows , there has been a 30 - year heating trend globally .
US officials did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights when they held a US citizen in isolated military detention without charge for nearly four years and subjected him to harsh interrogation techniques .
That 's the legal position staked out by Justice Department lawyers who are urging a federal judge in Charleston , S.C. , to dismiss a lawsuit filed on behalf of Jose Padilla against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and nine other current or former US officials .
Mr. Padilla was held in military custody from 2002 to 2006 as a suspected Al Qaeda operative and enemy combatant .
The 55 - page motion , filed this week , offers the first detailed defense of the government 's aggressive treatment of Padilla during his three years and seven months in military custody .
Padilla 's suit says he endured isolation , stress positions , extreme cold , sleep deprivation , and reportedly was subjected to five months of severe sensory deprivation , including near total isolation from human contact .
Mental - health experts who have examined Padilla say the experience has left him with severe mental disabilities , including post - traumatic stress disorder .
Government lawyers made no reference to Padilla 's diagnosed psychological problems .
They told US District Judge Henry Floyd that such a lawsuit , if allowed to progress , would interfere with military decisionmaking , aid the enemy , and make the US more vulnerable to terrorist attack .
" It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering of executive branch officials than to allow enemy combatants to trade a battlefield in Afghanistan for a battlefield in the US legal system , " Barbara Bowens , civil chief of the US Attorney 's Office in South Carolina , says in her brief .
After nearly four years in military custody , Padilla was transferred to the criminal - justice system in January 2006 .
He was convicted in August in a Miami terror - conspiracy trial and is set to be sentenced in December .
An appeal is expected .
Although Padilla was placed on trial and convicted in Miami , no court has fully assessed the legality of Padilla 's earlier detention and interrogation in military custody .
Government lawyers say such an assessment is unwarranted .
" Padilla 's designation , detention , and interrogation as an enemy combatant did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights , " Ms. Bowens says in her brief .
" It can not be said that there were any constitutional ' bright lines ' applicable to Padilla 's case which the [ government ] could be held liable for transgressing , " Bowens writes .
The issue of " clearly established " rights is important because government officials are protected by immunity from such lawsuits even when rights may have been violated .
They lose that immunity , however , if the violated rights are so obvious to a reasonable person that they are considered " clearly established . "
" Officials are not liable for bad guesses in gray areas , " Bowens notes .
" They are liable for transgressing bright lines . "
Padilla 's lawyers believe the lines in his case are clear and clearly established .
In their 30 - page complaint , they charge that Padilla " suffered gross physical and psychological abuse at the hands of federal officials as part of a scheme of abusive interrogation intended to break down [ his ] humanity and his will to live . "
The complaint says US officials violated Padilla 's constitutionally protected rights to consult a lawyer , to gain access to the courts , to practice his religion and associate with family and friends without government interference , and to be free from coercive interrogation , free from cruel and unusual punishment , and free from illegal and arbitrary detention .
Fundamentally at issue in the Padilla case is whether such constitutional guarantees continue to protect a US citizen seized on US soil and held without charge in a US - based military prison once the citizen is designated an enemy combatant .
Bowens says the issue has already been decided by a federal appeals - court panel in Richmond that upheld Padilla 's military detention in September 2005 .
As a result , she says , Padilla 's lawyers should be precluded from raising any constitutional claims – even claims related to Padilla 's interrogation and isolation .
Some legal analysts say they are alarmed by the sweep of the government 's position .
" The notion that there is absolutely no limit in how the government treats US citizen detainees strikes me as a disturbing proposition , " says Stephen Vladeck , a law professor at American University in Washington , D.C. " Most people would have thought before the Padilla case that the government can't simply do whatever it wants to a US citizen in military custody . "
Given the government 's reliance on " clearly established " law , the Padilla civil case could present an ironic twist in the long and heated debate over Bush administration tactics in the war on terror .
White House and Justice Department officials worked hard in the years since the 9/11 attacks to maximize legal flexibility in dealing with detainees .
They sought to clarify the law in a way that would protect interrogators , soldiers , and other US officials from civil suits and war - crimes charges .
Instead of clarification , the efforts triggered debates both within and outside the administration over what the law should be .
Now , legal analysts say , the administration may rely on the lingering uncertainty to help shield US officials from legal liability .
" It will make it a lot harder for plaintiffs [ like Padilla ] to win a lawsuit because there is a much better argument that the relevant laws are n't clearly established , " Professor Vladeck says .
" Even though Padilla 's rights may have been violated , the real question is whether it was clearly established that what the government was doing to him was illegal , " Vladeck says .
" One ca n't help but wonder based on the torture debate whether anything was clearly established . "
AP Confirms Secret Camp Inside Gitmo

Somewhere amid the cactus - studded hills on this sprawling Navy base , separate from the cells where hundreds of men suspected of links to al - Qaida and the Taliban have been locked up for years , is a place even more closely guarded – a jailhouse so protected that its very location is top secret .
For the first time , the top commander of detention operations at Guantanamo has confirmed the existence of the mysterious Camp 7 .
In an interview with The Associated Press , Rear Adm .
Mark Buzby also provided a few details about the maximum - security lockup .
Guantanamo commanders said Camp 7 is for key alleged al - Qaida members , who must be kept apart from other prisoners to prevent them from retaliating against long - term detainees who have talked to interrogators .
They also want the location kept secret for fear of terrorist attack .
Many operations have been classified since the detention center opened in January 2002 in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
More than four years passed before the military released even the names of detainees held on this 45 - square - mile base in southeast Cuba – and it did so only after the AP filed a Freedom of Information Act request .
Detainees have been held in Camp Echo and Camps 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 .
Journalists cleared by the military have been allowed to tour some of these lockups , where 260 men are held , but are n’t allowed to speak to detainees .
Some lawmakers and other VIPs have passed through , and the International Red Cross has access , but does n’t divulge details of visits with prisoners .
Camp 7 , where 15 “ high - value detainees ” are held , is so secret that its very existence was not publicly known until it was mentioned in December by attorneys for Majid Khan , a former Baltimore resident who allegedly plotted to bomb gas stations in the United States .
Previously , many observers believed the 15 were being held in Camps 5 or 6 , which are maximum - security facilities .
“ Under the gag order … we are prohibited from saying anything more about their camp , ” lawyer Gitanjali Gutierrez , who met with Khan in October , said Tuesday .
Most of the lawyers ’ notes and memos have been stamped “ top secret ” by the government .
Buzby told the AP he is sharply limiting to a “ very few ” the number of people who know Camp 7 ’s whereabouts .
He described it as a maximum security facility that was already built when President Bush announced in September 2006 that 14 high - value terrorism suspects had been transferred from CIA secret detention facilities to Guantanamo .
An additional detainee , Abd al - Hadi al - Iraqi , arrived last April .
“ They went straight into that facility , ” Buzby said .
Buzby , who heads all military detention operations on Guantanamo , said he controls Camp 7 , but would not discuss whether the CIA might still be talking with the high - value detainees .
Paul Rester , the military ’s chief interrogator at Guantanamo , told AP he has been interviewing one of the Camp 7 detainees and that others may be interrogated , depending on intelligence needs .
But other key military commanders on the base have been told to leave Camp 7 to others .
“ Not everybody , even within the Joint Task Force , has access or even knowledge of where Camp 7 is , ” said Army Col. Bruce Vargo .
As commander of the military ’s Joint Detention Group at Guantanamo , Vargo is responsible for the camps holding 260 detainees .
But not for Camp 7 .
Red Cross representatives have visited Camp 7 and all the other detention facilities at Guantanamo , confirmed Geoff Loane , head of the humanitarian organization ’s delegation in Washington .
He declined to give details .
Buzby said the 15 are kept isolated in part to protect other prisoners .
“ Detainees have told us a lot of things about this group of people , and if there were potential for retribution it would be a very , very dangerous situation , ” he said .
For his part , Vargo said he is preoccupied by the possibility of an al - Qaida attack on Guantanamo .
“ Although we are trying to be open , security is paramount , ” he said .
“ I mean , if you can fly a plane into the towers , you can attack Guantanamo if that ’s what you choose to do .
It ’s something I think about on a day - to - day basis . ”
Vargo declined to discuss whether the U.S. has received information that al - Qaida may be planning such an attack .
“ We have intelligence reports , but I do n’t want to release what we know for obvious reasons , ” he said .
While some military personnel have reportedly grumbled about being kept out of the loop , others do n’t mind .
Army Col. Larry James , whose team of psychologists assists interrogators , said he does not want to know where Camp 7 is .
“ I learned a long , long time ago , if I ’m going to be successful in the intel community , I ’m meticulously – in a very , very dedicated way – going to stay in my lane , ” he said .
“ So if I do n’t have a specific need to know about something , I do n’t want to know about it .
I do n’t ask about it . ”

As Glenn Beck says , “ Here is how I got there ” .
I am a staunch supporter for Ron Paul for President .
I attended when Ron Paul spoke on Monday January 21 at the Holiday Inn in Shreveport .
That was the first time I heard that there would be a caucus held in Louisiana on Tuesday January 22 ( EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BEING HELD THE NEXT DAY ) at Bossier City Centrytel arena , and other places in Louisiana , and that we needed to turn out to vote between 5 pm and 8 pm in support of Ron Paul .
You would think that this would have been advertised more , with a clear understanding of when it was going to be held , what the rules were , and how you could vote to support your candidate .
When I got there , the only instructions handed out , said to vote for all the candidates in your district , and they had a list of the delegates for the two districts .
There was no hint or indication of who each candidate supported .
( I still have my copy )
I began talking to the people running the caucus .
None of them could tell me how the process was being run .
No one seemed to know anything .
Everyone was confused !
I began talking to other voters who came in .
They were as confused as I was .
Being a firm supporter of Dr. Paul , I was determined to find out what was going on .
I then talked to two of the young delegates who were there .
They were real nice , young men .
I questioned them and one delegate told me the following :
If a republican candidate should get over 50 % of the vote , all of the “ uncommitted delegates ” being voted on tonight , were obligated to vote for that candidate when the delegates vote .
He said if no candidate gets 50 % of the primary vote , then they could vote for any republican candidate they wanted to !
I asked him ?
Does this mean I could vote here today and I could actually cause a candidate I do not want to be President to be elected the Republican Presidential nominee .
He said yes , unless your candidate gets over 50 % of the vote .
( that is not likely to happen , especially with the mass media censorship and this type of finagling going on ) .
I decided to leave and not vote .
I ran into 5 people when leaving , and told them my story , and that their vote could help a candidate they did not want in office .
4 of them were Ron Paul supporters and seemed to understand and were very concerned .
2 said they were going in and would talk to others about it .
2 turned around and left without voting as I did .
The last guy I told my story to , said he was going to vote anyway and he was a McCain supporter .
What did he know that I did n't ?
We need support to get this investigated IMMEDIATELY .
We need to contact Moon Griffon , a Louisiana talk show host from Monroe , Louisiana , and get him to talk about it on his radio show .
I hope he can get the attention of the new Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , and get Bobby to investigate .
Both Moon and Governor Jindal are staunch supporters of cleaning up Louisiana corruption .
It seems to me that someone behind this “ misleading intentional delusion ” , should be prosecuted under the RICO statute , if it can be proven !
It seems that this would be a perfect “ first case ” for Governor Jindal .
.
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN AN INTENTIONAL SETUP :
1 ) The caucus was not timely advertised .
2 ) Even Ron
Paul thought we should vote in his support , and had not been told the caucus details .
3 ) The uncommitted delegates , were predominately “ John McCain ” supporters .
This is evident from articles and information currently being posted all over the Internet .
4 ) This is also obvious , since they are stating that “ John McCain won the Louisiana Caucus ” No Way .
5 ) No one at the Bossier caucus knew what was going on and could not even intelligently answer my questions .
6 ) No instruction sheet was issued at the caucus , except one saying “ WIN one for the Gipper ( I did n't even know he was running ) and saying to vote for “ all ” the delegates in your district .
It did n't even say which areas were covered in each district .
7 ) This had to be intentionally misleading .
Surely Louisiana politics are not this “ DUMB ASSED ”
I HAD QUIT CURSING .
RON PAUL CENSORSHIP AND MANIPULATION IS CAUSING ME TO CURSE AGAIN .
I Pledge to quit cursing again , and exert that energy to support for Ron Paul for President .
DALLAS ( Reuters ) - A batch of old documents linked to the slaying of President John F. Kennedy has reportedly been unearthed , including a highly suspect transcript of a conversation between assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and Oswald ’s killer Jack Ruby , the Dallas Morning News said on Sunday .
President John F. Kennedy is seen working in the Oval Office in the White House in this 1963 photo by White House photographer Robert Knudsen provided by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston .
A batch of old documents linked to the slaying of Kennedy has reportedly been unearthed , including a highly suspect transcript of a conversation between assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and Oswald 's killer Jack Ruby , the Dallas Morning News said on Sunday .

The newspaper said the Dallas County district attorney ’s office , which uncovered the documents , would display its discovery at a news conference on Monday morning .
The Morning News said the items found in an old safe in a Dallas courthouse included personal letters from former District Attorney Henry Wade , the prosecutor in the Ruby trial .
Ruby shot Oswald two days after the president ’s death .
Also found were official records from Ruby ’s trial , a gun holster and clothing that probably belonged to Ruby and Oswald , District Attorney Craig Watkins told the newspaper .
But one potentially controversial item is a transcript of an exchange between Oswald and Ruby in which they discuss killing Kennedy to halt the mafia - busting agenda of his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy .
The Morning News said one theory about the transcript was that it was part of a movie script
Wade was working on with producers , for a film that was never made .
The transcript resembles one published by the Warren Commission , which investigated Kennedy ’s assassination and concluded Oswald acted alone .
The FBI had determined the conversation between Oswald and Ruby -- this time about killing Texas Gov. John Connally -- was definitely fake , the newspaper said .
Connally was riding in the car with Kennedy and was wounded in the attack .
The documents may be a Presidents ’
Day gift to conspiracy theorists who have long questioned the official U.S. government version that Oswald acted alone when he shot Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , as the president ’s motorcade swept past the Texas School Book Depository in downtown Dallas .
Nightclub owner Ruby subsequently shot Oswald dead at point - blank range as police were escorting their prime suspect .
Ruby died a few years later from cancer .
Health concerns over the Red Bull energy drink were fuelled yesterday after Europe ’s highest court upheld a French ban on the product .
The fizzy drink has been linked to several deaths and some experts have criticised its high levels of caffeine and other stimulants .
Red Bull is Britain ’s best - selling energy drink , with 213 million cans consumed last year .
It has been dubbed the ‘ clubbers ’ drink ’ , and is often mixed with vodka .
The popular adverts claiming that Red Bull ‘ gives you wings ’ , have led to the brand being described as ‘ the Porsche of soft drinks ’ .
It contains caffeine , vitamins , and sugar which , the company claims , kick - starts the body ’s metabolism and keeps people alert .
But France has refused to authorise its sale , along with other vitamin - fortified foods such as Danone yoghurt and Kellogg ’s cereals .
The European Commission ( EC ) challenged France ’s ban after manufacturers complained it was inhibiting imports .
In a ruling yesterday , the European Court of Justice upheld the main part of the EC challenge , ordering France to lift the ban unless it could prove the health risks .
But the court said that the French government did have a right to ban Red Bull .
The judges said that a study by the French Scientific Committee on Human Nutrition found that Red Bull contained excessive caffeine .
The committee also raised concerns about the drink ’s other ingredients – taurine , an amino acid the company claims can ‘ kick - start ’ the metabolism – and glucuronolactone , a carbohydrate .
The EC’s Scientific Committee on Food conducted a study last year , and found that while caffeine levels in energy drinks were safe , more studies were needed to assess the dangers of taurine and glucuronolactone .
While other toxicology experts had concluded that the caffeine levels in Red Bull are safe , France had a right to ban the drink on the advice of its own experts , the court said .
One can of Red Bull contains 80 mg of caffeine – equivalent to one cup of coffee .
Three years ago , Ross Cooney , 18 , from Ireland , died after he shared four cans of Red Bull and played in a basketball match .
An inquest into his death ruled that he died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome .
Lyndel Costain , a dietician , said : ‘ The problem with caffeine is that the effects can vary , so it is difficult to say what is a safe level .
High levels of caffeine can be dangerous for people with high blood pressure or anxiety disorders .
Not much is known about taurine and glucuronolactone , but high levels of them could affect the body . ’
Red Bull – which sells 1.6 billion cans worldwide – said yesterday that its product was safe .
A spokeswoman said : ‘ Red Bull will continue to be sold in 100 countries worldwide . ’
She added : ‘ No authority in the world has ever discovered or proven an unhealthy effect in or from Red Bull . ’
Only France , Denmark and Norway have banned the drink .
Britain ’s Committee on Toxicity investigated Red Bull in 2001 and found that it was safe , but warned pregnant women against it because high caffeine intake has been linked to a risk of miscarriage .
An EU ruling which comes into force this year means that Red Bull and other energy drinks will have to carry ‘ high caffeine content ’ warnings .
An urban myth that taurine was made from bull ’s semen has only added to its popularity .
Safety fears Ross Cooney , 18 , was a healthy basketball player , but died in 2000 just hours after drinking Red Bull .
The student from Limerick , Ireland , died after sharing four cans of the drink with friends before a basketball game .
At his inquest , the coroner called officials from the Austrian - based company to give evidence about their product .
They said that no adverse effects had been proven in connection with the drink .
The inquest jury later ruled that the teenager had died as a result of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome , but called for an inquiry into high - caffeine energy drinks .
A Brazilian study found that those who mix Red Bull with alcohol may be drunker than they think they are – the energy drink may mask the alcohol effect .

Security forces have poured in to several regions China has admitted for the first time that anti-Beijing protests have spread outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region , as security is ratcheted up .
Xinhua news agency reported huge damage to government buildings and shops after riots in Sichuan province on Sunday .
And officials said 24 people had been arrested after demos in the Tibetan city of Lhasa , and 170 protesters had surrendered to authorities .
Hundreds of troops have been seen pouring into Tibetan areas .
On Wednesday alone , BBC reporters saw more than 400 troop carriers and other vehicles on the main road - the largest mobilisation witnessed since the unrest began .
Security forces filmed the early protests in Lhasa
' First ' clashes
And the authorities have placed strict limits on Western journalists trying to report on the unrest .
Georg Blume , a German journalist who was forced out of Lhasa on Thursday , said security forces had told him he was the last foreign journalist in the city .
He told the BBC that police were " everywhere " and he had seen them going into houses and carrying out searches .
Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has reiterated his willingness to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao - if he receives " concrete indications " of what the Chinese can offer .
But senior Chinese officials have repeatedly accused him of orchestrating the protests from his base in the Indian town of Dharamsala , and the foreign ministry once again labelled him a " splittist " on Thursday .
TIBETAN PROTESTS
Tibet : Protests began in Lhasa on 10 March , dozens reported dead over weekend Gansu : Unrest spread to Machu , where Tibetan government in exile says 19 died , and near Hezuo , where protesters were filmed tearing down Tibetan flag Sichuan : Reports of riots and casualties in Aba , and of unrest in other locations Qinghai :
Other unrest reported
Key events and places Tibet 's unsettled borders Gansu streets deserted In pictures : Troops go in Meanwhile , the BBC has obtained dramatic footage filmed by the security forces of some of the first clashes between monks and the military last week .
Chinese and Tibetan sources have given very different accounts of the protests that began in Lhasa on 10 March , on the anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
Xinhua , which is state - run , has published graphic articles describing the violence it blames on rioters , saying 13 people were stabbed or burnt to death in unrest in Lhasa .
The agency referred to protesters in Aba country , Sichuan , as " mobsters " , saying they had caused " great damage " to shops and government offices .
Tibetan exiles say that at least 99 people have died so far , including 80 in Lhasa - and accuse security forces of firing on crowds .
' Grave crimes '
State media reported that 170 people had now handed themselves in - up from the 105 people they said had surrendered to police in Lhasa .
The authorities had threatened " harsh punishments " for those who failed to meet a Monday deadline .
TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet was always part of its territory Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century 1950 : China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to a bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India
Accounts from Tibet Send us your comments
On Thursday the state - run Tibet Daily quoted prosecutors as saying that two dozen suspects had been arrested for " endangering national security as well as beating , smashing , looting , arson and other grave crimes " .
Demonstrators had called for Tibetan independence and waved the flags of Tibet 's " government - in - exile " , it said .
It was not clear whether the 24 arrested were among the 170 reported to have surrendered .
Rights groups say they have heard reports that hundreds had been arrested .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said China 's Premier Wen Jiabao had told him he was open to talks under certain conditions .
He said he had told Mr Wen that he would meet the Dalai Lama during a visit to London in May and that the violence in Tibet must end .

What are these ?
It was n’t supposed to work this way .
Credit card companies have long seduced customers with “ buy now , pay later , ” hoping they would pay at least a minimum amount month after month but never pay off their debts .
Now , though , with the economy slowing and houses no longer easy sources of cash , a growing number of consumers cannot pay even the minimums .
In December , revolving debt  an estimated 95 percent from credit cards  reached a record high of $ 943.5 billion , according to the Federal Reserve .
The annual growth rate of this debt increased steadily in 2007 , reaching 9.3 percent in the last quarter , up from 5.4 percent in the first quarter .
The amount of debt that is delinquent  in which minimum payments are late but the accounts are still open  also appears to be on the rise .
The Federal Reserve found that 4.34 percent of the credit card portfolios of the 100 largest banks that issue cards was delinquent in the third quarter of last year , up from 4.07 percent in the previous quarter .
Charge - offs  accounts closed for nonpayment  also grew in that period , and banks expect charge - offs to keep rising in 2008 .
“ It ’s not that card debt is unmanageable for everyone , ” Adam J. Levitin , a credit expert and an associate professor of law at Georgetown University , wrote in an e-mail message .
“ Rather , it is unmanageable for some ( and a growing group , it seems ) . ”
Recently I have been working at implementing Actors in Common Lisp .
I have been looking at the Scala source for their Actors library as well .
Vision
My vision is that an effective Actors library would allow clean and simple interation between threads , programs , and external computers as well .
Implementation
There are a number of implementation questions to be considered here .
But I my current approach involves two components : an actor - environment and actors .
The actor - environment will contain a number of local - actors , and can keep track of external actor - environments and the local - actors contained within those other environments .
On setup an actor - environment will have to be taught how to find any other actor - environments it interacts with , but the actors inside different actor - environments ( once they have been introduced ) should interact with the same syntax as actors in the same actor - environment .
Each actor - environment will have one primary dispatch thread , which will be used to either ( single - threaded model ) run relevant actor code when they recieve a new message , or ( multi - threaded model ) will allocate a worker thread to run the relevant actor code when they recieve a new message .
The dispatch thread will also be used to sending and recieving new messages between actor - environments and actors .
It will also be used to dynamically search for other actor - environments in certain situations ( zeroconf enabled actor - environments , for example ) .
In addition , each actor - environment will have 0 + interfaces ( this is how actor - environments will be introduced to each other ) .
These interfaces can be input , output , or bidirectional ( an input socket , an output socket , a two way socket , etc ) .
They can also be active or passive ( zeroconf will have to dynamically scan for new actor - environments , but data about a specific server you want to communicate with wo n't fluxuate ) .
Syntax
I am still working on the syntax , and I do n't particularly care for what I have right now .
But its somewhat servicable :
( with - env ( env ) ( let ( ( ping ( make - instance ' local - actor :env env : id ' ping ) ) ( pong ( make - instance ' local - actor :env env : id ' pong ) ) ( output nil ) ) ( setf ( action ping ) ( lambda ( actor msg ) ( if ( equal ( second msg ) " pong " ) ( setf output ( append output ( list " ping " ) ) ) ) ( send actor ' pong " ping " ) ) ) ( setf ( action pong ) ( lambda ( actor msg ) ( declare ( ignore actor ) ) ( if ( equal ( second msg ) " ping " ) ( setf output ( append output ( list " pong " ) ) ) ) ) ) ( send pong ' ping " pong " ) ) )
Each actor has an action associated with it , and that action is called each time it recieves a new message .
The action receives the Actor itself as the first parameter ( akin to explicitly passing self to a Python method ) , and then a msg as its second parameters .
The msg is a tuple containing the sending actor , and the data sent as well ( typically this will be a string , perhaps it will always be a string ... there are some security considerations to be had there ) .
At the moment things are mostly thread - safe because I am only using the single - thread dispatcher .
This would n't be thread safe in the multiple - thread dispatcher .
Then again , you probably should n't be modifying shared mutable objects within the actors if at all possible .
Definitely requires some more syntactic sugar before it becomes pleasantly usable .
Any thoughts ?
When I first read of the nine 14 - year - old students at the Jewish Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls ' School in east London who refused to sit a Shakespeare test because they believed the Bard was anti-Semitic , I could well understand their feelings .
Their protest against Shylock in The Merchant of Venice – reported in this newspaper last week – seemed well grounded .
However human moneylenders may be ( " If you prick us , do we not bleed ? " ) , demanding a pound of flesh from a debtor really does add to the anti-Semitic overtones of Elizabethan literature and – by implication – stokes up the racist fires of our contemporary world .
But then – in paragraph four – I came across the killer line .
The nine girls were not being tested on The Merchant of Venice at all – they were being examined on The Tempest .
It was Shakespeare they were objecting to .
If only I and my schoolboy chums had thought of such a wizard wheeze .
I always found Christopher Marlowe a bore .
" Christ 's blood streaming in the firmament " did not have me yearning for more of Dr Faustus and I had no desire to " ride in triumph through Persepolis " with Tamburlaine .
But if I 'd had the wit to protest at The Jew of Malta , I could have abandoned all my Marlowe studies .
Then , of course , I could have chucked T S Eliot – and yes , I fear he was an anti-Semite , however much we may try to excuse him by remembering the " times " in which he lived – because of that horrible line in " Gerontion " about " the Jew .../ Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It 's not the only line of Eliot that makes me cringe ( try reading " Burbank with a Baedeker : Bleistein with a Cigar " ) .
So into the bin goes Eliot 's Prufrock , Murder in the Cathedral , The Cocktail Party , The Waste Land , etc .
Come to think of it , even Siegfried Sassoon 's poetry might have to go , given that unpleasant reference in his diary ( 22 February 1918 ) to a Jew in a British army concert in Italy , " chin out , with his curved Hebrew beak coming down to the thin - lipped mouth ... " .
So out go " Base Details " , " The General " and " Everyone Sang " .
But hold on a moment .
Let 's take a look at the darkly anti-Semitic overtones of anti-Muslim discourse in Shakespeare .
Othello was a Moor , a black Muslim , a mercenary ( in the service of Venice ) – and a wife killer .
Even worse , the mother of Caliban , a Muslim Arab , born of an Algerian mother , is described by Prospero – in The Tempest , the very play the nine Jewish schoolgirls were supposed to take in their test – as " This blue ey'd hag was hither brought with child ...?
A freckl'd whelp , hag - born - not honor 'd with / A human shape " .
Why not a protest over this racist , provocative portrait of a Muslim Arab ?
For that matter , Tamburlaine – already flung into the trash heap because of another Marlowe play – scarcely improves Muslim - Western relations with its description of the Muslim warrior as " the scourge of God " .
But let 's not stop there .
Winston Churchill exhibited some racist views of the Indians – typical of his age , no doubt , but hardly acceptable – in the Daily Mail .
See his description of Indian villagers as " humble , primitive folk , who have been incapable of evolving , even in a most rudimentary form , a village government " .
Later , Churchill reflected on the need to curtail the entire Indian race .
When he sees a wounded Sikh on the North West Frontier , Churchill describes him as " a tragic golliwog " .
( See My Early Life , 1935 , page 156 , if you do n't believe me . )
So I guess we 'll have to chuck out Churchill 's Marlborough : His Life and Times , A History of the English Speaking Peoples and The Second World War .
And then – let 's not leave the anti-Muslim slant of English poets here – there 's Spenser , whose Faerie Queen drove the schoolboy Fisk to oceans of boredom .
But wait !
When the Prince is fighting the Pagan , the latter , " all full of rage ... gan to curse and sweare , / And vow by Mahouone ( Mohamed ) that he should be slaine .
With that his murderous mace ... " etc . ( For pedants , you can check Booke IV , Canto VIII , v. 44 . )
Anti-Muslim rhetoric again !
And Spenser , let 's remember , was an anti-Irish racist , too , a rapacious landlord , one of the Munster planters known locally as the " Undertakers " , who wrote a vicious tract ( " A View of the present State of Ireland " ) in which he advocated cruel measures of suppression .
So – to my infinite relief – out go The Faerie Queen and The Shepheardes Calender and The Teares of the Muses and all that other late 16th - century fluff .
And so to Dante .
If only I had realised , ploughing through The Inferno , that here lay yet another anti-Islamic provocation .
For the Prophet himself is discovered by Dante in – Hell !
" Look how Mohammed claws ? / And mangles himself , torn open down the breast !
Look how I tear myself .
And Ali goes weeping before me ... " in Robert Pinsky 's imperishable translation .
But why , for that matter , leave out the texts of the great religions of the East ?
In the Hadith of the Prophet and the Old Testament , there are excuses for any lunatic to commit mass murder and ethnic cleansing .
Mohamed dealt most savagely with the Jews of Medina .
" Assuredly thou ( Mohamed ) wilt find / that the most violent of the people / in enmity against those who have believed / are the Jews ... " ( Koran 5:82 85 ) .
In the Bible , God instructs Moses to tell the children of Israel that " ... When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan ; / Then shall ye drive out all the inhabitants of the land .../ And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land ... " ( Number 33:50 - 55 ) .
In fact , why do n't we go the whole hog and spare students the sacrifice of refusing their school tests by instituting the same kind of censorship that the Arab League – surely the silliest institution in the history of the world – has just adopted in the Middle East .
For yes , the 22 - member League now demands that TV stations should not " offend leaders or national religious symbols ... should not damage social harmony , national unity , public order or traditional [ sic ] values " .
TV channels must " refrain from broadcasting anything which calls into question God , the monotheistic religions , the prophets , sects or symbols of the various religious communities ... erotic or obscene material " .
And then – my favourite advice amid all this tosh – " freedom is to be exercised with awareness and responsibility to protect the supreme interests ( again , sic ) of the Arab states and the Arab nation " .
The Egyptian minister of information , Anas al - Fiqi , proudly announced that Egypt would be " the first to implement " this craven document .
Nor is it surprising that the decision of one of Mr al - Fiqi 's predecessors in the Cairo censorship sticks in my mind .
Faced with Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List and its epic portrayal of the Jewish Holocaust , he decided to ban the film .
It was " too depressing " , he said .
Another wizard wheeze to shut down our ears and our hearts and our understanding of history .
This is the candidate who keeps telling us she ’s so competent that she ’ll be ready to govern from Day 1 .
Mrs. Clinton may be right that Mr. Obama has a thin résumé , but her disheveled campaign keeps reminding us that the biggest item on her thicker résumé is the health care task force that was as botched as her presidential bid .
Given that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama offer marginally different policy prescriptions  laid out in voluminous detail by both , by the way , on their Web sites  it ’s not clear what her added - value message is .
The “ experience ” mantra has been compromised not only by her failure on the signal issue of Iraq but also by the deadening lingua franca of her particular experience , Washingtonese .
No matter what the problem , she keeps rolling out another commission to solve it : a commission for infrastructure , a Financial Product Safety Commission , a Corporate Subsidy Commission , a Katrina / Rita Commission and , to deal with drought , a water summit .
As for countering what she sees as the empty Obama brand of hope , she offers only a chilly void : Abandon hope all ye who enter here .
This must be the first presidential candidate in history to devote so much energy to preaching against optimism , against inspiring language and  talk about bizarre  against democracy itself .
No sooner does Mrs. Clinton lose a state than her campaign belittles its voters as unrepresentative of the country .

Bill Clinton knocked states that hold caucuses instead of primaries because “ they disproportionately favor upper - income voters ” who “ do n’t really need a president but feel like they need a change . ”
After the Potomac primary wipeout , Mr. Penn declared that Mr. Obama had n’t won in “ any of the significant states ” outside of his home state of Illinois .
This might come as news to Virginia , Maryland , Washington and Iowa , among the other insignificant sites of Obama victories .
The blogger Markos Moulitsas Zúniga has hilariously labeled this Penn spin the “ insult 40 states ” strategy .
The insults continued on Tuesday night when a surrogate preceding Mrs. Clinton onstage at an Ohio rally , Tom Buffenbarger of the machinists ’ union , derided Obama supporters as “ latte - drinking , Prius - driving , Birkenstock - wearing , trust - fund babies . ”
Even as he ranted , exit polls in Wisconsin were showing that Mr. Obama had in fact won that day among voters with the least education and the lowest incomes .
Less than 24 hours later , Mr. Obama received the endorsement of the latte - drinking Teamsters .
If the press were as prejudiced against Mrs. Clinton as her campaign constantly whines , debate moderators would have pushed for the Clinton tax returns and the full list of Clinton foundation donors to be made public with the same vigor it devoted to Mr. Obama ’s “ plagiarism . ”
And it would have showered her with the same ridicule that Rudy Giuliani received in his endgame .
With 11 straight losses in nominating contests , Mrs. Clinton has now nearly doubled the Giuliani losing streak ( six ) by the time he reached his Florida graveyard .
But we gamely pay lip service to the illusion that she can erect one more firewall .

Siegelman ’s Daughter States That Her Father Knows Karl Rove Is Behind His Prosecution
Says Judge ‘ Trying To Keep Her Dad Hushed As Long As He Possibly Can ’
Guest Blogged by Alan Breslauer
Dan Abrams once again tackles the Don Siegelman case in his stellar “ Bush League Justice ” series on MSNBC .
Tonight ’s guests included Scott Horton of Harper ’s , former Alabama GOP operative Dana Jill Simpson , and Governor Siegelman ’s daughter , Dana Siegelman .
Abrams and Horton opened the segment discussing the remarkable 60 Minutes blackout of the Siegelman story in Alabama on Sunday .
According to the local CBS station the blackout occurred because of a faulty receiver .
An incredulous Abrams then proceeded to make a mockery out of the laughable excuse :
It ’s sooo hard to believe – the notion that a receiver , in Alabama , just during the Siegelman story , just during 60 Minutes – I mean , they got it resolved , right ?
Right at the end , just as the story is finishing up , right ?
After playing more of his interview with Karl Rove accuser Simpson from yesterday ’s show , Abrams made his first of many calls for Governor Siegelman ’s release from prison :
But there are serious questions that should lead the Justice Department and the judge to , at the very least , release Siegelman while he appeals .
Amazingly , Siegelman is unable to appeal his case because the government has failed to produce a transcript of the trial which was completed over 18 months ago .
Later Dana Siegelman tries to answer some of the many unanswerable questions regarding her father ’s case before flat out telling Abrams that the judge is “ trying to keep her dad hushed as long as he possibly can ” and that her father “ knows Karl Rove is behind this . ”

( CNN ) --
The lawyer representing a Saudi rape victim whose treatment has drawn worldwide criticism predicted Wednesday the controversy may help reform the Saudi judicial system .
Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim .
" I believe the kingdom is going through a reformist period and I believe what we 're going through will lead to a more modern judicial system that all citizens can enjoy , " Abdulrahman al - Lahim told Octavia Nasr , CNN 's senior Arab affairs editor , in a telephone interview .
" I 'm confident that this line of thought will vanish one day , and indeed the country will be reborn . "
In March 2006 , when his client was 18 and engaged to be married , she and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif , Saudi Arabia , and she was raped by seven men .
In October , the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years in prison .
But the rape victim was also convicted -- for violating the kingdom 's Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall .
The man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day , Al - Lahim said .
It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law .
The woman was sentenced to 90 lashes and -- when she appealed -- the sentence was more than doubled to 200 lashes and six months in prison .
Her lawyer accused the head judge in the three - judge panel of having been against his client from the beginning , and he criticized the judge 's position that the victim and the rapists appear in the same courtroom .
" Based on my humanistic and professional ethics , I strongly rejected that stance , " al - Lahim said .
" How can she stand next to these people while suffering further emotional and physical harm ?
The judge took my objection personally and raised the issue to the Ministry of Justice to revoke my license . "
Al - Lahim said he feels the Saudi government is penalizing him for trying to help the woman get justice , including failing to reinstate his law license .
He said it was revoked last week by a judge in the Qatif General Court seeking to punish him for speaking to the Saudi - controlled news media about the incident and other controversial cases .
" I think that they want to take revenge , " he said .
" I do n't understand the sensitivity about media attention .
By Saudi law , court sessions should be open to the public . "
The judges may have increased his client 's original sentence because she hired him , " a controversial lawyer , " Al - Lahim said .
Al - Lahim vowed to " fight till the end " to get back his license , " to work again , and help create a new generation of lawyers that will continue on this path . "
Watch al - Lahim say being a lawyer is a dream for him »
The case has provoked outrage in the West and has cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia 's strict Islamic law .
The Saudi Justice Ministry -- apparently stung by international media scrutiny -- issued a " clarification " Tuesday .
It acknowledged that al - Lahim is no longer on the case , saying he was punished by a disciplinary committee for lawyers because he " exhibited disrespectful behavior toward the court , objected to the rule of law and showed ignorance concerning court instructions and regulations . "
The ministry also said it welcomed constructive criticism and said the parties ' rights were preserved in the judicial process .
" We would like to state that the system has ensured them the right to object to the ruling and to request an appeal , without resorting to sensationalism through the media that may not be fair or may not grant anyone any rights , and instead may negatively affect all the other parties involved in the case , " the statement said .
The case was handled through normal court procedures , and the woman , her male companion and the rapists all agreed in court to the sentences meted out , the statement said .
Under Saudi law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery .
Still , the government 's handling of the matter has sparked anger among human rights groups .
" Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself , " said Fawzeyah al - Oyouni , founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women 's Rights .
The woman and the man were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him , according to al - Lahim .
Citing phone records from the police investigation , al - Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client .
He noted the photo she was seeking to retrieve was innocuous .
Al - Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing next month at the Ministry of Justice , where he faces a possible three - year suspension and disbarment , according to Human Rights Watch .

DENVER ( AP ) -- Kenyon Martin could n't believe the box score , so he does n't expect anybody else to , either .
" A lot of people are going to think it 's a misprint , " Martin said .
" A lot of people will think there 's no way they scored that many points .
It 's unbelievable .
There are no words for it . "
The Nuggets set NBA season highs for points in a half with 84 and points in a game with a 168 - 116 rout of the Seattle SuperSonics on Sunday night .
Denver set a franchise record for most points in a regulation game and fell just 16 points shy of the franchise record for points in a game .
" There was no way that I could n't enjoy the game , not from the way we played offensively , " Nuggets coach George Karl said .
The Nuggets had eight players score in double figures , led by Carmelo Anthony 's 26 and Allen Iverson 's 24 .
Martin had 23 points and Marcus Camby had a triple - double with 13 points , 15 rebounds and a career - high 10 assists .
Still , the only thing the players could talk about was the 168 points they scored in a franchise - record 52 - point win .
" I 've never been a part of a game like this where we won by so many points and scored so many points , " Camby said .
" This is definitely a game I 'm going to keep in my archives . "
Seattle would rather forget this one .
After giving up 138 points to Denver in a 42 - point loss on Feb. 27 -- which was also the previous high for points in the NBA this season -- the SuperSonics had no chance to redeem themselves Sunday .
They gave up an NBA season - high 48 points in the first quarter and trailed by 19 after the first 12 minutes .
It did n't get any better in the second .
Denver eclipsed Phoenix 's record of 80 points in a half with 1:31 left before the break , and at halftime the Nuggets led by 26 .
They led by as many as 55 in the fourth quarter .
" We just lost tonight .
We lost by a lot , " said Seattle forward Chris Wilcox , who had 17 points .
" That 's just something you 're going to have to look back on .
It 's just something you 're going to have to live with . "
Seattle is n't the only team that has been routed by Denver this week .
The Nuggets finished this homestand with three blowout victories .
They beat Memphis by 22 Wednesday night and the Raptors by 32 Friday night .
Sunday , they used the same formula to rout the Sonics .
They shared the ball and hit open shots , and for the second straight game the starters were on the bench in the fourth quarter and let the reserves play mop -up time .
" It 's hard to beat a team when you get 44 assists and making the extra pass , " Martin said .
" It 's tough to beat a team when you play like we did tonight . "
Now the trick for Denver is to keep it going .
The Nuggets are 40 - 26 but trail Golden State by 1½ games for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference .
They start a five - game road trip in Detroit on Tuesday and hope to continue their strong play against the defensive - minded Pistons while trying to comprehend Sunday 's win .
" Like the Rockets winning 22 straight , it 's unheard of on this level , " Martin said .
" Scoring 168 points in regulation is unheard of .
Hopefully we can take what we did these last three games at home onto the road trip . "
Seattle has to regroup after suffering its 51st loss of the season in an embarrassing fashion .
" We get beat that badly , there 's no excuse for that , " Sonics coach P.J. Carlesimo said .
" It matters a lot because we 're professionals and we 're trying to compete -- and we did n't compete tonight . "
Game notes
The Nuggets ' franchise record for points came in a 186 - 184 triple - overtime loss to Detroit on Dec. 13 , 1983 .
...
The previous team record for regulation points was 163 against San Antonio on Jan. 11 , 1984 .
...
The Nuggets are tied for the fourth - best start in franchise history and their best start since 1987 - 88 .
...
The Nuggets set an NBA record with 49 fast - break points , breaking the previous mark of 48 set by Toronto on Jan. 12 , 2003 .
... Kevin Durant led the Sonics with 23 points .
I 'm sure we can all breathe easier now that this little detail has been cleared up in a legal fashion .
Recently , a tabloid magazine publisher offered the sum of $ 500,000 to anyone who could provide incontrovertible proof that one Tom Cruise was , indeed , a homosexual .
The publisher soon received a videotape , from Germany , which purportedly showed the movie star engaged in gay sex .
Cruise found out about it , and immediately filed a $ 100,000,000 lawsuit against the publisher .
The thing went to court , and Cruise won , forcing the publisher to retract any and all statements saying the videotape featured Cruise .
This certainly is n't the first time Cruise has filed , and won , lawsuits to defend his sexual identity .
This case , however , is unusual in that the settlement involves a stipulation that states the magazine publisher must acknowledge , for now and evermore , that " ( Cruise ) is not , and never has been , homosexual and has never had a homosexual affair . "
In other words , Cruise now has his heterosexuality enforced by the courts .
He has forced someone to say something in a legally binding agreement that may or may not be true .
Cruise 's attorney , a gentleman named Bert Fields , stated after the ruling , " He 's not gay and the judge so ruled . "

Rumors about movie star 's sexual preferences have circulated for as long as there have been movie stars .
Everyone from Barbara Stanwyck to Richard Gere have had nasty , queer , and possibly libelous rumors distributed about their choice of sex partners .
None , that I am aware of , have gone about prosecuting the rumors with as much zeal as Mr. Cruise .
I 'm forced to wonder why this is so .
The man , despite admittedly persistent rumors about his sexuality , continues to be one of the biggest movie stars of our times .
The rumors obviously have n't hurt his career .
My wonderings are really a moot point now that Cruise enjoys the legal status of compulsory heterosexual .
However , I do feel just a bit cheated .
I 'm beginning to wonder if we , the moviegoing public should n't now file a class action lawsuit against Cruise himself to force him to defend his new legal status .
I mean , I 've never seen Tom have sex with anyone .
How do I know if he 's gay or straight ?
This is important information to have !
I mean , if I see Tommy up there on the screen banging away at a woman and I do n't know if he 's really straight or not ...
I wo n't be able to enjoy the movie !
What , I 'm supposed to believe the court , and their ruling ?
Did the judge get to see Tom have jungle sex with Nicole or Mimi ... or even Kyle ?
I think not .
So , to put this issue to bed , I propose we all get together , file a lawsuit , and ( especially for the sake of Tom 's ( all adopted2 ) children ) force Mr. Cruise to work to maintain his status as the world 's only legal heterosexual by having him perform the following duties :
Once a month , Cruise must have sex with a woman , on live TV and webcast .
Said sex must be penetrative and ejaculatory .
Tom 's children ( since Cruise has stated that his primary concern about these rumors is that his did - I - mention - they 're - all - adopted - kids will read about them and worry ) must watch this event monthly , so they can be assured that , contrary to rumor and tabloid reporting , Tom is , indeed , a heterosexual .
A representative panel of the moviegoing public must be allowed to question Cruise after the event , to make sure Tom 's thoughts during the procedure did n't waver from the straight and narrow .
Web filtering software should be installed on any and all Internet access devices Cruise owns , to ensure he 's not cheating us by visiting gay or bisexual related websites .
Likewise , only portrayals of male - female sex should be permitted in his collection of erotic art , and UN inspection teams must be allowed to monitor said collection .
Attempts to deny the teams ability to inspect will be met with cruise missile ( heh ) strikes against Tom 's property .
The Dark Side of " Privacy Protections , " Continued :
Last month , I linked to a story about someone who was " convicted of violating state wiretapping laws " for " conceal[ing ] a camera to videotape a Boston University police sergeant ... during a 2006 political protest . "
I wrote that this was outrageous , but entirely consistent with a 2001 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision in Commonwealth v. Hyde , which is based on Massachusetts ' extremely broad privacy law .
The court there upheld a conviction of a person who had " secretly tape recording statements made by police officers during a routine traffic stop " of himself .
This , I argued , was the dark side of " privacy " — a law aimed at protecting privacy ends up wrongly restricting people 's liberty , and people 's ability to protect themselves against police misconduct .
Here 's part of the court 's rationale :
We reject the defendant 's argument that the statute is not applicable because the police officers were performing their public duties , and , therefore , had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their words .
The statute 's preamble expresses the Legislature 's general concern that " the uncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modern electronic surveillance devices pose [ d ] grave dangers to the privacy of all citizens of the commonwealth " and this concern was relied on to justify the ban on the public 's clandestine use of such devices .
And this protection of " privacy " extends not just to allegedly misbehaving cops but even to kidnappers calling in ransom requests : " In Commonwealth v. Jackson , this court rejected the argument that , because a kidnapper has no legitimate privacy interest in telephone calls made for ransom purposes , the secret electronic recording of that conversation by the victim 's brother would not be prohibited .... "
These incidents are n't necessarily an indictment of all such laws .
Perhaps such a law could be properly drafted to exclude audiotaping of conversations with the police , or of conversations with people who one reasonably believes are trying to extort something from you or threaten you .
But the incidents are a warning that not all laws proposed in the name of " privacy " are good , especially when they try to protect one person 's privacy by constraining another 's liberty to record conversations to which one is lawfully a party .
Now there 's another such incident in the news ; the Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly reports :
[ Simon Glik ] will stand trial on Jan. 29 in Boston Municipal Court on charges of wiretapping , aiding an escape and disturbing the peace for allegedly using his cell phone to record the arrest of a 16 - year - old juvenile in a drug case ....
Officer Peter Savalis alleges that attorney Simon Glik was walking in the Boston Common at 5:30 p.m. when he used his phone 's camera to videotape him and two other officers investigating a teen .
" [ He ] reached out and placed his arm into the officer 's way and held out a phone , " according to Savalis ' police report - â€ ” an accusation that Glik denies .
The report then states that [ Glik ] walked around the officers and continued recording the scene .
When one of the officers asked if he was using audio and video on the phone , Glik reportedly said : " I sure am using audio . " ...
I can't speak to whether Glik got close enough to the scene that he was physically interfering with the arrest of the suspect .
But it should n't be illegal for him to audiotape the police officers ( the subject of a separate charge , of which he could be convicted even if the jury finds he did n't physically interfere with the arrest ) .
Yet under Massachusetts law , he may well be guilty , so long as the jury concludes that at least part of the tape recording happened before the officers realized that they were being recorded .
Pretty bad .

" T- rays " , pulses of terahertz radiation , could let art historians see murals hidden beneath coats of plaster or paint in centuries - old buildings in much the same way X - rays let doctors see through skin and could also illuminate penciled sketches under paintings on canvas without harming the artwork , according to new research .
Current methods of imaging underdrawings can't detect certain art materials such as graphite or sanguine , a red chalk that some of the masters are believed to have used .
The team of researchers used terahertz imaging to detect colored paints and a graphite drawing of a butterfly through 4 mm of plaster .
They believe their technique is capable of seeing even deeper .
A paper on the research is published in the February edition of Optics Communications .
In March , the scientists will take their equipment to France to help archaeologists examine a mural they discovered recently behind five layers of plaster in a 12th century church .
" It 's ideal that the method of evaluation for historical artifacts such as frescoes and mural paintings , which are typically an inherent part of a building 's infrastructure , be non-destructive , non-invasive , precise and applicable on site .
Current technologies may satisfy one or more of these requirements , but we believe our new technique can satisfy all of them , " said John Whitaker , an author of the paper who is a research scientist and adjunct professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at U - M .
Terahertz imaging can reveal depth and detail that other techniques cannot , Whitaker said .
And it 's not potentially harmful like X - ray imaging because terahertz radiation is non-ionizing .
Its rays do n't have enough energy to knock electrons off atoms , forming charged particles and causing damage , like X - rays do .
While terahertz radiation is all around us in nature , it has been difficult to produce in a lab because it falls between the capabilities of electronic devices and lasers .
" Terahertz is a strange range in the electromagnetic spectrum because it 's quasi-optical .
It is light , but it is n't , " said Bianca Jackson , first author of the paper who is a doctoral student in applied physics .
The device used for this research is a hybrid between electronics and lasers .
It was developed by the Ann - Arbor based company Picometrix .
It 's called the T - Ray™ system , and it uses pulses from an ultra - fast laser to excite a semiconductor antenna , which in turn emits pulses of terahertz radiation .
The rays permeate the plaster , and some reflect back when there is a change in the material .
When they bounce back and how much energy they retain depends on the material they hit .
Different colors of paint , or the presence of graphite , for example , cause tell - tale differences in the amount of energy in the returning waves .
A receiver measures this energy , and the scientists can use the data to produce an image of what lies beneath , Jackson explained .
A similar device made by Picometrix is used routinely to examine the foam on the space shuttle 's fuel tanks for underlying damage , said Irl Duling , director of terahertz business development at Picometrix and an author of the paper .
This paper discusses a new application , rather than a new device .
Gèrard Mourou , a U - M electrical engineering professor emeritus , said he believes this technique will be especially useful in Europe , where historic regime changes often resulted in artworks being plastered or painted over .
This was common in places of worship , some of which switched from churches to mosques and vice versa over the centuries .
" In France alone , you have 100,000 churches , " Mourou said .
" In many of these places , we know there is something hidden .
It has already been written about .
This is a quick way to find it . "
And Leonardo DaVinci's " The Battle of Anghiari , " for example , is believed to lurk beneath other frescos at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence , Italy , Mourou said .
The paper is called " Terahertz imaging for non-destructive evaluation of mural paintings . "
Mourou is the A. D. Moore Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
He currently holds a position at the Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquèe .
Other authors are : Steven Williamson of Picometrix ; Marie Mourou , a U - M undergraduate student ; and Michel Menu , of the Center for Research and Restoration at The Louvre Museum .
The C.I.A. inspector general ’s report on the agency ’s failures before Sept. 11 was devastating — but not because it showed that America ’s spies missed the rise of Al Qaeda .
George Tenet , then the director of central intelligence , rang the Qaeda alarm .
He sent a memo to the entire intelligence community saying that he wanted no effort spared in the “ war ” with Osama bin Laden .
He took on the president ’s closest advisers to agitate for a strike on a Qaeda base in Afghanistan .
The disturbing thing was that this all happened under President Bill Clinton .
When George W. Bush won the White House , Mr. Tenet seems to have shifted his priorities .
The C.I.A. chief suddenly seemed consumed with hanging on to his job .
The Bush team was so busy in 2001 trying to upend America ’s global relationships according to a neo-conservative agenda that the then national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , did not see any urgency in reports that Al Qaeda was determined to strike in the United States .
Mr. Tenet later helped hype the “ slam dunk ” intelligence that Mr. Bush used to justify diverting the military from the war of necessity against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan to the war of choice in Iraq .
Another disturbing aspect of the report released on Tuesday was its date , June 2005 , which neatly sums up Mr. Bush ’s policies on transparency and accountability — he does n’t believe in either .
Perhaps it ’s not surprising that the report was n’t released in 2005 .
Mr. Bush had just given Mr. Tenet the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his “ pivotal ” role in fighting Al Qaeda .
Years behind the lab bench taught Moshe Pritsker that the trickiest part of any science experiment is n't the hypothesis , it 's the method .
The former Harvard researcher learned this lesson back in his student days , after carefully following the instructions on a specialized kit for isolating DNA .
" Surprise , " Pritsker says , " no DNA ! "
A colleague finally showed him how to make the kit work .
And that gave Pritsker an idea : methodology porn .
The Web site he cofounded , the Journal of Visualized Experiments , launched last October .
Now its videos of experimental procedures and techniques — from stem - cell culture prep to hippocampal dye injection — get 300 pageviews a day .
The journal 's still a work in progress ( nothing 's gone viral yet ) , but just wait .
" No one has published results in video before , " Pritsker says .
" Scientists do n't know how to do it . "
Here are a few of the journal 's faves .

New research shows that wearing glasses does not mean you are a nerd , but it could be a sign that you are more intelligent .
The study from the University of Melbourne 's Centre for Eye Research shows there are no links between myopia or short - sightedness and introversion or conscientiousness , the socially withdrawn and hard - working personality traits often associated with nerds .
The study 's lead author , Associate Professor Paul Baird , says this research , which has been investigating a number of factors linked to myopia including personality , puts to rest a popular stereotype in the scientific community as well as the general population .
" I was reading a text book a couple of nights ago and it said 'we have to conclude that people who are introverted have an association with myopia ' and this was written 10 years ago , " Professor Baird said .
" I found it very perplexing that people would go along with this view without having done the study . "
Researchers sent questionnaires to 633 twins and a comparative group of 278 members of families with myopia .
Participants were rated on five personality traits : extroversion , conscientiousness , openness , agreeableness and neuroticism .
" All those 278 people came from families with myopia , so if we 're going to find something that 's a personality trait then you think it would be in those families , " Professor Baird said .
" [ But ] we could n't find anything associated with introversion , conscientiousness or passiveness . "
However the research , which is published in the latest issue of the journal Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science , did find links between myopia , agreeableness and openness .
Professor Baird says the association between myopia and agreeableness was only detected in the twins and was not overly significant .
But the link between myopia and openness was stronger .
Associate Professor Nick Haslam , from the university 's department of psychology , says openness is the only personality trait that appears to be linked to myopia .
" Openness is one of the only personality traits that correlates with intelligence and people who score highly on this tend to have a wide range of interests , are often well - educated and widely read , " he said .
This fits in with the long - held view that people who are better educated , read and write more and are more intelligent are more likely to be myopic .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. missile strike in southern Somalia on Monday targeted a man wanted by the FBI , two senior U.S. officials said Tuesday .
Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan is wanted for questioning in 2002 attacks in Kenya , including a hotel suicide blast .
It is unclear whether Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan was killed when a U.S. submarine fired a Tomahawk missile at the target , the officials said .
The FBI wants Nabhan , 28 , for questioning in the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli - owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa , Kenya .
Ten Kenyans and three Israelis were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa 's Paradise Hotel .
The bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet , which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members .
Nabhan is also thought to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul , who was indicted for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , according to the FBI .
More than 200 people were killed and 4,000 wounded in the attacks , most of them Kenyans .
The U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda 's East African operations , one senior official said .
The FBI announced in February 2006 that it was seeking information on Nabhan and any possible links to those incidents .
The Pentagon confirmed Monday that the U.S. military struck " a target against a known al Qaeda terrorist . "
The strike hit near the town of Dhoobley along the Somali - Kenyan border , a U.S. military official said Monday .
It was aimed at a " facility where there were known terrorists " affiliated with East African al Qaeda operations , the official said .
Watch report on what U.S. calls a precision strike »
The strike destroyed two houses , killing three women and three children and wounding another 20 people , said Dhoobley 's district commissioner , Ali Nur Ali Dherre .
Dherre said the remains of the missiles were marked " US K . "
Villagers fled in fear of another attack , Dherre said , adding that he did not know of any Islamist extremists in the village .
While referring questions about details of the strike to the Pentagon , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that " the United States is going to go after al Qaeda and al Qaeda - affiliated operatives wherever we find them . "
" They are plotting and planning all over the world to destabilize the world , to inflict terror , and where we find them , we are going to go after them , " he said .
The United States conducted similar strikes in southern Somalia in January 2007 against al Qaeda targets .
Officials later confirmed that they did not believe that they achieved their goal .
The 2007 targets also included members of the Islamic Courts Union , who had recently been driven out of power in Somalia by Ethiopian - backed Somali troops .
Washington accuses the Islamic movement of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda , including the suspect in the 1998 embassy bombings .

Wright 's Rantings Wo n't Sink Obama
Will the Gospel According to Jeremiah Wright sink the Obama candidacy ?
Not very likely .
Let 's start with two basic facts :
( a) Sen. Barack Obama ( Ill. ) has already won the Democratic nomination .
It 's over .
Regardless of how the remaining primaries and caucuses go , including Michigan and even Florida , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( N.Y. ) can never catch Obama in elected delegates .
His current lead of 170 pledged delegates will not be overcome no matter what happens .
Even if Clinton beats him by 10 points in each of these primaries , he will still lead among elected delegates by over 100 .
The superdelegates will not override the will of the voters unless Obama is in jail .
They will not let themselves in for a civil war by overruling a black man who is beloved by the young by going over the heads of the electorate and naming the candidate that lost the primaries as the nominee .
Regardless of how damaged Obama may be by the Wright tapes , it will not provide sufficient cover or cause for them to do so .
( b) Wright 's rantings are not reflective of Obama 's views on anything .
Why did he stay in the church ?
Because he 's a black Chicago politician who comes from a mixed marriage and went to Columbia and Harvard .
Suspected of not being black enough or sufficiently tied to the minority community , he needed the networking opportunities Wright afforded him in his church to get elected .
If he had not risen to the top of Chicago black politics , we would never have heard of him .
But obviously , he can't say that .
So what should he say ?
He needs to get out of this mess with subtlety , the kind Bill Clinton should have used to escape the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- but did n't .
As the controversy continues , Americans will gradually realize that Obama stuck by Wright as part of a need to get ahead .
They will chalk up to pragmatism why he was so close to such a preacher .
As they come to realize that Obama does n't agree with Wright but used him to get started , they will be more forgiving .
While he lets this fact sink in , he needs to continue to distance himself from Wright by characterizing that kind of anger and animosity as a thing of a generation past .
He needs to compare the progress of which whites are proud in discarding the racism of our forebears with his own pride at being a post- racial candidate .
He needs , again and again , to reject what Wright says and emphasize his belief in America and the validity and morality of the American Dream .
As the controversy matures , he can increasingly depict those who fan its flames as trying to live in the past and re-fight the civil wars of race that have divided America .
All these themes were evident and articulately presented in Obama 's Tuesday speech on race .
What Obama needs not to do is to resort to the kind of Clintonian fudging that animated his interview with Keith Olbermann .
By saying " I was n't there " and " I did n't know " and " I did n't hear him say it , " he will invite contempt and derision .
If he were to continue in that vein , he would buy himself a controversy akin to that which drowned John Kerry in the facts and allegations of his service in Vietnam .
People will surface to say , " I sat next to him , and Wright said such and such , " and Obama will be hostage to everybody 's subjective memory .
But if he handles the situation with subtlety and lets what he cannot say -- that it was opportunism that led him to stay in that church -- sink in among the electorate , he can and will survive this battle .
And let 's remember one other thing :
The Democrats will increasingly realize that he will be their nominee and , in continuing this battle , they are eating their own .
Nato is treating the threat of cyber warfare as seriously as the risk of a missile strike , according to a senior official .
A London conference was told that online espionage and internet - based terrorism now represent some of the gravest threats to global security .
Suleyman Anil , who is in charge of protecting Nato against computer attacks , said : " Cyber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security .
" We have seen more of these attacks and we do n't think this problem will disappear soon .
Unless globally supported measures are taken , it can become a global problem . "
Anil , who is head of Nato 's computer incident response centre , told the E - Crime congress in London that the cost of hi-tech strikes on government communications was falling , while the amount of damage they could inflict grew .
Among the chief threats is cyber terrorism , in which attempts are made to shut down online communication networks or use the internet to attack official institutions .
Although some have warned of the possible threat since the 1980s , it is only in recent years that the issue has made it onto the radar of governments around the world .
But Anil also warned of rogue nations who could sponsor internet - based attacks on Nato members .
" There are nations who are not just working on defence capabilities , but who have attack capabilities - and that brings a new dimension to the whole issue , " he said .
The annual E - Crime congress is one the largest gatherings of those who work to combat cyber crime .
Delegates included banking experts , police and IT industry luminaries , all keen to discover new ways to fight online crime .
The prospect of internet - based warfare has come to the fore after a series of high - profile international attacks .
Last year , it emerged that a gang of hackers , believed to be from China , had infiltrated computer systems at the Pentagon and launched attacks on government networks in Britain , Germany , India and Australia .
US officials , who have labelled the group Titan Rain , have accused them of operating under the auspices of officials in Beijing .
Another strike in Estonia , which has one of the most hi-tech governments in the world , was initially blamed on hackers backed by the Russian authorities .
However only one teenager , an Estonian , has been arrested in connection with the incident so far .
To coincide with the congress , shadow home secretary David Davis will today announce Conservative proposals on online crime - including the creation of a new post of cyber security minister .
The Tory plans also outline the reinstitution of a national hi-tech crimes police squad , and forming a dedicated unit inside the Crown Prosecution Service for dealing with computer crime cases .
" Cybercrime is a growing and serious threat to individuals , business and government .
It is a problem that will continue to escalate as technology changes , " said Davis .
Kevin Poulsen , a former hacker who is now an editor with technology magazine Wired , has accused politicians and the media of overplaying the fear factor .
" In some ways , Estonia 's attacks were less sophisticated than previous ' cyberwars ' - like those between Israeli and Palestinian hackers , India and Pakistan , China and the US , " he said .
" Even those attacks fell short of a cyber war , at least as experts have defined the term .
I 'm sceptical that real cyber war , or cyber terrorism , will ever take place . "
Despite the lack of hard evidence on the nature or identities of cyber terrorists , however , the threat is deemed serious enough for the White House to allocate $ 6bn ( £ 3 bn ) for strengthening its systems against attack .
Those plans have been characterised by critics as a potential invasion of civil liberties .
Bush administration officials say they are a necessary defensive measure .
Homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff has called it " one area where we have significant work to do " .
“ I doubted what Indonesia now had to offer and wearied of being new all over again , ” he wrote in his memoir .
“ More than that , I ’d arrived at an unspoken pact with my grandparents : I could live with them and they ’d leave me alone so long as I kept my trouble out of sight . ”
During those years , he was “ engaged in a fitful interior struggle .
I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America . ”
Ms. Soetoro - Ng recalled her mother ’s quandary .
“ She wanted him to be with her , ” Ms. Soetoro - Ng said .
But she added : “ Although it was painful to be separated from him for his last four years of high school , she recognized that it was perhaps the best thing for him .
And she had to go to Indonesia at that time . ”

That time apart was hard for both mother and son .
“ She longed for him , ” said Georgia McCauley , who became a friend of Ms. Soetoro in Jakarta .
Barack spent summers and Christmas vacations with his mother ; they communicated by letters , his illustrated with cartoons .
Her first topic of conversation was always her son , her female friends said .
As for him , he was grappling with questions of racial identity , alienation and belonging .
“ There were certainly times in his life in those four years when he could have used her presence on a more daily basis , ” Ms. Soetoro - Ng said .
“ But I think he did all right for himself . ”
Fluent in Indonesian , Ms. Soetoro moved with Maya first to Yogyakarta , the center of Javanese handicrafts .
A weaver in college , she was fascinated with what Ms. Soetoro - Ng calls “ life ’s gorgeous minutiae . ”
That interest inspired her study of village industries , which became the basis of her 1992 doctoral dissertation .
“ She loved living in Java , ” said Dr. Dewey , who recalled accompanying Ms. Soetoro to a metalworking village .
“ People said : ‘ Hi !
How are you ? ’
She said : ‘ How ’s your wife ?
Did your daughter have the baby ? ’
They were friends .
Then she ’d whip out her notebook and she ’d say : ‘ How many of you have electricity ?
Are you having trouble getting iron ? ’ ”
She became a consultant for the United States Agency for International Development on setting up a village credit program , then a Ford Foundation program officer in Jakarta specializing in women ’s work .
Later , she was a consultant in Pakistan , then joined Indonesia ’s oldest bank to work on what is described as the world ’s largest sustainable microfinance program , creating services like credit and savings for the poor .
Illinois Representative Karen May ( D - Highland ) has introduced a bill calling for a system of renewable energy “ feed - in tariffs ” ( FITs ) like those used in Germany to spur the development of electricity from renewable sources .
After its initial reading , HB 5855 , The Illinois Renewable Energy Sources
Act has been reported to the House Rules Committee for initial action .
Feed - in tariffs have proven remarkably successful throughout Europe , and especially in Germany , where some 55 % of the world ’s solar power capacity resides .
I have covered the nuts and bolts of the FIT here and I have made a short argument for them here ( but for a more comprehensive treatment of how and why the policy mechanism works , I recommend visiting the World Future Council ’s PACT website , which is a powerful resource for advocates , policymakers , environmentalists , tech geeks and regular folks ) .
In a nutshell , a feed - in tariff offers a long - term guaranteed price contract ( usually about 15 - 20 years ) to any entity that contributes electricity to the grid via renewable sources like solar , wind , biomass , landfill gas , small hydro , geothermal and methane .
Whereas existing policy mechanisms like the production tax credit favor large corporations with sizable tax liability , and investment tax credits favor those folks who can afford a large upfront cost that comes with a 20 - 30 year payoff , this policy tool encourages the distributed generation of renewable energy and it levels the playing field by providing long - term investment security for small businesses , homeowners , churches , schools and others , so they are more willing to make the financial commitment that is necessary for installing renewable energy themselves .
This is not to say that our existing RE policy tools of choice ( including renewable energy standards ) are inherently bad , but they may be insufficient to spark the kind of growth in clean energy the public seems to be demanding .
The diffusion of renewable energy FITs has extended from Northern Europe to include some 47 countries worldwide , but the mechanism has yet to gain much political traction in the United States .
The bill is modeled after the legislation proposed in the fall of 2007 , when Rep. Kathleen Law introduced HB 5218 into the Michigan House of Representatives .

I was surprised that the writers of comments over at Salon.com did not know the below .
It is common knowledge to anyone interested in genealogy .
I know that it is hard for people invested in a hard East /
West dichotomy to imagine that the icon of Western civilization , the British royal family , has Arab Muslim antecedents ( along with a host of other nationalities of course . )
But it does .
The Greater Mediterranean got all mixed up over millennia .
Most Sicilians ( i.e. most Italian - Americans ) also have Arab Muslim ancestors .
It works the other way around , too .
It is obvious that a lot of Egyptians , Lebanese and Jordanians have descent from the Christian European Crusaders .
This is connected to just pointing out that having ancestors named Hussein is more common among Europeans and Americans than is usually realized .
Elizabeth II ca n’t be descended from the Prophet Muhammad without also being descended from his grandson , the original Husayn / Hussein , since that is the line of descent of the Sayyids .
' Second - class delegates '
A co-chairman of Hillary 's Michigan campaign and has a line that 's sure to drive a whole bunch of red state governors up the wall :
" Superdelegates are not second - class delegates , " says Joel Ferguson , who will be a superdelegate if Michigan is seated .
" The real second - class delegates are the delegates that are picked in red - state caucuses that are never going to vote Democratic . "
How do you spell relief ?
P - A - Y . . .
M- O - R-E .
In a study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , researchers found that people given identical pills got greater pain relief from the one they were told cost $ 2.50 than from one supposedly costing 10 cents .
“ We all know that we expect more from products with high prices and good names , and we wanted to see if these things could change how we react to pain medication , ” said MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely , who led the research .
“ The answer seems to be yes . ”

Ariely said the findings might help explain why many people report that generic drugs are less effective than their branded equivalents , and why a substantial number of patients prefer costly pain relievers such as Celebrex to cheap alternatives like aspirin .
Previous studies have shown that price has a powerful impact on the psychology of consumers .
Researchers at Caltech reported in January that expensive wine was experienced as being more pleasant - tasting than identical wine that supposedly cost less .
In an earlier experiment , Ariely found that people given inexpensive energy drinks felt more tired and worked out less than those who received identical energy drinks that cost more .

In the latest study , which was funded by MIT , 82 volunteers were asked to rate the intensity of electric shocks administered to their wrists before and after they received a dummy pain pill .
Tests subjects did not know they received a placebo .
Rather , they were told the pill was a new opioid painkiller similar to codeine but faster - acting .
Each participant received a colorful brochure touting the drug as “ an exciting new medication ” that could provide “ up to 8 hours ” of pain relief .
Placebos have been shown to alleviate mild to modest pain .
Scientists believe that the anticipation of pain relief triggers the release of endorphins -- opiate - like substances produced by the body .
Ariely and colleagues wanted to see if price -- a signal of quality -- could amplify or reduce the placebo effect .

Half of the study participants were told that the drug had a regular price of $ 2.50 a pill .
The remaining subjects were told that the new medication had been discounted to 10 cents a pill .
No explanation was given for the price cut .
In the findings , 85 % of subjects who received regular - priced pills reported feeling less pain after taking the dummy medication , compared with 61 % of those who received the supposedly discounted pills , researchers said .
Ariely said enthusiasm on the part of physicians about the lower - priced medications they prescribe might counteract patients ’ negative feelings -- and improve the effectiveness of the drugs .
But the idea needs to be tested , he said .
“ How do we give people a cheaper medication , or a generic , without them thinking it wo n’t work ? ” he said .

Wilfred Emmanuel - Jones is no stranger to struggle .
He battled his way out of inner-city Birmingham , served in the Army , carved out a career in television , set up a successful marketing agency , then became famous as Britain 's only black farmer .
But now he faces the fight of his life : against the British National Party .
Selected to contest the Wiltshire constituency of Chippenham for the Conservatives , Mr Emmanuel - Jones appears a model candidate .
He has charisma , an astonishing story of personal triumph and strong links to the local community .
That community , though , is almost exclusively white .
And the candidate was born in Jamaica .
That fact , it seems , has not been lost on the far - right BNP .
Chippenham is safe
Tory territory – and likely to remain so .
Yet the BNP 's decision to make a foray into the shires threatens to bring racial politics to the English countryside .
Opponents warned yesterday there was little doubt that the BNP would be making a subliminal appeal to voters ' prejudices over their prospective MP 's ethnicity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Emmanuel - Jones is exactly just the kind of candidate that David Cameron has championed to try to demonstrate that the Tories now reflect contemporary Britain .
He came to the UK from Jamaica as a three - year - old and grew up in the Small Heath area of Birmingham as one of nine children .
He left school without qualifications and joined the Army for a year .
From there he found success in television – with the BBC's Food And Drink – and through a food marketing company he then set up .
Subsequently , as a farmer , he set up a scheme for inner-city children to learn about rural life .
Unsurprisingly , Mr Emmanuel - Jones was brought on to Mr Cameron 's " A - list " of favoured candidates .
Until a few days ago it seemed a straightforward election .
But the arrival of a BNP candidate , Mick Simpkins , has added a toxic note to the contest .
" Because I 'm a black candidate in a high - profile seat , they have thought they ... will try and stir it up , " said Mr Emmanuel - Jones .
He insisted he had not picked up any " vibes " that race would be an issue .
" It took a massive amount of courage for the people of Chippenham to select someone like me because Wiltshire is , in a sense , the soul of traditional rural England , a true blue area . "
He also said he was not concerned by the occasional threatening email he received .
" If you are black and going into public life , there are oddballs who are going to try and frighten you . "
Mr Simpkins , a taxi driver , became the BNP 's only councillor in the South - west last year after he was elected unopposed to the town council in Corsham , which is part of the constituency .
He said : " I 've met Mr Emmanuel - Jones and he 's a very nice guy .
The fact he is black has nothing to do with why I 'm standing .
I 'm standing because that 's my constituency and it's where I live . "
Gerry Gable , of the anti-racist group Searchlight , said : " We 're concerned wherever the BNP field candidates .
They are a cancer within British society but ... [ Mr Emmanuel - Jones ] will give them a bloody good run for their money . "
Mud flowed down Mt Ruapehu 's slopes but no lava was produced
The eruption at Mt Ruapehu triggered two mud flows , while pilots spotted ash clouds 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) above its peak .
Around 50 people were evacuated from ski lodges on the mountain , while roads and train lines were briefly closed .
The climber was hurt when rocks crashed through the roof of a mountain hut where he and three others were staying .
William
Pike 's legs were crushed by a boulder , trapping him .
The 22 - year - old teacher was taken to hospital in Waikato , where he was said to be in a serious condition .
Two other workers at a ski area suffered minor injuries , a council official said .
Impact craters
Vulcanologist Brad Scott flew over the site after the short eruption on Tuesday evening .
Mt Ruapehu is one of New Zealand 's most active volcanoes
" The top of the mountain is black , covered in crater - lake mud and ash , " he told Radio New Zealand .
Craters caused by rocks and debris could be seen up to 1.5 km ( almost one mile ) from the summit , he said .
The eruption was caused by the build - up of steam under the crater lake rather than new lava flowing into the volcano , he said .
Experts have not ruled out further eruptions and the mountain 's ski area remains closed , the Dominion Post reported .
At 2,797 metres ( 9177 feet ) , Ruapehu is the North Island 's highest mountain and one of New Zealand 's most active volcanoes .
An eruption in 1995 sent boulders the size of cars flying through the air .
There are several camps on the concept of a real estate bubble .
Much like a high school clique list , you have your hardcore doomers , your middleliners , your people in the business trying to forecast “ mostly sunny with a chance of rain ” to keep their business going , and then you have the consumers out there trying to make sense of everything and trying to find how this fits into their daily lives .
I think each has some good points , but if there ’s one truth to be had , it ’s that none of us truly know what ’s going to happen .
We can only watch the sky fall and see what damage results .
Nouriel Roubini writes on his blog that this housing bubble we ’re currently experiencing will be “ MUCH worse ” than the 1998 Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) liquidity crisis .
Remember the term “ Too Big To Fail ” because we ’ll be hearing more about it .
LTCM was a hedge fund that had amazing success with returns of over 40 % in its first years , only to eventually lose $ 4.6 billion dollars in less than 4 months .
It was considered “ Too Big To Fail ” because the effects on the US market would be disastrous if it did .
Now we ’re starting to hear the same about some of the companies who hold pieces of your mortgage once your bank sells it on the secondary market and it gets repackaged into pieces of multiple investments .
But why is today ’s bubble so much more dangerous than previous financial disasters ?
There ’s four :
“ You have hundreds of thousands of US households who are insolvent on their mortgages .
And this is not just a subprime problem : the same reckless lending practices used in subprime …. were used for near prime , Alt - A loans , hybrid prime ARMs , home equity loans , piggyback loans .
More than 50 % of all mortgage originations in 2005 and 2006 had this toxic waste characteristics .
That is why you will have hundreds of thousands – perhaps over a million – of subprime , near prime and prime borrowers who will end up in delinquency , default and foreclosure .
Lots of insolvent borrowers . ”
Importance :
This is important because most people in the business and those afraid of inciting panic keep mentioning “ containment ” and how this bubble only affects subprime .
The problem is that the products used to finance the homeowners now unable to make payments were not solely subprime but often a mixture .

“ You also have lots of insolvent mortgage lenders – not just the 60 plus subprime ones who have gone out of business – but also plenty of near prime and prime ones . ”
Importance :
There is an upwards gravity in the marketplace and bubbles like ours tend to pop “ up ” .
Imagine getting the corner of a napkin wet – notice how the water slowly creeps up the napkin ?
The same happens the longer the prime lenders remain exposed to that bubble .

“ You will also have – soon enough – plenty of insolvent home builders .
Many small ones have gone out of business ; now it is likely that some of the larger ones will follow in the next few months . ”
Importance : Many people not only bought up to the max they could ( not ) afford , but also from small builders .
When warranty claims start going unanswered , or building defects start to become apparent , as these builders go out of business – a lot of homeowners will be left holding broken homes to complement their broken mortgages .

Importance : Picture a daycare full of small children .
Imagine one child getting sick with an infectious disease .
Exposure to that child , even though nobody knows how serious the illness is , continues to slowly infect the other children .
The subprime crisis has been an interesting “ dye test ” to see how far subprime reaches .
We ’re learning more and more every day that there was never any way to just keep subprime “ contained ” .
So Why Exactly Is This Housing Bubble Different ?
As Roubini goes on to explain :
Why ?
Insolvency versus illiquidity .
A liquidity problem occurs when a household , firm , country , etc is still solvent , but faces a sudden crisis , where a creditor is unwilling to refinance their claims for example .
An insolvent debtor does not only face a liquidity problem , but could not pay the claims upon them over time , even if there were no liquidity problem .
One , broadly , suggests sound fundamentals ; the other very much not so .
And just hours later , Reuters reported the following :
Countrywide , the US largest mortgage lender , announced that it faces “ unprecedented disruptions ” in the debt market and secondary market for mortgages that “ could have an adverse impact on the company ’s earnings and financial condition , particularly in the short - term . ”
Same for WaMu .
This is a serious and scary development .
Yahoo Inc.'s rejection of Microsoft Corp .'s buyout bid will test whether the software giant is willing to pay a lot more for the Internet company -- or risk a truly hostile takeover attempt .
Microsoft may sweeten its offer , say people familiar with the matter .
But any increase is likely to fall short of what Yahoo 's directors believe would fairly value the company , the people say , setting the stage for a protracted battle .
People close to Microsoft say the software giant is reluctant to launch a proxy fight to push out Yahoo's board .
A fight could increase the odds that key Yahoo employees will leave the company , these people say .
It is more likely to pursue less - hostile options , such as recruiting big shareholders to put pressure on Yahoo to negotiate with Microsoft for an acceptable price .
Yahoo directors concluded after a meeting Friday that the unsolicited offer -- worth nearly $ 45 billion when it was announced on Jan. 31 -- " massively undervalues " Yahoo , according to a person familiar with the situation .
The board plans to send a letter to Microsoft today , spelling out its position .
Analysts have expected Microsoft to increase its $ 31 - a- share offer .
But Yahoo is pressing for at least $ 40 a share , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Such a premium would increase the value of Microsoft 's original cash - and - stock bid by more than $ 12 billion .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosure filings nationwide jumped 60 % in February compared with the same month last year , but they decreased slightly versus January , according to a report released Thursday .
RealtyTrac , an online marketer of foreclosure properties , said 223,651 homes got hit with foreclosure filings last month , which include default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions .
46,508 of those were lost to bank repossessions , which more than doubled over last year .
The report also indicated that foreclosure filings in February fell 4 % compared with January , similar to a 6 % decrease that occurred during the same time - span in 2007 .
The monthly decrease is a " seasonal occurrence , " according to Rick Sharga , a Realty Trac spokesman .
Foreclosure rates spike in January when homeowners are saddled with extra debt from the holidays , then settle in February , he said .
The report suggests that efforts from government and consumer groups to combat the rising number of foreclosures have not had a significant impact , according to Jared Bernstein , a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute .
" I do n't see evidence that any of the interventions we 've been implementing are having any effect , " he said .
The report " does n't show that measures have failed but it 's pretty clear that nothing we 've undertaken is slowing foreclosures . "
Sharga pointed out that the most recent action by the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the credit markets could help the mortgage market , though he agreed with Bernstein that " the previously announced government initiatives have n't had any effect . "
Nevada , California and Florida had the highest foreclosure filing rates in the nation .
One in every 165 households in Nevada received a filing in February , up 68 % from a year ago and more than three times the national average .
Home prices surged in all three states during the housing boom , partly due to investment by speculative buyers , but they have fallen dramatically since last summer .
In California , foreclosure activity was up 131 % year - over - year with a total of 53,629 filings .
Florida reported 32,447 foreclosure filings , up 69 % over the same period last year .
Metro areas in California and Florida topped the list of urban centers facing a surge in foreclosure filings .
Florida 's Cape Coral - Fort Myers metro area was the hardest hit in February with one in every 84 households receiving a foreclosure filing - 6.7 times the national average .
Stockton , Calif. , had the second - highest foreclosure rate , where one in every 87 households receiving a filing in February .
Outside of the sun belt , Michigan and Ohio each reported more than 10,000 properties with foreclosure filings in February .
These " Rust Belt " states with struggling economies were originally at the epicenter of the housing crisis that began last year with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market .
Now , states like California and Florida , where speculative investing helped inflate a housing bubble that has since burst , are struggling with a housing glut , record low home prices and skyrocketing foreclosure rates .

BBC science and environment correspondent , Canadian Arctic
Less ice makes it easier to get at the Arctic 's resources
Record summer melting of sea-ice has made the passage fully navigable ; and immediately escalated a dispute over who controls the route .
Canada maintains that the waterway that connects the Atlantic with the Pacific lies within its territorial waters .
It has backed that up with plans for a new military base in the Arctic .
However , the United States , and other countries claim international rights to use the route for shipping .
Big melt
In an interview with BBC News , the head of the Canadian Coast Guard , George Da Pont , said : " Our view is that it 's our territorial waters and that we govern it accordingly .
Obviously the Americans and some European countries have different views .
" I assume at some point in time they 'll get settled but we 're pretty confident that they 're Canadian territorial waters and that we should be regulating and asserting our control over them as we would over any other part of our territorial water .
His statement comes as polar experts are still reeling from the dramatic loss of Arctic ice this summer .
The Canadian Ice Service was among the organisations monitoring the retreat and its director , Doug Bancroft , told the BBC that he was " stunned " that this extent of melting had not been expected for decades .
" It just seemed as if it was n't going to stop .
Normally , towards the end of August , the beginning of September , the melting slows down and stops and we get ready for the coming fall and the refreezing during the winter .
But it just kept on going and the concern was , ' Well when is it going to stop this year ? ' - and ultimately when it did stop , it shattered all previous records . "
Research cruise
On Monday , the Canadian Coast Guard is preparing to send one its research vessels , the Amundsen , through the Northwest Passage with about 40 scientists on board .
Equipped with a remotely operated robot submarine and a sonar system , the ship will undertake a detailed survey of the sea-bed - essential if the waterway is to become more open to commercial shipping .
A British team on board will study the sediment on the sea-bed to hunt for a chemical record of changes in the ice stretching back for the past thousand years - a vital task to help understand the likely rate of change in the future .
BBC News will join the ship for its journey through the Northwest Passage .
The route is at - or beyond - the limits of satellite coverage but the plan is to provide regular updates wherever possible .
Alliance of the Libertarian Left
The Alliance of the Libertarian Left is a multi-tendency coalition of mutualists , agorists , voluntaryists ,
geolibertarians , left - Rothbardians , green libertarians , dialectical anarchists , radical minarchists ,
and others on the libertarian left , united by an opposition to statism and militarism , to cultural
intolerance ( including sexism , racism , and homophobia ) , and to the prevailing corporatist capitalism
falsely called a free market ; as well as by an emphasis on education , direct action , and building
alternative institutions , rather than on electoral politics , as our chief strategy for achieving liberation .
Pure coincidence .
That was the message from the Federal Reserve as it made the announcement that it was giving emergency help to Wall Street banks , just as dreadful employment numbers were announced .
If you believe that , as the saying goes , you will believe anything .
The Fed knew about the fall in non-farm payrolls , knew what the reaction of the financial markets would be , and took pre-emptive action .
The impact , though , was short - lived .
Wall Street has a touching faith in the omniscience and the omnipotence of the Fed , but it is not quite that gullible .
So what is the explanation for the Fed 's action ?
There are three points to bear in mind .
The first is that today 's employment report is the clearest indication yet that the US economy is in recession , with the slump in the housing market spreading to other sectors .
The second is that the credit crunch has entered a new and potentially even more dangerous phase .
Despite cuts in the Fed funds rates , interest rates paid by companies and individual borrowers have been rising as credit has become scarcer and , as a result , more expensive .
The Fed funds rate has been slashed from 5.25 % last summer to 3 % today — and will be cut again on March 19 , but the fear is that the US central bank is , as Keynes once put it , pushing on a piece of string .
Finally , the Fed 's apparent indifference to the current level of inflation in the US — the headline rate is well above 4 % — has spooked investors in the foreign exchange markets .
The dollar is in freefall , dropping to record lows against the euro and prompting a flight into the safe haven of gold .
This , of course , has added to the upward pressure on the cost of living and has made it more difficult for the Fed to come up with the sort of eye - catching cut in interest rates later this month that the markets were starting to price in .
In recent days , there had been speculation that Ben Bernanke , Fed chairman , might be persuaded to cut rates by 75 points later this month or even announce the second inter-meeting reduction in borrowing costs this year .
Today 's decision to pump extra liquidity into the financial markets is a sign that this is not going to happen .
Quite rightly , the Fed has taken the view that anything other than a half - point cut on March 19 would smack of panic and lead to a meltdown in the dollar .
In truth , though , that may still happen .
The Fed would like us to think it is still in full control of events ; the opposite is the case .
The rumors about Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and the Green Iguana just would n't go away .
The story goes that the Florida governor frequented the Green Iguana , a bar in Tampa , back in the early 1990s when he was just starting his political career .
He was less careful back then , people say , and during his partying at the Green Iguana , he was openly gay .
When I got Rick Calderoni , the bar 's well - known owner , on the phone , I expected him to stonewall me about it .
He did n't .
Calderoni , who is gay , confirmed that Crist came into his bar quite often and that the two of them became friends .
Getting to the point , I asked him if he knew Crist to be gay .
" Yes , " he answered bluntly .
" I just wish he would come out and admit it .
That would be a great thing if he did . "
I asked Calderoni if he was certain that Crist is gay .
He told me that Crist socialized with a gay clique of friends but conceded that he'd never actually seen Crist become intimate with another man .
So how can he be sure Crist is gay ?
" The way he acted , " Calderoni said .
How did he act ?
Calderoni laughed and said , " Very feminine . "
The Green Iguana owner then told me that he knew someone who could provide me more information and that he would have him call me .
The call never came .
It was n't proof .
Just more circumstantial evidence that Florida 's Republican governor is gay , a prevalent rumor in Tallahassee for years .
The topic may soon , however , get some national play .
After helping to deliver Florida in the GOP primary , Crist is widely believed to be on the short list to become John McCain 's nominee for vice president .
If he were to be chosen , imagine how interesting this presidential election would be .
Not only would the American people be asked to vote for the first black president or female commander in chief , but , at least in terms of subtext , also the first gay vice president .
Are they ready for it ?
Do they even care ?
Most voters will tell you they do n't , that they could n't care less about anyone 's sexuality .
Of course , they are n't telling the truth .
Human nature demands that they at least be curious .
But , absent a Jim McGreevy -/ Mark Foley -/ Larry Craig - type scandal , I do n't think the issue would change an election .
If anything , the buzz would only bring more intrigue to the candidate and possibly add to his support .
Being boring is a lot bigger political sin than having sexual secrets in your closet .
Americans knew full well that Bill Clinton was a poonhound before they elected him , did n't they ?
Most Floridians had probably at least heard the rumors about Crist before they elected him governor .
During the election , I reported about two male GOP staffers ' boasts of having had affairs with Crist when he was running for governor in 2006 .
The stories burned across the internet and got a bit of play in the mainstream press .
Crist won in a landslide anyway .
Republicans homophobic ?
Not in Florida .
If McCain chooses Crist , it would be interesting to see how the voracious national press ( as opposed to cautious Florida newspapers ) would handle the issue .
Would the New York Times put a small team of reporters on the story in an effort to dig up the truth ?
I think so .
Just last week , a writer with a major national magazine called me on the topic .
He said he was doing a general piece about the recent spate of Republican outings and scandals , but the V.P. talk surely has given a bit of urgency to the project .
Finding the truth when it comes to Crist , though , is a slippery endeavor .
For years , opposing candidates and private investigators have dug into the matter and found scintillating evidence .
Just no proof .
My own efforts , as the Calderoni interview shows , have gone the same way .
I began looking into the matter about 16 months ago , when a tipster in Fort Lauderdale told me that a young Republican aide had boasted to him at a dinner party that he was having an affair with Crist , who was then Florida 's attorney general .
The tipster , who is gay , said he came forward because he found it terribly hypocritical that Crist opposed gay marriage and adoption by gay couples .
Not to mention the whole pesky " living a lie " thing .
I agreed , and before long , I had found numerous sources who said that GOP insiders Jason Wetherington and Bruce Carlton Jordan had boasted to them about romances with Crist .
Wetherington , who served as a regional director for Katherine Harris ' U.S. Senate campaign and as a legislative aide for state Rep.
Ellyn Bogdanoff , denied that he'd had an affair with Crist ( though , after I started asking questions , he was taken under the wing of Hollywood lawyer Todd Payne and moved to Georgia until the election was over .
Payne , a real estate attorney , would n't comment ) .
Jordan 's story runs a bit deeper .
A member of the pioneering Crum family in Central Florida 's Sumter County , he 's a longtime Tallahassee political operator , a childhood friend of Harris ' , and a convicted felon .
His most recent political title was executive director of the Florida Funeral Home Directors Association .
It was in that capacity that he snagged Crist as a fill - in guest speaker for a convention after then - Gov. Jeb Bush suddenly canceled an event in 2003 .
Two years later , Jordan was fired after it was discovered he'd stolen thousands of dollars from the association for personal vacations .
He was also convicted of two theft - related felonies .
After his arrest , he went to his old friend Harris and asked if she needed a hand for her U.S. Senate campaign .
She quickly hired him as her personal travel aide .
Then Jordan began telling other campaign workers about having a long - term romantic relationship with Crist , who was then running for governor .
Among those he told was campaign pilot Jay Vass , who has worked for numerous GOP officials , including Jeb Bush , Tom Gallagher , and Crist himself .
What Jordan did n't know was that Vass was friends with Gallagher , who at the time was running against Crist in the Republican gubernatorial primary .
Vass and his girlfriend , Dee Dee Hall , gave Gallagher sworn statements about Jordan 's detailed admissions .
Hall even sat down for a videotaped deposition , which I obtained , in which she said that Jordan had told her that Crist was undergoing counseling because he was so conflicted about the relationship .
Since reporting the stories , I have spoken with an ex-boyfriend of Jordan's , who said he too had heard of the affair .
He told me that even before the affair allegedly began , Jordan boasted of his friendship with Crist .
The ex-boyfriend , who traveled in Tallahassee political circles , said Jordan and Crist may have been introduced by a mutual friend named Jennifer Faga , a wealthy socialite from the Hamptons who owned land in Florida and who lived for a time in Tallahassee .
He said that Faga and Jordan both had crushes on Crist and that Jordan apparently won out .
I contacted Faga on the phone and asked if she knew Crist .
" I'm going to say ' no comment ' because I do n't know what you 're calling about , " she said .
Then I asked her if she introduced Jordan to Crist .
" No comment , " she said before hanging up .
Jordan 's ex-boyfriend led me to a Florida lobbyist who he said knew more about Jordan 's alleged affair with Crist .
I called the lobbyist , who commented on the condition of anonymity .
He said that Jordan was dating Crist through much of 2006 .
He said that Jordan shared details with him about what they did together and where they met ( at Jordan 's rented carriage house in Tallahassee 's Southwood development ) .
He said he was with Jordan on several occasions when Crist would allegedly call .
Jordan would tell him " It 's Charlie " and then run off to meet him .
But the lobbyist never actually saw Jordan together with Crist .
He said that , while he assumed his friend was telling the truth , he could n't be sure .
Jordan , he added , boasted about a lot of things he sometimes could n't back up , and he turned out to be a thief .
Jordan , for all his blabbing , has been publicly silent on the issue .
On both occasions that I reached him , the last time being last week , he quickly hung up on me .
When I called Crist about Jordan and Wetherington before the election , he denied not only that he was gay but that he even remembered meeting either man .
So what does it all add up to ?
Well , one thing that is certain is that Jordan and Wetherington ran in rarefied Republican circles and told numerous people , in some detail , that they 'd had romantic relationships with Crist .
I find it hard to believe that both of them were lying about it , but it 's possible .
Could be that Calderoni was mistaken about Crist as well .
Maybe his gaydar was off .
Weirder things have happened .
Oh , well .
Nobody cares anyway , right ?
Mother Nature 's Kings of Pain
What it 's like to have a nail in your heel while walking on hot coals , and more .
Feb. 26 , 2008  -- Certain members of the animal kingdom have a talent for torture , as those of us who have been unlucky enough to experience it can attest .
Maybe you 're swimming at the beach , hiking in the wilderness , or just cleaning out your basement — suddenly you 're on fire , dancing or doubled over , staring at an almost invisible wound and wondering how something so small could hurt so horribly .
We have compiled a Top 10 list ( in no particular order ) of some of the most excruciating stings and bites nature has on offer .
Some are potentially deadly , some are not .
All are absolutely worth avoiding .
Bullet Ant
These inch - long insects are named after their sting ; the pain is likened to being shot .
Most scientists claim the creature has the most excruciating sting of all insects .
" I have had some of the most painful experiences I 've ever had from bullet ant stings , " said Randy Morgan , curator of invertebrates , reptiles and amphibians at the Cincinnati Zoo .
" For two or three hours , it felt like people had just hauled off and whacked me with a baseball bat .
It 's a deep , aching pain . "
The bullet ant sting scores highest on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index , a rating created by entomologist Justin Schmidt , director of the Southwestern Biological Institute , which compares the ouch factors of different insects .
How does he know how much these insects ' stings hurt ?
He 's willingly endured each of them himself .
Schmidt 's rating gives a poetic description of the bullet ant 's sting : " Pure , intense , brilliant pain .
Like fire - walking over flaming charcoal with a three - inch rusty nail in your heel . "
An indigenous tribe in the South America ( the bullet ant 's home territory ) requires their young men to pass a harrowing trial with bullet ants — the boys must wear special mitts that have been lined with hundreds of the angry insects .
Not only must the youths endure the stinging treatment for 10 minutes at a time , they must repeat the process 20 times over again .
Luckily for them , as painful as the sting is , it does no permanent damage .
Box Jellyfish
These diaphanous sea creatures are the bane of tropical beaches .
Considered to be one of the more dangerous critters in the animal kingdom , their tentacles contain extremely powerful venom that can kill humans .
Along with the poison comes extraordinary , burning pain .
The creature 's tentacles discharge tiny needles into the victim 's skin ; each needle contains a cocktail of pain - inducing ingredients that make it " the most painful sting .
There is no question about it , " according to Dr. Joseph Burnett , past chairman of dermatology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" The bullet ant is nothing compared to this . "
What makes the animal so painfully effective are the 10 - foot - long , stinging tentacles .
Unfortunate swimmers can become draped and entangled in these drifting strands , and the intense doses of venom can induce shock and eventual drowning .
While it may seem like nothing but an instrument of torture , " the box jelly did n't develop its horrible toxic venom just to torture people at the beach , " said Don Boyer , curator of reptiles and amphibians at the San Diego Zoo .
The jellyfish requires its powerful poison to catch and eat its preferred prey , shrimp .
Since a struggling shrimp can easily damage the delicate creature , the jellies need to kill their meal as quickly as possible .
Rattlesnakes and Their Relations
If there 's a family of snakes you do n't want to anger , it would be the vipers .
While these snakes do n't always have the most deadly bites , they have the most painful ones .
Van Wallach of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology has had several viper bites ; the worst one , he said , " came from an African bush viper .
It felt like somebody had a blowtorch and was burning you inside your arm . …
It went on for three straight days before I had any relief . "
Kelly Zamudio , a biologist at Cornell University , described a similar sensation when she was bitten by another member of the viper family — the rattlesnake .
" It feels like burning , like you 're being branded , but the brand never lifts , " she said .
The key to the excruciating pain of the viper 's bite is its tissue - destroying venom , which dissolves cell walls and causes internal bleeding .
As the venom works its way through the body , so does the pain .
Vipers ' tissue - eating venom is n't designed to hurt humans , but rather , to get a jump on digesting their food .
When the snake strikes a rodent , bird or another type of prey , the toxins work quickly to help breaking down the tissue and get the meal ready for eating .
Stingrays
Although these animals gained a bad rep after the tragic Steve Irwin incident , stingrays are not aggressive or ( usually ) lethal animals .
However , they have a sting , and on the rare occasion they choose to use it , " it 's very excruciating , " said Edward DeMartini , a research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries .
When these gentle animals are stepped on or threatened , they will strike out with a sharp , serrated barb — about the thickness of a golf pencil — located at the base of the tail .
" The physical wound can be pretty intense , " said Jon Hoech , director of husbandry operations at the Monterey Bay Aquarium .
" It 's extremely painful , like getting punctured with an eight - penny nail .
Also , it 's like a cat scratch , it can carry a lot of bacteria . "
On top of the sizeable puncture wound comes a dose of toxins that cause instantaneous pain .
Stingrays only use their venomous barbs as a defense , not for hunting or attacking .
As many marine biologists , scuba divers and snorkelers know , the animals are the ocean 's pussycats .
" I work with rays on a regular basis , " said Hoech .
" I swim with them , I feed them by hand , and they 're very benign . "
Just be sure to look where you step .
Scorpions
There are thousands of scorpion species , all of them equipped with stings .
Many species ' stings are n't much worse than a bee or hornet ; but a select few can be a serious source of suffering .
" There are scorpions in the Old World that have extremely painful stings , " said Don Boyer .
" It gets worse and worse and worse . "
These types of scorpions — found in Africa and Asia — can be dangerous as well as painful .
However , in the Southwestern United States , the Arizona Bark Scorpion does n't pose much of a threat to healthy adults .
It just means extreme pain .
" If you 're an adult and you get the poison in your finger , it just stays , and fires your pain nerve , " said Dr. Leslie Boyer — no relation to Don Boyer .
" It locks the nerve in the on position . "
Leslie Boyer , who is medical director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center , said that the tiny sting will " send shooting sensations up your arm . "
If you 're clumsy enough to tap or bump that finger on anything , the pain instantly amplifies .
" You just give it a tap and you 're screaming in pain , " said Leslie Boyer .
" Just that one little spot hurts like heck , it radiates up to your arm pit with this throbbing pain — but there 's nothing to see . "
Boyer says that since her practice sees so many painful stings and bites , " I tend to give out morphine like it 's candy . "
Spitting Cobra
While this reptile has a poisonous bite , it does n't actually induce much pain .
Sure , it stops you from breathing , but for the venom to really make you scream , it needs to get into your eyes .
Spitting cobras have perfected the art of defense by shooting venom into an attacker 's eyes , which creates a blinding , burning pain .
Like many other pain - inducing animals , the reason for the agony is to keep attackers away , rather than to stage an offensive .
Van Wallach was unfortunate enough to get the spitting treatment from a cobra in the Philippines .
" It is excruciating , " he said .
" The only way I could relieve it was to pour milk into my eye about every 15 minutes .
I was blind for about four to six hours . "
The cobra 's venom contains a mix of nerve poisons , tissue - destroying chemicals and other nasty compounds designed to elicit severe stinging .
In worst case scenarios , it can lead to permanent blindness .
Should you ever encounter a spitting cobra — which is unlikely as they are fairly rare — make sure to keep a good 10 - foot distance away from it .
Their venom can shoot about four to eight feet .
Tarantula Hawk Wasp
This colorful , solitary wasp uses its stinging power to paralyze large tarantulas as food for its young .
While the insect is not aggressive and rarely stings humans — " you really have to force them to sting you , " said Leslie Boyer — the experience is fabled to be one of the top most painful stings out there .
According to sting expert Schmidt , the tarantula hawk rates just below the agonizing bullet ant .
" When that one when it hits you , it almost feels like you 've been hit by a lightning bolt , " said Schmidt .
" You 'll be screaming and writhing in agony . …
It feels like every gland in your body is purged of all its hormones , you 'll feel absolutely drained from the experience . "
Unlike other animals on this Top 10 list , the tarantula hawk 's venom is not for defense , but for paralyzing its much larger prey , tarantulas .
The mother wasp lays a single egg on the comatose spider , dooming it to a horrific death .
The egg hatches into a hungry larva , which then literally eats the tarantula alive , using it as a food source as it grows .
Stonefish
In terms of a perfect combo of pain and lethality , the homely stonefish 's sting may take first prize .
The stonefish , found in the rocky , shallow waters of tropical oceans , has several extremely sharp spines along its back .
Hapless waders can easily mistake the well - camouflaged fish for a rock or hunk of coral — and if they step on the animal , the spines will puncture the skin and inject a complex and deadly venom .
The pain from the sting is described as instant and intense .
One victim described the experience on an online aquarium enthusiasts ' forum :
" I got spiked on the finger by a stonefish in Australia … never mind a bee sting .
…
Imagine having each knuckle , then the wrist , elbow and shoulder being hit in turn with a sledgehammer over the course of about an hour .
Then about an hour later imagine taking a real kicking to both kidneys for about 45 minutes so that you could n't stand or straighten up .
I was late 20s , pretty fit physically and this was the tiniest of nicks .
Got sensation back in my finger after a few days but had recurrent kidney pains periodically for several years afterwards . "
Other stories describe sting victims wanting to have their stung limb amputated from their body .
Hoech of the Monterey Bay Aquarium has worked closely with the stonefish , and he agreed that the animal " is definitely at the top of the list " of the most pain - producing creatures .
Black Widow Spider
" I never want a bad black widow bite , " said Leslie Boyer , referring to the poisonous spider found all over the southern United States .
Although 95 percent of the spiders ' bites are trivial , if you 're unlucky enough to get nipped by a large , healthy black widow where your skin is thin , the experience can be excruciating .
Leslie Boyer described the time when a rural doctor called her up about an athletic 20 - something man who had been bitten .
" The patient had looked at him and said ' It hurts too much to breathe , ' and then he just stopped , " she said .
" To be awake enough to say that , and then willingly stop breathing — that 's got to be intense pain . "
The black widow bite does n't hurt initially , as the fangs are small .
But an hour and a half later , the venom , which contains a toxic ingredient that interacts with the body 's muscles , causes extreme cramping throughout the body .
" Imagine every muscle in a spasm at the same time , and they wo n't relax for days , " said Leslie Boyer .
But people should n't revile the black widow , she stressed .
" I have them on my porch and in my house , " she said .
" They never leave their webs , you always know where they are — they 're better than a bug zapper . "
Gila Monster
This slow - moving lizard from the Southwest United States packs a surprisingly painful bite .
Cecil Schwalbe , ecologist with the U.S. geological survey , was bit by a Gila monster while handling one in an outreach demonstration in front of 200 people .
He lists it as the most painful bite in his experience .
" My finger was on fire , the wave of fire moved slowly up my body , " Schwalbe said .
Within five minutes I turned pasty green and went into shock . …
I had pain in my kidneys , blood in my urine . …
All of my sphincters in my body were trying to relax .
It was on my finger for two minutes and it bit me five times — every bite went right to the bone . "
The reasons for the pain are twofold .
First , the Gila monster has very sharp teeth , each about a quarter of an inch long .
When the animal bites , it chomps down hard — and does n't let go .
Stories are told of bite victims rushing to the hospital with the lizard still attached .
Second , Gila monsters are equipped with specialized venom , full of compounds that break down collagen and vein membranes , a cocktail that is " built to cause inflammation , and just cause pain — it 's all about pain , " said Beck .
On top of the pain , the venom 's chemicals cause sweating , diarrhea , vomiting and a drop in blood pressure .
The goal of all this misery is to make predators and enemies stay away .
The slow - moving Gila monster can become easy prey , and it relies on its knack for a nasty bite to defend itself .
While the Gila monster 's venom might have caused misery in a few people , it has ended up helping many others ; it 's now the source of a new drug , called Byetta , which treats type Type II Diabetes .
Researchers believe that this drug is just scratching the surface of the potential that venomous species have — each creature in this list produces complex , potentially lifesaving compounds .
Something to keep in mind next time you curse the existence of that pesky bee or sneaky snake .
your question comes with an obvious bias so i will treat it with the distain it deserves
with regard to the regional aspect , your examples of beheading and flogging , care to examine how jolly an electric chair is , or indeed what has been going on in american detention centres for the last few years ? , invading countries , bombing civillians ? , has that not been carried out by those diabolical christian folks ?
wait a minute , i'm christian !
just because some countries and individuals behave in a certain fashion ( and yes corporal punishment and terrorist bombings are barbaric ) you cannot label all who follow the religon as such , muslims in this country generally abide by the rules of this country and live in peace and do not support chopping peoples heads off .
the irony of course is the average mail reader would bring back hanging in a heart beat , of course breaking a neck is far nicer than chopping it through , i mean your head does n't roll around for start , when you 're , ermmm dead :s
in the same way although i'm white and judged to be christian i hope i am not tarnished by association to biggoted hate filled ignorant people who post such nonsense as this thread ... we live in hope
There ’s been considerable discussion , at least online , about John McCain reaching out and embracing televangelist John Hagee , despite Hagee ’s record of attacking people not like him , most notably Catholics , Jews , and gays .
But it ’s worth keeping in mind that there ’s another right - wing televangelist with close ties to McCain whose background deserves closer scrutiny .
Meet Rod Parsley .
Senator John McCain hailed as a spiritual adviser an Ohio megachurch pastor who has called upon Christians to wage a “ war ” against the “ false religion ” of Islam with the aim of destroying it .
On February 26 , McCain appeared at a campaign rally in Cincinnati with the Reverend Rod Parsley of the World Harvest Church of Columbus , a supersize Pentecostal institution that features a 5,200 - seat sanctuary , a television studio ( where Parsley tapes a weekly show ) , and a 122,000 - square - foot Ministry Activity Center .
That day , a week before the Ohio primary , Parsley praised the Republican presidential front - runner as a “ strong , true , consistent conservative . ” …
McCain , with Parsley by his side at the Cincinnati rally , called the evangelical minister a “ spiritual guide . ”
The leader of a 12,000 - member congregation , Parsley has written several books outlining his fundamentalist religious outlook , including the 2005 Silent No More .
In this work , Parsley decries the “ spiritual desperation ” of the United States , and he blasts away at the usual suspects : activist judges , civil libertarians who advocate the separation of church and state , the homosexual “ culture ” ( ” homosexuals are anything but happy and carefree ” ) , the “ abortion industry , ” and the crass and profane entertainment industry .
And Parsley targets another profound threat to the United States : the religion of Islam .
Now , in all likelihood , if Hagee ’s anti-Catholic diatribes did n’t cause McCain any real political trouble , McCain probably wo n’t have to pay too high a price for Parsley ’s anti-Muslim harangues .
It ’s unsettling , but in this political climate , it ’s easier for a right - wing religio- political figure to get away with anti-Muslim animus than anti-Catholic .
But if McCain is going to tout Parsley as a “ spiritual guide , ” it ’s certainly worth learning more about where Parsley might “ guide ” the Republican nominee .
Most notably , Parsley does n’t just hate Islam , he wants to “ destroy ” it .
Here ’s what he wrote in one of his books :
The fact is that America was founded , in part , with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed , and I believe September 11 , 2001 , was a generational call to arms that we can no longer ignore .
From there , the lunacy becomes more predictable .
Parsley argues , for example , that “ Allah was a demon spirit . ”
There is no difference , he argues , between violent Islamic extremists and mainstream Muslim believers .
Keep in mind , Parsley is not just some fringe figure .
In evangelical circles , he ’s something of a powerhouse , and is widely believed to be one of the religious right ’s new major players , after Falwell ’s death and Robertson ’s deterioration .
It ’s precisely why McCain , desperate for support from a right - wing constituency that has never trusted him , would cozy up to this hateful extremist ( or , should I say , another hateful extremist ) .
I suppose waiting for McCain to denounce Parsley ’s anti-Muslim bigotry would take a while , so there ’s hardly any point to asking .
But it would be worthwhile for campaign reporters , always looking for a new angle or story , to ask the senator why he ’d stand alongside a “ spiritual guide ” who believes the United States has to “ destroy ” the “ false religion ” of Islam .
And lest there be any confusion , Parsley is n’t a one - trick pony — sure , he hates Muslims , but his bread and butter includes attacks on gays , abortion , the federal judiciary , and civil libertarians .
Best of all , his rhetoric frequently includes what sounds like appeals to violence , telling his followers , “ I came to incite a riot !
Man your battle stations .
Ready your weapons . ”
( One wants to assume he ’s speaking metaphorically , but it ’s not entirely clear . )
This is the man John McCain has embraced as a politically ally .
Remind me again how he developed a reputation as a moderate ?
Philip Burke
Virtually everybody agrees that 2007 was a terrific year for movies .
No matter .
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will still hand over its statuettes to hearty feel - good blather and life - affirming gimps , while too many worthy films get doughnuted ( or worse , a sound - mixing nod ) .
As a preemptive strike to this wrongheadedness , we offer our ninth annual Alternative Oscars , celebrating last year 's most relevant , astonishing , and overlooked achievements .
Or whatever struck us as funny .
Best Failed Experiment : Grindhouse
Nobody , it seems , wanted to sit through two fake exploitation movies in a row , which is a shame , because they 're both fantastic .
Robert Rodriguez 's zombie epic Planet Terror amounts to the best John Carpenter flick since 1982's The Thing , while Quentin Tarantino 's neatly bifurcated Death Proof , with Kurt Russell as a homicidal stuntman , mows down audience identification like nothing since Hitchcock 's Psycho .
Both films are available separately on video ( in needlessly extended versions ) , but they work much better in tandem -- Death Proof , in particular , needs to be the grimy second half of a double bill for full effect .
And the phony trailers created by Edgar Wright ( Shaun of the Dead ) and Eli Roth ( Hostel ) are more hilarious than anything on Funny or Die .
Best Proof That Cult Movies Are an Accident : Southland Tales
After seeing his first film , Donnie Darko , turn into a sensation on the midnight circuit following a stillborn initial release , Richard Kelly must have decided to skip the respectable phase and go straight for unhinged infamy .
The result : a crass , overblown , painfully sophomoric exercise in apocalyptic sci-fi " comedy , " populated largely by former SNL cast members ( plus the Rock ) mugging and twitching up a storm .
Chockablock with empty , self - conscious literary and topical references , it unfolds as if Jeff Goldblum had attempted to transport a Pynchon novel across his lab but failed to notice that a battered VHS copy of Hudson Hawk had somehow gotten inside the telepod .
Best Gratuitous Nudity : Marisa Tomei , Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead
Actresses tend to be more willing to get naked onscreen when they 're young , unknown , and hungry .
Lately , though , there 's been an influx of long - established celebs who suddenly become allergic to clothes as they hit middle age and the ingenue roles start drying up : Meg Ryan ( In the Cut ) , Jennifer Aniston ( as close as she 's ever come in The Break - Up ) , and now Tomei , who spends much of Sidney Lumet 's heist - gone - wrong picture parading around topless for no particular reason .
Not only does she look delectable at 43 , but her casual exposure gives this contrived and glibly cynical film a disarming frankness that it desperately needs .
Best Film with a Pseudo - Philosophical Bullshit Ending : No Country for Old Men
Great movie , no question -- but while the deliberately unresolved and abruptly thoughtful denouement is bold and utterly faithful to Cormac McCarthy 's novel , it simply does n't work onscreen .
That 's not because we 're all pathetic little children who need an explosive action climax and can't stomach ambiguity .
It 's because McCarthy interweaves Sheriff Ed Tom Bell 's weary ruminations about the changing American landscape throughout the book , whereas the Coen brothers , who are clearly more interested in the niceties of retrieving a briefcase full of drug money from an adjoining hotel room 's air duct than they are in grumpy interior monologues , have fashioned a brutally streamlined thriller that sets pulses racing for nearly two hours before finally making a Hail Mary bid for profundity : " P.S. Everything sucks now . "
Best Documentary : My Kid Could Paint That
Any halfway sentient American is well aware that we 've completely bungled Iraq and that our health - care system is a global embarrassment , so did we really need Charles Ferguson and Michael Moore to lay out those no -duh theses in excruciating detail ?
Meanwhile , the year 's finest documentary , My Kid Could Paint
That , about a four - year - old girl whose abstract art became a minor sensation , raises genuinely tough questions about the exploitation of children and the distinction between creativity and commodity .
It was roundly ignored .
Most Missed Hollywood Practice : Dubbing movie stars in musicals
Back in the good old days , when studios were churning out musicals practically every other week , they 'd simply hire whichever actor was best for the speaking part ( and the box office ) and then get somebody else -- usually Marni Nixon -- to do the singing , uncredited .
Nowadays , however , no star wants to look like Milli Vanilli , and so we get Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter making Tim Burton 's otherwise exceptional adaptation of Sweeney Todd play like community theater every time the orchestra kicks in .
And it 's not as if lip - synching can't be effective , either : Look at George Clooney belting out " I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow " in O Brother , Where Art Thou ?
( actual voice : Dan Tyminski ) and tell me he does n't convince .
Best Insane Opening Sequence : Tie -- Michael Clayton and Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters
It takes serious cojones to kick off a complex legal thriller with a lengthy monologue of paranoid gibberish spoken by a character ( Tom Wilkinson 's bipolar whistle - blower ) who has yet to be introduced .
As audacious as that move was , though , it was trumped by the Aqua Teen crew .
Even if the TV show does nothing for you , rent the movie for its hilarious parody of " turn off your cell phone " theater ads , performed as a death - metal song by a band of pissed - off animated condiments .
( " If I see you videotaping this movie , Satan will rain down your throat with hot acid and dissolve your testicles and turn your guts into snakes ! " )
Best Action Sequence in Which Almost Nothing Actually Happens : The Bourne Ultimatum
The third and best Bourne adventure includes a close - quarters fistfight and a car deliberately driven backward off the roof of a high building .
But it 's the high - tech CIA stakeout of London 's Waterloo Station -- a sequence that mostly consists of Matt Damon 's hyperalert Jason Bourne guiding a bewildered Guardian journalist ( Paddy Considine ) , via cell phone , through a maze of covert - ops assassins and hidden surveillance cameras -- that truly jangles the nerves .
Emphasizing the threat of danger from every direction and the need for not just eternal but downright obsessive vigilance , it 's a sign of the way that even Hollywood blockbusters are gradually shifting to reflect America 's increasingly paranoid landscape .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Today 's Gallup Poll Daily tracking update finds Barack Obama with an eight percentage point advantage over Hillary Clinton ( 50 % to 42 % ) , this gives him a statistically significant advantage for the first time since before the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy .
Obama last held a significant lead over Clinton in March 11 - 13 polling , just before Wright 's controversial sermons came to light and put his former parishioner on the defensive .
Clinton seemed to benefit from the Wright flap , moving into the lead in two consecutive days of tracking releases ( based on March 16 - 18 and March 17 - 19 polling ) .
That lead quickly dissipated and the two candidates retreated into a statistical dead heat , where they have been for much of the recent campaign .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
Obama 's current 8 - point advantage ties his largest lead of the Gallup Poll Daily tracking program , along with a 50 % to 42 % showing in Feb. 28 - March 1 polling .
Obama clearly has weathered the Wright storm , while the dark clouds have shifted to Clinton over whether she has exaggerated her foreign policy credentials .
This week she has had to defend her repeated claim that she came under sniper fire while visiting Bosnia as first lady , which news video clearly disputed .
Many Democrats are concerned that the ongoing nomination campaign -- which has grown increasingly contentious in recent weeks -- will hurt the party in the general election .
Right now , the races remain close , but Republican John McCain has an edge over both Clinton and Obama in registered voters ' general election preferences .
In the new Gallup Poll Daily tracking update , McCain has a statistically significant 4 - point lead over Clinton ( 48 % to 44 % ) and a smaller 2 - point advantage over Obama ( 46 % to 44 % ) .

Last summer while working in the Galapagos Islands I wrote about Planktos , a company that wanted to create plankton blooms near the islands by dumping tons of iron particles into the ocean : Carbon Project Endangers the Galápagos .
Planktos hoped these plankton blooms would ultimately become a lucrative way of removing carbon from the atmosphere .
However in a January issue of the journal Science , a number of international scientists issued a warning that not enough was known to commercialize what is known as iron fertilization of the oceans .
Last summer ’s dumping in the Galapagos never went forward , in part because of strong local objections , concern by marine scientists over unintended impacts and international environmental group protests .
Feb 13 Planktos announced indefinite postponement of the experiment due to lack of investment funds because of “ an effective disinformation campaign ” by those opposing the effort .
Mozilla Labs last week released a new version of Prism , a single - site browser system that brings web applications to the desktop .
The latest version is designed to work as a Firefox extension rather than as a separate XUL application .
Prism makes it possible to launch web sites from the desktop and load them into a simple browser window without all of the extra features and functionality of a regular browser .
This is advantageous for users because it allows them to run those sites in a separate process from their regular Firefox browser and interact with the content without any unnecessary distractions .
Prism also allows web application content to be customized in some ways to make it more conducive to desktop use .
After installing the Prism extension for Firefox , users can select the Convert Website to Application item from Firefox 's Tools menu to bring the currently active site to the desktop .
The website conversion dialog allows users to specify a name for the web application and also to choose whether or not to show the location bar and progress bar .
Prism will then create a shortcut on the desktop with an icon selected by the user .
For testing purposes , I used Prism to create desktop shortcuts both for Twitter and for Clint Ecker 's SteveJobsIsYourNewBicycle.com web application , both of which worked well .
Twitter running in Prism
Creating a Prism webapp
Prism does more than just provide a lighter interface for interactive web applications .
Developers can create custom Prism webapp bundles that include additional JavaScript and CSS for manipulating the content of the web sites .
Developers can add a webapp.js JavaScript file to a webapp bundle to perform custom programming within the Prism chrome window .
This code runs with chrome - level privileges ( much like a Firefox extension ) so it can use Mozilla XPCOM components to read and write files to the local filesystem and perform other system - level activities .
The webapp.js script can also be used to add sidebars to Prism applications .
In a blog entry , Mozilla developer Mark Finkle demonstrates this feature by showing how to add a Google Talk sidebar to a Google Docs webapp .
Firefox 3 offers many advanced capabilities that provide a rich foundation for desktop web applications .
It has basic support for offline web applications , for instance , and it implements some relevant features from the WHATWG Web Applications specification , including offline events and DOM Storage .
The DOM Storage feature provides basic support for data persistence between sessions , and some developers are also experimenting with integrating Google Gears into Prism applications .
Prism supports the same framework for extensions as Firefox does , so it is likely that additional functionality for more elaborate customization will emerge from the developer community .
According to Finkle , Mozilla 's plans for future versions include adding support for minimizing to the tray and adding a new JavaScript API that will expose more native system functionality directly to web applications .
Although Prism provides some compelling mechanisms for manipulating web content , it still requires the content itself to be hosted in the cloud .
Developers who want more flexibility or a standards - based technology that will allow them to use web development techniques to create cross-platform desktop applications that load from the local filesystem should look instead to Mozilla XULRunner , which allows developers to create entire native - looking applications using JavaScript and XML , with support for seamlessly interspersing both local and remote XHTML and SVG content .
Prism remains a nascent and still - experimental technology with limited uses , but it 's a good start that provides a usable foundation for single - site web browsers .
As Prism evolves and becomes capable of exposing more native system capabilities to web applications , its usefulness will grow considerably .

NASHUA , N.H. 
The big question facing Mayor Giuliani heading into tomorrow 's primary here is not so much whether he will win , but whether he can finish ahead of Rep. Ron Paul .
Mr. Paul , the stridently anti-war Texas congressman , nearly tripled Mr. Giuliani 's vote total in Iowa and is running neck - and - neck with him in New Hampshire , with each hovering around the 10 % mark in the polls .
For Mr. Giuliani , the undercard bout with Mr. Paul is the starkest sign yet of how far his star has fallen in recent months .
In a debate last May , Mr. Paul served as the foil for what may have been the highlight of Mr. Giuliani 's campaign , when the former mayor demanded that he apologize for suggesting that America 's presence in the Middle East had caused the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
While Mr. Giuliani was then the undisputed Republican frontrunner , his campaign is now treading water , looking for solid but unspectacular performances in the next three primaries and to stay afloat until the vote in Florida in three weeks .
Though analysts and even some Giuliani supporters are skeptical of that strategy , nearly all agree it is the only option he has left .
But what is largely left unsaid is that finishing behind Mitt Romney and Senator McCain is one thing , while losing twice in a row to a candidate once considered the GOP fringe 's equivalent of Rep. Dennis Kucinich is quite another .
" That would be embarrassing , " an associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire , Dante Scala , said .
In interviews after Saturday night 's debate in Manchester , advisers to Mr. Giuliani said they placed no particular importance in beating Mr. Paul here .
But the campaign manager , Michael DuHaime , did add Mr. Paul to the handful of GOP hopefuls considered " serious candidates . "
" He gets a chunk of votes , " Mr. DuHaime said , " and anyone who gets a chunk of votes deserves to be taken seriously in terms of how they weigh in the race . "
The advisers stuck to the campaign 's message of saying that Mr. Giuliani 's goal for New Hampshire was a " strong finish , " without defining what that entails .
One top supporter , however , did offer up a number .
" The top four , " said Rep. Peter King of Long Island , a surrogate traveling with Mr. Giuliani in New Hampshire .
" It keeps him competitive . "
Based on the current line - up of Republicans in the state polls , it also keeps him above Mr. Paul , with Mr. McCain , Mr. Romney , and the Iowa winner , Michael Huckabee , ahead of him .
In a CNN / WMUR poll released yesterday , Mr. McCain was leading with 32 % , followed by Mr. Romney with 26 % and Mr. Huckabee with 14 % .
Mr. Giuliani edged Mr. Paul , 11 % to 10 % .
A USA Today / Gallop poll , also released yesterday , showed Mr. McCain leading with 34 % , while Messrs .
Giuliani and Paul were tied at 8 % .
A weak finish in New Hampshire could be more damaging to Mr. Giuliani than it was in Iowa because he has made a much more aggressive effort here .
He is running television ads in the state , which he did not do in Iowa , and he acknowledged in a news conference yesterday that he has spent as much time in New Hampshire as he has in any other state .
The electorate also seems to set up well for him in New Hampshire , with its prevalence of independent and fiscally conservative voters over the social conservatives who dominate in Iowa .
" This is a place where he could have done well , and arguably , should have done well , " Mr. Scala said .
Still , Mr. Giuliani's campaign is modest here .
More than 200 people packed a house party for him yesterday in Hollis , N.H. , but it was his only event with voters of the day .
He later held a press conference to announce the endorsement of the New England Police Benevolent Association before attending a candidate forum last night .
He refused to predict an outcome , saying he hoped only to do " the very best I can do . "
" My candidacy is an unconventional candidacy , " he said , adding that he had exceeded expectations simply by being in contention at this point in the race  a curious statement from a man considered the party 's front - runner for long stretches of last year .
Speaking at the house party , he kept a positive message , although he did manage to get a dig in at Mr. Paul .
Asked about his possible Cabinet , Mr. Giuliani cited President Lincoln , who named party rivals as his top advisers .
He then joked that his Cabinet could comprise all of the Republicans on the debate stage Saturday night , " maybe with one exception . "
The crowd laughed , though it was initially unclear whether he was referring to Mr. Paul or Mr. Romney , who was roundly criticized at the debate .
He later acknowledged it was Mr. Paul , citing his " isolationist " foreign policy views .
Advocating dramatic cuts in the size of government , a strong American dollar , and a foreign policy of nonintervention , Mr. Paul has generated a significant grassroots following , both on the Internet and on the ground in New Hampshire .
His fund - raising strength also has astonished the political establishment .
He reported raising $ 19 million in the fourth quarter alone , outpacing all other Republicans .
In the Iowa caucuses , Mr. Paul finished with 10 % of the vote , while Mr. Giuliani had 3.5 % .
It was a result the Paul campaign relished , particularly considering their repeated fights over foreign policy during the GOP debates .
" We loved that , " Mr. Paul 's son , Rand Paul , told The New York Sun .
He said the campaign " really hoped to beat up on the mayor in New Hampshire , too . "
The Granite State could be even more fertile ground than Iowa for Mr. Paul , who ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988 .
As his supporters often mention , the state motto is " Live Free or Die . "
" They 're more libertarian in that sense .
Iowa 's just not the same way , " Rand Paul said .
FDA : Deadly blood - thinning drug produced in China may contain bogus ingredient Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday March 5 , 2008

This A blood thinner tied to the deaths of at least 19 people in the U.S. has a " possibly counterfeit ingredient , " a federal agency revealed .
Raw components of the drug , heparin , are produced in China , reports The New York Times in a story set to appear on their Thursday front page .
" Routine tests failed to distinguish the contaminant from [ heparin ] , " write Gardiner Harris and Walt Bogdanich for the Times .
" Only sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging tests uncovered that as much as 20 percent of the product 's active ingredient was a heparin mimic blended in with the real thing . "
Officials with the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) say they have not yet identified the contaminant and , according to the Times , do not know whether the presence of the contaminant " was accidental or ... deliberate . "
Heparin is among the oldest drugs still in widespread use , according to Wikipedia , predating even the establishment of the FDA itself .
The drug is derived from tissues of slaughtered pigs and cows .
Chinese - made products -- among them the world 's largest supply of pharmaceutical ingredients -- being imported into the U.S. have come under increased scrutiny in recent times , most prominently after the tainted pet food and lead paint toy scandals of last year .
Excerpts from the Times article , available in full at this link , follow ... # The F.D.A. admitted last month that it had violated its own policies by failing to inspect Scientific Protein 's China plant before approving the drug for sale .
The agency sent inspectors to the plant last month who found that at least some heparin was made from " material from an unacceptable workshop vendor . " ...
In addition , Panamanian investigators have concluded that at least 174 people were poisoned , 115 of them fatally , by counterfeit cold medicine linked to an unlicensed Chinese chemical plant .
A series of independent assessments , including one by the agencys own Science Board , have found that the F.D.A. is increasingly overwhelmed by its many responsibilities and is incapable of protecting the public from unsafe drugs , medical devices and food  particularly from China .
The Government Accountability Office recently discovered , for example , that over a six - year period , the F.D.A. inspected just 64 of the nearly 700 medical device plants registered in China .
Medical devices can include items like stents and spinal screws .
...
The Chinese heparin market has been in turmoil over the past year as pig disease swept through the country , leading some farmers to sell sick pigs into the market and forcing heparin producers to scramble for new sources of raw material . #
Young people today are nothing but trouble .
They slouch .
They 're lawless .
They tote knives and flob on the ground .
Look into their eyes : there 's no gratitude there .
Just blank - eyed nihilism and belching .
Although the belching 's coming from lower down , from the mouth bit .
Young people undermine society .
They come over here , into our present , downloading our ringtones .
Would you want your daughter marrying one ?
Young people think they own the place .
Well they do n't .
Yet .
But what can be done ?
The softly - softly approach is as much use as a Plasticine ladder or a glass trampoline .
Take a group of youths hanging out by the local bus stop , intimidating innocent pedestrians with their 21st - century patois .
Now approach them .
Try to point out where they 're going wrong .
Be patient .
Take your time .
Use diagrams .
Will they listen ?
Will they heck .
They wo n't even look you in the eye .
While you politely set them straight , they stare at their shoes and snort , because you 're old and dull and they hate you .
That 's how their minds work .
They 've got no respect for their superiors .
You can't win with young people .
But you can punish them .
The older male generation loves dreaming up punishments for the young .
It 's the only thing that still gets them aroused .
Last week , moon - faced political letdown and professional idiot David Cameron suggested a new kind of penalty .
" I 'd like to see judges and magistrates tell a 15 - year - old boy convicted of buying alcohol or causing a disturbance that the next time he appears in court he 'll have his driving licence delayed , " he said , through his fat failing mouth , adding , " And then I 'd like that boy to tell his friends what the judge said . "
Dribbling gump though he is , Cameron 's on to something here .
And that bit where the crook - boy has to tell his mates what happened is the key .
In the mind of a young person , being told off is cool .
An asbo , therefore , is like a badge of honour : a sort of alternative Victoria Cross .
What 's required is a form of punishment that genuinely humiliates the offender .
Every so often a comedy judge in America will sentence someone to some kind of embarrassing public penance : walking down the street in a chicken suit , and so on .
We need to go one better , by establishing a dedicated 24 - hour digital TV channel on which young offenders humble and debase themselves .
Here 's how it works .
Let 's say a 16 - year - old called Ryan has stolen a shopping trolley and spun it round and round in the town centre while screaming abuse at horrified passers - by .
He 's arrested and charged and hauled into court .
The judge sentences Ryan to five hours ' community service on Channel Loser .
As part of his punishment , Ryan has to hand over his mobile phone , so the police can search through his address book and text all his friends , telling them what time to tune in .
Let 's say it 's 4 pm .
As the clock strikes four , Ryan 's friends flop down on the sofa , switch on the box , and this is what they see .
Ryan is wearing nothing but a pair of bikini bottoms .
" Hello , " he says , reading slowly from the autocue .
" My name 's Ryan Daniels and I stole a trolley . "
Then the Thomas the Tank Engine theme music starts playing and Ryan has to dance to it .
When the tune comes to an end , it instantly skips back to the beginning and Ryan has to start again .
This sequence is repeated until he bursts into tears .
Then Ryan 's mum walks in , spits on a bit of tissue , and wipes his face with it .
Then she produces a bag of his laundry and goes through every item in it one by one , complaining bitterly about the state of his underpants and so on .
Once she 's gone , Ryan climbs into a paddling pool filled with ice - cold water and sits down until his genitals have shrivelled to squinting point .
Then he has to stand up and pull down his bikini bottoms , at which point a girl from Hollyoaks walks in , points and laughs in his face for 10 minutes .
Then Ryan has to push his face into a cow 's backside .
The sole concession to his personal dignity is a bucket on the floor to be sick in .
Finally , there 's a three - hour interactive section where the audience at home texts in phrases that Ryan has to read aloud .
This , the simplest section , is also the most entertaining .
Picture it .
Come the end of his punishment , Ryan will never offend again and probably wo n't even go outside again .
Problem solved .
What 's more , we 've all been entertained .
Everybody wins .
Cameron , if you 're reading - you can have this idea for free .

Flippity , floppity , flip , flop .
Just like a fish on the deck of a boat , John McCain is gasping for the life of his campaign .
Knowing full well that tying his campaign to staying in Iraq and the " success " of the " surge " ( quick , McCain , explain what that means ! ) and that the majority of Americans just are n't willing to buy it , McCain executes a perfect " cut and run " from his earlier statement of staying in Iraq for 100 years .
By the way , that reminds me of that “ 100 year thing ” .
My friends , the war will be over soon .
The war , for all intents and purposes , although the insurgency will go on for years and years and years .
But it will be handled by the Iraqis , not by us .
Huh ?
The war will be " over soon " ???
Mission Accomplished redux ?
But the insurgency will go on .
But that 's not a war .
But the Iraqis will handle it .
Are n't the insurgents Iraqis too ?
Can anyone make heads or tails of this ridiculous excuse of a back pedal ?
How in the hell does McCain think he can get away with this ?
The arrogance and unrelenting contempt that the Cheney - Bush administration has for the American people and the people 's Congress continuously verified and on public display , has reached exceedingly dangerous levels .
The administration 's contempt for Congress and its controlling Democrats is unprecedented in the history of this now rapidly failing experiment in republic - based individual freedom .
It is contempt for the very foundation of our societal achievements , a pilgrims ' progress based upon creativeness and industry collectively enjoyed by a nation that formerly depended upon rugged individualism and hard work .
It is a contempt that places parasitic bureaucracy and authoritarian government over the rights of individuals that built this nation and made it great .
It is a contempt that grows daily and feeds upon itself capitalizing upon the treason and cowardice of the Democratic Party .
The power of Cheney - Bush is magnified not only by the groveling of despicable , treasonous Democrats in Congress , but also by the complacency of a fraudulent and non-existent American press and its highly paid journalistic charlatans .
The mainstream press and media have been so incorporated into the arrogance and public contempt displayed by Cheney - Bush for what was once the most revered rule of law of this nation , a rule of law and its former successful implementation that became and was the envy of all other nations , that our government 's self - corrective piloting is fast becoming impossible .
Seemingly overnight , after Clinton and especially now with Cheney - Bush , our nation and its people are increasingly hated , despised and feared .
We have become the world 's fulcrum of international terror and invasion , horrifically punctuated by the carpet bombings and mass murder and liquidation of entire cities of defenseless , men , women and children .
It should be clear that by now the hatred , contempt and fear the international community once attributed solely to our government leaders , has progressed to where we as a people are the ones now being hated .
What of our " checks and balances ? "
What about our " separation of powers ? "
What ever happened to our world class ability to correct errant government , never mind a rogue and out - of - control state run by mass murdering genocidal maniacs ?
Why has n't the people 's Congress removed these mass - murdering war criminals from power ?
Why ?
Because Democrats do not wish to jeopardize their chances in the 2008 presidential elections !
Just think of what Hillary will do with all the unconstitutional and tyrannical " laws " created by Cheney - Bush .
Why would any sane American vote for any Democrat ever again ?
On Wednesday , December 5th , the American Civil Liberties Union was acting on a filed complaint ordering the release of documents held by the Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel .
Now where have we heard of that latter bureaucracy before ?
Was n't it relative to criminal Alberto Gonzales ' illegal firing of US Attorneys ?
And speaking of that gangster with a law diploma from Harvard , has this guy been charged with any crime yet ?
There sure are a lot of charges against him to choose from !
According to an ACLU report posted on CommonDreams.org , " ACLU Calls for Release of Three Secret Torture Memos , " the article opens : " The American Civil Liberties Union is in court today calling for the release of three documents issued by the Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) that are believed to have authorized the CIA to use extremely harsh interrogation methods .
The government failed to identify or provide the memos , which were issued in May of 2005 , in response to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit filed by the ACLU requesting information on U.S. treatment and interrogation of detainees . "
The article continues quoting an ACLU lawyer : " ' This is yet another example of the government 's attempt to bypass legal prohibitions on torture and while engaging in a cover - up of its illegal conduct , ' said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants ' Rights Project .
' These memos must immediately be released to the public and high level officials must be held accountable for their role in spawning torture and prisoner abuse . ' "
The article goes on , " The New York Times disclosed the existence of the first two memos in a front - page article on October 4 , 2007 .
The Times reported that the first memo explicitly authorized interrogators to use combinations of harsh interrogation methods including waterboarding , head slapping , and exposure to freezing temperatures .
The second memo , issued by OLC as Congress prepared to enact legislation prohibiting ' cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , ' declared that none of the CIA 's interrogation methods violated that standard . "
Astonishing !!!
Here are the words of law from the United States Constitution 's Bill of Rights , Eighth Amendment : Cruel and Unusual Punishment - " Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted . "
And then there 's the Fifth Amendment : Trial and Punishment , Compensation for Takings ­ " No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation . "
Although the Eighth Amendment specifically forbids cruel and unusual punishment , and those torture methods used by the CIA definitely fall under the description of " cruel and unusual , " it is really the Fifth Amendment that makes the case barring torture from any and all American court proceedings ; specifically , testimony based upon even a written confession can be legally thrown out and excluded in a trial if the defendant can show that his confession was obtained under duress .
Can any legal scholar dismiss cruel and unusual punishment to obtain information or a confession as not being the most violent form of duress ?
Why must Congress now enact a federal statute prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment when this prohibition is already in our Bill of Rights ?!
Is Congress familiar at all with the United States Constitution that Cheney , Bush and Gonzales have abolished relegating it to just a " goddamned piece of paper ? "
Is Congress attempting to rewrite the entire Constitution because Cheney - Bush ignore it and Congress is unfamiliar with it ?
It would seem that not only do we have just " a goddamned piece of paper " for our nation 's rule of law , but also a goddamned stupid , ignorant and treasonous Congress run by stupid , ignorant and treasonous Democrats as well !
" ' Through these memos , the Office of Legal Counsel created a legal framework that was specifically intended to allow the CIA to violate both U.S. and international law , ' said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU 's National Security Project .
' It 's clear that these documents are being kept secret not for national security reasons but for political ones . ' "
And speaking of The New York Times [ nytimes.con ] on Pearl Harbor Day , December 7th , an article was published relating how the CIA deliberately destroyed vital evidence related to the ACLU 's efforts .
The article by Mark Mazzetti , " C.I.A . Destroyed 2 Tapes Showing Interrogations , " begins : " The Central Intelligence Agency in 2005 destroyed at least two videotapes documenting the interrogation of two Qaeda operatives in the agency 's custody , a step it took in the midst of Congressional and legal scrutiny about its secret detention program , according to current and former government officials .
The videotapes showed agency operatives in 2002 subjecting terrorism suspects - including Abu Zubaydah , the first detainee in C.I.A. custody - to severe interrogation techniques .
The tapes were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that video showing harsh interrogation methods could expose agency officials to legal risks , several officials said . "
Now offered , merely as a point of reference , is the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights : Search and Seizure ­ " The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
[ Emphasis mine . ]
Here 's more from Mazzetti's report : " In a statement to employees on Thursday , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , the C.I.A. director , said that the decision to destroy the tapes was made ' within the C.I.A. ' and that they were destroyed to protect the safety of undercover officers and because they no longer had intelligence value . "
This is the same four - star Bush servant who earned [ ? ] both a bachelor and master 's degree in American history from Duquesne University .
This is the same Michael Hayden , who at a press dinner was queried by a reporter concerning illegal searches and seizures and who insisted , repeatedly I might add , that the Fourth Amendment DID NOT contain the term " probable cause . "
Obviously , just following orders and ignoring that " goddamned piece " of paper has its rewards if you want a position of stature in the Cheney - Bush administration !
Mazzetti continues : " The destruction of the tapes raises questions about whether agency officials withheld information from Congress , the courts and the Sept. 11 commission about aspects of the program .
The recordings were not provided to a federal court hearing the case of the terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui or to the Sept. 11 commission , which was appointed by President Bush and Congress , and which had made formal requests to the C.I.A. for transcripts and other documentary evidence taken from interrogations of agency prisoners .
The disclosures about the tapes are likely to reignite the debate over laws that allow the C.I.A. to use interrogation practices more severe than those allowed to other agencies .
A Congressional conference committee voted late Wednesday to outlaw those interrogation practices , but the measure has yet to pass the full House and Senate and is likely to face a veto from Mr. Bush .
The New York Times informed the intelligence agency on Wednesday evening that it was preparing to publish an article about the destruction of the tapes .
In his statement to employees on Thursday , General Hayden said that the agency had acted ' in line with the law ' and that he was informing C.I.A. employees ' because the press has learned ' about the matter . "
I find it rather curious that the same level of concern exemplified by the destruction of these two torture tapes , produced , directed and enjoyed by the CIA goons for their private amusement , is n't on a par with that used to out and expose CIA supervising operative Valerie Plame while in her capacity investigating claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iran and Iraq .
And that is precisely the problem with the one - man-rule of Dick Cheney in this and any other authoritarian rogue state dictatorship ­ there is no fixed or equally applied standardized rule of law .
The law is changed for the convenience of the dictatorship as needed .
Also posted on CommonDreams.com , on Wednesday , December 5th , in a report entitled " Leahy Plans Contempt Vote " by Even Lehmann and originating in The Brattleboro Reformer , it begins : " Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , scheduled a committee vote for Thursday to consider whether four White House officials , including Karl Rove , are in contempt for disobeying Senate subpoenas .
The move comes after the officials failed to respond to Leahy 's demand last week that they immediately provide testimony and documents related to an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee into the firing of eight U.S. attorneys last year .
The officials had previously failed to obey the subpoenas , which the committee issued last summer .
' They have still not complied with the subpoenas , ' said Erica Chabot , a spokeswoman for Leahy , who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee .
The Thursday vote accelerates the possibility of a legal collision between the Senate and White House over the president 's claim that the officials are protected by executive privilege . "
" Executive privilege , " huh ?
And failed to obey subpoenas since last summer ?
Perhaps Leahy 's committee should wait until after Christmas ; that is , NEXT Christmas in 2008 !
Can you see this nonsense going on during the time of Nixon , or even for that matter , during the reign of " Slick Willie ? "
This is absolutely outrageous !
Are Leahy and the Democrats even aware that Karl Rove has resigned ?
And where 's Gonzales ?
And what about that impending book and the revelations by Scott McClellan ?
Why have n't his revelations regarding Rove and Libby in outing Plame been taken seriously and acted upon ?
And remember how Bush commuted Libby 's sentence .
Constant and continuing " in your face " violations of national law and the flipping off of both Congress and the American people .
When will these pompous , arrogant , low - life criminals be held accountable ?
Here 's a clue !
" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) on Thursday postponed a vote on contempt resolutions against former White House adviser Karl Rove and Chief of Staff Josh Bolten after Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) objected to language in the measures .
Committee rules allow for a one - week delay , so the vote will likely take place next Thursday .
Committee approval of the resolution would trigger a full Senate vote on the resolutions early next year , " reports Susan Crabtree in her article for The Hill of December 6th entitled " Leahy postpones contempt vote . "
Arlen Specter , the Congressional phantom and ghost of investigations , entered upon his career as a federal investigator for the Warren Commission , then looking into the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy .
It was phantom Specter who concocted the ridiculous single bullet theory of that fraudulent cover -up .
Is n't it just the height of Beltway and MSM convenience that all this CIA dirty laundry is just now hitting the Beltway fan ?
How convenient for the Beltway Buffoons to have all this marvelous dirt on the rotten CIA !
And how convenient to have this all out right after the Monday , December 3rd CIA National Intelligence Estimate exonerating Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Russian President Vladimir Putin and proving again that Cheney - Bush are liars ?!
The NIE , citing no nukes in Iran , was immediately refuted by Cheney 's stooge Bush and Con - the - Loser Rice !
They do n't care what the CIA report presented , because they just know in their hearts that Iran is very , very evil .
Iran is most certainly THINKING about acquiring nukes in 2015 !
That 's why Cheney and Israel are plotting to bomb them now !
Why wait for the smoking gun and the mushroom cloud ?
And that 's why it 's vital for Cheney - Bush and the MSM to convince US all that we must act now , and not wait for Iran to acquire even just one nuke in 2015 !
And never mind that Iran signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Traety and Israeldid not .
Never mind that Israel has somewhere between 200 and 400 nukes , did n't sign NPT , and has never allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear activities as Iran has .
Israel and Cheney just know Iran is bad and needs a preemptive attack with real nukes to avoid the risk posed by Iran 's thinking about them !
The MSM 's striking contrast of on - demand reporting to defend , apologize and prop up the despicable American dictatorship has now provided for the added secondary distraction in providing delay and stall tactics by redirecting America 's focus away from the NIE .
Cheney - Bush will need time to work out a way to start World War III .
Russia , China and Pakistan would be fools not to act to stop the world 's now most dangerous rogue nation .
Perhaps after the sinking of the Fifth Fleet , they will act against an Iraqi War - weakened America and Israel to save what will be left of humanity .
Of course , the only blame for the American dictatorship 's successful launch of World War III will now rest entirely on the backs of the despicable Democrats who support Cheney - Bush 's need for time to construct the needed agitprop for the war with Iran .
Only the Democrats are left to stop Cheney - Bush !
Will Democrats act ?
Will they finally come through for US and impeach Cheney - Bush ?
Consider their leadership : Pelosi , Reid and Leahy .

Last May , a Saudi Arabian conglomerate bought a Massachusetts plastics maker .
In November , a French company established a new factory in Adrian , Mich. , adding 189 automotive jobs to an area accustomed to layoffs .
In December , a British company bought a New Jersey maker of cough syrup .
For much of the world , the United States is now on sale at discount prices .
With credit tight , unemployment growing and worries mounting about a potential recession , American business and government leaders are courting foreign money to keep the economy growing .
Foreign investors are buying aggressively , taking advantage of American duress and a weak dollar to snap up what many see as bargains , while making inroads to the world ’s largest market .
Last year , foreign investors poured a record $ 414 billion into securing stakes in American companies , factories and other properties through private deals and purchases of publicly traded stock , according to Thomson Financial , a research firm .
That was up 90 percent from the previous year and more than double the average for the last decade .
It amounted to more than one - fourth of all announced deals for the year , Thomson said .
During the first two weeks of this year , foreign businesses agreed to invest another $ 22.6 billion for stakes in American companies  more than half the value of all announced deals .
If a recession now unfolds and the dollar drops further , the pace could accelerate , economists say .
How can you increase your chances of appealing to an average Digger , Stumbler , or other social media user , and actually get them to vote for your content ?
Consider this quote from John Maynard Keynes , British born economist responsible for Keynesian economics , who explains how markets work by making an analogy to a beauty contest :
“ It is not a case of choosing those [ faces ] which , to the best of one ’s judgment , are really the prettiest , nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest .
We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be .
And there are some , I believe , who practise the fourth , fifth and higher degrees . ” ( Keynes , General Theory of Employment Interest and Money , 1936 ) .
What he means is that people do n’t make objective choices based on their own judgment .
Rather , they choose what they think the average person is going to agree with as being the right choice .
The same principle applies to social news sites .
People mostly submit and vote for content not because they objectively think the content is good , but because they think that the community in general is going to find the content to be good .
To illustrate this point , let ’s look at the following news submission to Digg and break down the things that people look at as they anticipate the community ’s verdict :
1 . Play the field
As the community at Digg grows , the site is becoming less and less about technology news ( where it was focused initially ) and more about ‘ world news and business ’ and ‘ offbeat ’ content .
To be on top of the social news pile , you have to keep an eye on the site ’s ever - changing demographic and user preferences .
This does n’t mean that the same content that was popular before cannot be popular again .
What this means is that you have to find a new framework ( angle ) in which to present your content .
There are several ways of playing the categories on Digg :
You can you can create content purely for the more popular categories ( like business and finance ) , in which case there will be significantly more competition , but if you ’re successful the payoff will be much higher .
You can create content for a relatively less popular categories ( like sports ) , in which case the competition will not be as tough but the payoff wo n’t be as high .
Or , you can create content that is about a more popular category , but applicable to a less popular category .
This way , you can get the best results with the least amount of competition .
A great example of this is a post I recently read , titled 4 Ways Technology is Changing Sports Officiating .
The post is great because it is about technology ( hot category ) and how it is changing sports ( not - so - hot category ) .
Therefore , it can be submitted to the sports category and be made popular easily , but still drive the traffic of a story from a popular category .
( There are other reasons for the fact that this particular submission was n’t significantly promoted , but the principle remains true . )
2. Obsess over your titles
There was a time when sensationalism ruled the social news space .
As the space matures ( ever so slowly ) , there is a backlash brewing against sensationalism , and using that age - old trick can will actually make the community go out of its way to bury you .
The good thing is that this actually makes our job easier because it requires much less imagination to get attention .
While writing your title , take note of the following :
Stick with regular formatting .
Do n’t use special characters , capital letters throughout , or excessive punctuation .
Make sure there are no spelling mistakes or grammatical errors ( the audience can be vicious if this is the case ) .
Try to use trigger words when possible , without overdoing it .
If you ’ve been on the site long enough , you start living its culture .
If you ’re writing about a popular meme , be sure to use buzz words that will get people ’s attention .
Do n’t give it all away .
You want people to know what you ’re writing about without actually telling them what you wrote .
3. Summarize , and do n’t state the obvious
There ’s no better way to sabotage any chances you have than to write “ Title says it all , ” “ Enough said , ” or something to that effect , for your summary .
As a submitter that ’s the easy approach — just do n’t do it .
As a content producer wanting to ensure submissions from your site are n’t botched , it ’s in your best interest to present a summary of your content at the very top , before the actual article .
Again , as with the title , a summary should n’t include any spoilers , but should make promises that you can deliver on .
Think of the summary as your chance to pitch the story .
Answer the reader ’s question : “ Why should I click through to read this ?
Please tell me in 150 characters or less . ”
4 . Make it “ picture perfect ”
Not to be confused with the pictures section on Digg ( though that warrants an entire post of its own ) , this refers to the use of thumbnails .
The Digg submission process automatically picks up the images used on your page and allows a submitter to use one of them as a representative thumbnail next to the submission .
With a title , summary , and now a thumbnail , a social news submission is the best summarized representation of your content , and you should take advantage of it .
With every other submission carrying a thumbnail next to it , being the odd one out in this case is not a good thing .
Make sure that the images are relevant but provocative .
5 . Take advantage of network effects
Making friends on social media sites is good simply because it helps you immediately get exposure to a much larger direct audience and helps you much more accurately asses what the middle of the road submission is ( one that would appeal to the masses and help you win the beauty pageant ) .
There is an equally important secondary effect , however , that a lot of people do n’t give much thought to .
A submission that is Dugg by one of your friends is indicated with a green sash , and no matter how poorly a submission is doing on the rest of the points mentioned in this post , if it has a green sash , one feels compelled to check it out .
This secondary effect is pretty much boundless :
If you have 100 friends on Digg who have 10 unique friends each , even if 10 % of your friends Digg something , that submission is ‘ green - sashed ’ for 200 people ( 100 of your friends , and 10 friends each for the 10 people that actually Dugg the story ) .
6 . Woo the power users
Though it ’s not a make - or - break scenario , if your content is submitted by a power user , it has a much higher chance of getting promoted , regardless of the algorithmic bias against these users .
Part of the reason for this is because of the branding that these users have — there is implicit trust that most community members place in submissions from these users ( and most often it is easy to ignore everything else and take a chance on something just because a power user endorses it ) .
Not to forget that the “ green - sash effect ” is also that much more extensive for power users .
Though it ’s very easy to get in touch with a power user , do n’t do it unless you plan on pitching only your best .
7 . Talk , talk , talk , talk , talk
There is no doubt about the impact of comments on the success of a social news submission .
First of all , on a very basic level , if a story is in the upcoming section with 100 Diggs and absolutely no discussion , people are bound to think something fishy is going on .
In addition to that , there are several exposure - related benefits of contributing comments :
Every time someone makes a comment , it adds to the “ hotness ” of a story .
A combination of the quality , quantity , and time of Diggs and comments on a story is what it takes to push a story from just the queue to the “ hot in all topics ” category and eventually to the Digg home page .
Also , every time someone makes a comment , the activity is recorded and can be shown in Digg / Spy , as well as users ’ activity pages .
Comments breed more comments , which ultimately means more visibility .
Winning the pageant
There are two schools of thought for achieving success on social news networks .
The first is to write something provocative and incite emotion , and the second is to appeal to the masses and pander to the middle of the road .
Both can be equally successful if you can manage to find out who your audience is .
For example , if you ’re going to be writing about technology , anything about Microsoft is going to be provocative but that does n’t necessarily mean it will be successful ( simply because the Apple camp is stronger ) .
In situations where you ca n’t judge which camp in your audience is stronger , targeting the average can be well worth it .

ACLU calls out US over ' absurd bloating ' of terror watch list Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday February 27 , 2008
|
Print This Email This More that 900,000 people are currently listed as suspected terrorists on the US government 's " do not fly " list , and that number will grow to beyond 1 million by summer , says the American Civil Liberties Union .
" If there were a million terrorists in this country , our cities would be in ruins , " Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU 's Technology and Liberty Program , stated in a press release from the group .
" The absurd bloating of the terrorist watch lists is yet another example of how incompetence by our security apparatus threatens our rights without offering any real security . "
The ACLU has launched a new Web site to track the growth of the watch list , which it says includes thousands of innocent Americans , including prominent politicians and authors as well as people with common names .
The group says its count is " extrapolated from a September 2007 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice , which reported that the Terrorist Screening Center had over 700,000 names in its database as of April 2007 , and that the list was growing by an average of over 20,000 records per month . "
As of Wednesday afternoon , the ACLU said there were about 917,500 names on the list .
Having such an unwieldy list does little to protect against terrorism , the ACLU argues , and it violates the constitutional rights of innocent people on the list who are hassled by airport security .
" Homeland Security 's handling of the watch lists is typical of this administration 's blundering approach to the war on terror , " said ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Tim Sparapani .
" Create sprawling new systems for sifting through the population , throw an indiscriminately broad range of names into the mix , fairly or not , and treat the rights of innocent people as an afterthought . "
The revolutionary new video game from LucasArts has a compelling , movie - like story line , involving a secret apprentice to Darth Vader and the formation of the Rebel Alliance .
Images courtesy of LucasArts .
View exclusive images from Star Wars : The Force Unleashed .
And do n’t miss our exclusive video of the game itself .
To visit the San Francisco offices of LucasArts , the video - game arm of George Lucas ’s entertainment empire , is to glimpse first - hand the dividends that his six - episode Star Wars saga has generated over the last 30 years .
The $ 350 million state - of - the - technological - art Presidio campus that the company shares with its moviemaking brethren , Lucasfilm and visual - effects house Industrial Light & Magic , boasts a commissary with panoramic views of the city ( including , on a clear day , the Golden Gate Bridge ) ; an employee gift shop stocked with Skywalker Ranch olive oil , Star Wars merchandise , and other Lucasfilm swag ; and a plush 350 - seat theater where employees can test - drive video games on a full - size movie screen or watch the latest film releases after work .
In many cases , the employees themselves are byproducts of the influence of Star Wars : writers , designers , animators , and artists who , as kids and teens , were wowed by the movies and decided that they , too , wanted to create science - fiction and fantasy characters and visuals that were as fully formed and plausible as those that Lucas had put on movie screens .
But instead of lining up behind the crowds jockeying to get into film school , these future storytellers chose as their canvas the much younger and more interactive medium of video games , a medium that increasingly overlaps with filmmaking — artistically , technically , and in terms of storytelling technique — but that also has its own rules , philosophies , and cultural touchstones .
On the Presidio campus there stands a bronze statue of Eadweard Muybridge , whose series of consecutive photos taken at a horse farm in 1878 — known today as “ The Horse in Motion ” — is a motion - picture prototype .
The Muybridge of the video - game industry is arguably Nolan Bushnell , co-founder of Atari and the creator in the mid-70s of Pong , the first successful , if primitive , home video game : a digitally generated ball was knocked between two digitally generated paddles until one of the players was declared the winner or fell asleep from boredom .
Along those same lines , Pac - Man and Ms. Pac - Man are the equivalent of silent - film stars , and , for a number of LucasArts executives , the Citizen Kane of 3 - D video games is Nintendo ’s Super Mario 64 .
Released in 1996 for what was then the groundbreaking Nintendo 64 game console , and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto , who has created some of the most enduring characters and games in the history of the industry , Super Mario 64 was not only the first true 3 - D video game , according to LucasArts vice president of product development Peter Hirschmann , but also the game that established a number of conventions — “ such as how you navigate a 3 - D space and how a camera moves in 3 - D space , ” Hirschmann says — which game designers still use today .
But when it comes to mimicking real - life conventions — the laws of physics , the squishy dynamics of biology , the unpredictability of human behavior — video games are still struggling with their technical limitations .
Take an action as simple , or at least in gaming as commonplace , as throwing a villain through a wooden door .
No matter what combination of moves or punches the hero uses , the bad guy usually breaks through the door in the same stiff and unconvincing way — usually uttering the same stilted grunt or scream — each and every time the gamer plays through this point in the game .
That ’s because , in essence , most video games are composed of a series of brief , inter - related animations that are cued by the gamer .
Some games provide multiple animations for a particular action , to give the illusion of spontaneity , but that is an expensive proposition .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
A Florida congressman is suggesting that a brokered convention for the Democrats could lead to some pretty unexpected results .
In other words , forget about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
Representative Tim Mahoney says he would n't be surprised if someone different is at the top of the ticket .
He says a compromise candidate could be someone like Al Gore .
In a newspaper interview , Mahoney said if the convention is deadlocked and either Clinton or Obama suggested a Gore - Obama or Gore - Clinton ticket , the party would accept it .
Mahoney is one of the almost 800 superdelegates who would get to cast a vote at the convention .
He has n't endorsed either Clinton or Obama yet , but has been wooed by both .
It 's an interesting idea .
It 's not clear if Democrats really know what they 're in for if this nasty battle continues all the way to the Denver convention .
The way things are going , there could be enough acrimony by the time it's over that neither Obama nor Clinton would any longer be viewed as electable .
Al Gore has insisted he wo n't run and that he has " no plans to be a candidate " , although he's also said " I see no reason to rule it out entirely . "
And , it 's worth pointing out that the former vice president and Nobel Prize winner has not yet endorsed either Clinton or Obama .
So stay tuned .
Here ’s my question to you :
If a ticket led by Al Gore somehow emerged from a brokered convention , would that be a good thing for the Democrats ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Adam writes :
Great .
So now Obama and Clinton will fight it out to see who gets to be Gore's V.P. ?
I think that a congressman from Florida has a lot of nerve even suggesting this .
The Florida Democratic Party is part of the reason this election is such a mess .
The Democratic Party leaders and Florida and Michigan should stand up and start taking responsibility for this mess they 've created , instead of patronizing us with ridiculous fairy tales .
Eugene writes :
The fact is if neither candidate has enough votes on the first ballot at the convention then those delegates are released from their pledges and are free to draft another candidate from the floor .
This is not robbery , it is simply recognition that neither candidate has a majority of the party 's support , and thus can not be expected to unite the party to win in November .
My feeling is that this is the DNC sending up a trial balloon to see if this proposal will garner the support of the party regulars as a solution to the August train wreck that is coming around the corner .
Woody from Tucson , Arizona writes :
That 's just stupid .
No one runs a campaign for 2 years to give the top spot to someone who was n't running .
Cindy writes :
A Gore nomination would really tick off the voters of both front - runners and show the world how wishy - washy the Democrats are .
It 's gotta be Obama or Clinton , and the one who does n't get the nomination will have to convince their supporters that it's ok to support the other guy .
That 's why the negative rhetoric has to stop .
It 's going to make it harder and harder to deprogram their supporters .
Barb from Canada writes :
If you think you 've heard griping by not allowing Florida and Michigan votes to count , just try not counting the votes of the entire nation !
It would be the end of the Democrats , although Gore would probably win the election !
Angelos from Munich writes :
Yeah , that would make sense : make both candidates unhappy .
Next time we can as well do away with the primaries and nominate Chelsea right from the start .
Rob writes :
Any more ridiculous suggestions you want to post , Jack ?
Last August I read a column which I thought provided fascinating insights in to the Clinton campaign .
Subsequent events have shown the column to be prescient :
When Hillary sharply disagreed with Obama ’s pledge , in the South Carolina Democratic debate , that he would meet with the leaders of rogue nations like North Korea , Iran , Cuba and Venezuela , she was undoubtedly shooting from the hip .
But when she and her campaign spent an entire week attacking and ridiculing Obama — and now are well into their second week of criticism — they appear to have lost their marbles .
Put very simply , Hillary is on the wrong side of this particular issue for the Democratic primary electorate ...
Meanwhile , Obama , correctly reading the mood of the Democratic electorate ( or correctly reading his polls ) , mocked Hillary ’s position as " Bush Cheney - lite , " emphasizing Hillary ’s insider way of thinking .
Hillary ’s stumbles over this issue remind one of her campaign ’s knee - jerk decision to lash out at David Geffen for his attack on Bill Clinton ’s administration and pardons .
Both mistakes smack of appeasing the boss at the expense of making the right move politically .
Each is the kind of mistake that advisers who do n’t have the confidence to stand up to the Clintons often find themselves making .
When Bill ’s temper is aroused or Hillary stubbornly digs in on a position , it is a daunting task to confront them and convince them that they are just flat - out wrong .
Few advisers are able to do it , and it appears that the current crop are helpless in the face of their candidate ’s insistence on making a mistake .
[ Emphasis added ]
This source , I admit , is problematic , as the column was written by Dick Morris .
Morris has a long , complicated and at times even sordid history with the Clintons .
Furthermore , it was Morris who brought Mark Penn in to the Clinton orbit for the 1996 campaign .
Morris got tossed overboard after his toe - sucking escapade , while Penn has become Clinton 's " Chief Strategist . "
Morris has reason to resent Penn , and he 's irrationally obsessed with the Clintons .
Morris is undoubtedly biased against the Clintons .
But in suggesting that there 's nobody who can deliver bad news to Hillary or Bill Clinton , he also appears to be correct .
A month ago I declared that the race for the Democratic nomination was over ; Barack Obama will be our nominee .
The conventional wisdom is catching up .
More and more , people are realizing that Clinton is hanging around on the dying hope that Obama will destruct , either by his own hand or the hands of others .
The early indications are that Obama will weather the Wright scandal - ette , and may in fact come out from it stronger .
Clinton ended up in this situation because she ran against an extraordinary candidate who 's run a masterful campaign .
But she has also hurt herself .
She has never had a compelling message .
She ran a safe campaign about experience in an election in which voters are starving for change .
She could n't reel in her husband .
The crushing defeat in South Carolina gave Obama big momentum heading in to Super Tuesday ; it 's unlikely Obama would have won by almost 30 points if Bill Clinton had n't recklessly insulted Obama , likely pushing even more support to Obama and possibly John Edwards .
She eventually fired her campaign manager , long - time staffer Patti Solis - Doyle , but Penn stayed put , Penn and Harold Ickes continued to battle , and her campaign continued to fall behind Obama .
While he may be an asshat , the evidence suggests that Dick Morris was right , that Hillary Clinton 's campaign was crippled by a dearth of trusted aides who could tell the candidate ( and maybe more importantly , her husband ) when they were making mistakes , when they needed to change course , and who should be listened to and who should be ignored .
Now the question is , if Hillary and Bill Clinton did n't have anyone around would could tell them when they were wrong , who will tell them the campaign is over , and it's time to step aside and acknowledge Barack Obama will be our nominee ?
It 's hard to tell what 's going on inside the Clinton campaign , but one has to wonder whether many of the top Clinton supporters really believe in her campaign .
Surely some of the people who were top staffers to Bill Clinton know , but few of them probably have the ability to tell the Clinton 's they will not achieve their dreamed - of dynasty .
They 're estranged from many of their long - time friends and close associates from Arkansas ; it 's probably too harsh , but there 's at least a little bit of truth in this comment comparing them to The Great Gatsby 's Tom and Daisy Buchanan :
They were careless people , Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness , or whatever it was that kept together , and let other people clean up the mess they had made .
Few people have remained close to the Clintons through all their difficulties and can still tell the what they do n't want to hear .
But soon someone will need to tell them it 's time to step aside .
Vernon Jordan could be that person .
Vernon Jordan is one of those creatures known in Washington as a " fixer . "
He was for a long time the head of the Urban League , and then became a fixture on the DC circuit of lawyering / lobbying / sitting on corporate boards / serving on panels and commissions .
He chaired Bill 's transition in 1992 - 1993 .
And despite getting deeply embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal , he remained close to the Clintons .
At the lowest point of the scandal , in August 1998 , Bill and Hillary vacationed on Martha 's Vineyard , and about the only time they socialized was to " celebrate " Bill 's birthday with Jordan and his wife .
The relationship continues ; both Jordan and his wife have bundled over $ 100,000 for Hillary 's campaign .
Jordan is committed to the Clintons , but he probably understands the extraordinary talents and achievements of Obama .
In October 2003 , five months before Obama won his Senate primary , he held his first DC fundraiser , where he was introduced to some of the power elite in Washington at the home of Vernon Jordan .
Someone needs to tell the Clintons they will not have a dynasty .
It has to be someone they trust and who can tell them what they do n't want to hear .
And it has to be someone who can see clearly what many of us have known was coming for some time , and what the traditional media are finally starting to recognize , that Barack Obama will be our presidential nominee .
Mr. Jordan , it 's getting to that time where you 're going to have to break Bill and Hillary the news .
The electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment , the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled Friday , effectively suspending executions in the only state that made sole use of the practice , once the dominant form of execution in the United States .
The court , in a 6 - to - 1 decision , ruled that electrocution , the only method of execution used in the state , violates the state constitution .
“ The evidence shows that electrocution inflicts intense pain and agonizing suffering , ” Justice William Connolly wrote for the majority .
The state ’s attorney general , Jon Bruning , said he would “ move to the legislative process to get a new method of execution . ”
Working on a clean slate , Nebraska may opt for a form of lethal injection that does not rely on the combination of three chemicals that is the subject of a pending challenge in the United States Supreme Court .
Indeed , it may explore entirely different methods of executions .
No other state relied solely on the electrocution , but seven allow at least some inmates to choose it instead of lethal injection .
Two other states , Illinois and Oklahoma , have designated electrocution as the fallback method should lethal injections be ruled unconstitutional .

Thanks for using Netlog
throughout the years .
The Netlog Team
I ’m in the middle of a two year project to roll out a project management software package in a large construction company .
The first year was taken up with requirements gathering , writing specs , putting together a tender , sending the tender out to prospective software vendors , evaluating the responses , signing contracts with the successful vendor and setting the scope for the deployment .
The second year is scheduled to be designing and configuring the software for the environment ( 5 months ) , prototyping and testing ( 3 months ) followed by a pilot deployment with a controlled group of projects ( 3 months ) .
If that all goes well , the software get rolled out to the whole company over the following year .
So this is a long , involved project with a list of unknowns so long that quite frankly it ’s terrifying and BEFORE THE WHOLE THING STARTED the person who signs the cheques wanted a detailed schedule showing how long it would take to complete the project .
Depending on which side fence you live , the request for an upfront schedule is either common sense or insanity .
If you ’re on the business side and have to authorise the expenditure ( in this case , millions of dollars which was an unprecedented IT expenditure for this company ) you want to know what you will be getting and how long it will take to get .
If you ’re the sucker who has to deliver the project , setting a schedule seems crazy because there are far too many variables .
There are the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns ( which is not as crazy as Donald Rumsfeld made it sound – he just articulated it badly . )
The known unknowns are the things you do n’t know the answer to but at least you know you have to figure out an answer .
The unknown unknowns are the landmines that every IT worker knows are waiting for them on pretty much every project .
You do n’t even know they ’re there but one day you step on one and you blow everything to hell .
The one saving grace of this project is that the software is not being developed in - house .
An off the shelf piece of software is being configured to work according to the company ’s requirements .
And it has to integrate with the existing core business applications .
Oh , and we have to find a way to standardise the processes followed in a variety of inconsistent ways by the hundreds of employees in order to design the software configuration and deploy it successfully .
So a schedule for a project with so many variables is essentially a wild guess followed in blind faith , all the while wishing on a star , hoping that none of the thousand possible unforseen problems derail everything .
Why does anyone thing this is a good idea ?
Well , there ’s this little thing the business world like to call reality .
You can call it political reality ( you fall out of favour if you ca n’t deliver to schedule ) , fiscal reality ( businesses want to be able to quantify the return on their expenditure – ahead of time preferably ) or comparative reality ( a process line worker makes x widgets per day so why can’t I measure how much development gets completed in a day ? )
Very few companies can liberate themselves from this view of reality ( Google seems to be an exception if you believe what you read . )
So very few businesses will let you start a project without a schedule .
As wrong as it may be , it ’s pretty important to accept it as our lot in life as IT workers .
Here ’s a little tip : if you do n’t feel like accepting it as your lot in life , argue your case from the point of view of how the business will benefit from changing their views , not why it would be better for you .
Do n’t waste time saying “ that is n’t how IT development works ” – unless you argue the case from a cost / benefit perspective ( again , benefits for the business , not you ) you ’ll most likely come across as spoiled and / or totally disconnected from business “ realities ” .
There ’s a disturbing tendency for IT workers to be seen as spoiled and overpaid already so try not to make it worse .
A business can use a project schedule in one of two main ways : as a weapon with which to beat the project team if they fail to deliver to schedule or as a general roadmap .
To those who treat divergence from a schedule as a failure which must be punished : you ’re going to get the team , the morale and the results you deserve ( hint – they ’ll all be crap ) .
But if you acknowledge that your schedule is a best guess at where the key signposts are , that you ’ll have to stop and ask for directions regularly and that you ’ll find the journey taking you in strange and unexpected directions before you reach your destination , then you stand a chance of success .
In my current role I ’m lucky enough to be working in a business that treats the schedule as a rough guide rather than holy scripture .
Twice , the management committee has actually responded to a progress report by saying “ you ’re trying to do too much in this time period , give yourself the extra time you need to make sure you ’re doing it properly . ”
When we report project delays they listen to our reasons and support the judgement calls we make .
They will kick our butts if the budget blows out much more but with each change we give two alternatives : more time or reduced scope .
I get the feeling our work is actually valued by management .
If I sound a little surprised by this it ’s because I ’ve worked in a number of jobs over the years where the attitude of management to IT was more like “ barely tolerated ” .
Assuming my work is actually valued ( and assuming management are wise to place said value in me ) this is actually a very smart business decision .
It all goes back to the type of cost / benefit analysis I was mentioning earlier in this post .
I get frequent calls from employment agencies hoping I ’m looking for work .
There is more contract work available than there are experience contractors to fill the roles at the moment .
They have quoted me figures more than 1/3 higher than my current rate .
So I could easily earn more but I would be taking a risk – the work might not be as interesting and the environment might not be as good .
That ’s my cost / benefit analysis .
For management , the cost / benefit analysis goes like this : allowing the project to run beyond initial schedule estimates is an increased cost .
But if I left ( not just me of course ) , there would be a number of unpleasant costs .
First , the project knowledge I have gained would walk out the door with me – there would be a significant time lag before any replacement gained a similar level of knowledge .
Second , in the current tight job market it would take quite a while to find a replacement .
Third , any replacement would either cost a lot more than me or have considerably less experience ( maybe both ) .
So we ’re forced to have a schedule .
But there ’s a reasonable attitude to changes in that schedule .
Everyone seems sufficiently comfortable with the level of doublethink required to balance the contradictory notions of ( a ) we are following a schedule , and ( b ) that schedule could be rendered meaningless at any moment .
It is n’t perfect but it feels like the lesser of two evils .
LONDON  Track and field ’s world governing body ruled on Monday that Oscar Pistorius , a double - amputee sprinter from South Africa , is not be eligible to compete in Olympic qualifying events .
The International Association of Athletics Federations explained in a statement that , after an independent scientific study , it deemed Pistorius ’s state - of - the - art carbon fiber prosthetics “ should be considered as technical aids which give him an advantage over other athletes not using them . ”
Pistorius ’s agent , Peet Van Zyl , said that he and Pistorius were seeking legal advice in order to prepare an appeal .
“ We need to speak with the I.A.A.F. first and see what approaches we can follow there , ” Van Zyl said in a telephone interview from South Africa .
“ The last resort will probably be the Court of Arbitration for Sport . ”
Pistorius , 21 , was born without fibulas and had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old .
But in the four years since he started competing , he has set Paralympic world records in the 100 , 200 and 400 meters and it was his dream to compete in the Olympic Games .
The I.A.A.F. had originally cleared him to compete against able - bodied athletes last June , pending further scientific examination of his j - shaped blades , known as Cheetahs .
But in the meantime , Pistorius became the focus of an intense ethical debate over the limits which should be placed on technology .
So last November , the I.A.A.F. arranged for Pistorius to travel to Cologne , Germany , where he was tested for two days under the supervision of Peter Brueggemann , a professor at the German Sport University .

There are alot of
different ways to trick browsers into letting hackers do things that they
should not be allowed to do .
Some of them have to do with URIs .
In a presentation at
Black Hat , security researchers Nathan McFeters and Rob Carter argued that URI
exploitation is an area that is still ripe for further analysis and
exploitation .
URI 's allow browsers to load applications and protocols for
example http :// for web and ftp:// for FTP .
Other common URI 's are AIM :// for
instant messaging and firefoxurl :// for loading a Firefox browser .
McFeters noted that every URI
registered on your system can be interacted with by a browser .
Application
developers commonly create URI hooks into their apps .
Sometimes those URI hooks
can be used by an attacker to do ' bad ' things .
One such application with a URI
hook is Google 's Picassa photo application .
That 's where the T - bAG ( trust based
applet attack ) comes in .
The attack involves a user clicking on a Picassa URI
( Picassa :// ) that causes a button to be loaded inside of a user 's Picassa
application .
In a nutshell , when the button is clicked the users images can be
stolen by the attacker .
Carter and McFeters were quick to
note that Google has now mostly fixed the URI issue by doing additional URI
bound and validation checks .
McFeters also demonstrated what he
called ' Stupid IM Tricks ' where by taking advantage of IM URIs he could trigger
a message to be sent from a victim 's machine .
Scary stuff actually that looks
dead easy to do , in my opinion .
Overall McFeters sees URIs as a
target rich environments that affect Windows , Linux and Mac .
To make matters
even worse McFeters argued that in many cases there is no need for the URI
( which could lead to an exploit ) to exist in the first place .
" I do n't think there is a
real reason why we need protocol handlers most are n't really useful , "
McFeters said .
MARTIN WOLF
thinks investing in hedge funds will soon be as popular as buying sub prime debt .
I agree many funds are on the chopping block .
But I am not convinced the complete collapse of the hedge fund industry is inevitable or upon us .
bad
unscrupulous
Mr Wolf claims there are so manylucky hedge fund managers the industry has become a market for lemons .
Investors will soon realise bad ones exist , but wo n't be able to spot them .
They will internalise the potential downside from a bad manager and refuse to pay the high fees .
Without the fees the good managers will leave the market for a better opportunity and only bad managers will remain .
People will realise this and not want to invest in funds at all .
Hedge funds are doomed for a collapse .
But the market for lemons assumes imperfect information .
Information is publicly available , specifically a fund 's performance .
Mr Wolf points out that this may not really expose good from lucky managers .
Lucky ones may have twenty years of good returns before things go badly .
Twenty years of good returns sounds like more than luck to me .
Even if it is , I would like to invest with someone so lucky .
Further , using the market for lemons used car example , many of people who invest in funds are the equivalent of a skilled auto mechanic .
A large share of the hedge fund capital comes from institutional investors .
They tend to be fairly sophisticated and can competently judge a fund 's view .
It is not perfect , but far from completely asymmetric information .
But if they are so savvy why do these knowledgeable investors bother with the fees and just invest for themselves ?
Large investors often have an incentive to keep hedge funds in their portfolio .
Institutional rigidities may prevent the head of a large endowment from being too leveraged or taking too many short positions .
Hedge funds provide these investors with the risk they would like , but can't take .
This partly justifies the large fees .
Perhaps the industry has become too large .
The current market turmoil will likely rid the market of many funds .
But ultimately they are here to stay .
I usually do n't write much about this moron because after I watched him once I wondered how he had a job in radio let alone got a gig on CNN .
I know talkies have a lot of time on their hands to kill , but what the heck is he talking about ?
Has he looked in the mirror lately ?
" If you 're a guy , you can get past it .
I do n't think you can as an ugly woman . "
" You 've got a double cross , because if you 're an ugly woman , you 're probably a progressive as well . "
He later added :
Mr. Hatch expressed sympathy , but went on to say that “ some who say they support our troops turn around and talk about defunding them .
“ The message to our troops is that we no longer support them , ” he said .
Senator Durbin countered by citing news articles that said some of the new troops being sent to Iraq are going without adequate training or equipment .
“ Now who is standing behind the troops ? ” he asked .
Mr. Durbin suggested that Congress revisit the resolution it passed in 2002 authorizing the use of force in Iraq , since the prime reasons cited in it  the threats posed by Saddam Hussein and by weapons of mass destruction that Iraq was thought to possess  were no longer factors .
“ By what authority do we continue this war ? ” he said .
Mr. Specter read the results of a survey of service members conducted by The Military Times , which found that only 35 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Bush ’s handling of the war .
The senator suggested that in that light , the military might be “ appreciative of questions being raised by Congress . ”
Mr. Feingold insisted that his resolution would “ not hurt our troops in any way ” because they would all continue to be paid , supplied , equipped and trained as usual  just not in Iraq .
The panel heard from legal experts , who cited constitutional debates over conflicts ranging from the “ quasi - war ” with Napoleon in 1798 to peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Somalia in recent years .
No war seemed to hang more heavily over the hearing than Vietnam , where Congress brought American involvement to a close by cutting off financing .
Prof. Robert Turner of the University of Virginia suggested that Congress had made itself responsible for the deaths of the 1.7 million Cambodians estimated to have been slaughtered by the Khmer Rouge , by denying funds for President Nixon to wage war inside Cambodia .
Similarly , he said Congress bore responsibility for the deaths of 241 marines killed by a suicide bomber in Lebanon in 1983 because it raised the question of forcing a withdrawal there .
Joy Douglas knows all about hair and dyes and making people pretty , but when she did a doggie dye job that turned her poodle pink , Boulder authorities say she went too far .
Never mind it was for a good cause and the dye was organic beet juice , Douglas faces a $ 1,000 fine under a city animal cruelty ordinance .
Douglas , who owns Zing Hair Salon , decided to color Cici pink to promote awareness of breast cancer .
“ Customers come in and ask why the dog is pink , ” she said .
“ So we tell them about breast - cancer awareness , about the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure , and then we ask for a donation . ”
But not everyone who saw Cici was amused .
Some called the Humane Society of Boulder Valley , which enforces the city ’s animal ordinances .
One of those ordinances , meant to discourage families from dying rabbits and chicks for Easter , prohibits the coloring or dying of animals .
“ We ’ve received a number of complaints about the dog , ” said Lisa Pedersen , director of the humane society .
“ We ’ve been out to talk with Joy several times .
Finally , we gave her a ticket to let the courts decide the issue . ”
Douglas , who drives a pink scooter and a pink car , will appear in Boulder Municipal Court this morning after an 8 a.m. rally outside the courthouse .

Convertible bias : AFA trades in Ford , eyeing GM
by Jeremy Hooper
Remember a few weeks back when , after a two year period , the obsessively anti-gay folks at the American Family Association up and ended their Ford boycott amidst vague claims that they 'd gained some sort of unspecified ground with the automaker ?
And do you recall how Ford repeatedly denied that the AFA had scored any victories , with the company instead suggesting that the " pro-family " group had simply made a choice to put the brakes on their queer - hostile endeavor ?
And remember how when those of us on the pro-gay side tried to get the AFA to explain themselves in the face of Ford 's public declarations , yet only got more runaround and more ambiguous claims of " victory " ?
Yea , well , get ready to let that whole fun process begin anew .
For the AFA has now moved on from Ford altogether , picking a new car - making target at whom to cast their gay - antipathetic stones :
:: sigh : :
What the hell gives these folks the right to go apeshit simply because a company dares to advertise to the LGBT community ?!
Good God of fringe extremism , why can not they not at least accept that we are " sinners " with a degree of disposable income , some of which we like to put towards cars ?!
We know they think we 're barreling down the Highway to Hades .
Fine .
Let them think that .
But ca n't they at least respect the right of an automaker to try and sell us a car whose climate control features will help us brave the unbearably hot Lake of Fire ?
Honestly , these AFA kids are more myopic in their focus than a used car salesman who just learned he has 100 dollars in the bank and twins on the way !
And unlike that dude , who just wants to want to rip some people off so he can feed his lil ' babies , the AFA has no greater motive for their actions than baldfaced , dehumanizing bias .
It 's absolutely disgusting .
Stand strong , GM .
Your thoughts
Just this morning on the news I heard that Mississippi ranks 50th in the latest list of " Most Livable States " ( and has for 9 of the past 10 years ) .
Of course , that begs the question : Did Wildmon and the AFA contribute to that embarrassing rating or did the unlivable condition of that state give rise to Wildmon and the AFA ?
Either way , I 'm sure their boycott of General Motors will be a smashing success .

" GM is blocking our emails " Can you blame them ?

Responding to db's comment :
The March 22 - 28 issue of The Economist magazine has an article titled " The Science of Religion . "
http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10875666
One small blurb from it is this : " Dr Wilson himself has studied the relationship between social insecurity and religious fervour , and discovered that , regardless of the religion in question , it is the least secure societies that tend to be most fundamentalist . "

Idiots !!
Do n't they know that Adam and Steve is a movie that ran on Logo , not a " program " ?
Rick and Steve is a logo program .
Sigh .

Well Timothy , you 'll also notice that they call it " Steve & Adam " at one point .
But it should be noted that they are , in fact , referring to the movie not the " Rick & Steve " show .

An interesting article - I think you might be on to something .

I worked for one of GM 's agency buying media for several years .
The AFA gets a voice which is widely regarded as a pain in the ass that they have to deal with .
They are like a bad cold that crops up occassionally .
The best way to deal with their onslaught is for our community - probably through orgs such as HRC and others to send a note or emails of encouragement to GM 's marketing department .
As longtime admirers of companies like GM which choose to advertise their goods to our community , we must show our support through our abilities to communicate and through our concern for their ongoing marketing success to the LGBT community at large .

Mr. Elturk said , “ His father and family are really scared that he might do something . ”
Attempts to Shut Down Blog
From time to time , Mr. Khan said , his father also cut off his Internet access and , to placate him , Mr. Khan recently added a disclaimer to his blog disavowing responsibility for the views expressed on the site .
He has also been fending off citizen watchdogs who are working to knock sites likes his off the Internet .
Twice in September his blog went dark when his service provider shut him down , citing complaints about the nature of his postings .
Mr. Khan has now moved his blog to a site called Muslimpad , whose American operators recently moved from Texas to Amman , Jordan .
Their larger forum , Islamic Network , is the host of discussions among English - speaking Muslims .
One of their former employees , Daniel Maldonado , was convicted this year in federal court of associating with terrorists at their training camps in Somalia .
Mr. Khan said that he had dreams about meeting Mr. bin Laden and that he would not rule out picking up a weapon himself one day .
In a recent essay , he argued that jihad was mandatory for all Muslims , and he cited three ways to fulfill this obligation : join fighters in Iraq , Afghanistan or Algeria ; send them money ; or promote militant videos as part of the jihad media .
For now , he said , he is fulfilling his obligations by helping other Muslims understand their religion .
Recently he posted a video of a news report from Somalia showing a grenade - wielding American who had joined the Islamists .
“ He is an example of a Muslim who follows the Religion of Islaam , ” Mr. Khan wrote .
Joe Hebenstreit is Frog Design 's principal engineer and an amateur wedding ring designer .
When it came time for Joe Hebenstreit to buy a wedding ring for his wife - to - be , he stuck with what he knew .
That did n't involve going to the neighborhood jewelry store or venturing into a Tiffany's .
Instead , Hebenstreit simply designed the ring in CAD by himself and then printed out a three - dimensional prototype using a 3 - D printer .
" I designed it in 3 - D , printed it out in wax , and then cast it in platinum at a high temperature casting place , " Hebenstreit explains nonchalantly .
" You can do a lot of cool things with 3 - D printers , " he continues .
" They come up with new uses for them all the time . "
Granted , as the principal engineer for Palo Alto - based industrial design shop Frog Design , Hebenstreit has access to gadgets that most geek grooms can only dream of .
But 3 - D printers are n't just handy for making wedding rings .
Armed with new capabilities , they 're taking a central role in the rapid prototyping and even production of consumer products .
The 3 - D printer at Frog Design 's Palo Alto headquarters measures approximately 10 x 10 x 12 inches .
While this printer is relatively small , some can be as big as walk - in closets .
The technology behind 3 - D printers is n't new .
Rapid prototyping machines have existed in myriad forms since the early 1980s , but the pace at which new capabilities and printing materials are being added to the machines is astonishing , says Scott Summit , the co-founder of San Francisco - based industrial design firm Summit ID .
These printers typically work by spewing out successive layers of a given material to build a three - dimensional object , slice by horizontal slice .
These end results are n't just prototypes or proof - of - concepts any more .
As the technology has evolved , 3 - D printers are now capable of printing out fully functional finished products .
For example , according to Summit , battleships and aircraft carriers now make extensive use of selective laser sintering ( SLS ) printers , which can " print out " materials like titanium , cobalt chromium and polyamide , to fabricate spare parts on the spot instead of carrying huge warehouses full of replacements .
And some manufacturers of 3 - D printers even use their own products to create parts for the next generation of printers .
" It 's like the Terminator self - replicator machine or something , " Summit says .
" Machines are making the next - generation machines . "
Designers and engineers can leave Frog Design 's 3 - D printer running over the weekend if need be to print out consecutive models , one on top of the other .
The printer at Frog Design , which is used for more traditional modeling purposes , uses two materials : ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ) plastic and industrial - strength glue .
The glue is what enables the machine to build hollow or concave objects without letting them collapse in on themselves .
These rapid prototyping printers are bringing an entirely very new mentality to design , where the user becomes a key participant in the creation of the product .
Summit and Hebenstreit both cite hearing aids as one example of this new approach .
" They stick some clay in your ear , it takes the shape of your ear , then they 3 - D laser scan that and it gets fabricated by a 3 - D printer , " Summit explains .
" It 's kind of co-designed by your ear – by your personal geometry . "
This personalized approach to design can also be a godsend for new designers trying to break into the business .
Teaming up with those who own and operate 3 - D printers , designers open a web store with little more than a handful of designs .
A customer simply chooses the design he or she wants , a rented printer fabricates the product , a traditional 2 - D printer creates a mailing label , and Fed Ex picks up the box and ships it to the customer .
Hebenstreit shows off a small component model he was able to print out in a matter of minutes .
Companies like Freedom of Creation , which sells home furnishings , are already starting to experiment with this approach to doing business without relying on inventory or big capital investments .
" ( 3 - D printers ) are basically like the new car that landed in everybody 's driveway , " Summit concludes .
" ( Every designer ) wants to try them out and see what they can do . "

ST . PETERSBURG , Florida ( CNN ) --
The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN / YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday .
The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month .
With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season , the Republican candidates engaged in a free - for - all , trying to differentiate their views on immigration , the Iraq war , abortion , gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true .
Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front - runner Hillary Clinton , Wednesday night 's attacks were launched at each other .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration , something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month .
Romney attacked Giuliani 's record , saying that as mayor , he promoted illegal immigration .
And Giuliani shot back , accusing Romney of having a " sanctuary mansion " at his own home .
Watch the debate format produce raw moments »
GOP Debate Replay !
If you missed it , catch the debate everyone 's talking about -- again this weekend .
Saturday , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
" In his case , there were six sanctuary cities .
He did nothing about them .
There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home , illegal immigrants were being employed , " Giuliani said .
Romney denied Giuliani's allegation , and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other .
In his quest to appeal to the hard - line immigration wing of the party , Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who has been rising in the polls .
Rep .
Tom Tancredo , who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration , seemed delighted with the give and take , saying the other candidates were trying to " out - Tancredo " him .
Huckabee drew one of the night 's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service .
" Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging , and there 's a reason why , " he said .
Sen .
John McCain , freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates , and Rep. Ron Paul , the most anti-war of the candidates , tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war .
Did YouTubers get their questions answered ? »
Asked which government programs they would cut , Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save " a trillion dollars . "
McCain said : " It 's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II , " which drew some hoots from the crowd .
Watch McCain , Paul spar on Iraq »
Paul replied : " The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel ? "
A retired brigadier general , Keith Kerr , who is gay , asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops .
CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic front - runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters .
Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question »
David Bohrman , CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate , said , " We regret this incident .
CNN would not have used the general 's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate . "
Political Ticker
Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself .
Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans , a national gay and lesbian Republican grass - roots organization .
Prior to the debate , CNN had verified Kerr 's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate .
In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights , three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns : McCain , Giuliani and Romney .
Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped , " I own a couple of guns -- but I 'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are . "
Watch the candidates address gun control »
The debate turned personal when a viewer , holding the Bible , asked : " Do you believe every word of this book ?
And I mean specifically , this book that I am holding in my hand . "
Huckabee , a Baptist minister , said , " Sure , I believe the Bible is exactly what it is . "
Giuliani said he believes the Bible , but not " literally true in every respect . "
After that , Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word .
Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible »
" Yeah , the Bible is the word of God . ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word , but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God , " Romney said .
When asked about abortion , Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman 's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts .
" If people in this country are looking for someone who 's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they 're ever wrong , they 're going to have to find somebody else .
On abortion , I was wrong , " he said .
His remarks came in response to the 30 - second video produced for the debate by Thompson 's campaign , which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs .
Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen .
Ted Kennedy .
When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal , Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government .
" We do n't need a federal abortion police , that 's the last thing we need , " Paul said .
He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities .
On the issues of taxes , Thompson said he'd " never met a tax he liked . "
" I 've got a tax - cut bill on the table .
But I do n't do pledges to anybody but the American people , " he said .
His response was met by a " Go , Fred , go ! " from a member of the audience .
On the issue of trade with China , Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is " cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China 's cheating .
Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job . "
The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site , just as Democratic White House candidates did in July .
The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month .
CNN 's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats ' debate .

If a person looks at published oil reserves , it is easy to get the idea that there are huge amounts of oil left to be extracted .
One would think that there is no way that peak oil should be a concern .
Once we look at the situation a more closely , we discover that published oil reserves really are n't all that helpful in telling us about future production .
In fact , the evidence suggests that oil shortages may not be many years away .
This post includes some ideas of Matt Mushalik , plus some of my analysis .
Matt is a retired civil engineer and regional planner from Sydney , Australia .
Most reports show reserves similar to those shown above , which were compiled by British Petroleum ( BP ) .
The major categories shown on Figure 1 are
• Canadian oil or tar sands .
Generally considered a resource , rather than a reserve .
( Shown separately by BP . )
Oil sands resource was first listed by BP in 1999 , even though commercial production began in 1967 .
• OPEC 11 .
Excludes Angola ( added to OPEC in 2007 ) , and Ecuador ( added recently ) .
• FSU .
Former Soviet Union .
• USA , Europe , etc . Everything else other than Canadian oil sands , OPEC 11 , and FSU .
Includes Australia , Canada , China , Mexico , and many other counties .
In this analysis , the term " gigabarrels " ( abbreviated Gb ) is used to mean 1,000 million barrels , or 1 billion barrels in USA terminology .
2 . How does the distribution of actual oil production compare with the distribution of published reserves ?
It is very different :
Figure 2
Production from the Canadian oil sands is just a thin ribbon , year after year , in spite of the apparently large size of the available resources .
OPEC 11 has far less production than might be expected by their " proven reserves . "
USA , Europe , etc. has much higher production than might be expected based on the size of their reserves .
If one graphs the ratio of production to reserves , one obtains the following :
Figure 3
It is clear from this graph that the ratio of production to reserves varies considerably from group to group .
It can also vary over time , as shown by the fact that the ratio for FSU is shifting downward over time .
There seems to be an anomaly in the BP data in 1998 , which was the year production for FSU was shown by country for the first time .
In 1998 , there was a 23 Gb increase in FSU reserves , and corresponding decrease in reserves for the USA , Europe , etc. group .
Apparently , reserves for one or two countries got shifted between the two groups at that time .
This anomaly causes the jump in the 1998 production to reserve ratios in Figure 3 .
3 . Are n't published reserves a leading indicator for future production ?
One might expect reserves to be a leading indicator , but when one looks at historical data on an aggregate basis , it is difficult to see much evidence that this is in fact the case .
• USA , Europe , etc .
Oil reserves are essentially flat from 1980 to 2006 , while oil production first rose , then peaked and began to decline .
One would never guess the rise and fall in oil production from the reserves .
• USA by itself Both oil production and oil reserves have been falling since prior to 1980 .
Oil production has tended to fall more quickly than oil reserves , as evidenced by the decline in the production to reserve ratio over time .
If reserves were a leading indicator of depletion , one might expect this ratio to rise rather than fall over time .
Figure 4
• OPEC 11 Several OPEC members publish very high reserve numbers , but have never offered production at the level one might expect from the quoted reserves .
• FSU Russia quotes its reserves at " P3 " level , a level that is quite a bit higher than the level mandated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
Besides P1 or proved reserves , which are all the SEC permits , it includes amounts that are expected with improvements in technology and economics , and even amounts that may be possible in the future , with future technology .
The big drop in the ratio of production to reserves in recent years may indicate a more aggressive view of what may be possible in the future .
• Oil sands
The hot water extraction process similar to that used todaywas patented in 1928 , and the first large - scale commercial extraction began in 1967 .
While a huge amount of the resource is present and there has been a great deal of investment ( $ 10.4 billion in 2005 ) , production remains low -- currently a little over 1 % of world oil supply .
According to Statistics Canada , 2007 production is expected to increase by 2.2 % over 2006 production .
4 . Does everyone use the same rules in determining oil reserves ?
No .
Companies which follow the US SEC rules are required to set reserves at the P1 level -- the amount that is clearly available with current technology and current economic conditions .
Availability must be demonstrated by actual production or commercial formation tests .
Some countries use P2 reserves -- reserves that are at the " expected " level .
Others use P3 reserves , incorporating amounts that may be possible with future technology and higher oil prices .
I am not aware of aggregate data regarding the difference in these reserve levels , but some company level data suggests that at times they can be very large ( for example , here and here ) .
Now that companies are having increasing difficulty replacing their SEC reserves due to depletion , the SEC is considering modernizing its rules .
The changes are expected to increase the amount of reserves companies can record .
Reserve amounts reported by countries to statistical organizations are generally not audited .
BP reports whatever countries report to it , without adjustment .
When these amounts are published in newspapers and books , they are often referred to as " proven reserves , " even though they use different definitions and are not audited .
Based on US data , the data BP publishes appears to be on a crude + condensate + natural gas liquids basis .
Biofuels are excluded , as are processing gains .
5 . Is there any evidence that the oil reserves for OPEC are overstated ?
There is a great deal of evidence that this is the case .
• Matt Simmons obtained copies of more than 200 scientific papers published by scientists working on Saudi Arabian oil production .
Based on his review of these papers , Simmons came to the conclusion that reservoirs in Saudi Arabia were at an advanced stage of depletion , and that the reserves were significantly overstated .
His findings were published in the book Twilight in the Desert in 2005 .
• Several of the OPEC countries adjusted their reserves upward in the 1980s , without any new oil discoveries , at a time when there was discussion about how production quotas should be allocated .
It was believed that having higher reserves would be beneficial when quotas were assigned , so each country in turn raised its reserves .
Logically , reserves should be declining in recent years , as oil is pumped out , and virtually no new fields are added , but this is not happening .
Figure 5
• Dr. Sadad I. Al Husseini , former Executive Vice President of Aramco ( Saudi Arabia 's national oil company ) , gave a presentation last October in which he stated that OPEC oil reserves are overstated by more than 300 Gb .
If the amount is 300 Gb , it would correspond to about one - third of current reserves .
His presentation says more than , so this is a floor , not a best estimate .
• A report by the reserves committee of the Kuwait oil company shows only 24.2 Gb of proven reserves ( 48.1 Gb if non-proven reserves are included ) at the end of 2001 , while published reserves as of the same date were 96.5 Gb .
This was only 25 % of the published level .
• The amount of oil produced by OPEC , relative to the amount of stated reserves , is very low .
Some of this may be the result of very heavy oil that cannot be produced very quickly , such as that found in Venezuela ( similar to the Canadian oil sands ) .
Some other oil may be bypassed , because of war and sanctions , as in Iraq .
Even allowing for this , the reserves would be much more reasonable in relationship to production if they were half of their stated amount , or even less .
• While OPEC claims extra capacity , its actions are not consistent with having much extra capacity .
It seems likely that much of the claimed extra capacity relates to oil that is difficult to refine .
No buyers are available , because no refineries can handle the particular impurities of the oil .
6 . Is there a way of representing the disproportionate nature of the reserves and production graphically ?
Matt Mushalik has prepared a graph showing the disproportionate nature of reserves and production .
According to his calculations , 45 % of oil production comes from only 190 GB of reserves .
If these should deplete , there will be very serious implications for world production .
Figure 6
Matt 's groupings are a little different from mine .
He shows several of the OPEC countries separately and groups the remaining countries by whether their reserves are increasing over time or decreasing over time .
Matt has written about the disconnect between reserves and production in World 's Fragile Oil Flows From Declining Reserve Base .
7. Does n't the US Geological Service ( USGS ) say that huge amounts of oil are yet to be discovered , and that current reserves will prove to be too low , rather than too high ?
Yes .
The latest USGS study does show 649 Gb of undiscovered oil and 612 Gb of " reserve growth " .
The methodology of this analysis is seriously in doubt , according to a report by Jean Laherrere .
In this report , USGS does not adequately reflect the fact that the rate of discoveries has been falling .
Figure 7
The USGS also determines expected reserve growth in an inappropriate manner .
They determine reserve growth based on historical experience for companies using SEC reserves .
They apply this approach world - wide , without considering the type of reserves reported by other countries .
In countries where reserves are inflated , this adjustment has the effect of inflating them further .
If the ratio of US production to reserves has been declining over time , it is likely this approach will even overstate future US reserve growth .
8 . Which of the groups " USA , Europe , etc. " , FSU , and OPEC are past peak production ?
• USA , Europe , etc .
The grouping USA , Europe , etc. is fairly clearly past peak production .
The USA , the North Sea , and Mexico are all past peak , as are Canadian conventional production and Australia .
The only other major producer that is not past peak is China , and its production is increasing very little .
Angola and Ecuador , which have recently joined OPEC , are shown in this group , but even with their inclusion , production is dropping .
Figure 8
It is logical that this group should peak first , because it includes most of the heavy users of oil , and they generally extracted their own oil first .
EIA data through November 2007 is shown because it gives nearly the full 2007 year , while BP does not yet include 2007 .
The reason BP data is consistently higher than EIA data is because it includes natural gas liquids , while EIA data includes only crude and condensate .
Since EIA does not show a subtotal for FSU , it was necessary to estimate this amount by combining data for the available countries , and adding an estimate for countries not shown separately , based on BP data for this segment .
• Former Soviet Union
Oil production for the FSU does not yet appear to have peaked .
Figure 9
Production dropped in the early 1990's , and is now getting back to the level it was previously .
It is not clear that it will ever exceed its previous peak .
There are frequent reports that Russian production is expected to level off or decline in the future ; the smaller countries are limited in their production capability by infrastructure limitations .
Thus , increases in the future are likely to be small , at least in relationship to declines in production of the USA , Europe , etc. group .
Thus , this group is not likely by itself to save us from peak oil .
• OPEC 11
It is possible that OPEC - 11 is past peak , but this is not yet certain .
BP indicates a small up - tick in OPEC 11 production in 2006 , but EIA data shows a decrease in both 2006 and 2007 production .
Figure 10
If one looks more closely at OPEC 11 production using Matt Mushalik 's graph of incremental EIA production ( showing just recent changes in production ) , one can see that that while Saudi Arabian oil production is not as low as it was in early 2007 , it is nowhere near where it was in mid-2005 .
Figure 11
The lower Saudi production raises questions about OPEC 11's ability to raise its production .
This is one to watch - - once OPEC 11 is past peak , it is very likely that the world is past peak .
We know so little about " real " OPEC reserves that reserve levels cannot be used to eliminate this possibility .
9 . Can the Canadian oil sands save us from peak oil ?
Can the perpetual sliver ever be anything else ?
It is difficult to see how Canadian oil sands production will expand very much , very quickly .
According to the Master 's thesis of Bengt Söderbergh , natural gas availability is likely to limit oil sands production in the long term .
With or without the natural gas limitation , there are many other concerns , including environmental impact , greenhouse gas emissions , and very high continuing investment .
Optimistic estimates of production are about four times current production by 2030 .
This would be about 5 % of current world production -- still not very much .
It is possible that one of the new production techniques , such as Toe to Heel Air Injection , will prove to be effective .
If this happens , oil sands production may increase by even more than that forecast in the current optimistic target .
If such an increase does occur , much of the benefit is likely to be after 2020 .
Such an increase could theoretically help mitigate the downslope after the peak in world oil production .
The increase , should it occur , is likely be too late and too small to prevent the peak .
10 .
Does this type of analysis say anything about depletion rates ?
Possibly .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) published an analysis indicating that if one looks at a mixture of fields that are increasing and decreasing , the overall decline rate is 4.5 % .
If CERA looks at the decline rate for a mixture of increasing and decreasing fields , it sounds like CERA is looking at the depletion rate with respect to reserves at a point in time .
This is in contrast to a decline rate , which one generally thinks about as occurring after individual field 's peak or plateau .
While CERA made its calculation with individual field data , another approach would be to start with aggregate data relating to the ( production / reserves ) ratio , such as BP data .
A person would then make adjustments to the aggregate data .
One adjustment would be to remove reserves relating to fields that are not yet in production from the total reserve amount .
Another adjustment might be to put reserves on a P2 ( that is expected ) basis , if companies report them on a P1 or P3 basis .
Another adjustment is a small timing adjustment - the payments during one year should relate to reserves at the end of the previous year , instead of the end of the current year .
Ratios before adjustment are shown in Figure 3 .
The ratio before adjustment for the USA , Europe , etc. group is 7.1 % ( Figure 3 ) .
It seems likely that even after adjustment , it would be higher than 4.5 % .
The ratio before adjustment for the FSU group is 3.5 % .
Two adjustments are needed :
1 .To reduce the reserves because reserves are on a P3 basis , and thus are higher than the expected or P2 level .
2 . To reduce the reserves by the amount relating to fields not yet in production .
Both of these adjustments would tend to reduce the denominator of this ratio , and thus increase the ratio .
With these adjustments , it is likely that the FSU ratio would also be over 4.5 % .
OPEC reserves , as published , are too unreliable for this approach to work .
If a person had a better analysis of reserve figures for OPEC , it could perhaps be applied .
11 . What should we do now ?
Given the likely shortage of oil in the future , and the likely environmental impacts whether or not there is an oil shortage , it would be best to start taking action now to reduce usage of oil and other fossil fuels .

We are now running out of time to implement urban rail solutions as is being done in the Australian City of Perth .
In Perth , rail lines run alongside the freeways .
Rail stations have bus terminuses on top the rail stations , and kiss & ride and park & ride facilities nearby .
This is ideal for getting to the station in various ways and a quick train - ride to the city .
The concept of the Linux mascot being a penguin came from
Tux is the world famous and endearing symbol of Linux .
I do n’t know any other software mascot that is so loved and venerated other than Tux .
There are plenty of reasons for this phenomenon , but I wo n’t try to enumerate it here .
Perhaps seeing my collection of " 30 Coolest and Funniest Tux Icons " can somehow help explain why Tux is so adored .
But first , some brief
Tux facts :
The concept of the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds .
Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial suggestion made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list .
Linus took his inspiration from a photograph he found on an FTP site , showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park .
The first person to call the penguin " Tux " was James Hughes , who said that it stood for " ( T ) orvalds ( U ) ni ( X ) " .
However , many people observe that Tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo , the outfit which springs to mind when they see a penguin .

Bletchley Park code - breaker Professor Donald Michie , 84 , and his ex-wife , geneticist Dame Anne McLaren , 80 , were killed in a car crash this Saturday .
Their son , Jonathan , told Reuters that his parents were travelling from Cambridge to London on the M11 , when their car left the road and hit a tree .
No other cars are reported to have been involved in the accident .
Both were extremely eminent scientists : Dame Anne was the first female officer of the Royal Society , a fellow of King 's College and Christ College , Cambridge , and a member of the Warnock Commission , an ethical advisory board on the use of genetics .
Her ex-husband Professor Michie was an artificial intelligence researcher who had worked with Alan Turing at Bletchley Park during the second world war .
Martin Rees , president of the Royal Society , said that Dame Anne 's death was a " great tragedy and a loss to science ...
She was both idealistic and effective , and her loss will be deeply felt not only by her fellow researchers , but far more widely . "
It was at Bletchley Park that Professor Michie developed an interest in machine intelligence , but it was an interest it would take him some time to revive .
After the war he went to Oxford to study medicine , going on to obtain a D Phil in Mammalian Genetics .
He worked in Zoology , briefly alongside Dame Anne at UCL , until the mid 1960s , when he returned to his programming roots and set up the Experimental Programming Unit , at the University of Edinburgh .
There he later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception .
Professor Michie 's work at Bletchley Park contributed to cracking Tunny , a German teleprinter cipher implemented by the Lorenz machine .
The code breakers never saw a Lorenz machine until after the war , but they had been decoding its messages for two and a half years .
The Lorenz machine took a stream on input and obscured it using the Vernam system .
This took a plain text message and added an set of obscuring characters to it , producing the cipher text .
The same set of characters could then be added back to the cipher text and would reveal the original message .
The original German plan was to use characters from a one - time pad to encipher the plain text , but this proved operationally difficult to manage .
As a result , the obscuring text was provided by a pseudo - random number generator .
The pseudo in the random was the chink in the armour that allowed the team at Bletchley to break the cipher .
According to Jonathan Michie , at the time of his death , his father had been preparing to give a lecture on the history of machine intelligence to the University of Edinburgh .
The couple worked together at University College London during the 1950s .
They were married in 1952 and had three children before divorcing in 1959 .
Despite the breakdown of their marriage , they remained close and still shared a house in Camden , North London .
Professor Michie also leaves another child from an earlier marriage . ®
March 20 , 2008  --
At least two Iraqi families of victims killed by Blackwater security guards in September tell ABC News they have refused compensation offered by the company .
The father of a 9 - year - old boy , who says his son was one of the 17 civilians killed when Blackwater guards , escorting a diplomatic convoy , opened fire at Baghdad 's Nisour Square on Sept. 16 , says he is trying to file a lawsuit against the company .
He told ABCNews.com that Blackwater offered him $ 20,000 through an Iraqi prosecutor , but he refused the money .
Another Iraqi who lost both his wife and son in the incident says he too has refused the company 's offer of compensation of $ 20,000 for each victim .
Adel Jabur Shamma , who was injured in the incident , says he was bed - ridden for six months after being shot in the thigh .
He says he was given $ 10,000 by the Iraqi prosecutor who is mediating between the families and Blackwater , but that the amount is n't nearly enough to cover his surgery .
He says he took the money because he had no other choice .
While a federal grand jury in Washington , D.C. investigates the deaths , Blackwater has been operating behind the scenes in Iraq to offer condolence payments to survivors and families of the dead .
The company released a statement this afternoon saying : " At the request of U.S. Embassy Baghdad , Blackwater has reached out to the families of those killed or injured in Nisoor Square on September 16 as part of this condolence payment process .
These are customary condolence payments , and are not an admission of guilt , but recognize that Iraq is an extremely dangerous place .
When faced with an enemy intent on maximizing civilian casualties , innocent people will tragically be caught in the crossfire ; when that happens , their suffering should not go unrecognized . "
Officials familiar with the case told ABCNews.com last month that Blackwater had resisted U.S. government demands that the company pay at least $ 100,000 per death , claiming the U.S. government itself has n't paid that much in similar situations .
As ABCNews.com has reported , the federal grand jury criminal investigation is focusing on two or three Blackwater guards who opened fire , claiming they perceived a threat .
Other Blackwater guards have testified to federal agents , however , that they saw no such threat .
Several of the Iraqi families have already filed lawsuits against Blackwater in U.S. courts , alleging the security guards were guilty of " war crimes . "

Non-radioactive technology is also used in cancer detection
Doctors have described the shortage of medical nuclear material as " potentially catastrophic " .
The Chalk River reactor , in Ontario , was closed two weeks ago for scheduled maintenance which has now been prolonged until early or mid-January .
The reactor supplies two - thirds of the world 's medical isotopes to hospitals .
Safety standards
The isotopes are injected as a radioactive dye into patients with cancer or other diseases to allow doctors to take detailed scans .
Thousands of patients in Canada , the United States and other countries have had vital tests postponed because of the shortage .
" Last week , I guess you could describe it as struggling , " said Dr Chris O'Brien , president of the Ontario Association of Nuclear Medicine .
" This week it 's devastating , and next week potentially catastrophic . "
The head of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission said the government - run reactor was violating safety standards .
The sudden shutdown has created problems for MDS Nordion , the medical supply company which sells much of Chalk River 's output .
The company said it anticipates a return to full production in early to mid-January .
In the meantime , company officials said it was looking for other sources of supply for the radioisotopes .
The isotopes cannot be stockpiled because they have a short shelf life .
Violence in Gaza to end , for now :
Despite earlier denials by top officials in Jerusalem , a senior defense official has confirmed Tuesday that an agreement on a lull in Gaza Strip fighting has been worked out .
In a conversation with French news agency AFP , the security official said that an agreement that would see an end to Israeli military operations in the Strip in exchange for an end to rocket attacks on Israel has been finalized via Egyptian mediation efforts .
Gaza Strip Palestinians : Ceasefire in south already in effect Ali Waked Gaza sources claim Israel , armed Palestinian factions reach understanding on ceasefire in area , effective as of this weekend .
Only one rocket fired at Negev in last two days , no IDF strikes registered in Strip .
PMO denies any deal reached with Hamas Palestinians : Ceasefire in south already in effect
Egypt pledges to fight arms smuggling
The lull agreement reached between Israel and Hamas is subject to an Egyptian pledge to do everything in its power to prevent arms smuggling into the Gaza Strip , the defense official noted .
In addition , according to the report , Israel pledged to refrain from massive offensive operations but is reserving the right to carry out attacks on specific targets should the need arise .
Earlier Tuesday , London - based Arabic - language newspaper al - Quds Al - Arabi reported that senior Defense Ministry official Amos Gilad has relayed to Egypt Israel 's request for a month - long unofficial ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza .
The latest report joins earlier reports from the Arab world that confirmed Israeli - Palestinian understandings on a lull agreement .
Last week ,
Ynet also reported that such agreement has been worked out , despite official denials .

Absolutely Brilliant !
Posted by : cinefoz | Feb 15 , 2008 11:25:09 AM
NASA ’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) has taken the best measurement of the age of the Universe to date .
According to highly Â precise observations of microwave radiation observed all over the cosmos , WMAP scientists now have the best estimate yet on the age of the Universe : 13.73 billion years , plus or minus 120 million years ( that ’s an error margin of only 0.87 % … not bad really … ) .
The WMAP mission was sent to the Sun -Earth second Lagrangian point ( L 2 ) , located approximately 1.5 million km from the surface of the Earth on the night - side ( i.e. WMAP is constantly in the shadow of the Earth ) in 2001 .
The reason for this location is the nature of the gravitational stability in the region and the lack of electromagnetic interference from the Sun .
Constantly looking out into space , WMAP scans the cosmos with its ultra sensitive microwave receiver , mapping any small variations in the background “ temperature ” ( anisotropy ) of the universe .
It can detect microwave radiation in the wavelength range of 3.3 - 13.6 mm ( with a corresponding frequency of 90 - 22 GHz ) .
Warm and cool regions of space are therefore mapped , including the radiation polarity .
This microwave background radiation originates from a very early universe , just 400,000 years after the Big Bang , when the ambient temperature of the universe was about 3,000 K .
At this temperature , neutral hydrogen atoms were possible , scattering photons .
It is these photons WMAP observes today , only much cooler at 2.7 Kelvin ( that ’s only 2.7 degrees higher than absolute zero , - 273.15 Â°C ) .
WMAP constantly observes this cosmic radiation , measuring tiny alterations in temperature and polarity .
These measurements refine our understanding about the structure of our universe around the time of the Big Bang and also help us understand the nature of the period of “ inflation ” , in the very beginning of the expansion of the Universe .
It is a matter of exposure for the WMAP mission , the longer it observes the better refined the measurements .
After seven years of results - taking , the WMAP mission has tightened the estimate on the age of the Universe down to an error margin of only 120 million years , that ’s 0.87 % of the 13.73 billion years since the Big Bang .
“ Everything is tightening up and giving us better and better precision all the time [ … ]
It ’s actually significantly better than previous results .
There is all kinds of richness in the data . ” – Charles L. Bennett , Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University .
This will be exciting news to cosmologists as theories on the very beginning of the Universe are developed even further .

To the fury , no doubt , of Belgium 's dwindling band of " old colonials " the state - funded Royal Museum for Central Africa - formerly known as the Museum of the Belgian Congo - has commissioned some of the country 's most eminent historians to give the public the one thing they have been deprived of for so long : the truth .
Shocking claims - often well documented - that 10 million Congolese were either murdered or worked to death by Leopold 's private army , that women were systematically raped , that locals ' hands were cut off and that the local populace endured kidnapping , looting and village burnings , have never been the subject of serious debate in Belgium , let alone an apology .
Many of these allegations are set out in a book called King Leopold 's Ghost by the American author Adam Hochschild .
When it was published in Belgium in 1999 it outraged the country 's historians but failed to bring about a genuine period of reflection .
Controversially , Hochschild compared the death toll in the Belgian - administered Congo to the Holocaust and Stalin 's purges .
" We will look at these claims , we will investigate them and by 2004 we will attempt to provide an answer to Hochschild 's book , " Guido Gryseels , the director of the museum , said .
" We cannot avoid answering these questions .
It has become too much of an issue .
Everyone raises it all the time and we do n't know what to say . "
The investigation will force the country to confront its colonial demons and tackle a subject which has been taboo ever since the Welsh - born explorer Henry Morton Stanley secured the rubber - and ivory - rich colony for Leopold in 1885 .
The investigatory panel , likely to be headed by Professor Jean - Luc Vellut , will start work in the next two months and present its findings in 2004 ( the centenary of Stanley 's death ) as part of an exhibition at the museum .
If Congo is Belgium 's forgotten skeleton then the museum is its neglected cupboard .
An imposing palace near Brussels built by Leopold with money he made in Congo to showcase a place he never visited , it is crammed with millions of objects brought back in dubious circumstances .
Tatty stuffed animals vie for attention with display cases crammed with butterflies , fish and African tribal art , but the museum , like much of Belgium itself , is frozen in a colonial time warp .
It commemorates the Force Publique officers , who are now accused of barbarism .
And of the cruelty and suffering endured by the Congolese people there is no mention .
It is a desire to modernise the museum and drag it out of its one - sided politically incorrect past that has prompted the investigation .
" The museum has n't changed for the last 44 years , " Mr Gryseels conceded .
" It has a colonial spirit to it .
As you walk in there is a statue [ of a black boy looking up at a white missionary ] with the legend ' Belgium brings civilisation to the Congo ' .
" The message of the museum needs to change so that it does n't only reflect the view of Belgium before 1960 [ when Congo won its independence ] .
We need African views too so that the visitor can make up their own mind . "
More than a century may have passed since Leopold acquired Congo , embracing territory the size of western Europe , but sensitivity about Belgian culpability remain acute .
" It is a reality which touches the deepest part of the Belgian soul , " Mr Gryseels said .
" We really have n't coped with it , and the revelations came as a real shock .
We were brought up knowing that we brought civilisation and good to Africa .
[ Allegations of brutality ] were n't taught in schools . "
The investigation will be only the first step towards coming to terms with the past .
Disbelief about the seriousness of the allegations and a feeling that foreign historians are over influenced by works such as Joseph Conrad 's Heart of Darkness , in which the terrible Kurtz has African heads on spikes in his front garden , runs deep - even among the historians invited to investigate the matter .
" To compare it with the Holocaust or Auschwitz is an insult to the truth , " Prof Vellut said .
" We need to put our history in perspective and be cautious . "
Many of the specific allegations cannot , he conceded , be disputed but he argued that discovering the precise scale of the atrocities would be difficult .
" Statistics for that period are very unreliable .
One hardly knew what the population was .
You can see figures which make the Jewish slaughter pale in comparison .
Who knows whether 10 m or 15 m Congolese were killed ? "
King 's plunder
· King Leopold II appointed himself King Sovereign of Congo Free State in 1885
· In 1908 , a year before his death , he sold the colony to the Belgian state , which governed it until independence in 1960
· Belgian Congo was 76 times bigger than Belgium itself
· Rudyard Kipling called it the place " where there are no 10 commandments "
· The instrument of Belgian repression was the chicotte - a whip made from sun-dried hippo hide
· Leopold 's fortune - which he ploughed back into monumental buildings in Brussels - was made on the proceeds of Congolese rubber and ivory
· Locals were forced to collect the sap required to produce rubber or , it is alleged , have their hands or feet , or those of their children , cut off
· Between 1880 and 1920 the population of Congo halved .
The writer Adam Hochschild claims that 10 million people were the victims of murder , starvation , exhaustion induced by over - work , and disease
· The plight of the Congolese , and Belgian brutality were first brought to the world 's attention at the beginning of the 20th century by American and British campaigners and writers
No matter what I ’m doing , I ca n’t help wondering if there is a better way .
For example , I noticed yesterday in Las Vegas that many of the casinos have ATMs amongst thousands of slot machines .
The casinos hopes you will take your money out of one machine , carry it several feet , and put it in another .
There ’s something about the change of ownership in your money that is considered entertainment .
And judging from the crowds , people ca n’t get enough of it .
In the old days , when Vegas was less popular , the slot machines sometimes gave a little of your money back , at least temporarily .
But these days all the nice hotels are at full occupancy .
I ’ve been here three days and have n’t seen anyone win a jackpot .
If you think that removing the “ maybe you can win ” part from the equation would dampen peoples ’ enthusiasm , you have vastly overestimated the intelligence of the general public .
After Las Vegas trained people to lose 98 % of the time , it was a simple matter to nudge it to 100 % .
Now the casinos have people trained , like chickens hoping for pellets , to take money from one machine ( the ATM ) , carry it across a room and deposit in another machine ( the slot machine ) .
I believe B.F. Skinner would agree with me that there is room for even more efficiency :
The ATM and the slot machine need to be the same machine .
The casinos lose a lot of money waiting for the portly gamblers with respiratory issues to waddle from the ATM to the slot machines .
A better solution would be for the losers , euphemistically called “ players , ” to stand at the ATM and watch their funds be transferred to the hotel , while hoping to somehow “ win . ”
The ATM could be redesigned to blink and make exciting sounds , so it seems less like robbery .
I ’m sure this is in the five - year plan .
Longer term , people will be trained to set up automatic transfers from their banks to the casinos .
People will just fly to Vegas , wander around on the tarmac while the casino drains their bank accounts , then board the plane and fly home .
The airlines are already in on this concept , and stopped feeding you sandwiches a while ago .
In the spirit of my last post , I decided to turn one of my favorite long comments on Hacker News into a blog post in the hopes that someone would find it useful .
There was a good discussion last week about how to learn Lisp , and since I was a little late to the thread , most of the things I wanted to say had already been said .
So , in an effort to pull it all together , I made a nice long summary comment , which is reproduced and cleaned up below .
Before I started learning Lisp , I have ( in reverse chronological order ) worked with .
Net for several years , disliked C++ in college , loved Pascal in high school , dabbled in ( Assembly ? ) programming my TI - 82 graphing calculator , and started with Hypercard .
Here ’s my advice based on ~ 1 year of part - time Lisp education .
There are three hurdles people usually run into when learning Lisp :
The language looks different – this goes away with practice and familiarity .
It starts looking normal fast .
The parentheses are a bit tough to manage unless you use a capable editor , which leads to : Emacs is different – really powerful , fun to use , but it takes investment in learning .
It ’s really tempting to quit when starting , but worth getting over the hump .
Once you do that :
The way of thinking is different in Lisp – Lisp seems a little awkward to use until you get ( do n’t need to master them , just get the idea ) the following ideas : 1 ) code can be manipulated as data because the syntax is so simple , 2 ) creating your own syntax ( using macros – code that writes code ) means that you can express your program in a way that closely matches the problem you ’re trying to solve .
Some good articles to help get these points are : The Nature of Lisp Functional Programming For The Rest of Us
Do n’t worry if you do n’t get these “ big picture ” things at first , they click at some point and everything makes a lot more sense .
You can speed that up by putting a lot more Lisp in your head in the meantime .
Does anyone have any more tips on learning Lisp ?

Sick Leave

“ Linda Kroen ! 155013 !
Report for duty ”
Linda did n’t exactly know why the crystalline voice of the ship AI was blaring her name but she was n’t going to answer .
It ’s her day off .
“ Linda Kroen !
It is estimated you only have 135 minutes until you expire .
Report for duty ! ”
The impulses signaling the importance of the message and the impulse signaling that her mouth is full of blood were simultaneously received by Linda ’s brain .
Stumbling out of bed she fell on the cold metal floor .
She had sprayed blood all over while gasping for air but the room still looked sterile .
“ WHAT ?
Why ? ”
Her radiation meter tattoo was black .
The little patch of skin almost looked burned with a laser .
“ You ’ve been exposed to lethal doses of radiation .
You must make your way to the auxiliary bridge ”
“ WHY ?
Where ’s the captain ? ”
“ You are acting captain ”
“ I ’m a level 2 tech ! ”
“ Linda Kroen 155013 : promoted to acting field captain by automated succession order on 27 Feb ‘ 47 ”
“ That ’s today .
Wher … ”
As she stood up her lungs filled and she coughed another spray of blood on the wall .
“ Ok… Situation report . ”
“ Aces. . Ac…Ac ”
The voice of the AI reverbed as if caught in an infinite loop .
“ Information limited .
Data corruption .
Sensor data shows extreme radiation spike approximately 2 hours ago .
Uncorrupted log information begins 27 minutes ago as follows :
– Cpt. Musa deceased , replacement not mentioned
– automated succession order comes into effect .
Linda Kroen 155013 selected .
– Cpt. Kroen ’s lifesigns fluctuating .
Life expectancy : 14 minutes .
Medical staff not available .
Stimulants administered through ventilation .
Massive internal bleeding probable .
New life expectancy : 160 minutes
– assessment of ship status begins
Current situation :
– large sections of hull missing ”
“ You pumped me full of damn stims to wake me up ?
That ’s why I ’m bleeding from every pore . ”
“ Your condition was critical captain ”
“ This does n’t make sense … the succession order goes by rank there are hundreds of people above me and … everybody ’s dead . ”
“ Linda Kroen 155013 is the highest ranking living crewmember .
You must proceed to the auxiliary bridge to enable the main cannon . ”
The new captain had already stepped out of the room leaving bloody footprints on the cold floor .
Her heart was pounding , her eyes were sore but she was unfazed .
Bodies littered the corridors .
“ Why am I still alive ? ”
“ You requested sick leave .
That automatically creates a septic field in your quarters .
Combined with your documented higher resistance to radiation it was enough to lower your exposure to the event .
Next corridor , enter the lift . ”
As Linda neared the lift its vents hissed open and flooded her senses with an electric feeling .
The lift whirred down .
“ Who… ? ”
“ Data corrupted ”
The doors opened and a body fell .
The sound of his head hitting the metal floor seemed interesting to Linda .
Vents hissed again in the corridor making her feel better .
Skipping her way to the next lift she started thinking how cool it will be to tell her friends how fast she made captain .
Rubbing the black tattoo on her arm and seeing everyone else ’s was the same she spit out some blood .
The lift took her directly to auxiliary command .
As soon as the doors opened she jumped into the swivel chair of the captain .
Something snapped at landing but Linda was enjoying too much to notice .
“ Take a note !
Effective tomorrow everybody can customize his or her tattoo . ”
“ Acknowledged .
Please authorize AI control of main canon . ”
“ Who are we firing at again ? ”
“ Data corrupted ”
Linda logged into the console and switched all control options to AI .
“ … Good . ”
The vents hissed loudly letting in welcomed euphoria .
Captain Linda Kroen reclined , twirling , with a smirk on her face , as tears of blood ran from her eyes .
“ Stims are great … ”

The second part of this post is up , so after you finish reading , check it out !
I really want to know what it is about programming , or computers in general , that makes people want to grow a beard , have long hair , and dress like a slob .
I can say these things without guilt because while I do not have long hair , I do have a beard and I do in fact dress like a slob .
Not horribly sloppy or anything .
I am actually pretty fanatical about hygiene , I just am not big on tucking my shirt in or ironing it or shaving .
So who was the guy that started the unkempt programmer code of honor ?
Was it this guy ?
Edsger Dijkstra ( most know for Dijkstra ’s shortest path algorithm )
Here we see him in a suit and tie , but hey , he was born in 1930 .
All people wore a suit and tie back then , even women and children .
Or how about this guy ?
Alan Kay – Does n’t he look like a sad Burt Reynolds ?
Stop laughing !
This is one of the fathers of object oriented programming .
All hail !
He does have the mop and a nice ‘ stache going on though .
What about this one ?
Bjarne Stroustrup – I would say that this looks like the kind of guy I would expect to see on a " wanted poster " somewhere , but this guy brought us C ++!
I could n’t talk trash about a guy who made C++.
And this one ?
Charles Bachman – Nothing unkempt about this guy , except that hat !
Damn son !
He had a hand in early database technology and won the Turing award for his work .
The list keeps going …
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson –
Are we programming here or going to a Hell ’s Angels meeting ?
But seriously though , being that I am a Microsoft programmer I ’m not sure that I am supposed to like these guys .
Dennis was the original developer of C and one of the core developers on UNIX while Ken was the man responsible for UNIX and the fact that I do n’t have to pay 8000 dollars for a copy of Windows since MS has some competition now .
But seriously , these guys are gods .
One of my personal favorites …
John McCarthy – Long lost relative of Colonel Sanders and the original designer of the Lisp programming language .
This guy had some serious programming cojones .
He even predicted in 1961 that one day computer processing would be sold like a utility .
That is the kind of prediction that makes Nostradamus look like a sissy .
Again , not too terribly unkempt , but that crazy hair and beard mixed with the suit says " serious by day , party animal by night . "
The A - list celeb :
Donald Knuth –
If I have to explain what this guy did for computer science , then you need to stop reading this and go to the book store .
Again , not an unkempt guy , but nothing says " Computer Programming God " like flannel .
You really have to wonder where his beard or mustache is though .
He is a real computer scientist , is n’t he ?
Cha-ching …
Martin Fowler – I ’m not sure he should be in the list with some of these other guys , but he is a personal hero of mine , and man this picture is great .
I could not have asked for a better example of this article if I had requested a picture from him .
He has written quite a few books , of which Refactoring and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture are my favorites .
And the freedom fighter …
Richard Stallman – Like him or hate him , he is a seriously influential person in the computer world , and again he looks like he ’d fit in better at a wood chopping competition than at MIT , but who am I to judge ?
The man is the founder of GNU , need I say more ?
And the fruit …
Steve Wozniak –
What is a list of crazy computer people without Woz ?
He co-founded Apple ( duh ) and is the poster - boy for hippie style programming .
This one is a gem …
Yukihiro Matsumoto – I just threw this one in for the search engines .
Just kidding !
This the man that brought us Ruby and proves that even in the land of the rising sun , programmers still need beards .
Or at least a five o’clock shadow .
By popular demand …
Larry Wall –
This guy brought us Perl and sports a nice mustache and hair that would make Fabio jealous .
And I ca n’t believe I left off this one …
Alan Cox – Holy crap .
Alan Cox and Richard Stallman must have been long lost brothers .
This guy was one of the earliest developers on the linux kernel and apparently has not shaved since he started .
The programming santa …
James Gosling –
This guy brought us Java and is wearing a shirt with the java mascot playing an electric guitar .
I have nothing else to say .
I think I am out of smart - ass comments .
He ’s a cold hearted snake …
Guido Van Rossum –
This guy brought us Python and he is seen here without his beard , but he has an afro that would make Snoop Dog smile .
I know I said Fabio before , but wow …
Grady Booch –
This guy does commercials for Herbal Essences shampoo and in his spare time he invented UML .
Oh , and he wrote a little book called Object Oriented Analysis and Design , you may have heard of it . 🙂
And saving the best for last …
Justin Etheredge – How ’d that tool get in there ?
His picture does n’t deserve to be in the same folder as these guys , much less in a list with them !
Bah !
So there you have it , my totally incomplete list of bearded , long haired , casually dressed visionaries .
Except that last one .
Sorry , but I ’m not sure how that last one got in there .
Now what other field ( except maybe physics ) would accept these people , much less make them their idols .
Got any other great pictures of any computer scientists / software engineers ?
Let us know in the comments .
Also , this list is clearly in jest , if you are offended by having your picture on here then please let me know and I will take it down .
Just send the request in writing to me with a signed copy of your book / source / picture and a personal letter of recommendation .
I will then dance because you have fallen victim to my trap .
And one final note , I ca n’t believe you guys read this crap . 🙂
All this technology and what do we use it for ?
To make fun of the visionaries of our time .
Man I love these here internets .
If you enjoyed it , go read part two !
New Jersey 's state assembly yesterday voted 44 - 36 to abolish the death penalty - the first state to do so since Iowa and West Virginia scrapped the punishment in 1965 .
The move was prompted by a special state commission 's findings that the death penalty was " a more expensive sentence than life in prison , had not deterred murder , and risked killing an innocent person " .
Wilfredo Caraballo , a Democratic assembly member , said : " It 's time New Jersey got out of the execution business .
Capital punishment is costly , discriminatory , immoral , and barbaric .
We 're a better state than one that puts people to death . "
Governor Jon Corzine has said he will sign the bill before January , and in future those who would have previously been executed will face life imprisonment without parole .
The decision means a reprieve for eight men on New Jersey 's death row , including Jesse Timmendequas whose 1994 murder of seven - year - old Megan Kanka led to " Megan 's Law " , which " requires law enforcement agencies to notify the public about convicted sex offenders living in their communities " , as the Telegraph explains .
The death penalty now remains in 37 US states .
Those who do not practice executions are Alaska , Hawaii , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , New York , North Dakota , Rhode Island , Vermont , West Virginia and Wisconsin , plus the District of Columbia .
Since the US Supreme Court reintroduced the ultimate sanction in 1976 , 1,099 people have gone to their deaths - 53 of them in 2006 .
The last execution was that of Michael Richard in Texas on 25 September , prior to a suspension of all executions pending a Supreme Court decision on " whether execution through lethal injection violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment " .

なぜMicrosoft Officeファイルフォーマットはこんなにもややこしいのか ( そしてその対処法を幾つか )
Tuesday , February 19 , 2008
先週 、Microsoft はOfficeのバイナリフォーマットを公開したが、このフォーマットは殆ど正気でないように見える。Excel 97-2003ファイルフォーマットは349ページのPDFファイルだ。でも待って、それで全部じゃない。このドキュメントには次の面白いコメントが書いてある。
それぞれ のExcelワークブックは1つのcompound fileに収められている
つまり 、Excel 97-2003ファイルはOLE
coumpound documentで、それは結局、1つのファイル内にあるファイルシステムである。これは、理解するのにあと9ページはスペックを読まなくちゃならないぐらいには十分に複雑だ。そしてこれらの「スペック」は、普通我々が考えるようなスペックというよりは、Cデータ構造みたいに見える。これ全体が階層的ファイルシステムなのだ。
もしあなたが週末を 、Wordドキュメントをブログにインポートしたり、あなたの個人的な財務データからExcelフォーマットのスプレッドシートを生成するような気の利いたコードを書くのに使おうと思ってこれらのドキュメントを読み始めたなら、このスペックのややこしさと長さがそんな気をあっという間に失せさせるだろう。普通のプログラマはこのOfficeバイナリファイルフォーマットについて次のような結論を下す:
故意に不明瞭にされている
発狂したボーグ( スタートレックに出てくる生命体)
の精神が生み出したものである
正気でないまずいプログラマによって作られた
読んだり、正しく作ったりすることは不可能である
こ の4つ全てについて、きみは間違っている。ちょっとだけ掘り下げて、これらのファイルフォーマットがどうしてこんなに信じがたいくらいに複雑なのか、なぜMicrosoftの悪いプログラミングを反映しているのではないのか、そしてそれを回避するためにあなたに何ができるか、を明らかにしよう。
理解すべき最初のことは、これらのバイナリファイルフォーマットはちょっと違ったデザインゴールを持って設計されたということだ。たとえばHTMLとは。
これらはすごく古いコンピュータで速く処理できるようにデザインされた。Excel for Windowsの初期のバージョンでは、1MBのRAM、20MHz動作の80386が Excelを快適に走らせることができるための妥当なものだった。このファイルフォーマット内には、ファイルを素早く開いたり閉じたりするための最適化が沢山仕込まれている:
これらはバイナリフォーマットだ。だからレコードのロードは通常は、単にディスクからメモリへある範囲のバイト列をコピーする( blitting)ことで、それは結局あなたが使うCデータ構造だ。lexing
も parsing も ファイルのロードに際しては行われない。lexing と parsing は blitting よりも 1 オーダー遅い 。
このファイルフォーマットは、よくある操作を速くするために、必要なところでは捻じ曲げられている。例えば
Excel 95 および 97 は " Simple Save " と呼ばれるものを持っており、これは主流の使いどころでは十分に高速とはいえない
OLE compound document formatの 高速なバージョンとして使われ た
。Word は Fast Saveと呼ばれるものを持っていた。長いドキュメントを素早くセーブするために、15回中14回は、1からドキュメントを書き直すのではなく、変更分がファイルの最後に追加されるだけだった。当時のハードディスクでは、これは長いドキュメントのセーブが30秒でなく1秒ですむことを意味していた。(またこれは、ドキュメント内の削除済みデータがファイルに残ることを意味してもいた。これは人々が望んだことでないと(のちに)判明した。)
これはライブラリを使うことを想定して設計されている。もしあなたがバイナリをインポートするものを1から書き上げたいと思ったら、Windows
Metafile Format ( 何か図を描く場合 ) や OLE Counpound Storage みたいなものをサポートしなくてはいけなくなる。もしあなたが
Windows上でやるのなら、そうしたことをたいしたことのない作業にするためのライブラリのサポートが存在する...
そういったフィーチャーを使うことは(元々)マイクロソフトチームのためのショートカットだった。でもあなたが全部を自分でスクラッチから書くなら、全部の作業を自分自身でやらなくてはいけない。
オフィス はcompound documentsに対して広範囲のサポートを持っている。例えば、スプレッドシートをWord文書に埋め込んだりできる。完璧なWordファイルフォーマットのparserは、同じように、埋め込まれたスプレッドシートで何かインテリジェントなことが出来るべきだろう。
それは相互協調性( interoperability ) を意識してデザインされてはいない。仮定されていたのは、WordファイルフォーマットはWordからのみ読み書きされなくてはいけない、ということで、それは当時においては十分に合理的なものだった。これは、Wordチームのプログラマがファイルフォーマットをどう変更するかについて決定を行う場合にはいつでも、彼らが気にするのは
( a ) 何が高速か ( b) Wordのコードベースにおいて最小の行数になるのは何か、だったことを意味する。SGMLやHTML-interchangeableといった標準ファイルフォーマットのようなアイデアは、最初にインターネットがドキュメントの相互交換を実現するまで現実のものにはならなかった。それはOfficeバイナリフォーマットが最初に考案されてから10年後のことだったのだ。ドキュメントを交換するのにインポーターとエクスポーターを使うことができるという仮定が常にあった。実際Wordは簡便な交換のために設計されたRTFと呼ばれるフォーマットを持っており、そのフォーマットは殆ど最初のころからあり、今も100%サポートされている。
それはアプリケーションの全ての複雑さを反映していなくてはいけない。
全部のチェックボックス、全部のフォーマッティングオプション、そして全部の、Microsoft Officeのフィーチャーは、ファイルフォーマットのどこかで叙述されていなくてはいけない。Wordのパラグラフメニューにある、" Keep With Next " と呼ばれるチェックボックス、これはパラグラフを、その後ろのパラグラフと同じページに置くのに必要な場合は、次のページに移動させるもの(?)
だが、これもファイルフォーマットの中に無くてはいけない。そしてこれはつまり、あなたがWordドキュメントを正しく読み込める完璧なWordクローンを実装したいなら、そういったフィーチャーを実装しなくてはいけないということだ。Wordドキュメントをロードする競争力のあるワードプロセッサを作っているのなら、ファイルフォーマットからそのビットをロードするコードを書くのには1分しかかからないかもしれないが、ページのレイアウトアルゴリズムをそれに対応させるのに何週間もかかるかもしれない。もしあなたがそうしない場合、カスタマーがあなたのクローンでWordファイルを読み込んだら、全部のページがぐちゃぐちゃになってしまうだろう。
それはアプリケーションの歴史を反映していなくてはいけない。
このファイルフォーマットに見られる多くの複雑さは、古く、複雑で、愛されず、めったに使われないフィーチャーを反映している。それらはファイルフォーマットのなかに後方互換性のためにまだあり、そしてMicrosoftにとってその辺りのコードを残しておくことには何らコストはかからない。しかしあなたがこれらのファイルフォーマットをparseおよびwriteする一貫した完全な仕事をしたいと思うなら、Microsoftのインターンが15年前にやったのと同じことを全て、またやらなくてはいけない。要点は、何千人年の仕事が今のWordやExcelには費やされてきたのであり、これらのアプリケーションの完璧なクローンを作りたいと本当に欲するなら、あなたは何千人年を費やさなくてはならないことになる、ということだ。ファイルフォーマットは単に、アプリケーションがサポートする全てのフィーチャーの簡潔なサマリーなのだ。
手始めに、小さな例を一つ、深く見てみよう。Excelのワークシートは色々なタイプのBIFFレコードの集まったものだ。私はスペックの一番最初のBIFFを見てみたい。1904と呼ばれるレコードだ。
Excelファイルフォーマット仕様のこのレコードについての記述は非常に曖昧なものだ。そこでは単に、1904レコードが「1904日付システムが使われているかどうか」を示すレコードだ、と述べているだけだ。ああ、使えない仕様書の典型的な一例だ。あなたがExcelファイルフォーマットで何かしている開発者で、そしてファイルフォーマット仕様にこう書いてあるのを見つけたなら、あなたがMiocrosoftは何かを隠しているのだと結論付けたとしても無理はない。この情報の断片は十分な情報をあなたに与えはしない。あなたには幾ばくか外部の情報が必要で、私は今ここで、それを提供しよう。Excelワークシートには、2種類ある。日付のエポックが1900/1/1のもの(これには、Lotus 1-2-3 との互換性のために故意に入れられた閏年に関するバグがあるが、ここでそれについて述べるのは退屈すぎる)、および、1904/1/1のものだ。Excelは両方をサポートしているが、それはExcelの最初のバージョンはMac版であり、それは単に簡単だったという理由でOSのエポックを使っていて、しかしWindows版のExcelは1-2-3のファイルをインポートできなくてはならず、そしてそれは1900/1/1をエポックとして採用していたからだ。あなたが涙ぐむのも無理はない。歴史のどの時点においても、プログラマが正しいことをしなかった、という時はないのだが、しかし現実にあなたが手にしているものはこれなのだ。
1900と1904のファイルタイプは両方とも世の中には広く存在しており、それは通常、ファイルがWindowsとMacのどちらで作られたかによる。一方のタイプから他方のタイプへ黙って変換するのはIntegrity的に問題があるので、Excelはファイルタイプを変換することをしない。Excelファイルをparseするためには、あなたは両方を扱わなくてはならない。それはファイルからこのbitをロードするだけの問題ではなく、あなたが日付表示と両方のエポックを扱うparsingのコードまで書き直さなくてはいけないということを意味する。実装には何日かかかるだろうと私は思う。
実際、あなた がExcelクローンの作業をするなら、日付の扱いについて、あらゆる種類の微妙なディティールを発見することになるだろう。Excelは日付の値をいつ変換するのか?
表示の整形はどうやっているのか?
なぜ1/31は今年の January 31と翻訳され、また一方で1/50 はJanuary 1st , 1950 と 翻訳されるのか ?
Excelのソースコードと同じだけの量のドキュメントを書かないがぎり、振る舞いに関しての微妙なビットを全て完全に記述することはできない。
そしてこのレコードは、あなたが扱う何百もあるBIFFレコードの最初の1つに過ぎず、しかももっとも単純なものなのだ。他のレコードの殆どは、より多くのプログラマーを涙に暮れさせるぐらいには十分複雑だ。
唯一導き得る結論はこれだ。
Microsoft がMicrosoft とOfficeのファイルフォーマットをリリースしたことは大変有用なことだが、しかしそれでOfficeファイルフォーマットをインポートしたり保存したりするのが楽になるということは全く無さそうだ。それらは狂気じみて複雑で、リッチなアプリケーションで、そしてあなたは人気のある20%の部分を実装して80%の人々を幸せにするというくらいのことしかできない。バイナリファイル仕様によってなされるのは、多く見積もっても、著しく複雑なシステムのリバースエンジニアリングにかかる時間を何分か削減するくらいだろう。
オーケー , 私はいくつか回避法を教えると約束した。良いニュースは、殆どの良く知られたアプリケーションにとって、Officeバイナリファイルフォーマットを読み書きしようと試みることは誤った決定だということだ。あなたが真剣に考えなくてはいけない代案が2つある。Officeそのものにそれをやらせるか、書き込むのが簡単なファイルフォーマットを使うかだ。
ヘビーな仕事 はOfficeにやらせよう。WordとExcelは実に完全なオブジェクトモデルを持っており、COMオートメーションの手段が可能で、これであなたは何でもプログラムでやるようにできる。多くのシチュエーションでは、Office内のコードを再利用するほうがそれを実装しようとするよりも良い。ここにいくつか例がある。
Webベースのアプリケーションがあって、それが既存のWordファイルをPDFフォーマットに出力するようにする必要がある場合、それを実装するにはこうする : ファイルを読み込んでからWord 2007のビルトインのPDFエクスポーターを使ってそれをPDFとして保存する、数行のWord VBAコードだ。あなたはこのコードをIISで動作しているASPやASP.NETのコードから直接呼び出す。これでうまくいく。最初にWordを立ち上げるときは数秒かかる。2回目はCOMサブシステムによりWordはまたあなたがそれを必要としたときのためにメモリ中にキープされている。それは通常のWebベースアプリケーションにとっては十分に速い。
上と同じ。ただしあなたのWebホスティング環境がLinuxだった場合。フルライセンスのWordがインストールされたWindows 2003サーバを買う。そしてその仕事をする小さなWebサービスを構築する。C#とASP.NETでの半日の作業だ。
上と同じ、ただしあなたがよりスケールさせたいと望む場合。ステップ2で構築した全部のボックスの前にロードバランサーを置きなさい。コードは必要ない。
この手のアプローチは、全ての種類の一般的なOfficeタイプについての、サーバ上であなたがやりたいと思うであろうアプリケーションで、うまくいくだろう。例えば:
Excelのワークブックを開き、セルに何らかのデータを入れ、再計算して、そして結果を出力セルに書きこむ。
GIF フォーマットでチャートを生成するの にExcelを使う
色々 なExcelワークシートから色々な情報を取り出す。ファイルフォーマットについて考えることに時間を使うことなしに。
ExcelファイルフォーマットからCSVのテーブルデータへの変換 ( 別の方法は 、Excel ODBCドライバをSQLクエリを使ってデータを吸い出すのに使うことだ)
Wordドキュメントを編集する
Wordフォームへの記入
Offceがサポートしている沢山のファイルフォーマットの間でのフォーマット変換
( ワードプロセッサと表計算のフォーマットについては沢山のインポーターが存在する)
これらのケースの全てにおいて、Officeオブジェクトにインタラクティブ動作でないことを教えてやる方法があり、だから表示をアップデートするのに煩わされたり、ユーザに入力を促す必要はない。ところで、このようなやりかたでいく場合には、gotchas(?)がいくつかあり、そしてそれはMicrosoftは公式にサポートしているものではない。だからあなたがそれを始める前にはKnowledge baseの記事を読むように。
書き込むファイルにはもっとシンプルなフォーマットを使いなさい。単にOfficeドキュメントをプログラムで生成したいなら、殆どいつでもOfficeバイナリフォーマットよりももっと良いフォーマット、WordやExcelでも問題なく開くことができるようなフォーマットが存在する。
いずれにせよ、全て のOfficeファイルを完全に読み書きできるような、文字通りのOffice競合製品を作ろうとする(その場合には、何千年もの作業があなたに予約される) のでない限り、Officeバイナリフォーマットの読み書きをするというのは、何であれあなたが解決しようとしている問題を解決するためのもっとも労働集約的な方法だ。

A leading general and former top military spokesman in Iraq is pleading with the armed services to let troops blog and post to YouTube .
Too bad the video site is banned on military nets , and Army rules squeeze military bloggers , hard .
Greg Grant notes , politely , that Caldwell 's " recommendation that appears to run counter to Pentagon policy . "
Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell
IV became an internationally - recognized figure in 2006 and 2007 as the face of the American effort in Iraq .
He commanded the 82nd Airborne Division before , and now heads the Combined Arms Center and Fort
Leavenworth – one of the Army 's main intellectual centers .
( Gen. David Petraeus held the job before taking over the Iraq war . )
In a Small Wars Journal blog post , Caldwell says that , in a struggle where perception is often as important as bombs - and - bullets conflict , soldiers ought to be encouraged and equipped to wage that information war on their own .
And that means " get [ting ] onto blogs and [ s ] end[ing ] their YouTube videos to their friends and family . "
Not everyone in the military shares that view .
YouTube is officially banned on military networks .
Many influential blogs are blocked .
Stringent regulations , read literally , require commanding officers to review each and every item one of his soldiers puts online .
And in televised commercials , screen savers , and flyers , troops are told that blogging is a major security risk – even though official sites have proven to leak many , many more secrets .
Read excerpts from Caldwell 's essay , after the jump .
* First , we need to * Encourage
Soldiers to “ tell / share their story ” .
Across America , there is a widely held perception that media coverage of the War in Iraq is overwhelmingly negative .
We need to be careful to NOT blame the news media for this .
The public has a voracious appetite for the sensational , the graphic and the shocking .
We all have a difficult time taking our eyes off the train wreck in progress - it is human nature ...
[ B ]ut when it comes to their men and women in uniform , they also have a very strong desire to hear their personal stories .
They want to know what it is like , what the Soldiers are experiencing , and how the Soldiers feel about their mission .
That is why we must encourage our Soldiers to interact with the media , to get onto blogs and to send their YouTube videos to their friends and family .
When our Soldiers tell / share their stories , it has an overwhelmingly positive effect .
* Just playing lip service to encouraging Soldiers is not enough .
Leaders need to not only encourage but also ** Empower
subordinates .
A critical component of empowering is underwriting honest mistakes and failure .
Soldiers are encouraged to take the initiative and calculated risk in the operational battlefield because we understand the importance of maintaining the offensive .
However , once we move into the informational domain , we have a tendency to be zero defect and risk averse .
Leaders have to understand and accept that not all media interactions are going to go well .
Leaders need to assume risk in the information domain and allow subordinates the leeway to make mistakes .
Unfortunately , the culture is such that the first time a subordinate makes a mistake in dealing with the media and gets punished for it , it will be the last time * ANYONE in that organization takes a risk and engages with the media ...
* Finally , we need to ** Equip Soldiers to engage the new media ...
[ W ]e need to trust them enough to give them the tools to properly tell / share their stories .
The experience of trying to gain YouTube access in Iraq and even back in the United States is a prime example .
A suggestion for consideration might be equipping unit leaders with camcorders to document operations but also daily life .
The enemy video tapes operations and then distorts and twists the information and images to misinform the world .
What if we had documented video footage of the same operations which refuted what our enemies say ?
...
If we wait until we see the enemy ’s images , we are being reactive and we have already squandered the opportunity .

Shuttle announced today that its upcoming $ 199 KPC will ship with the open - source Foresight Linux distribution .
In addition to a price that squarely targets the budget market , the KPC features a small form factor and high energy efficiency .
Shuttle has teamed up with Foresight and says that the Linux distribution 's intuitive interface , user - focused design , and robust selection of included applications make it a win for average consumers .
Although Foresight is n't as popular as more mainstream desktop distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora , it is favored by some enthusiasts because it is closely aligned with upstream GNOME development and quick to integrate emerging technologies like Package Kit .
Another compelling advantage of Foresight is that it uses rPath 's Conary package manager , which has smart file - based dependency resolution and a nifty roll - back feature .
Shuttle says that the KPC will come with a variety of packages preinstalled , including OpenOffice.org , Firefox , Pidgin , Banshee , Totem , and F - Spot .
It will also come with Compiz by default and support 3D effects .
A few of the Foresight developers have written blog entries commenting on the new partnership .
" I am fortunate enough to have received one of these little boxes already , and I am pretty impressed , " wrote Ken VanDine .
" Great value for the $ 199 price tag .
And of course it is Linux - friendly , Foresight worked perfectly out of the box .
All the way from sound , compiz , to suspend / hibernate , all just worked . "
" We 're putting a lot of work making sure Foresight 2.0 is ready and polished as we are excited to introduce Foresight to new users who buy Shuttle 's KPC , " developer Paul Cutler commented .
With a Celeron 420 standard , 512MB of RAM , and integrated graphics , the hardware specs are n't terribly impressive , but seem reasonable for the price .
A Core 2
Duo is available as an upgrade option .
A factor that might deter some buyers is the absence of an optical drive , though arguably the success of the Eee seems to demonstrate that one is n't necessarily required for a budget computing product .
It 's hard to guess what demand will be like for a product of this nature , but it 's definitely nice to see Shuttle getting into the Linux game .
Like any opensource software shop , we distribute the source code
for our software .
How 's that for the obvious statement of the decade ?
Actually , I can beat it .
It 's a pain in the neck for end users to
collect and install all of the dependencies for our software .
And now I 'm going to one - up myself again .
Customers often build
our software against untested versions of libraries , making debugging
' frustrating . '
RT , our flagship product , depends on 124 separate packages , 114 of
them CPAN libraries .
While CPAN has pretty good support for recursively
installing dependencies , it 's not perfect and can be time consuming
and confusing for end users .
And when it does n't work right , as can
happen when a module author makes an incompatible change , debugging
requires a wizard .
We 've built a new source ( and binary ) packaging system called
Shipwright .
Shipwright allows you to track all of your package's
dependencies in a version control repository like SVN or SVK as
well as build order and build instructions .
It comes with tools for importing Perl modules , C libraries and
other dependencies from CPAN , upstream version control repositories
and tarballs .
When it can discover dependency information ( as it
can for Perl modules ) , Shipwright will automatically import the
current versions of all listed dependencies if the repository does n't
already contain sufficient versions .
Shipwright can automatically set up build instructions for projects
using autoconf as well as projects using Perl 's MakeMaker ,
Module : : Install and Module : : Build mechanisms .
If necessary , you
can customize the build instructions and dependency ordering after
you import a package .
When it 's time to ship your project to your end users , all you need
to do is take a snapshot of your Shipwright repository and send it
out .
To build your project , an end user just needs to run
"./bin/shipwright-build " .
If they want to , your users can choose
to skip certain dependencies ( if they want to use system versions )
or specify an installation path .
By default , Shipwright builds
fully relocatable binary distributions into a temporary directory
and users can move them into place or copy them to any number of
hosts with the same base system libraries -- Shipwright automatically
wraps all your binaries and scripts so that they can find the
Shipwright versions of their dependencies , no matter where you move
the installed distribution .
Shipwright also comes with sh and tcsh
scripts you can ' source ' to add an installed distribution 's libraries
to your current environment .
At Best Practical , we 've configured most of our Shipwright distributions
to bundle everything above libc .
Perl , Subversion and GD are just
some of the packages we distribute as part of these relocatable
builds .
We now have a single - command tool to build , link and install
Subversion , SVK and all their dependencies ( including APR , Neon ,
Perl and a bunch of others ) .
With a single command , we downloaded ,
extracted , checked in and tested Tatsuhiko Miyagawa 's Plagger Feed
Aggregator and all 134 perl modules it depends on .
After that , a
single command built a full binary distribution of Plagger , ready
for deployment on any Mac OS X system .
I 'm quite proud to release Shipwright 1.0 today .
I designed Shipwright
with sunnavy , one of the hackers here at Best Practical .
He's
responsible for almost all of the project 's implementation to date ,
though we 're eager to have additional developers join us going forward .
If you 're interested in Shipwright , download 1.0 from
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Shipwright and subscribe to the Shipwright
mailing list by emailing shipwright-subscribe@lists.bestpractical.com
You can always get the latest version of the Shipwright source code
with this command :
svn co svn://svn.bestpractical.com/Shipwright/trunk
You can get a glimpse of Shipwright builds of RT , SVK and Jifty at http://code.bestpractical.com/shipwright/

Gillian Gibbons , 54 , from Liverpool , had spent eight days in custody for insulting Islam before eventually being pardoned by President Omar al - Bashir .
Mrs Gibbons said she was in " total shock " but was " well treated in prison and everyone was very kind to me " .
After speaking at Heathrow , she was taken by police to an unnamed location .
The teacher and her family were expected to return to Mrs Gibbons ' son's home in Wavertree , Liverpool , but reporters from around the world have been left waiting there for hours .
Mrs Gibbons ' son , John , and , daughter , Jessica met her at Heathrow Airport , and the BBC's Matt Prodger said a homecoming party would be held in Liverpool later .
' Fabulous time '
Mrs Gibbons , a mother - of - two , was arrested on 25 November and later given a 15 - day sentence after allowing her pupils to hold a vote and choose the name Muhammad , the same name as the Islamic Prophet , for a teddy bear .
She arrived back to London accompanied by British Muslim peers Baroness Warsi and Lord Ahmed , who had mediated for her release .

The calm after teddy storm Call for Muslim culture tests
After a meeting with Baroness Warsi and Lord Ahmed , the press office of President al - Bashir announced that Mrs Gibbons had been pardoned and released after " mediation " .
On her arrival at Heathrow , Mrs Gibbons looked tired but relieved as she was whisked to a private room to speak to reporters for the first time since her ordeal began , our correspondent said .
He understands that when Mrs Gibbons was first arrested , she asked a British consular official not to tell her family for fear it might worry them .
Only then was she told that her case had become an international media story .
Mrs Gibbons said the incident had " all come as a huge shock to me " and that going to prison was " terrifying " although she never actually spent any time in the Omdurman women 's jail .
She said : " I was very upset to think that I may have caused offence to people - very , very upset about it .
" I 'm just an ordinary middle - aged primary school teacher .
I went out there to have an adventure and got a lot more adventure than what I was looking for .
I never imagined this would happen . "
Mrs Gibbons added that she was " very sorry " to leave Sudan , where she had had a " fabulous time " .
I would n't like to put anyone off going to Sudan
Gillian Gibbons
She said : " It is a beautiful place and I had a chance to see some of the countryside .
" The Sudanese people I found to be extremely kind and generous and until this happened I only had a good experience . "
" I would n't like to put anyone off going to Sudan .
" I would like to thank Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi and I would like to thank all the people who have worked so hard to secure my release and make my time more bearable . "
Mrs Gibbons said she was treated the same as other Sudanese prisoners and that the Ministry of Interior sent her a bed , which was " the best present " .
' Quite tense '
When asked if she was going to continue as a teacher , Mrs Gibbons said : " I 'm looking for a job - I am jobless . "
Lady Warsi , who helped negotiate a pardon for Mrs Gibbons , told BBC News 24 that some of the meetings she and Lord Ahmed had with Sudanese officials were " very , very difficult " .
She said : " On Sunday we spent most of that day having very difficult meetings , some of them quite tense , some of them were very , very difficult .
" And then at the end of Sunday we were presented with some hope that we may be able to see the president on Monday and we may be able to reach a resolution .
" We had that meeting on Monday morning ... and thankfully we secured a release . "
The teacher 's local MP , Louise Ellman , has welcomed Mrs Gibbons ' return but said the jail sentence " should never have happened " .
Gillian Gibbons did not want to worry her family over her arrest
" The original incident was something very innocent and then what should have been seen as a minor error - and certainly a very innocent one - suddenly became blown up into something extremely important and the whole thing has been very , very worrying and quite horrendous . "
Downing Street said Prime Minister Gordon Brown had spoken to Mrs Gibbons upon her arrival in the UK .
He is said to be pleased that she had returned , wished her well and had also made clear to her that the government stood ready to provide whatever further assistance she may require .
Khalid al Mubarak , media counsellor at the Sudanese embassy in London , said he was very pleased the situation had been resolved .
' Red faced '
He also suggested that orientation classes for westerners coming to work in Sudan should be reintroduced .
They had been standard procedure during the colonial era , he said .
He said a short course ending in an exam , perhaps run at local colleges in Sudan , would be " very useful " to help new - comers avoid basic mistakes such as using the left hand to offer something to somebody - the left hand is considered unclean .
Mrs Gibbons ' son earlier said his family had been " under a lot of pressure " but added that he was " very pleased " his mother was returning home .
Meanwhile , Jonah Fisher , former BBC Khartoum correspondent , said that the arrest of Mrs Gibbons must have seemed like an easy opportunity to give Sudan 's former colonial masters a bloody nose .
But in actuality , it appears to be Sudan 's President al - Bashir who has been left with a red face , he added .

Shiny and glossy design elements are now officially outdated .
Just like retro is becoming trendy again , grungy look appears to rapidly gain on popularity .
And there is a damn good reason behind it .
In our everyday environment we ’re unlikely to find ideal geometric forms or pretty shadow effects as they are manifested by glorious Web 2.0 - designs .
The reality is different , and Web is definitely not an exception here .
Shiny and glossy design elements are now officially outdated .
Just like retro is becoming trendy again , grungy look appears to rapidly gain on popularity .
And there is a damn good reason behind it .
In our everyday environment we ’re unlikely to find ideal geometric forms or pretty shadow effects as they are manifested by glorious Web 2.0 - designs .
The reality is different , and Web is definitely not an exception here .
Therefore designers often tend to explore the less ideal and more realistic design solutions which reflect the world we ’re living in more accurately and precisely .
Result : such elements give the design a more realistic , genuine look , a look one would actually expect in real life .
In such grunge designs dirty stains , torn images , “ broken ” icons and creased pieces of paper are as popular as hand - drawn elements and dirty textures .
The main purpose of hand - drawn elements lies in their ability to convey a personality and an individual note .
And dirty textures are often used as background images for navigation menus , photos and overall layouts .
Usually these elements are regular objects from our daily life , replicated in their real form without any glossy effects .

Grunge Style ≠ Dirty Look
Few weeks ago we ’ve already provided you with grungy fonts , textures , icons and brushes .
Since most designers were confused about the purpose of these “ dirty ” , “ graffiti - like ” , “ urban ” elements , it ’s important to understand that grunge designs do n’t necessarily have a dirty look .
In fact , grungy layouts do n’t necessarily consist only of grungy design elements .
The latter can as well support the design , giving it a more realistic look without making it look overcrowded or dirty .
Take a look at Bart - Jan Verhoef ’s late blog presented below .
Although the design has a number of irregular elements such hand - drawn doodles and dirty background image , it does n’t feel dirty at all — in fact , the design is rather subtle , clean , elegant and in any case unique .
Although the design has a number of irregular elements such hand - drawn doodles and dirty background image , it does n’t feel dirty .
Sometimes it ’s enough to add just few irregular ( or dirty ) elements to achieve a more realistic look .
In online - shops and corporate projects it simply does n’t work otherwise .
In such cases small details influence the mood and define the perception of the users .
Sometimes it ’s enough to simply replace the background image of the layout with a dirty texture .
This is exactly what Jeremy Zevin has done .
Without a dirty texture his weblog would have a typical Web 2.0 - design .
Without a dirty texture used as a background image this weblog would have a typical Web 2.0 - design .
Grunge Color Palette
In most cases grunge designs use subdued , dirty and dull colors .
Brown , beige , grey and black are dominating colors .
Vibrant shades of vivid colors are being replaced with more natural and subtle colors .
The color palette below presents colors which are often used when it comes to grunge designs .
The colors have been extracted from the screenshots listed below .
For instance , Satsu uses rather subtle colors ; the design , however , does n’t look boring .
Hand - drawn elements support the overall design and give it an artistic touch .
However , grunge designs can as well contain more vivid colors ; however , in order to fit to the design , they are less striking and more realistic .
Dark shades of green , blue and read are usual .
Shop Moss and David Hellmann ’s blog are examples of a vivid grunge design .
Trends In Grunge Design
Dirty textures and background images are almost essential in every grunge design .
irregular lines and frames
yellowed scotch tape
paper - and photo clips , needles and various pins
coffee rings , spilled out liquids and dirty stains
torn paper and dirty edges
dog-ears
hand - written elements
… and EXP .
TYPO is rather a collage than web design .

The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus
Tree Octopus Sightings
Tree octopus species , including the endangered Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus , are some of the most elusive creatures known to Man .
Not many researchers have managed to photograph them in the wild and those few in captivity tend to hide in inaccessable corners of their cages , as if purposefully avoiding the prying of humans .
Any Tree Octopus sighting should be sent to lyle.zapato@gmail.com .
If it adds significantly to Tree Octopus research it may end up on this page .
Ellie managed to catch a climbing tree octopus on video : 2012-05 - 16 May 11th my friends and I hiked up Mt Baker .
Snow caused us to start two miles from the trail head which retrospectively was a stroke of luck !
Almost , back at the car on the 12th I suddenly see something strange scurrying around the base of a tree .
I could n't believe my luck when it ended up being the elusive Pacific North West tree octopus !
Managed to get a little footage before it secreted itself away in a hole in the tree !

John digs deep to help the cause : 2010 - 12 - 16 Hello !
A few days ago I stumbled across some information about the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus on the web , so I decided to look for a specimen in my area .
I was happy to discover a tree octopus living comfortably in a tree near my house .
I excitedly took out a dollar bill for its nest , and left it at the base of the tree trunk .
I dashed inside to get my camera , and took this picture just before the magnificent little creature crawled into its nest .
I 've seen this tree octopus and maybe a couple others a few times since .
I really hope this photo adds to your research .
Sincerely ,
John C. Lawson
A report of tragedy among the already endangered tree octopus population : 2010 - 03 - 24 : " Tree Octopi tragedy "
While enjoying a break from shooting one of my films , I was vacationing on the west coast , visiting a friend .
Inbetween our extensive debates on international politics and the environment , we happen to stroll the grounds of his estate .
His home is set adjacent to the beautifully scenic Olympic National Park .
The air was tinged with smoke from the nearby Constantine fire , which was happening at the time .
It was n't long before I noticed something strange at my feet , an entire pod of 30 to 40 Pacific Northwest tree octopi were littering his lawn .
The poor creatures had obviously been driven from the moisture of their forest homes and were desperately migrating toward the safety of the nearby Hood Canal .
Tearfully , we collected several of the dehydrated animals and tried to nurture them back to health , but to no avail .
I have attached [ photos ] of one of the Octopi for you to use to raise awareness to the continued plight of the species .
With love & support to the Pacific Northwest tree octopus

With their numbers still dwindling , this is the sort of setback that the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus can ill afford .
Contrary to popular beliefs , not all tree octopuses hibernate during winter .
Here are two sightings of snow - loving octopuses from New England .
The first is from Danno : 2009 - 03 - 11 : " Snow Octopus "
The other day after a snow storm .
I was getting ready to shovel the snow .
When I notice some movement .
When I realized what it was I grabbed my camera .
I was only able to get one photo be for the Snow Octopus ( Snow Puss ) disappeared under the snow .
Living in New England
I did n't think they came this far south or east .

Their ability to blend into the environment is amazing .
One would almost think it was made of snow .
But one would be wrong .
This sighting comes from Emmy : 2009 - 01 - 19 : " we found a tree octopus !!!!!!! "
These photographs show that tree octopi are not restricted to temperate climates .
The last picture also is possibly the only known photo of a tree octopus nest .
This is a proposed new species , or the New England Ground - Nesting Tree Octopus , or just simply New England Tree Octopus .
Emmy 's photos of this previously unclassified tree octopus species were too blurry for even our most advanced cephalopod - image processing technology to enhance .
In order to keep warm in the cold winter air , this species must be constantly on the move through the tree tops , making photographing it clearly next to impossible .
Its blue coloration might mean it 's related to T. pilosa , or perhaps that 's just its way of saying how very cold it feels .
Whatever the case , the ground nest shows that , even in these uncertain economic times , people are willing to open their wallets to help give tree octopuses comfy homes .
2009 -02 - 16 : The Save the Tree Octopus !
YouTube channel has found actual footage of a Octopus paxarbolis in the wild :
James from Seattle / Olympia writes in with a discovery he made in his Christmas tree : 2008 - 12 - 25 : " Pacific NW Xmas tree Octopus " Just letting you know , we spotted this adventurous tree octopi feeling particularly festive .
Sometimes tree octopuses hitch a ride in Christmas trees harvested from farms on the Olympic Peninsula .
When its tree is being jostled violently , a tree octopus will hunker down deep inside the branches near the trunk and camouflage itself to look like bark .
This is a defensive mechanism to protect it from wind storms and sasquatch trying to shake octopuses to the ground .
They may stay hidden like this for days after a particularly violent shaking , such as experienced by Christmas trees when they are chopped down and transported .
Many octopuses have a natural instinct to decorate their lairs with attractive baubles , and O. paxarbolis is no exception .
When it finally comes out of hiding and explores its tree , finding it covered in shiny ornaments and sparkly lights , it will become so mesmerized by the baublely abundance that it 'll hardly notice that its tree is sitting in some human 's living room .
Scandinavian immigrants considered it good luck to find a tree octopus in their Christmas tree .
Granted , that 's because they like to eat them .
But for us more enlightened cephalopodophiles , we can consider it a sign of good luck that the species has n't yet gone extinct .
And to keep it that way , please remember to remove any octopuses you find before disposing of your Christmas tree .
They can be put in a shoe box -- with a bit of moist branch to make them feel comfortable and some tinsel to keep them distracted -- and taken to your nearest chapter of the Friends of the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus for reintroduction into the wild .
Jonathan wrote in with an invasive tree octopus species he discovered in his garden ...
2007-08 - 24 : " Invasive exotic tree octopus species a threat to our native Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus ? "
Dear Sir , I am writing to bring to your attention yet another threat to our endangered native Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus ( Octopus paxarbolis ) .
I photographed these specimens on a potted bamboo and Japanese maple on my deck , north of Seattle .
At this time , I am uncertain whether this invader is the Chinese Bamboo Octopus ( Sinoctopus bambusa ) that came in on the bamboo and spread to the nearby Japanese maple , or a related Japanese species ( Aceroctopus japonicum ) that spread from the maple to the bamboo .
Given the similarity between the coloring of the octopuses and the maple leaf stems , I suspect the latter .
The Asiatic invasive octopus is much smaller than O. paxarbolis , with mature specimens measuring just 5 - 6 inches across , from tentacle tip to tentacle tip .
However , what they lack in size , they make up for in numbers .
The maple and bamboo plants were just crawling with them !
Lax inspection standards for horticultural imports are certainly to blame .
I worry about the effect on the native species should the exotic species manage to spread beyond garden plants to the greater fir forests of the area .
Sincerely ,
Jonathan Griffin-MacGregor
It is indeed a Japanese maple octopus .
You can tell from the spring - like cinching at the base of the arms , which has become characteristic for A. japonicum .
Shinto priests in Japan have been artificially selecting this species for centuries , culling from the maple trees only those with a pleasing continuity between their body and arms for use in their ceremonies / luncheons .
This has left the wild population with limbs oddly mismatched to their bodies -- as well as a bold , some would say defiant , attitude toward humans , since the unculled ones have come to view the priest 's avoidance as a sign of fear .
You are right to be worried about this invasive species .
I would suggest you burn your garden to the ground .
It 's the only way to make sure that the invasion does n't spread to native Tree Octopus habitats .
Marc L. sent in a photo of a rare tree octopus that specializes in redcedar : 2006 - 12-16
Photo detail enhanced using advanced ZPi cephalopod - image processing technology .

Here is a rare and endangered Cephalopod Thuja Pilcata or locally known as the Western Red Cedar Climbing Octopus .
You do n't see one of these babies everyday !!
Especially this far inland !!
Emacs !
Marc has his names a bit confused , which is understandable given the esoteric nature of tree octopus cladistics .
Thuja plicata is actually the scientific name for the Western Redcedar tree that this octopus calls home .
The correct binomial for the octopus itself is Thujoctopus pilosa , named for the lush coating of bluish velvet that it evolved to help retain moisture as it migrated deep inland from its ancestral Pacific home .
Unfortunately , this notable trait led to its current rarity .
Originally considered a cheaper domestic alternative to fine velvets imported from Italy or Kashmir , redcedar octopus pelts became popular in the early to mid 20th century with a growing North American middle - class desperate for luxury goods .
In particular , evening dresses made entirely of undyed T. pilosa pelts became such a fixture during the post - war period that they were immortalized in the song " Blue Velvet " -- made a hit in 1951 by Tony Bennett and again in the 1960s by Bobby Vinton .
( The song also featured prominently in the 1986 film " Blue Velvet " by director and animal lover David Lynch , who considered it emblematic of the moral degeneracy of suburban middle - class life .
Lynch spent much of his childhood in the woods of eastern Washington and was well aware of the devastation brought against the local tree octopus populations by the twisted , fetishistic desires of the suburbs . )
Eventually , shrinking numbers of redcedar octopus combined with inexpensive mass - produced synthetic velvets available on the burgeoning global market led to the pelt trade becoming unprofitable -- narrowly saving T. pilosa from extinction .
[ 2007-01-01 ]
Marc had a follow up letter : 2006 - 12-31
Your write up was very impressive but you failed to mention the decline in habitat here in Southern Oregon due to logging .
Fortunately , now that the species is protected , you often hear in the woods " Do n't cut that one , they 's one of them dang blue pusses up there ! ! "
A far greater threat to the species exists from pets .
I have personally witnessed a Labrador Retriever violently shaking a Cedar Pus , the cries of which are unimaginable , perhaps best described as unworldly or maybe Chinese .
On a lighter note I 'm sure you will be happy to hear our sighting turned out to be a breeding colony , as evidenced by the attached photo .

At last !
Someone who can testify to the reality of such rare and beautious beasts .
It was a fine Spring day .
We hapless residents of Daisy Hill were out photographing the last remaining large koala habitat in SE Queensland , with developers poised at our doorstep ( www.savedaisyhill.com), snapping away at the innocent koalas sleeping peacefully in the treetops , when lo !
The great and very endangered Tree - ringed octopus appeared swinging amongst the branches .
Very unusual for such a shy animal .
Developers are still poised at our doorstep .
We know our plight to save the Tree - ringed octopus is futile , but this , at least , is testimony to the world that they once inhabited this great land .
Hapalochlaena eucalyptlata , which is known to grow up to 30 cm ( 12 in ) across bears bright blue rings when angered , and can inflict a lethal bite , much like it 's marine cousin , the lesser Hapalochlaena lunulata .
Since both species carry enough poison to kill 26 adults within minutes , we 're hoping there 'll be enough to go around for the developers and their bulldozer wielding lackeys .

A friend an I were looking for interesting bugs in a dense forest east of Seattle .
My friend John is the man hanging from a rope in the middle of the photo .
I was taking a picture of him hanging from the ropes with my digital camera when I noticed in the picture preview there was something on the base of one of the trees .
I Looked at the tree and saw what appeared to be an octopus .
It was rather dark because the sun was on the other side of the tree , so I took a photo of it with my heat sensing camera to make sure that it was a living creature .
I then went searching on the internet for a tree - climbing octopus site and I found this one .
Here is the photo I was talking about , I hope it helps your studies .

Below is a first hand account of the cephalopodic carnage that results when tree octopuses cross the road ...
2004-02-11
I am well acquainted with the tree octopus from the time I lived in Tacoma .
For a time I dated a girl who lived in Port Angeles on the north end of the Olympic peninsula .
Because it was a about a three hour I 'd drive up to visit her on the weekends .
The route I 'd drive to and from visiting her crossed the Hood canal and then followed its western shore for some distance .
It 's a beautiful , unspoiled area of virgin forest at the foot of the majestic Olympic mountains in the west , and the beautiful waters of the Hood canal and Puget sound to the east .
Many times while driving back home late I would see tree octopi ( or " tree squawbs " as the locals call them ) as they crossed the road heading for the canal , obviously on their way back to spawn ...

The following photo appears to be of some species of Deciduous Tree Octopus , most likely O. saccharum or the Sugar Octopus .
They occur most often in coastal New England , where they use their beaks to break the bark of maple trees and slurp the sap .
These tree octopuses die off annually with the changing of the leaves , dropping to the ground where they are then gathered by the local Hominoids as sweet Fall snacks .
Although not closely related to O. paxarbolis , they do share a common plight as environmental disruption and poaching for the lucrative Japanese dessert sushi market has brought Sugar Octopus populations to dangerously low levels .

His speech yesterday actually managed to shock .
You might think that , in wartime , a president would acknowledge what no one denies is a terribly grim decision in front of us - whether to pursue a clearly unwinnable war in order to govern a clearly ungovernable country - or withdraw and redeploy in ways that will doubtless lead to even more bloodshed .
But no .
There is no gray here ; no awful decision for the least worst option ; not acknowledgment of his own moral culpability for such a disaster .
There is instead an accusation that those who reach a different judgment about the course of the war are , in fact , enemies of the troops :
Our troops are seeing this progress that is being made on the ground .
And as they take the initiative from the enemy , they have a question :
Will their elected leaders in Washington pull the rug out from under them just as they 're gaining momentum and changing the dynamic on the ground in Iraq ?
Here 's my answer is clear :
We 'll support our troops , we 'll support our commanders , and we will give them everything they need to succeed .
To place all the troops into the position of favoring one strategy ahead of us rather than another , and to accuse political opponents of trying to " pull the rug out from under them , " is a , yes , fascistic tactic designed to corral political debate into only one possible patriotic course .
It 's beneath a president to adopt this role , beneath him to coopt the armed services for partisan purposes .
It should be possible for a president to make an impassioned case for continuing his own policy in Iraq , without accusing his critics of wanting to attack and betray the troops .
But that would require class and confidence .
The president has neither .

About a week ago , Ryan wrote about a way that you could watch high - resolution YouTube videos by adding something on to the end of the YouTube URL .
That is no longer needed because YouTube videos that are higher quality ( not all are ) have a link below the video that says “ Watch this video in higher quality . ”
Some of you doubted whether or not you were actually seeing a higher quality video with the “ trick ” we first mentioned , so now this should put your doubts to rest .
The screenshot below shows what you ’ll be looking for :
Even better is the fact that you can watch YouTube high quality videos by default .
When you ’re logged in to your YouTube account , click “ Account ” .
Then under the “ Account Section ” look for “ Video Playback Quality . ”
Click that and then this is what you ’ll see :
Once you save the settings , the higher - quality videos will play when they are available .
This way you ’ll never have to click the link below the video to “ watch this video in higher quality . ”
If it seems to be loading slow , they do include the link to go back to the lower quality video .

Turning native ecosystems into “ farms ” for biofuel crops causes major carbon emissions that worsen the global warming that biofuels are meant to mitigate , according to a new study by the University of Minnesota and the Nature Conservancy .
The work will be published in Science later this month and will be posted online Thursday , Feb .
7 .
The carbon lost by converting rainforests , peatlands , savannas , or grasslands outweighs the carbon savings from biofuels .
Such conversions for corn or sugarcane ( ethanol ) , or palms or soybeans ( biodiesel ) release 17 to 420 times more carbon than the annual savings from replacing fossil fuels , the researchers said .
The carbon , which is stored in the original plants and soil , is released as carbon dioxide , a process that may take decades .
This “ carbon debt ” must be paid before the biofuels produced on the land can begin to lower greenhouse gas levels and ameliorate global warming .
The conversion of peatlands for palm oil plantations in Indonesia ran up the greatest carbon debt , one that would require 423 years to pay off .
The next worst case was the production of soybeans in the Amazon , which would not “ pay for itself ” in renewable soy biodiesel for 319 years .
“ We do n't have proper incentives in place because landowners are rewarded for producing palm oil and other products but not rewarded for carbon management , ” said University of Minnesota Applied Economics professor Stephen Polasky , an author of the study .
“ This creates incentives for excessive land clearing and can result in large increases in carbon emissions .
“ This research examines the conversion of land for biofuels and asks the question ‘ Is it worth it " ’ , ” said lead author Joe Fargione , a scientist for The Nature Conservancy .
“ And surprisingly , the answer is no . ”
Fargione began the work as a University of Minnesota postdoctoral researcher with Polasky , Regents Professor of Ecology David Tilman ; he completed it after joining the Nature Conservancy .
They , along with university researchers Jason Hill and Peter Hawthorne , also contributed to the work .
“ If you ’re trying to mitigate global warming , it simply does not make sense to convert land for biofuels production , ” said Fargione .
“ All the biofuels we use now cause habitat destruction , either directly or indirectly .
Global agriculture is already producing food for six billion people .
Producing food - based biofuel , too , will require that still more land be converted to agriculture . ”
These findings coincide with observations that increased demand for ethanol corn crops in the United States is likely contributing to conversion of the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado ( tropical savanna ) .
American farmers traditionally rotated corn crops with soybeans , but now they are planting corn every year to meet the ethanol demand and Brazilian farmers are planting more of the world ’s soybeans .
And they ’re deforesting the Amazon to do it .
The researchers also found significant carbon debt in the conversion of grasslands in the United States and rainforests in Indonesia .
Researchers did note that some biofuels do not contribute to global warming because they do not require the conversion of native habitat .
These include waste from agriculture and forest lands and native grasses and woody biomass grown on marginal lands unsuitable for crop production .
The researchers urge that all fuels be fully evaluated for their impacts on global warming , including impacts on habitat conversion .
“ Biofuels made on perennial crops grown on degraded land that is no longer useful for growing food crops may actually help us fight global warming , ” said Hill .
“ One example is ethanol made from diverse mixtures of native prairie plants .
Minnesota is well poised in this respect . ”
“ Creating some sort of incentive for carbon sequestration , or penalty for carbon emissions , from land use is vital if we are serious about addressing this problem , ” Polasky said .
“ We will need to implement many approaches simultaneously to solve climate change .
There is no silver bullet , but there are many silver BBs , ” said Fargione .
“ Some biofuels may be one silver BB , but only if produced without requiring additional land to be converted from native habitats to agriculture . ”

Wal - Mart 's experiment with selling cheap Linux - based PCs in its stores has apparently come to a close .
Starting last October , the retail giant stocked desktops from the Green PC line manufactured by Everex .
That stock ultimately sold out , but Wal - Mart has apparently decided not to refresh it .
The Associated Press quotes a company spokesperson , referring to the machines , as saying , " This really was n't what our customers were looking for . "
The news is n't all bad for Everex , however , as Wal - Mart 's online store will continue to carry the current Green PC desktop and the company 's compact , Linux - based laptop , the Cloudbook .
It 's tempting to try to read something about the public acceptance of desktop Linux here , but there are so many variables that enter the equation that a clear conclusion is going to be difficult to reach .
Wal - Mart is notoriously tight - lipped about its internal sales planning or figures , so it 's impossible to know how the Everex machines fared compared to their Windows counterparts .
In - store sales are influenced by everything from product placement to staff familiarity , a fact that ultimately induced Apple to sell its own wares .
Meanwhile , from a retail perspective , factors like rate of turnover , profit margin , and shelf and warehouse space have a large influence on business decisions .
Linux PCs would n't run much of the boxed Windows software that Wal - Mart caries , meaning that they may have brought in less total revenue than equivalent Microsoft - driven machines .
It 's entirely possible that the Everex machines did okay by some of these measures , but were n't compelling in the overall picture .
An unfamiliarity with Linux may have hurt these machines at retail , but that 's hardly the only thing about them that might have struck an average consumer as odd .
The gPC's CPU and graphics chip both are made by VIA , rather than Intel or AMD .
And unfamiliar software does n't end with the operating system , as the software bundle features items such as the GIMP , OpenOffice , and Xing .
Beyond a few bundled applications , most of the featured " software " simply involves links to popular sites like gMail and YouTube .
Overall , it 's easy to see how , in the absence of a well - maintained display model , new or casual computer users could find the basic stats of the Everex machines bewildering .
The fact that Wal - Mart is continuing to sell these machines online is also telling .
Here , many of the retail factors mentioned above are not involved in determining a product 's " success , " and online sales are more likely to be comprised of people targeting the machine because they know exactly what they are getting .
Although it 's hard to construe this as good news for desktop Linux , it 's also not necessarily the bad news that some will proclaim it to be .
On March 26 , 2008 , surgeons at UC San Diego Medical Center removed an inflamed appendix through a patient ’s vagina , a first in the United States .
Following the 50 - minute procedure , the patient , Diana Schlamadinger , reported only minor discomfort .
Removal of diseased organs through the body ’s natural openings offers patients a rapid recovery , minimal pain , and no scarring .
Key to these surgical clinical trials is collaboration with medical device companies to develop new minimally - invasive tools .
The procedure , called Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) , involves passing surgical instruments through a natural orifice , such as the mouth or vagina , to remove a diseased organ such as an appendix or gallbladder .
Only one incision is made through the belly button for the purpose of inserting a two millimeter camera into the abdominal cavity so the surgeons can safely access the surgical site .
Santiago Horgan , M.D. , director of the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery , is a world leader in minimally invasive surgeries , having performed 14 of these scarless NOTES procedures in the U.S. and Argentina .
Horgan cites the critical role of biotechnology companies in bringing NOTES devices into the operating room for clinical trials .
“ The path to innovation is dynamic , requiring quick response from the companies developing the tools , ” said Horgan , president of the Minimally Invasive Robotics Association .
“ Partnership with industry keeps us rolling from one success to another .
The evolution of surgery to incisionless techniques is on the horizon . ”
By avoiding major incisions through the abdomen , patients may experience a quicker recovery with less pain while reducing the risk of post operative hernias .
This procedure received approval for a limited number of patients by UC San Diego ’s Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) which oversees clinical research .
“ The UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery is investigating and refining techniques that are rapidly transforming the world of surgery , ” said Mark A. Talamini , M.D. , professor and chair of the Department of Surgery at UC San Diego Medical Center .
“ Imagine a day when surgery requires no incisions or just one tiny incision that is only millimeters in length .
Scarless , painless techniques are what the UCSD Center for the Future of Surgery is setting the stage for right this minute .
Patients deserve it . ”
Schlamadinger , a third - year graduate student at UC San Diego working toward her Ph.D. in chemistry , reported her pain as a ‘ 1 ’ or a ‘ 0.5 ’ on a scale of 1 to 10 , with 1 being the lowest .
The opportunity to participate in the clinical trial was attractive to the scientist in her .
“ The surgery appealed to me because the work and study I do every day relates to science research and discovery , ” said Schlamadinger .
“ I understand the need for these trials to provide patients new information and new procedures . ”
This is the fourth NOTES surgery that UC San Diego Medical Center has performed .
The first surgery took place in September 2007 and the most recent on March 26 , 2008 .
Talamini will assume the position of President of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons ( SAGES ) in Philadelphia the second week of April 2008 .
SAGES represents a worldwide community of surgeons who are bringing minimal access surgery , endoscopy and emerging techniques to patients in every country .
Horgan and Talamini used FDA - cleared RealHand High Dexterity instruments , developed by Novare Surgical .
These laparoscopic instruments give the surgeon greater dexterity and control to move around organs and blood vessels .
RealHand allows the instrument tip to track the surgeon ’s hand movements and have been customized for transvaginal NOTES procedures .
The surgery was guided by imagery enabled by a flexible , high - definition digital endoscope made by Olympus America .
“ Her speech was very long and inappropriate for that occasion , ” said Vivian Creighton Bishop , a public official in Columbus , Ga. , who supports Mrs. Clinton .
Mrs. Obama has also had to learn to tamp down her sometimes biting humor because it too often leaves Mr. Obama as the punch line .
( It has been a long time since she has talked publicly about her husband of 15 years being smelly in the morning , as she told Glamour magazine , or forgetting to put away the butter . )
“ What I ’ve learned is that my humor does n’t translate to print all the time , ” she said in the interview .
“ But usually when I ’m speaking to a group , people understand what I ’m trying to say , they get the humor , they understand the sarcasm , they get the joke . ”
Her audiences do laugh .
Talking about how long it took her and Mr. Obama , 46 , to pay off their student loans ( they did so only in the last couple of years ) , she told a church audience in Cheraw , S.C. , “ I ’m still waiting for Barack ’s trust fund . ”
They cackled .
She continued : “ Then I heard Dick Cheney was supposed to be a relative !
Thought we might be in for something here . ”
On some occasions , Mrs. Obama ’s straight talk has also made it necessary for the campaign to explain her remarks .
In the case of “ Good Morning America , ” campaign officials pointed out that in an unbroadcast portion of the interview , Mrs. Obama later acknowledged that as a good Democrat , she would need to support Mrs. Clinton if she were the nominee .
Mrs. Obama ’s nickname inside the campaign is “ the closer ” because she is skilled at persuading undecided voters to sign pledge cards .
But as a smooth orator , she is also known as a connector , volunteering her own life lessons from working - class roots and discussing her confrontation with a culture of low expectations .
She has been transparent about more mundane things , too , like leaning on her mother for child care while she is on the road .
Too often the White House spokespeople are able to dodge and weave their way through questions about the President 's demand for immunity against warrantless surveillance lawsuits .
To help the press corps try to get to the heart of the matter , here are the top ten questions we'd like to see Dana Perino or Tony Fratto faced with at their next press conference :
# 10 : How can the lawsuits cause liability for " billions " of dollars unless the telcoms violated the rights of millions of ordinary Americans ?
If the surveillance is limited to communications involving suspected terrorists , would n't the number of people surveilled be very low ?

And , the number one question :
You keep saying that a recent FISA court order prevents you from listening in on foreign - to - foreign communications .
But that ruling did not affect your longstanding ability to listen in on foreign to foreign calls from overseas listening places , did it ?
Why can't you listen into those foreign - to - foreign calls from the many overseas surveillance facilities that the NSA has long used instead of installing new listening posts inside the U.S. ?

An isotope is an element with a secret .
Its atoms have the standard number of electrons and protons but carry an extra - heavy load of neutrons .
( That 's why the hydrogen isotope deuterium makes " heavy water . " )
Now , there are limits to how much the nucleus of a given element can hold , but what those limits are remains , for the most part , a mystery .
Still , the idea of aluminum atoms with , say , 29 or 30 neutrons instead of the usual 14 , or magnesium with 28 instead of 12 , would have been considered impolite , if not outlandish .
Then along came Dave Morrissey , who created those mutants with the cyclotron at Michigan State University last year .
" The theoretical physicists will have to figure out what 's wrong with their models , " he says .
To pull off this atomic feat , Morrissey 's team shot beryllium with calcium isotope ions accelerated to half the speed of light .
The resulting fragments , comprising the all - new isotopes , flew through two mass spectrometers to measure their masses and volumes and hit a radiation detector at the other end of the lab .
All that happens in five - millionths of a second ; sorting the data took almost two weeks .
But when Morrissey was done , he was rocking some serious heavy metal .
He estimates that it 'll take another two to five years to find all the isotopes of aluminum , silicon , and magnesium , and far longer for the 107 elements for which isotope limits remain unknown .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.N said on Tuesday it was locked in an exclusive deal to distribute DVDs on Toshiba Corp 's 6502 .

“ We have a partnership with Toshiba and have an obligation to see this through , ” DreamWorks Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said on Tuesday .
“ As you know , we have been well - compensated for our support .
It really is in their court at this point to really declare what the next step will be .
We ’re poised either way to jump into the marketplace when the conditions are right to do so , ” he said
Toshiba , which began selling HD DVD players in March 2006 , has sold 1 million players and recorders .
But this month it declared it would quit the technology after a bitter battle against Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T rival Blu-ray , which won more studio and retail support .
In August , Viacom Inc's VIAb .
N Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks signed exclusivity deals to distribute next - generation films on HD DVD for the next 18 months .
Shortly afterwards , the New York Times reported Viacom executives with knowledge of the deals said Paramount and DreamWorks would get a combined $ 150 million in financial incentives for their commitment to HD DVD .
DreamWorks plans to release the DVD version of “ Bee Movie ” next month and is waiting to hear back from Toshiba on how to proceed .
“ We said , we have a release coming up on ‘ Bee Movie . ’
What would you like us to do ? , ” Katzenberg told Reuters in an interview .
JP Morgan analyst Barton Crockett said the Blu-ray market was still small although he expected DreamWorks would like to have the issue settled by the 2008 holiday season .
“ It might mean they ’ll lose the opportunity to sell ‘ Bee Movie ’ on Blu-ray , although the market for Blu-ray is still pretty small and the offset is that they ’d get money from Toshiba , which may in fact be more , ” Crockett said .
“ But I ’m sure they ’ll like to have this settled by Christmas . ”
Other HD DVD - backing studios like General Electric Co's GE.N Universal Pictures said this month they will switch to Blu-ray after Toshiba officially pulled the plug on HD DVD .

( 11 Feb 2008 ) The Internal Revenue Service , defying three court orders , continues to withhold crucial statistical data the public needs to judge how the agency is enforcing the nation 's tax laws .
That charge was made today in a motion filed in the Federal District Court in Seattle by longtime IRS expert Susan Long .
A professor in the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University , Long is also the co-director of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse , a research center affiliated with both the Whitman School and the Newhouse School of Public Communications .
Since 1989 , TRAC has used the Freedom of Information

SAN FRANCISCO 
Some of the largest book publishers in the world are stripping away the anticopying software on digital downloads of audio books .
The trend will allow consumers who download audio books to freely transfer these digital files between devices like their computers , iPods and cellphones  and conceivably share them with others .
Dropping copying restrictions could also allow a variety of online retailers to start to sell audio book downloads .
The publishers hope this openness could spark renewed growth in the audio book business , which generated $ 923 million in sales last year , according to the Audio Publishers Association .
Random House was the first to announce it was backing away from D.R.M. , or digital rights management software , the protective wrapping placed around digital files to make them difficult to copy .
In a letter sent to its industry partners last month , Random House , the world ’s largest publisher , announced it would offer all of its audio books as unprotected MP3 files beginning this month , unless retail partners or authors specified otherwise .

Peter the Poll Worker in that video was wrong .
The first poll worker was correct .
It 's perfectly OK to film inside a polling place , as long as voters are not being intimidated or made to feel uncomfortable during voting , or when they are preparing to vote .
In other words , you can't go into a polling place and film the voters .
That 's the kind of voter intimidation that the Jim Crow South used to inflict on Blacks .
So , the voter with the camera in this video was walking a fine line .
I can understand why Peter became angry and defensive , but he was wrong .
However ... since the voter informed us that after he got home and called the ROV to find out why he was n't registered as a Repub , he discovered he was .
So ... there was a problem with the roster .
So ... what should have happened when the voter was instructed to go to Peter the Problem - Solving Poll Worker , Peter should have called the Registrar 's office himself on his handy - dandy Election Assistant Cell Phone , discovered that the voter was indeed a Repub , and then instructed the voter to vote on a provisional ballot , noting the reason for using the provisional ballot on the back of the ballot envelope , so that the ROV could verify the reasons back in their office .
I can understand the voter 's concerns that his provisional ballot will not be counted , but the system of provisional ballots should not be problematic when instituted and executed correctly .
Provisional ballots ARE counted , when it is determined that the voter did not double - vote , or was indeed unable to vote on a regular ballot ( as this voter clearly was ) , or attempted to vote provisionally so that someone else could come into the polling place who was not registered to vote or who had voted under his own name and then voted as if he was this other voter .
What is the most disturbing to me about this video are the discrepancies between the polling place roster and the computer database of voters back at the ROV .
Now THAT is something that needs to be investigated fully !
Do n't scapegoat provisional ballots or misinformed / poorly trained poll workers !
What comes up as another area of concern is exactly what is the process that the people back at the ROV use when reviewing provisional ballots and making the determination as to their legitimacy .
It should NOT be a judgment call for some official .
The whole process should be objective , very clearly defined , with guidelines exactly spelled out , and with enough people doing the reviewing and determining process as to disallow any provisional ballot shenanigans .

Or perhaps the LA Times was talking about the vote that just happened in the Senate .
The republicans filibustered the economic stimulus package .
Sixty votes were needed but only 59 would vote for it .
The nostalgic desirer of another 100 years war , McCain , was not there to vote .
The " 6 or 7 " republicans that switched over will be waterboarded later ...
Is that the vote the LA Times thinks went ok ?

Linda is correct .
That is the exact protocol used in our county .
We were even issued a PDA device that contained all the registered voters and polling locations in our county called AskED plus a seperate eligibilty printout .
I used the PDA device a few times and the voters I worked with seemed to like the process .
Infact , we were instructed to issue a provisional ballots to any voter who didnt appear in the books or on the database and informed them that their vote would be counted if it was determined that this was the correct location for them to vote .
This situation occured only 3 times out of 730 ballots cast and each time is was a husband / wife situation - one was registered the other was not .
If the poll register had errors , the problem 's root cause (s ) lies soly with the county election agency who generated that register , not the folks running the polling place .
Our register books had a few dead people in it , but with 3 exceptions , everyone who showed up appeared in our register or we were able to re-direct them to the correct polling location .
Our books contained about 2,200 registered voters .

... another little tidbit .
Now to what happened last night for the actual Ron Paul supporters : 76 year old woman goes to vote in afternoon at Giblyn School in Freeport , Long Island .
Is told that Ron Paul is not on the ballot .
His name is crossed out .
She is upset that she can't vote for Ron Paul .
She goes home and tells her son , Gabe .
A Delegate for Ron Paul .
He goes to the voting poll to find out what she is talking about .
He is told that Ron Paul dropped out and is no longer on the ballot .
His name has been locked the entire day .
There are 2,100 voters in this voting district who did not have the choice of Ron Paul for the entire day .
He calls the police .
The police come down to find out what the problem is .
Gabe tells them and one of the two police go out to the car to speak to the Sargent of Freeport Village police .
The officer comes back in only to tell Gabe that Sargent Essex does not understand what the problem is since Ron Paul dropped out of the race .
News 12 was called and The Daily News was informed .
ABC news was too busy to take this story .

With all the cool things that you can do with LEDs today , there is still one thing that ’s lacking : simplicity .
If you want to run a bunch of LEDs at a time , you usually end up spending a fair bit of time worrying about series and parallel combinations , matching brightness , and picking load resistors .
Or , if you ’re a beginner , maybe you only get one third of the way through the previous sentence– wondering if you ’re already in over your head .
Suppose that you want to make a big LED display for your window or wall : maybe it ’s your logo , a symbol , your favorite 8 - bit character , or maybe even a sign that spells out words like “ OPEN ” or “ ON AIR . ”
How do you go about it ?
The usual DIY solution involves drilling holes in a panel to fit your LEDs , then spending a heck of a lot of time wiring everything up– ending up with one resistor per LED ( and a three - dimensional mess if you happen to look at the back side of the panel ) .
And , if you do everything in the most obvious ways , it can even end up consuming a surprising amount of power .
While I have certainly spent my share of time constructing things with the aforementioned technique , at some point it becomes clear that there has to be a better way .
In this day and age , should n’t LEDs be about as difficult to play with as , say , a Lite Bright ?
Today we are releasing a new open - source hardware and software design that takes some of the sting , complexity , and mess out of playing with LEDs .
It ’s a versatile and powerful light - emitting pegboard that lets you efficiently drive hundreds of LEDs in whatever configuration you like , without so much as calculating a single load resistor .
So how does it work ?
The design is based on a large custom printed circuit board that provides a 25 x 25 grid of locations for LEDs ; 625 in all .
Around the edges of this array go resistors and transistors that serve to control the array , driven by a large AVR microcontroller .
Once those peripheral components around the edges have been added , every one of the 625 LED locations is active , and an LED placed there will light up and be efficiently driven .
Circuit theory
The basic idea is that we have constructed a multiplexed array where only one row of the display is actually turned on at any given time .
However , the microcontroller scans through the different rows so quickly that they all appear to be on continuously .
The anodes of the LEDs in each column are connected together , and through a single resistor to the positive voltage rail , 4.5 V . Since only one row is ever on at a given time , that column resistor limits the amount of current through just one LED – effectively providing one load resistor for every LED that is on at a given time .
The cathodes of the LEDs in each row are connected together and are controlled through a single NPN transistor driven by the microcontroller .
This design inherently does not care which LED locations are populated and which are empty – performance is not affected by the number of LEDs in a given row .
Microcontroller
While there are some other ways that the circuit could be driven , we chose to use an ATmega164P microcontroller to drive the display .
It is a relatively inexpensive AVR family microcontroller with 16 K of flash , hardly any of which is required for the basic row - scanning functions that we use .
The most important thing is that it comes in a 40 - pin package that can easily drive the 25 pins of the display and still have room left over for several extra I/O pins including analog to digital converters .
One of the main reasons to pick a controller like that is that one of our design goals was for the whole circuit to be seriously hackable .
What exactly can be done with that processor and its extra inputs is wide open .
As a simple example , our default firmware uses a light sensor and can ( optionally ) turn off the display during the daytime .
What does it look like ?
First of all it should be stressed that the circuit board is huge : 12 x 15 ″ .
That ’s because we ’ve left enough room at each LED location to fit a “ 10 mm ” LED .
The pegboard area itself covers nearly a square foot of space .
Immediately below the LED field is room for a battery box ( 3 x D - cell ) .
On the lower left is the microcontroller and on the lower right there is a place for a power jack and a switch to select whether the board is powered from an adapter or from batteries .
Of course , what we really care about is what it looks like when there are things on the circuit board :
In the examples above , you can see our Evil Mad Scientist “ Resist ” logo , along with our electronic and sarcastic valentine ’s day card .
There are also closeups on 10 mm pink , green , and blue diffused LEDs , as well as 5 mm white clear LEDs installed in the panels .
How do you make it ?
This project is fully documented , wide open , open source , and you can approach it from any direction you want .

That ’s what the forums are for .
FAQ :
1 . What ’s this all about ?
This is an easy way to drive a lot of LEDs– up to 625 – in a big matrix .
You can make an LED sign for your window , a geeky valentine for your sweetie , one bad - ass birthday card , or freak the holy bejesus out of Boston .
Your call .
It ’s a versatile , high - brightness display .
The display can run off an AC adapter or batteries ( 3 ‘ D’ cells ) , and is designed to run as many green / blue / white / violet LEDs as you care to solder into the holes , all with excellent brightness .
The board can accommodate LEDs in several common sizes : 3 mm , 5 mm ( standard T - 1 3/4 size ) , and 10 mm .
A photosensor is provided that can automatically turn off the display in bright daylight or incandescent light .
2 . Do I have to put the LEDs on the grid , or can I position them exactly where I want to ?
You do not have to place every LED on a regular grid .
See the instructions for some tips on how to position the LEDs more arbitrarily .
3 . What can I reprogram the display to do ?
If you have an appropriate interface and like to program , you can control what the display does , either turning all the LEDs on and off , or controlling the individual rows ( but not columns ) of the display .
Here are some basic ideas to get you started :
Turn on only for a given period of time after it goes dark , or even after a given period of time .
Blink or flash the whole display slowly or occasionally .
Use it as a strobe ?
Add external buttons to control the display .
Make an insane - o - tv - b - gone ?
( Yes you can ! )
Use the photosensor to make the display interactive in other ways– turns on for ten seconds when somebody walks by ?
Make an open / closed sign where either the top half or the bottom half of the display is on .
Make a sign with a static logo in one half and blinking text in the other .
Animate vertical waves , fading in and out through the display .
Put different color LEDs in different rows , and alternate how much each of them is driven to make a color changing illumination panel , or a static panel with adjustable color .
LED coffee table ?
8 - bit style electronic art for your wall or bicycle– it can run on batteries , you know .
LED illumination panel for photography or even an infrared illumination panel .
Use the light sensor , or other sensor with the analog inputs and make a scrolling strip chart that records and displays the history of that variable , plotted by the intensity of the rows of the display .
Attach a sound sensor and make a display or sign that pulses to the beat .
4 . What is the “ charlieplexing ” option / hack ?
It ’s an alternate configuration ( well , a hack , actually ) for the board that allows you to control individual LED locations to a limited extent .
It requires you to change the hardware around a bit and reprogram the board .
It is much dimmer , and does n’t have enough speed to do anything really complicated .
There are also some bugs to work out ( A hack with bugs ?
Never ! ) that may not make it impossible– or at least very inconvenient– to drive a board that has a lot ( note : purposefully left vague ) of LEDs on it .
So what * can * it do ?
It can allow very minor animation in limited cases – do you want to blink or wink the eyes on your giant happy face display ?
4A .
Do you recommend building the multiplexed ( standard ) or charlieplexed display option ?
For almost everyone , the standard option is the way to go .
It ’s much brighter .
4B . Can I put in 625 LEDs and use this as a full animated display with charlieplexing ?
It ’s probably possible , but we do n’t recommend trying that yet– again , there are some bugs to work out first , and we may need a more severe hack to make it work well .
Update : We released Peggy 2.0 in May 2008 .
Look , before I even start talking about yttrium , let 's cut the crap .
I know all you want is the ' down and dirty . '
The really juicy stories and inside information about yttrium .
You do n't care that yttrium 's symbol is " Y " , its atomic number is 39 , and that its atomic weight is 88.90589 .
You do n't give a rat 's ass that its density is 4.47 g/cm3 ( at 293 K ) or that its molar volume atomic volume ) is 19.8 cm3/mol .
You want to know all the dirty little secrets about yttrium ( because you are a perv ) .
You want to know the answers to questions such as Yttrium is a transitional metal .
It has 39 proton s and 50 neutrons .
The electron configuration is Kr 4d5s ( meaning it 's like krypton , but with an electron in 4d ( the d atomic orbital of the fourth energy level ) and 2 electrons in 5s ) .
Yttrium 's melting point is 1799 K ( 1526 °C ) and its boiling point is 3609 K ( or 3336 °C ) .
The ionization potentials are as follows ( skip this part if you already know it by heart ) :
1st level : 600 kJ/mol ,
2nd level : 1180 kJ/mol ,
3rd level : 1980 kJ/mol ,
4th level : 5847 kJ/mol ,
5th level : 7430 kJ/mol ,
6th level : 8970 kJ/mol .
The rest are over 10000 kJ / mol , which you 're probably never going to have .
Accept it and move on .
Yttrium is stable in air .
It is silvery - metallic in appearance .
Turnings of the metal combust at around 400 °C , and if yttrium is divided finely it becomes unstable in air .
Yttrium is found in rare earth minerals and in uranium ore , but is not found naturally as a free element .
It is commercially manufactured from monazite and bastnasite , in a reaction with calcium .
Yttrium 's common oxidation state is +3 .
This little piece of information has been a source of joy to many .
Its vapour pressure is 5.31 Pa at 1799 K .
To produce yttrium in the safety ( and comfort ) of your own home , obtain some yttrium fluoride , and react it with calcium .
You get :
2YF 3 + 3Ca -> 2Y + 3 Ca 3 F 2
It is of course , of unestimable interest to know that , naturally , yttrium exists as only one isotope , Y - 89 .
The other isotopes are unstable , all but four ( Y - 87 , Y - 88 , Y - 90 and Y - 91 ) having a half - life of less than a day .
Due to public demand , I will list several isotopes with their respective half - lives :
Isotope | Half life ----------|-------------
Y- 85 | 2.6 h Y - 86 | 14.74 h Y - 87 | 3.35 d Y - 88 | 106.6 d Y - 89 | Stable Y - 90 | 2.67 d Y - 91 | 58.5 d Y - 92 | 3.54 h Y - 93 | 10.2 h
Yttrium was discovered by Johan Gadolin in 1794 .
It was discovered in a mine near Ytterby , a village in Sweden .
This little village ( where , at the time of writing , the sky appears to be overcast according to a prominent weather site , and the temperatures a not - so - warm 14 °C ( not to be used for navigational purposes ) ) , is not too far from Stockholm .
In this mine , Gadolin discovered Yttria ( as you can see , they were very creative name - wise ) .
Incidentally , due to a severe vowel shortage , Ytterby also gave its name to three other other element s : ytterbium terbium and erbium , but that is the subject of another ( and no less exciting ) node .
In 1828 , Friedrich Wohler isolated yttrium oxide , and in 1843 Mosander showed that yttria was actually a combination of oxides of three elements , yttrium , erbium and terbium ( good times , good times ) .
Today , yttria refers only to yttrium oxide .
Quite a large amount of yttrium is found on the moon .
Despite the fact that it is not a lanthanide or an actinide , it is considered a rare - earth metal because of its similarity and natural proximity to the lanthanides .

Yttrium 's main use is in colour televisions .
YVO europium and Yeuropium phosphor s are used to give the red colour in television tubes .
Other than that , yttrium is used to increase strength in aluminium and magnesium alloys , is used in lasers ( that is always cool ) and as a catalyst for ethylene polymerization .
Yttrium oxide is used to produce yttrium - iron garnets , which are very effective microwave filters .
99.9 % pure yttrium is currently going for about $ 140 / kg , less if you order a large amount .
Several sites say the price is $ 75 / oz , but hey , my figure is a quote from an actual dealer ( true fact , and not as interesting as it would seem ) .
Flush eyes with warm water for 15 minutes .
If irritation persists , seek medical attention
Take deep breaths of fresh air and avoid further inhalation of material .
If irritation persists , seek medical attention .
( The previous two items are actual quotes from a safety brochure on yttrium ) .

A jovial Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama took to FOX News early Monday to spin their respective performances in Tuesdays pivotal Democratic primaries  and faced critiques from former Bush architect  Karl Rove .
Clinton parried a question about her humanity ,  wooing the network she had once decried .
 I have a little secret , which I will only tell Fox , if you promise not to tell anybody else ,  she said .
 You know what , I really am a human being .
I know thats hard to believe , but it happens to be true . 
Karl Rove has handed me a note ,  added Fox anchor Steve Doocy ( the clip takes place at 2:51 ) .
 More US presidents have been born in the month of October than any other month .
You were born in ?
 October ,  Clinton replied .
 Thank you , Karl .
I mean the omens are just stacking up .
What can I say ?
Asked about a Rush Limbaugh effort to have Republicans vote for Clinton in Texas , Clinton said ,  Be careful what you wish for , Rush . 
Obama , meanwhile , noted that he still held a sizable lead among Democratic delegates , despite Clintons Tuesday victories in Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island .
 It s going to be hard for her to close the delegate lead ,  Obama said .
 We expect that well be vigorously contesting all of these states .
We are in a very strong position to win the nomination were anxious to pivot to November to have a debate about which direction we want to move the country . 
Rove complimented Clintons performance .
 I thought it was good , light thats the side of her Americans dont see much ,  he said .
Meanwhile , the onetime Bush adviser attacked Obama , saying he had failed in his three years in the Senate to achieve big things . 
 He has not done that in his three years in the Senate ,  Rove quipped .

In last month 's article , you saw just a touch of Scala 's syntax , the bare minimum necessary to run a Scala program and observe some of its simpler features .
The Hello World and Timer examples from that article let you see Scala 's Application class , its syntax for method definitions and anonymous functions , just a glimpse of an Array [ ] , and a bit on type - inferencing .
Scala has a great deal more to offer , so this article investigates the intricacies of Scala coding .
About this series Ted Neward dives into the Scala programming language and takes you along with him .
In this new developerWorks series , learn what all the recent hype is about and see some of Scala 's linguistic capabilities in action .
Scala code and Java code will be shown side by side wherever comparison is relevant , but ( as you 'll discover ) many things in Scala have no direct correlation to anything you 've found in Java -- and therein lies much of Scala 's charm !
After all , if Java could do it , why bother learning Scala ?
Scala 's functional programming features are compelling , but they 're not the only reason Java developers should be interested in the language .
In fact , Scala blends functional concepts and object orientation .
In order to let the Java - cum - Scala programmer feel more at home , it makes sense to look at Scala 's object features and see how they map over to Java linguistically .
Bear in mind that there is n't a direct mapping for some of these features , or in some cases , the " mapping " is more of an analog than a direct parallel .
But where the distinction is important , I 'll point it out .
Scala has class ( es ) , too
Rather than embark on a lengthy and abstract discussion of the class features that Scala supports , let 's look at a definition for a class that might be used to bring rational number support to the Scala platform ( largely swiped from " Scala By Example " -- see Related topics ) :
Listing 1 . rational.scala
class Rational ( n : Int , d: Int ) { private def gcd(x : Int , y: Int ) : Int = { if ( x==0 ) y else if ( x < 0 ) gcd ( -x , y ) else if ( y < 0 ) - gcd( x , -y ) else gcd ( y%x , x ) } private val g = gcd( n , d ) val numer : Int = n/g val denom : Int = d/g def +( that : Rational ) = new Rational ( numer* that.denom + that .numer * denom , denom * that .denom ) def -( that : Rational ) = new Rational ( numer * that .
denom - that .numer * denom , denom * that .denom ) def *( that : Rational ) = new Rational ( numer * that .numer , denom * that .denom ) def /( that : Rational ) = new Rational ( numer * that .denom , denom * that.numer ) override def toString ( ) = " Rational : [ " + numer + " / " + denom + " ] " }
While the overall structure of Listing 1 is lexically similar to what you 've seen in Java code over the last decade , some new elements clearly are at work here .
Before picking this definition apart , take a look at the code to exercise the new Rational class :
Listing 2 . RunRational
class Rational( n: Int , d: Int ) { // ... as before } object RunRational extends Application { val r1 = new Rational ( 1 , 3 ) val r2 = new Rational ( 2 , 5 ) val r3 = r1 - r2 val r4 = r1 + r2 Console.println ( " r1 = " + r1 ) Console.println ( " r2 = " + r2 ) Console.println ( " r3 = r1 - r2 = " + r3 ) Console.println ( " r4 = r1 + r2 = " + r 4 ) }
What you see in Listing 2 is n't terribly exciting : I create a couple of rational numbers , create two more Rational s as the addition and subtraction of the first two , and echo everything to the console .
( Note that Console. println ( ) comes from the Scala core library , living in scala .* , and is implicitly imported into every Scala program , just as java.lang is in Java programming . )
How many ways shall I construct thee ?
Now look again at the first line in the Rational class definition :
Listing 3 . Scala 's default constructor
class Rational( n: Int , d: Int ) { // ...
Although you might think you 're looking at some kind of generics - like syntax in Listing 3 , it 's actually the default and preferred constructor for the Rational class : n and d are simply the parameters to that constructor .
Scala 's preference for a single constructor makes a certain kind of sense -- most classes end up having a single constructor or a collection of constructors that all " chain " through a single constructor as a convenience .
If you wanted to , you could define more constructors on a Rational like so :
Listing 4 . A chain of constructors
class Rational ( n : Int , d: Int ) { def this ( d: Int ) = { this ( 0 , d ) }
Note that Scala 's constructor chain does the usual Java - constructor - chaining thing by calling into the preferred constructor ( the Int , Int version ) .
Details , ( implementation ) details ...
When working with rational numbers , it helps to perform a bit of numerical legerdemain : namely that of finding a common denominator to make certain operations easier .
If you want to add 1 - over - 2 ( also known as " one - half " ) to 2 - over - 4 ( also known as " two - fourths " ) , the Rational class should be smart enough to realize that 2 - over - 4 is the same as 1 - over - 2 , and convert it accordingly before adding the two together .
This is the purpose of the nested private gcd ( ) function and g value inside of the Rational class .
When the constructor is invoked in Scala , the entire body of the class is evaluated , which means g will be initialized with the greatest common denominator of n and d , and then used in turn to set n and d appropriately .
Looking back at Listing 1 , it's also fairly easy to see that I created an overridden toString method to return the values of Rational , which will be very useful when I start exercising it from the RunRational driver code .
Notice the syntax around toString , however : the override keyword in the front of the definition is required so that Scala can check to make sure that a corresponding definition exists in the base class .
This can help prevent subtle bugs created by accidental keyboard slips .
( It was this same motivation that led to the creation of the @Override annotation in Java 5 . )
Notice , as well , that the return type is not specified -- it 's obvious from the definition of the method body -- and that the returned value is n't explicitly denoted using the return keyword , which Java would require .
Instead , the last value in the function is considered the return value implicitly .
( You can always use return keyword if you prefer Java syntax , however . )
Some core values
Next up are the definitions of numer and denom , respectively .
The syntax involved , offhand , would lead the Java programmer to believe that numer and denom are public
Int fields that are initialized to the value of n- over -g and d-over - g , respectively ; but this assumption is incorrect .
Formally , Scala calls numer and denom methods without parameters , which are used to create a quick - and - easy syntax for defining accessors .
The Rational class still has three private fields , n , d , and g , but they are hidden from the world by default private access in the case of n and d , and by explicit private access in the case of g .
The Java programmer in you is probably asking at this point , " Where are the corresponding " setters " for n and d ? "
No such setters exist .
Part of the power of Scala is that it encourages developers to create immutable objects by default .
Granted , syntax is available to create methods for modifying the internals of Rational , but doing so would ruin the implicit thread - safe nature of this class .
As a result , at least for this example , I 'm going to leave Rational as it is .
Naturally , that raises the question of how one manipulates a Rational .
Like java.lang .
String s , you can't take an existing Rational and modify its values , so the only alternative is to create new Rational s out of the values of an existing one , or create it from scratch .
This brings into focus the next set of four methods : the curiously named + , - , * , and / methods .
And no , contrary to what it might look like , this is n't operator - overloading .
Operator , ring me a number
Remember that in Scala everything is an object .
In the last article , you saw how that principle applies to the idea that functions themselves are objects , which allows Scala programmers to assign functions to variables , pass functions as object parameters , and so on .
An equally important principle is that everything is a function ; that is to say , in this particular case , there is no distinction between a function named add and a function named + .
In Scala , all operators are functions on a class .
They just happen to have , well , funky names .
In the Rational class , then , four operations have been defined for rational numbers .
These are the canonical , mathematical operations add , subtract , multiply , and divide .
Each of these is named by its mathematical symbol : + , - , * , and / .
Notice , however , that each of these operators works by constructing a new Rational object each time .
Again , this is very similar to how java.lang .
String works , and it is the default implementation because it yields thread - safe code .
( If no shared state -- and internal state of an object shared across threads is implicitly shared state -- is modified by a thread , then there is no concern over concurrent access to that state . )
What 's new with you ?
The everything is a function rule has two powerful effects :
The first , as you 've already seen , is that functions can be manipulated and stored as objects themselves .
This leads to powerful re-use scenarios like the one explored in the first article in this series .
The second effect is that there is no special distinction between the operators that the Scala - language designers might think to provide and the operators that Scala programmers think should be provided .
For example , let 's assume for a moment that it makes sense to provide an " inversion " operator , which will flip the numerator and denominator and return a new Rational ( so that Rational ( 2,5 ) will return Rational ( 5,2 ) ) .
If you decide that the ~ symbol best represents this concept , then you can define a new method using that as a name , and it will behave just as any other operator would in Java code , as shown in Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . Let 's flip
val r6 = ~ r1 Console.println ( r6 ) // should print [ 3 / 1 ] , since r1 = [ 1 / 3 ]
Defining this unary " operator " in Scala is slightly tricky , but it 's purely a syntactic nit :
Listing 6 .
This is how you flip
class Rational( n: Int , d: Int ) { // ... as before ... def unary_~ : Rational = new Rational ( denom , numer ) }
The tricky part is , of course , the fact that you have to prefix the ~ name with " unary_ " to tell the Scala compiler that it is intended to be a unary operator ; therefore , the syntax will be " flipped " from the traditional reference - then - method syntax common in most object languages .
Note that this combines with the " everything is an object " rule to create some powerful -- but easy - to - explain -- code opportunities :
Listing 7 .
Add it up
1 + 2 + 3 // same as 1 .+( 2.+( 3 ) ) r1 + r2 + r3 // same as r1.+( r2.+( r3 ) )
Naturally , the Scala compiler " does the right thing " for the straight integer addition examples , but syntactically it 's all the same .
This means that you can develop types that are no different from the " built - in " types that come as part of the Scala language .
The Scala compiler will even try to infer some meaning out of the " operators " that have some predetermined meaning , such as the += operator .
Note how the following code just does what it should , despite the fact that the Rational class does n't have an explicit definition for += :
Listing 8 . Scala infers
var r5 = new Rational ( 3,4 ) r5 += r1 Console.println ( r5 )
When printed , r5 has the value [ 13 / 12 ] , which is exactly what it should be .
Scala under the hood
Remember that Scala compiles to Java bytecode , meaning that it runs on the JVM .
If you need proof , look no further than the fact that the compiler is producing .class files that begin with 0xCAFEBABE , just like javac does .
Also note what happens if you fire up the Java bytecode disassembler that comes with the JDK ( javap ) and point it at the generated Rational class , as shown in Listing 9 :
Listing 9 . Classes compiled from rational .
scala
C:\Projects\scala-classes\code>javap - private - classpath classes Rational Compiled from " rational.scala " public class Rational extends java.lang .
Object implements scala.ScalaObject{ private int denom ; private int numer ; private int g ; public Rational ( int , int ) ; public Rational unary_$tilde ( ) ; public java.lang.
String toString ( ) ; public Rational $ div( Rational ) ; public Rational $ times ( Rational ) ; public Rational $ minus ( Rational ) ; public Rational $ plus( Rational ) ; public int denom ( ) ; public int numer ( ) ; private int g( ) ; private int gcd ( int , int ) ; public Rational ( int ) ; public int $ tag ( ) ; } C: \Projects\scala-classes\code >
The " operators " defined in the Scala class transmogrify into method calls in the best tradition of Java programming , though they do seem to be based on funny names .
Two constructors are defined on the class : one taking an int and one taking a pair of int s .
And , if you happen to be at all concerned that the use of the upper- case Int type is somehow a java.lang .
Integer in disguise , note that the Scala compiler is smart enough to transform them into regular Java primitive int s in the class definition .
Testing , testing , 1 - 2 - 3 ...
It is a well - known meme that good programmers write code , and great programmers write tests ; thus far , I have been lax in exercising this rule for my Scala code , so let ’s see what happens when you put this Rational class inside of a traditional JUnit test suite , as shown in Listing 10 :
Listing 10 . RationalTest.java
import org.junit.* ; import static org.junit.
Assert.* ; public class RationalTest { @ Test public void test2ArgRationalConstructor ( ) { Rational r = new Rational ( 2 , 5 ) ; assertTrue( r.numer ( ) == 2 ) ; assertTrue(r.denom ( ) == 5 ) ; } @ Test public void test1ArgRationalConstructor ( ) { Rational r = new Rational ( 5 ) ; assertTrue( r.numer ( ) == 0 ) ; assertTrue(r.denom ( ) == 1 ) ; // 1 because of gcd ( ) invocation during construction ; // 0 - over - 5 is the same as 0 - over - 1 } @ Test public void testAddRationals ( ) { Rational r1 = new Rational ( 2 , 5 ) ; Rational r2 = new Rational ( 1 , 3 ) ; Rational r3 = ( Rational ) reflectInvoke ( r1 , " $ plus " , r2 ) ; //r1.$plus( r2 ) ; assertTrue( r3.numer ( ) == 11 ) ; assertTrue( r3.denom ( ) == 15 ) ; } // ... some details omitted }
SUnit A Scala - based unit test suite already exists , going by the name of SUnit .
If you used SUnit for the test shown in Listing 10 , you would n't need the Reflection - based workaround .
The Scala - based unit test code would be compiled against the Scala class , so the compiler would be able to make the symbols line up .
Some developers actually find it more attractive to write unit tests in Scala , exercising POJOs , instead of the other way around .
SUnit is part of the standard Scala distribution , in the scala . testing package .
Aside from confirming that the Rational class behaves , well , rationally , the above test suite also proves that it is possible to call Scala code from Java code ( albeit with a little bit of an impedance mismatch when it comes to the operators ) .
The cool thing about this , of course , is that it lets you try out Scala slowly , by migrating Java classes over to Scala classes without ever having to change the tests that back them .
The only weirdness you might notice in the test code has to do with operator invocation , in this case , the + method on the Rational class .
Looking back at the javap output , Scala has obviously translated the + function into the JVM method $ plus , but the Java Language Specification does not allow the $ character in identifiers ( which is why it 's used in nested and anonymous nested class names ) .
In order to invoke those methods , you either have to write the tests in Groovy or JRuby ( or some other language that does n't pose a restriction on the $ character ) , or you can write a little bit of Reflection code to invoke it .
I go with the latter approach , which is n't all that interesting from a Scala perspective , but the result is included in this article 's code bundle , should you be curious .
( See Download . )
Note that workarounds like these are only necessary for function names that are n't also legitimate Java identifiers .
A " better " Java
Back when I was first learning C++ , Bjarne Stroustrup suggested that one way to learn C++ was to see it as " a better C " ( see Related topics ) .
In some ways , Java developers today might come to see Scala as a " better Java , " because it provides a more terse and succinct way of writing traditional Java POJOs .
Consider the traditional Person POJO shown in Listing 11 :
Listing 11 . JavaPerson.java ( original POJO )
public class JavaPerson { public JavaPerson ( String firstName , String lastName , int age ) { this .
firstName = firstName ; this .lastName = lastName ; this.age = age ; } public String getFirstName ( ) { return this .
firstName ; } public void setFirstName ( String value ) { this .
firstName = value ; } public String getLastName ( ) { return this .lastName ; } public void setLastName ( String value ) { this .
lastName = value ; } public int getAge ( ) { return this .age ; } public void setAge ( int value ) { this .age = value ; } public String toString ( ) { return " [ Person : firstName " + firstName + " lastName : " + lastName + " age : " + age + " ] " ; } private String firstName ; private String lastName ; private int age ; }
Now consider its equivalent written in Scala :
Listing 12 . person.scala ( threadsafe POJO )
class Person ( firstName : String , lastName : String , age : Int ) { def get FirstName = firstName def getLastName = lastName def getAge = age override def toString = " [ Person firstName : " + firstName + " lastName : " + lastName + " age : " + age + " ] " }
It is n't a complete drop - in replacement , given that the original Person had some mutable setters .
But considering the original Person also had no synchronization code around those mutable setters , the Scala version is safer to use .
Also , if the goal is to truly reduce the number of lines of code in Person , you could remove the get Foo property methods entirely because Scala will generate accessor methods around each of the constructor parameters -- firstName ( ) returns a String , lastName ( ) returns a String , and age ( ) returns an int ) .
Even if the need for those mutable setter methods is undeniable , the Scala version is still simpler , as you can see in Listing 13 :
Listing 13 . person.scala ( full POJO )
class Person ( var firstName : String , var lastName : String , var age : Int ) { def get FirstName = firstName def getLastName = lastName def getAge = age def setFirstName ( value : String ) : Unit = firstName = value def setLastName ( value : String ) = lastName = value def setAge ( value : Int ) = age = value override def toString = " [ Person firstName : " + firstName + " lastName : " + lastName + " age : " + age + " ] " }
As an aside , notice the introduction of the var keyword on the constructor parameters .
Without going into too much detail , var tells the compiler that the value is mutable .
As a result , Scala generates both accessor ( String firstName ( void ) ) and mutator ( void firstName_$eq ( String ) ) methods .
It then becomes easy to create set Foo property mutator methods that use the generated mutator methods under the hood .
Conclusion
Scala is an attempt to incorporate functional concepts and terseness without losing the richness of the object paradigm .
As you 've perhaps begun to see in this series , Scala also corrects some of the egregious ( in hindsight ) syntactic problems found in the Java language .
This second article in the Busy Java developer 's guide to Scala series has focused on Scala 's object facilities , which let you start using Scala without having to dive too deeply into the functional pool .
Based on what you 've learned so far , you can already start using Scala to reduce your programming workload .
Among other things , you can use Scala to produce the very same POJOs needed for other programming environments , such as Spring or Hibernate .

Failing to prohibit in statute the use of waterboarding and other torture undermines our nation 's moral authority , puts American military and diplomatic personnel at risk , and weakens the quality of intelligence .
Indeed , in 2007 , General David Petraeus wrote , " Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy .
That would be wrong .
Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal , history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary . "
Speaker Nancy Pelosi : " In the words of retired Rear Admiral Donald Guter , a former Navy Judge Advocate General : ' There is no disconnect between human rights and national security … they 're synergistic .
One does n't work without the other for very long . '
Failing to legally prohibit the use of waterboarding and other harsh torture techniques also risks the safety of our soldiers and other Americans serving overseas .
In a letter to the Congressional intelligence committee chairmen , 30 retired generals and admirals -- including General Joseph Hoar , the former head of U.S. Central Command -- stated : ' We believe it is vital to the safety of our men and women in uniform that the United States not sanction the use of interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if inflicted by the enemy against captured Americans … ' "
" I do n't know where to draw the line on some of these issues , " Shays said , adding that torture used to involve pulling out fingernails and maiming people with knives .
" I would n't be able to go through each item and tell you , " Shays said , " because I do n't know the sensation .
I have n't had anyone do it to me . "
" I am appalled that the President vetoed a bill that would have simply forced interrogators to abide by the methods approved by our own military .
I am equally appalled that Chris Shays and the Republicans in Congress voted to sustain Bush 's veto .
" Chris Shays continues to provide cover for Bush 's torture policy -- a policy which has eroded our standing in the world , endangers our own troops in the field , and makes us less safe .
That the President and Chris Shays can't say clearly and loudly that Americans do not torture is inexplicable and outrageous . "
" Our country was founded on and draws its strength from noble ideals .
We are Americans , and we do n't torture .
It 's that simple . "
" We need members of Congress who take issues of morality seriously .
Instead of a reliable vote for torture like Scott Garrett , we need representatives who recognize that torture inherently generates unreliable information while reducing our standing in the world .
Our great strength as a nation is that , to paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , while the arc of our history is long , it bends toward justice . "
In a largely party - lined vote , the House failed to override Bush 's veto of the legislation that would have re-iterated long - standing American policy to not engage in the barbaric use of torture of prisoners .
Bush " vetoed the bill over the provision that extends to U.S. intelligence agencies and personnel the current prohibitions in the Army Field Manual against waterboarding and other torture . "
Senator Double Talk Express ( R - AZ ) , Bush 's political heir , supports Bush on the veto while telling the public that he opposes torture .
He is a very confused or a very deceptive man -- or both .
There were 5 brave Republicans who joined the Democrats in trying to override Bush 's veto : Roscoe Bartlett ( MD ) , Wayne Gilchrest ( MD , who lost his primary to a wingnut ) , Tim Johnson ( IL ) , Ron Paul ( TX ) and Chris Smith ( NJ ) .
There were also 2 Democrats who voted with the Republicans because the bill was n't good enough ( Dennis Kucinich and Maxine Waters ) and one disgrace to the Democratic Party who joined the GOP today , as he often does : Jim Marshall ( GA ) .
Among the Republicans desperately seeking re-election by telling their constituents they are moderates and independent of Bush who voted for torture -- again -- were Joe Knollenberg ( R - MI ) , Dave Reichert ( R - WA ) , David Dreier ( R- CA ) , Randy Kuhl ( R- NY ) , Mark Kirk ( R- IL ) , Jim Gerlach ( R - PA ) , Ric Keller ( R- FL ) , Tom Reynolds ( R- NY ) , and Mr. Moderate himself , crazyman Chris Shays ( R - CT ) .
The DSCC is supporting a right - of - center " business Democrat , " Kay Hagan for Elizabeth Dole 's senate seat in North Carolina .
Grassroots support goes to Jim Neal .
Jim has been campaigning hard against retroactive immunity and Hagan admits that she favors it .
In a brand new poll the under - financed campaign of the guy who knows it pays to emphasize the contrast in positions with right - wing Republicans pulled ahead of the Insider shill .
Many people have pointed to the deteriorating state of Chris Shays ' mental capacity lately .
Even with Attorney General Mukasey and GOP presidential nominee - designate McCain admitting that waterboarding is torture , Chris Shays is still splitting hairs and playing word games .
The slippery Liebermanlike Republican , who has voted for virtually every single item on Bush 's war agenda from Day One , had this to say about his contemptible pro-torture vote :
The progressive Democrat running against Shays in November is Blue America - endorsed Jim Himes .
We asked him how he felt about Connecticut 's one GOP congressman voting for torture .
Several other Blue America stalwarts are facing pro-torture Republicans in November .
Dennis Shulman , who is running against the Northeast 's last remaining right - wing extremist , New Jersey nutcase Scott Garrett has this to say :
And the Scott Garrett of the West Coast is California 's most extreme right wing member of Congress , Gary Miller .
Ron Shepston , his Democratic opponent does n't favor torture any more than Dennis or Jim or any rational American .
" I find it incredible that anyone would agree to put our soldiers now and in the future in danger by letting us engage in something as unproductive and in fact as counter - productive as torture .
In short , it does n’t work and makes things worse for our troops .
Anyone who says that it does is wrong .
Those who voted to sustain should be ashamed of themselves . "
VA - 11 's incumbent , Tom Davis , is retiring , as his constituents turn more and more against the war and against the entire shameful and disastrous Bush agenda Davis has rubber stamped .
Today Davis was still voting for torture .
The woman Blue America has endorsed to win in that northern Virginia district is Leslie Byrne and she came straight to the point : " Torture is against our fundamental democratic ideals and our Constitution .
We ask our military to defend these rights and principles with their lives .
If we disregard these fundamental rights , we dishonor their commitments .
"
If you 'd rather see people in Congress like Jim Himes , Leslie Byrne , Ron Shepston and Dennis Shulman , please show them a little love at Blue America Eric Massa , the Democrat running against Randy Kuhl in upstate New York , is a highly decorated ex-military officer with more understanding about military matters than Bush and his 5 closest advisers combined .
Like most military officers and retired military officers , he understands why going back to Spanish Inquisition forms of torture are damaging , first and foremost , to our own fighting men and women .
Having never been one , Bush , Cheney and their gaggle of Neocons is completely clueles .
Here 's what Eric toldthis evening after Kuhl voted , again , to rubber stamp Bush 's torture policies : " I am terribly disappointed that the roadblocking rubber stamps in Congress have decided to stand with George Bush and against the Geneva Conventions .
The topic of ' should we or should n't we condone torture ' should not even be part of the public discussion .
Torture is wrong on every level and I very much look forward to casting a vote against it when I am a part of the 111th Congress .
" Alan Grayson is running for Congress in Orlando against reflexive rubber stamp Ric Keller , who , naturally voted in favor of torture again today .
I asked Alan what the hell is going on with a vote like that .
He was as outraged as I was : " We somehow managed to get through two World Wars without torture , but in those wars we were led by the ' Greatest Generation , ' not their clueless , AWOL offspring .
I 'm wondering what else the current Republican leaders hope to revive ?
Witch - burning ?
Serfdom ?
Absolute monarchy ? "

A senior Swiss aid official has warned that the situation in the increasingly isolated Palestinian territory is " untenable " and " shocking , " the Swissinfo website reported on Thursday .
Switzerland should step up pressure to ensure international humanitarian law is properly respected in the Gaza Strip , Walter Fust , head of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation ( SDC ) , told the website .
Fust , who had just concluded a visit to Gaza , criticized Israel 's " siege policy " in Gaza , saying the policy " has damaging consequences that require a substantially increased international humanitarian response . "
According to Swissinfo , aid agencies are increasingly concerned about the plight of Gaza 's 1.4 million residents .
Gaza has been all but cut off from the outside world since June , when Hamas seized control of the territory .
In September , Israel declared Gaza a " hostile territory , " imposed additional restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from the area , and reduced the supply of fuel and electricity in response to continued rocket attacks from the Palestinian territory .
Fust said the food situation in Gaza had deteriorated " considerably , " with 30 percent of children undernourished .
The situation in hospitals and health centers is also precarious , he noted , with shortages of medicines and medical resources .
" Ambulances have such a complicated time passing Israeli checkpoints that patients ' lives are endangered , " he said .
The Swiss official stressed that a substantial increase in the humanitarian engagement by the international community in Gaza was indispensable .
" Everything must be done to mobilize more funds for Gaza .
Aid organizations cannot even cover half of their budget for Palestinian refugees . "

[ digg - reddit - me ] Barack Obama has told the story of how a Chicago doctor wrote him a letter respectfully criticizing his website for speaking of abortion in charged language after he won the Illinois Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate seat .
Barack concludes this story :
Re-reading the doctor ’s letter , though , I felt a pang of shame .
It is people like him who are looking for a deeper , fuller conversation about religion in this country .
They may not change their positions , but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fair - minded words .
Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many , and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points .
So I wrote back to the doctor , and I thanked him for his advice .
The next day , I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my pro-choice position .
And that night , before I went to bed , I said a prayer of my own – a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me .
In a similar manner , the day before the New Hampshire primary , a group of pro-life protesters interrupted an Obama rally .
They refused to stop chanting to allow Mr. Obama to speak , and after a few minutes , they were removed by security .
The largely Democratic crowd was clearly on Barack ’s side in this – booing the protesters , drowning their chants out .
But after they left , Mr. Obama gently scolded the crowd :
Let me just say this though .
Some people got organized to do that .
That ’s part of the American tradition we are proud of .
And thats hard too , standing in the midst of people who disagree with you and letting your voice be heard .
Compare this with Ms. Clinton ’s mocking of the protesters at her debates or President Bush ’s removal of anyone wearing a pin for the opposing party .

Not " Gods in White " German Doctors ' Group Confesses to Mistakes
Surgical scissors left in stomachs , operations on the wrong knee , prescriptions of uppers instead of downers -- medical error is not just the stuff of fiction .
Now a group of German doctors has decided to break a taboo and talk openly about their slip - ups .
Detroit Democrat Mayor Indicted for Perjury
The so - called culture of corruption that the Democrats labeled Republicans with before the 2006 election has been catching up with Democrats lately .
Just two weeks ago we had the Eliot Spitzer debacle followed by the ongoing disgrace of his replacement , and now we have a Democrat Mayor charged with perjury .
Of course if there is one thing that we learned from Democrats in the 1990 ’s , it is the fact that perjuring yourself is no big deal , and has no consequences , right Bill ?
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , a one - time rising star and Detroit ’s youngest elected leader , was charged Monday with perjury and other counts after sexually explicit text messages contradicted his sworn denials of an affair with a top aide .
The charges could signal the end of Kilpatrick ’s six - year career as mayor of one of America ’s largest cities .
Perjury is a felony , punishable by up to 15 years in prison .
But for Kilpatrick , a conviction also would mean his immediate expulsion from office .
The Detroit City Charter calls for any elected official convicted of a felony while in office to be removed .
In fact , this type of behavior is a badge of honor with Democrats .
Criminal activity legitimizes Democrat politicians and gives them “ street cred ” in the same type of way that rappers earn “ street cred ” for their illegal activities .
If you do n’t believe me , just ask Barney Frank , who ran a gay prostitute ring is his home , or Gerry Studds who raped a minor repeatedly , or more recently Carl Stanley Mcgee , a top aide to Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick , who raped a minor in a steam room .
Or William Jefferson , who took Katrina rescuers away from their duties to recover $ 100,000 he was hiding in his flooded home , or Ted Kennedy who left a woman to die a slow death in a submerged car while he went home to sober up .
The list goes on and on .
Something tells me he will come out of this okay .

BRUSSELS , Jan 29 ( Reuters ) - European Union countries can refuse to disclose names of file sharers on the Internet in civil cases , the EU ’s top court said on Tuesday in a blow to copyright holders trying to fight digital piracy .
The European Court of Justice ruled on a dispute between Spanish music rights holders association Promusicae and Spain 's top telecoms operator Telefonica TEF .MC .
Telefonica argued that , under a national law based on EU rules , it only had to disclose the name of an Internet subscriber for criminal actions , not civil ones .
“ Community law does not require the member states , in order to ensure the effective protection of copyright , to lay down an obligation to disclose personal data in the context of civil proceedings , ” the court said in a statement .
Promusicae wanted names of people using Telefonica ’s Internet gateway to share copyright material on the Web so it could start civil proceedings against them .
Civil proceedings are cheaper than criminal proceedings which typically require a higher burden of proof .
An adviser to the ECJ said last year that EU provisions safeguarding personal data effectively overrode the rights of intellectual property rights holders .
In victory and in defeat , the Academic Decathlon brings out the inner warrior in almost all of its nearly 500 competitors .
Moorpark High School , which captured the state title here Monday , was no exception .
“ I beat my brother by 16 points , ” said Moorpark senior Christie Calle , who compiled the most points in the Varsity division made up of A students .
Her brother , Colin , placed second in that group .
Fifty - four teams competed over the weekend in 10 events , ranging from speeches and interviews to math .
Each team has up to nine members representing A , B and C students .
The Super Quiz is the only event open to the public ; North Hollywood High was announced as the winner of that competition here Sunday night , but after a recount , Moorpark was given the title Monday .
North Hollywood finished fifth in the overall competition .

Larry Jones has coached the Moorpark team since 1991 and came close to retiring last year .
But after district officials asked him back , Jones said he could n’t refuse .
“ It ’s just too important for the kids , ” he said .
Jones beamed as he hugged his students , many of whom had multiple medals hanging around their necks .
“ This never gets old , ” he said .
Moorpark High Principal Kirk Miyashiro called the school in Ventura County to break the news .
“ Tell everyone , ” he said .
Then he turned to Jones and said , “ You ’re coming back next year . ”
If the 29th annual California Academic Decathlon was war , then the team from Granada Hills Charter High School fancied itself the brave Spartans who defended Greece from marauding invaders as depicted in the movie “ 300 , ” which the students watched repeatedly .

“ We ’re here to attack and conquer , ” said Caitlin Russell , a 5 - foot - 1 Granada Hills junior .
The team placed sixth , as it had in the local competition .
All seven Los Angeles Unified district schools that competed in the state round finished in the top 20 .
Palisades Charter High School in Pacific Palisades placed second , and defending national champion El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills finished third .
Before the start of the Super Quiz , in which each team member had to answer questions about the Civil War , the Granada Hills team huddled to do their Spartan war cry .

“ Ah - whoo , ah - whoo , ah - whoo ! ” they shouted .
“ They sound like a football team , ” said one of Granada ’s first - time co-coaches , Sharon Connelly - Menotiades .
Even the nearby Duarte High School team members , who had painted their faces baby blue , looked startled .
After spending almost all of Saturday taking tests , the Granada Hills team went through a final cram session Sunday morning in the hotel lobby .
Some flipped through their study materials , while the others took turns going over each other with a lint comb .

Most of the Granada Hills students did n’t know each other well before they began studying in the summer , but have bonded over long hours and “ 300 " screenings .
“ I love it .
It ’s like watching a work of art . . . even though there ’s not much story , ” Caitlin said of the movie .
“ There is a story ! ” said junior Bryon Atashian , perhaps the biggest “ 300 " fan on the team .
“ It ’s straight from history ! ”
After the winners were announced at Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on Monday , the Granada Hills team seemed exhausted yet pleased .
“ It ’s sad that it ’s ending , but our goal was to leave with no regrets , and I think we did that , ” said junior Rahul Vaswani .

Palisades junior Thomas Krane kept up the competitive spirit .
“ We could n’t be more proud of each other right now , ” he said .
“ Maybe we ’ll get [ Moorpark ] next year . ”
Two - time national champion Moorpark scored 52,879.4 out of a possible 60,000 points , and will compete at the national competition in Garden Grove in May .
California teams have won the last five national Academic Decathlons .
Other Moorpark team members are Jonah Buck , Anaamika Campeau , Angela Chen , Justine Levan , Chrissa Rutkai , Kris Sankaran , and Paul Watanabe .

The BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner , can reveal that Arab soldiers have been taking part in dangerous missions alongside US troops in Afghanistan .
Troops from the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) have been delivering humanitarian aid to their fellow Muslims and , on occasion , fighting their way out of Taleban ambushes .
Though Jordanian forces have been carrying out some base security duties , the UAE 's troops are the only Arab soldiers undertaking full - scale operations in the country .
Until now , their deployment has been kept so secret that not even their own countrymen knew they were here .
In a windowless room , surrounded by sandbags , the Emirati patrol commander briefs his troops for tomorrow 's mission : a hearts - and - minds visit to an Afghan village .
We try to convince the people about the US , about British .
They came here to give you peace .
UAE Maj Ghanem al - Mazroui
His troops are dressed in desert fatigues , topped with sand - coloured shemaghs , the traditional wrap - around headdress of the Gulf .
When the patrol moves out through the mountain valleys , it looks exactly like any other convoy from the US - led coalition .
The Emiratis are on their guard , wary of ambush , alert for roadside bombs .
At the last minute , the village they had originally planned to visit was deemed too dangerous : the Americans could not guarantee to provide air cover .
So they travel instead to one they have been to before , to hand out gifts and discuss what projects need building .
As fellow Muslims , they get a warm reception from the villagers .
" At first I thought these were American soldiers and I wanted them to leave but when they said they were Muslims I knew they were our brothers , " a young Afghan man says .
Hajji Fazlullah , another Afghan villager , says : " The Arab troops come in our country and our village , we are very happy . "
Riot risk
Of course , these are not the only coalition troops giving out aid to Afghans .
But what is really winning hearts and minds is the Islamic connection .
The Arabs use a shared Islamic faith to bond with the Afghans
In a sunlit courtyard , a small boy recites the Koran from memory , watched by his proud father , and by the UAE's Maj Ghanem Al - Mazroui .
Unlike most western military officers , he has spent over two years getting to know these villagers , eating and praying with them .
But handing out humanitarian aid in Afghanistan is not as easy as it sounds .
As the crowd builds up rumour spreads that there is not enough to go round and people surge forward .
The Afghan police wade in , pushing and hitting the villagers .
More than once , Maj Ghanem has to restrain them .
Without sensitive handling , the situation could easily descend into a riot .
There is even a scramble for the empty cardboard boxes .
But eventually the Arab troops manage to restore order and they leave without a shot being fired .
' Here to help '
Still , it is going to come as a surprise to most people that for the last five years , an Arab Muslim army has been operating here in Afghanistan , alongside the Americans as part of the coalition .
Afghans seem to respond well to UAE troops efforts ' to help them So I asked Maj Ghanem whether he was worried about how some people in the Arab world might react to this .
" We have an answer for that .
Even if you are asking back in the UAE or in the Gulf , or you asking here , we have the same answer , " he said .
" We make a contract with the US Army to help the people down here , not to fight " .
But I put it to him that in fact his troops have been fighting insurgents as well as handing out aid .
" If we have any types of personal attacks we react with fire .
And after that we go to the elders in this area : ' Why are you shooting us ?
We came here to help you .
" ' If you have the same picture of all coalition forces , we are different .
We came here to help you . '
" And we try to convince the people about the US , about British .
They came here to give you peace . "
Blueprint for Afghanistan
The man who kick - started the Arab humanitarian effort in Afghanistan five years ago is Hamad al - Shamsi , the UAE 's humanitarian aid co-ordinator .
A devout Muslim , a father of 10 , and a former fighter pilot , he has been travelling all over Afghanistan , often at great personal risk .
The UAE troops in convoy look much like the other coalition forces
He believes his country 's efforts are smoothing a path for the rest of the coalition .
" If we are visiting [ somewhere ] like this village and we do some service for them , then the coalition will know when they are approaching that there is somebody from their side who is coming here who has done something for us , " Mr Shamsi says .
" So the relations will be easier than if they come directly with no first approach " .
His words are born out by some of the Afghans we meet , including Governor Merajudeen Patan , who was instrumental in getting UAE 's money invested in the troubled province of Khost .
" People are not afraid that Emiratis will harm their religion , or disrespect the mosque or burn the mosque , things of this nature , " Governor Patan says .
" People are very friendly with them .
Everybody will drag them in for lunch or for dinner . "
These are hearts - and - minds operations at their most effective - drinking tea with Afghans , discussing what help can be provided .
The Emirati approach is to meet their fellow Muslims ' religious needs first , then build schools and clinics later .
But for this to have a wider , lasting , and national effect , the blueprint would need to be repeated and expanded by others , many times over and throughout Afghanistan .
And that is not likely to happen in the near future .

Today Travis was messing around with a Chinese site blinkx has indexed a short while ago http://www.tudou.com and saw a cryptic error message that started coming up on all pages .
The message looked something like this :
各位土豆 ：
为了给大家提供更好的服务，我们正在搬迁扩建土豆的中心机房。
3月14日凌晨0:00 ~ 夜间24:00，我们的服务暂停24小时。
3月15日凌晨0:00 新机房就搬迁完成了，土豆会准时回家。
Now , neither Travis nor I know the language of Chinese , so what do we do ?
Go to Google Translate , of course .
Here 's what Google Translate produced :
That 's :
Members potatoes :
In order to provide you with better service , we are expanding the relocation of the central room of potatoes .
March 14 at 0:00 to 24:00 at night , our services will be suspended for 24 hours .
March 15 at 0:00 new room on the relocation is complete , potatoes will be time to go home .
No wonder the servers went down , being powered by potatoes from a central room of potatoes and all .
I guess expanding to a larger room of even more potatoes was the only way out .
Russia test - fires two ballistic missiles
RIA Novosti
28/11/2007 10:10 MOSCOW , November 28 ( RIA Novosti ) - A missile brigade from the Siberian Military District test fired two SS - 21 Scarab short - range ballistic missiles during a tactical exercise at a test site in south Russia , a military spokesman said on Wednesday .
The SS - 21 , or Tochka , is a road - mobile single - warhead ballistic missile designed for tactical deployment .
It has been in service with missile units of the Russian Ground Forces since 1976 and has a range of 70 km ( 45 miles ) .
" A missile brigade conducted missile firing practices [ at the Kapustin Yar testing site in the Astrakhan Region ] and test launched two Tochka tactical missiles , " Colonel Valery Shcheblanin said .
The Tochka ( SS - 21 Scarab A ) and Tochka - U ( SS - 21 Scarab B ) missiles are to be gradually replaced with new Iskander - M ( NATO reporting name SS - 26 Stone ) short - range missiles , capable of carrying multiple warheads .
Dear Will , Hi .
It 's me .
Daniel .
Before I go any further , I 'd like to offer my condolences over Semi-Pro .
Everyone was predicting about $ 30 million for opening weekend , and you did about half that .
These are record - low numbers , ( for your standards ) , and that must be pretty tough for you .
It probably even comes as a surprise .
Being the arrogant , delusional man-child has always resulted in big numbers for you in the past , and I 'm sure you thought Semi - Pro would just be another huge victory .
And after all that promotion you did , with the Superbowl Ad , and the Sports Illustrated Spread , and the Old Spice stuff - you must be crushed .
I watched Semi -Pro yesterday .
It was n't very good .
I chuckled a few times , sure , there were some really great moments .
Iâve always been a sucker for bears .
A well - placed scream can often yield hilarious results , and you also have an amazing knack for picking out words that , somehow , are just inherently funny , ( this time it was âpancakes .â 
You said â pancakeâ  and I almost pissed myself . ) .
In general , however , it was as weak as Iâd expected it to be .
Each movie of yours since Anchorman has been a derivative of Anchorman , and a poor one at that .
Talladega Nights was pretty good , Blades of Glory was worse and in Semi - Pro , it just looked like you were trying too hard to do a â Will Ferrell Movie.â 
It seemed like everybody involved -- the writer , the supporting cast , even Woody Harrelson ( as Owen Wilson ) -- was just sitting back , expecting you to work some of that â Ferrell Magicâ thatâs worked so well in the past .
The formula , ( Will Ferrell plays an overly confident , loud - mouthed buffoon with an interesting hairstyle ) , has always worked , and maybe thatâs the problem .
Itâs worked too well , and too many times .
Weâve seen it .
Weâve loved it .
But weâ re not stupid .
We wonât keep paying for the same show over and over again .
Weâre ready for what else you have .
Donât confuse this with some of the other backlash you might read .
This isnât some snarky , â Iâve - always - hated - Will - anywayâ kind of letter .
Those letters are out there , but this isnât one of them .
I donât think youâre overrated .
I donât think youâ re a one - trick pony .
I havenât been sitting around waiting for you to fail .
Iâm a fan , Will .
I really am .
And , as a fan , I think I can speak for a whole lot of folks when I say â We miss you .â 
Itâs been brought to my attention that a plenty of people might only know you from your movies .
Under those circumstances , it isnât difficult to see why one or two reviewers called you a â 
One Joke Actor.â  I mean , after Anchorman , Talladega Nights , Blades of Glory and Semi -Pro , why wouldnât that be the conclusion ?
But I remember .
I remember Saturday Night Live the season before you showed up , Will .
Ellen Cleghorne .
Laura Kightlinger .
Janeane Garofalo .
Fucking Chris Elliot .
You made SNL relevant again .
Every so often , an SNL cast member comes along where you just think " That 's it .

You were one of those guys , Will , one of the best cast members that show will ever see , and it kills me that youâve resigned yourself to playing some variation of your Robert Goulet impression year after year .
Every once in a while , I try to sit back and imagine just how tough it must have been to convince studio heads that a movie about anchormen in the â70s would be a good sell .

It worked , and you knew it would , because youâve got perhaps the strongest comedic instincts of any actor of this generation .

In my previous post on shuffling , I glossed over something very important .
The very first thing that came to mind for a shuffle algorithm is this :
for ( int i = 0 ; i < cards .
Length ; i++) { int n = rand .
Next ( cards . Length ) ; Swap ( ref cards [ i ] , ref cards [ n ] ) ; }
It 's a nice , simple solution to the shuffling problem :
Loop through each card in the deck .
Swap the current card with another randomly chosen card .
At first blush , this seems like a perfectly reasonable way to shuffle .
It 's simple , it 's straightforward , and the output looks correct .
It 's the very definition of a naïve algorithm :
A naïve algorithm is a very simple solution to a problem .
It is meant to describe a suboptimal algorithm compared to a " clever " ( but less simple ) algorithm .
Naïve algorithms usually consume larger amounts of resources ( time , space , memory accesses , ... ) , but are simple to devise and implement .
An example of a naïve algorithm is bubble sort , which is only a few lines long and easy to understand , but has a O ( n2 ) time complexity .
A more " clever " algorithm is quicksort , which , although being considerably more complicated than bubble sort , has a O( n log n ) average complexity .
But there 's a deep , dark problem with this naïve shuffling algorithm , a problem that most programmers wo n't see .
Do you see it ?
Heck , I had the problem explained to me and I still did n't see it .
Watch what happens when I use this naïve shuffling algorithm to shuffle a three - card deck 600,000 times .
There are 3 ! or 6 possible combinations in that deck .
If the shuffle is working properly , we should see each combination represented around 100,000 times .
As you can see , 231 , 213 , and 132 are over - represented , and the other three possibilities are under - represented .
The naïve shuffle algorithm is biased and fundamentally broken .
Moreover , the bias is n't immediately obvious ; you 'd have to shuffle at least a few thousand times to see real statistical evidence that things are n't working correctly .
It 's a subtle thing .
Usually , naïve algorithms are n't wrong -- just oversimplified and inefficient .
The danger , in this case , is rather severe .
A casual programmer would implement the naïve shuffle , run it a few times , see reasonably correct results , and move on to other things .
Once it gets checked in , this code is a landmine waiting to explode .
Let 's take a look at the correct Knuth - Fisher - Yates shuffle algorithm .
for ( int i = cards .
Length - 1 ; i > 0 ; i--) { int n = rand .
Next ( i + 1 ) ; Swap ( ref cards [ i ] , ref cards [ n ] ) ; }
Do you see the difference ?
I missed it the first time .
Compare the swaps for a 3 card deck :
Naïve shuffle Knuth - Fisher - Yates shuffle rand .
Next ( 3 ) ; rand .
Next ( 3 ) ; rand .
Next ( 3 ) ; rand .
Next ( 3 ) ; rand .
Next ( 2 ) ;
The naive shuffle results in 33 ( 27 ) possible deck combinations .
That 's odd , because the mathematics tell us that there are really only 3 ! or 6 possible combinations of a 3 card deck .
In the KFY shuffle , we start with an initial order , swap from the third position with any of the three cards , then swap again from the second position with the remaining two cards .
The KFY shuffle produces exactly 3 * 2 = 6 combinations , as pictured above .
Based on your experience shuffling physical cards , you might think the more shuffling that goes on , the more random the deck becomes .
But more shuffling results in worse , not better , results .
That 's where the naïve algorithm goes horribly wrong .
Let 's compare all possible permutations of a 3 card deck for each algorithm :
Naïve shuffle Knuth - Fisher - Yates shuffle 123
123
123
123 132
132
132
132
132 213
213
213
213
213 231
231
231
231
231 312
312
312
312 321
321
321
321 123 132 213 231 312 321
You can plainly see how some of the deck combinations appear unevenly in the 27 results of the naïve algorithm .
Stated mathematically , 27 is not evenly divisible by six .
Enough theory .
Let 's see more results .
How about a four card deck , shuffled 600,000 times ?
600,000 divided by 24 is 25,000 ; that 's almost exactly what we see right down the line for every possible combination of cards with the KFY shuffle algorithm .
The naïve algorithm , in comparison , is all over the map .
It gets worse with larger decks .
Here 's the same comparison for a six card deck .
With a 6 card deck , the differences between the two algorithms grow even larger .
The math , yet again , explains why .
6 ! = 720 66 = 46,656
With 46,656 paths to only 720 real world outputs , it 's inevitable that some of those paths will be severely over - represented or under - represented in the output .
And are they ever .
If you shipped a real card game with a naïve shuffle , you 'd have some serious exploits to deal with .
I know this may seem like remedial math to some of you , but I found this result strikingly counterintuitive .
I had a very difficult time understanding why the naïve shuffle algorithm , which is barely different from the KFY shuffle algorithm , produces such terribly incorrect results in practice .
It 's a minute difference in the code , but a profound difference in results .
Tracing through all the permutations and processing the statistics helped me understand why it was wrong .
Naïve implementations are often preferred to complex ones .
Simplicity is a virtue .
It 's better to be simple , slow , and understandable than complex , fast , and difficult to grasp .
Or at least it usually is .
Sometimes , as we 've seen here with our shuffling example , the simplicity of the naïve implementation can mislead .
It is possible for the code to be both simple and wrong .
I suppose the real lesson lies in testing .
No matter how simple your code may be , there 's no substitute for testing it to make sure it 's actually doing what you think it is .
But I ’ve decided to select the impact which globalization is having on our society as the most important , the most formative event of 2007 .
The continued shelling of Israeli towns and rural communities near Gaza by Hamas could have been a natural choice for the most significant event in Israel in 2007 .
No less important and with far - reaching ramifications for the future of this country was the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , which recently stated that Iran had halted its military nuclear program in 2003 .
These events have generated the lion 's share of local and international media .
Almost like in a Pavlovian experience , Israel is always identified with and seen through the magnifying glass of foreign and security affairs .
Globalization ’s influence on Israel is rarely mentioned in the international media but is of great interest to the Israeli public – far more than Iran or the troubles with the Palestinians .
The trends of globalization - the taking over of state assets by Israel 's " Robber Barons " , the widening gap between rich and poor and the widespread corruption at all levels of society - are affecting our daily life for the worse .
The results are that Israeli society has changed beyond recognition .
Israel was once a role model , one of the world ’s most advanced and sophisticated social democracies , proud of its modern welfare system and trying to maintain as equal and just a society as possible .
The kibbutz — a rural community guided by the principle that each receives according to his needs and give back to society according to his abilities — was the jewel in Israel ’s crown .
Today , the idea of the kibbutz is dying .
Israel now worships the golden calf of the free market : privatization and sink - or - swim competition , what British Prime Minster Edward Heath once called the “ ugly face of capitalism . ”
The country ’s economy is under the influence of a handful of families who , like robber barons , rob public assets , utilities and national resources , all with the help of corrupt officials and ministers .
To understand how the country ’s wealth is concentrated in few hands , one has to read the Israeli business daily The Marker .
The paper estimated the accumulated wealth of the 500 richest people in the country to be around 300 billion shekels ( US $ 75 billion ) .
By contrast , Israel ’s GDP is 567 billion shekels ( US $ 130 billion ) .
Israel is now on the Top Ten list of nations with the widest socio-economic gap .
Pensions have been reduced .
Social security benefits have been cut .
In 2005 - 7 , Israel produced more millionaires per capita than any other country .
But it also pushed more people back beneath the poverty line than any other western nation in the last decade .
Israel ’s Social Security Institute defines the poverty line as an income of 1,744 shekels ( US$ 400 ) per month per individual , or 4,361 shekels ( US $ 1100 ) per family of four .
One and half million people , or 20 percent of the population , live under the poverty line .
That means that thirty - four percent of Israeli children live in poverty .
Fewer and fewer financial resources are allocated to public education , health , transportation and infrastructure .
More and more go to the wealthy through tax cuts and other benefits aimed to protect capital gains .
Israel is still a vital democracy , but it is a democracy in decay .
The champions of social justice and rational distribution of national wealth – the fighters of corruption – struggle to swim upstream .
Israel in 2007 has further lost its old ideals and its soul .
As presidential candidates and government policymakers rush to offer prescriptions for the deteriorating U.S. economy , some are beginning to worry about a disturbing possibility :
This may not be your traditional downturn .
And the tools that helped restore prosperity in the past may prove less effective this time around .
Cyclical downturns , including recessions , have long been a feature of the nation ’s economic landscape after periods of sustained growth .
So has one of the most popular antidotes : a fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts or higher government spending .
Today , public figures as diverse as Hillary Rodham Clinton , a Democratic presidential contender , and Martin Feldstein , a Reagan administration advisor and conservative Harvard economist , are proposing just that remedy for the current problem : stimulus packages of $ 50 billion to more than $ 100 billion .
But such proposals are designed for normal downturns , in which the fundamental problem is that the economy has stalled because consumers have run out of steam or because policymakers have made a mistake , stomping too hard on the economic brakes .
Under such circumstances , pumping money into the economy gets it moving again .
Advertisement
In the current downturn , something more unsettling than a traditional swing in the business cycle appears to be at work :
The United States has become increasingly prone to financial bubbles -- huge , seemingly irreversible rises in the value of one sort of asset or another , followed by sudden and largely unforeseen plunges .
What makes bubbles so dangerous is that their consequences , when they burst , are wider , often more damaging , and certainly more unpredictable than those of ordinary downturns .
“ We are more prone to bubbles than we used to be , ” said John H. Makin , a former senior Treasury official with several Republican administrations and now a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
“ The old - fashioned recession , where the consumer ran out of gas or there was an economic policy mistake , does n’t seem to occur much anymore , ” said Alice M. Rivlin , a former vice chair of the Federal Reserve and Clinton administration budget director .
“ As we ’ve seen from recent events , bubbles seem to be playing a bigger role . ”
Advertisement
Economists such as Rivlin and Makin do not necessarily oppose traditional stimulus proposals .
“ When there ’s a flood , I ’m not against throwing in sandbags , ” Makin said .
“ It ’s not going to solve the problem .
It ’s not going to reverse it .
It might mitigate it . ”
But the overriding requirement , they say , is that economists and policymakers need to develop ways to identify potential bubbles , discourage them from growing , and limit the economic carnage if they do .
Analysts trace the economy ’s growing propensity to develop bubbles to an unusual chain of events .
Since the early 1980s , increasingly effective Fed policymaking , coupled with financial innovations such as the expansion of credit cards , home - equity loans and exotic security derivatives , helped shrink large - scale fluctuations in the economy in what economists call the Great Moderation .

Inflation and unemployment fell .
Growth of the gross domestic product and employment steadied .
In addition , technological advances and new management techniques such as just - in - time inventory practices all but removed the mismatches of supply and demand that prompted employers to shrink production and employment , periodically setting off downward spirals .
Also , policymakers abolished many of the financial regulations that had grown up after the Great Depression .
And with many other countries growing more prosperous too after the Cold War , investment capital flowed into the United States , making funds available to borrow for almost any purpose .
This run of good news set off a near - two - decade bull market in U.S. stocks and allowed the nation ’s economy to boom as it had n’t since the 1960s .
But it also prompted a new generation of financial engineers to forget the lessons of the past and replace old and diminishing risks with new and even larger ones .
Advertisement
The invention of sub - prime mortgages , which have been at the center of the current crisis , is just one example .
“ We ’ve had a lot of financial innovation over the last several decades , and it may be that some aspects of it have made the economy more prone to bubbles , ” said Douglas W. Elmendorf , a former Fed economist now with the centrist Brookings Institution in Washington .
“ A lot of clever people thought they could make [ big ] bets and lay off the most serious risks on somebody else -- and they were wrong , ” said J. Bradford DeLong , a former Clinton administration Treasury official and a UC Berkeley economic historian .
This combination of factors has resulted in a series of bubbles that repeatedly played havoc with the economy .
The run-up in value of mortgage - backed securities and houses , followed by their abrupt fall back to earth , are at the center of many of the economy ’s current woes .

Earlier , stocks in high - tech companies went through a boom and bust that helped bring on the recession of the early 2000s .
Before that , a regional real - estate bubble , fueled in part by the savings - and - loan fiasco , is widely thought to have contributed to the recession of the early 1990s .
In focusing on identifying incipient bubbles and trying to prevent them , as suggested by Makin and Rivlin , the political and policy worlds will be making a substantial shift .
Until now , the conventional wisdom has been that bubbles could not be identified except in hindsight and that policymakers should not try .
That view was given broad currency by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as an explanation for the Fed ’s inaction during the 1990s stock boom .
After tentatively suggesting in 1996 that stock prices were exhibiting “ irrational exuberance , ” Greenspan opposed any effort to tamp down the market , saying that productivity was growing so rapidly that many of the old reasons for concern no longer applied .
But Greenspan ’s theory has become increasingly hard to maintain in the wake of what has happened in housing .
The growth of the housing bubble is clear in a chart published by Yale economist Robert J. Shiller in 2006 .
It contains an index of U.S. housing prices going back to 1890 .
The chart , which set the 1890 benchmark at 100 , showed that prices fell only about 30 index points during the Great Depression and rose only about 40 points during the giant postwar housing boom .
In the decade after the late 1990s , however , the index jumped 100 points .
Advertisement
“ If I were the Fed , I ’d think twice about continuing to say we ca n’t identify bubbles , ” Makin said .
Given the threat now posed by sagging house prices , the sub - prime mess and a more general financial constriction , “ we ’d better work harder learning how to identify bubbles and preempt them . ”
One suggestion : an independent board similar to the Business Cycle Dating Committee , which decides when recessions occur , to investigate when the prices of key assets appear to be going off the charts and to issue public warnings .
“ The group ’s job would be to put out an indicator of ‘ bubbleness ’ to tell us when prices look unsustainable , ” Rivlin said .
Some analysts argue that bubbles are simply the price of an innovative economy and one worth bearing , a case that House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) describes this way : “ We ’re more prone to bubbles , but less prone to severe recessions . ”
Advertisement
The problem , as Frank is quick to point out , is that bursting bubbles have a nasty habit of getting out of hand .
Both the Fed and the Treasury have repeatedly underestimated the dimensions of the housing and sub - prime crises , announcing they were contained only to watch them reemerge and threaten a crippling financial freeze - up .
The two agencies ’ efforts to come up with solutions have produced at best modest results .
The Treasury tried to orchestrate a privately financed fund of $ 100 billion to help exotic “ special investment vehicles , ” for example .
But the big banks that would have benefited found that almost no one would contribute , so the effort was dropped .
Meanwhile , the Fed ’s efforts to deal with liquidity problems failed to address more serious solvency problems tied to the rising probability of home - value losses exceeding $ 3 trillion .
Advertisement
In such circumstances , Frank said , the real solution -- with or without a stimulus -- is to try to prevent future bubbles by “ reasonable re-regulation . ”
“ We ’ve done the innovation of the financial system , but we ’ve never done the innovation of the financial regulations , ” he said .
Operating largely unfettered by the government , the private sector ’s risk management has not spread or reduced risk .
It ’s a danger that Frank and others have warned about repeatedly in recent years , but they were largely ignored .
Frank is scheduled to deliver a speech on the subject Monday at Harvard .
The title is “ We Told You So . ”

If you ’re one of the people who spend most of their reading time skimming through Client and Server Side Coding articles , then you probably should read this article .
Yes , you : the one with your code open full - screen in the other monitor .
I ’m a designer and I work at a hosting / ISP company in a room with four very talented Web programmers .
Together , they can develop just about any kind of application , but not one of them could develop a harmonious color scheme if his life depended on it .
Color selection for Website design is a topic that ’s been approached from many different angles .
Some people approach it from a usability standpoint , explaining how to ensure readability and cross-platform compatibility .
Some well - meaning people try to explain that design is all about feelings , describing colors with such hallucinatory delineations as happiness , energy , and stability .
Others come to the table with advertising concerns like , " Yellow means cheap , green means money , and black may mean elegance , or maybe … death ! "
Have you ever wondered where designers get that mystical ability to say whether a color is or is not " working " ?
While it ’s true that sea - foam green does n’t make a good accent for a palette of primary colors , nobody really explains why .
Just like having a knack for programming concepts , some natural ability can be advantageous when you ’re working with color , but most of the skills can be gained from a basic understanding of color theory .
Armed with a little knowledge and a few safe rules of thumb , you ’ll be more dangerous with a palette than a card - counter at a poker table .
The Painter ’s Best Friend
To begin to understand color , you ’ll have to think like a painter .
Now , do n’t go out and start throwing paint around like Jackson Pollack ; I mean simply that you need to think in terms of red , yellow , and blue .
When you ’re working with your beloved computer , colors are displayed in percentages of RGB ( red , green , and blue ) light using an additive method .
This means that , as more of each color is added , you get closer to white light .
In contrast — no pun intended — painters use a subtractive color method .
So , by asking you to think like a painter , I really mean that I want you to think about colors as combinations of red , yellow , and blue , and to realize that , as you add colors , you get closer to black .
Being a master painter , your most critical tool for mixing colors is your understanding of the simple color wheel shown here .
The black triangle that I placed in the center points out the primary colors .
If you mix two primary colors , you will get the secondary color that ’s pointed out by the lighter gray triangle .
When you mix a primary with either of its closest secondary colors , you get a tertiary color ; these are located between the points of the black and gray triangles .
With this painterly understanding of the color wheel , grasping the concepts of color theory will be a snap .
Color Schemes
When I mentioned my programmer friends , and how they could n’t create a harmonious set of colors , I was talking about color schemes .
There are three main sets of color schemes : analogous , complimentary , and monochromatic .
Analogous
Analogous colors are those that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel .
If you pick any range of colors between two points of either triangle on our color wheel ( ie yellow to red , orange to violet , red to blue , etc ) , you will have an analogous color scheme .
While I was taking an introductory design class at UCF , we were given a still life , and one class period to paint it using whatever color scheme we were studying .
Risking public ridicule in the interest of avoiding copyright infringement , I ’ll use these as my color scheme examples .
This still - life has an analogous color scheme achieved by mixing only yellow and blue acrylic paint .
Try checking out the links below to see some examples of analogous color schemes in action .
http://www.zeldman.com – Jeffery Zeldman presents … a very limited analogous color scheme .
It ’s certainly not complimentary , as none of the colors are positioned opposite one another on our color wheel .
Notice that he only really uses two colors in his design , and only two or three tints / shades of each color .
Using a limited color palette is a great idea , as long as the colors fall into a strict color theme .
Depending on how you pull it off , this will usually produce a crisp , fresh feel .
http://www.jasonsantamaria.com?
– Jason Santa Maria ’s classic book cover design is another great example of an analogous color scheme .
Notice that every bit of color on his site falls within one third of our color wheel .
http://www.gorillaglue.com
–
I ’m wondering how a company that sells glue has such a flashy , fun Website … but you ’ll notice as you play with the gorilla menu that all of the color on the site ranges from yellow , through orange , to a dark red .
Complementary
Complementary color schemes consist of colors that are located opposite each other on the color wheel , such as green and red , yellow and violet , or orange and blue .
These colors are said to complement one another .
When placed next to each other , a phenomenon known as simultaneous contrast occurs , wherein each color makes the other look more vibrant .
There are two pitfalls to avoid when using complimentary schemes :
If you place complementary colors on top of one another , this creates an illusion of movement .
This is really bad for text .
Have you ever tried to read violet text on a yellow background ?
Trust me : it ’s not pretty .
Also , colors like cyan and red , which are not quite directly across from each other , yet are not close enough to be analogous , will clash rather than complement .
These colors are known as discordants .
Unless you want to promote discord among your visitors , I suggest that you do n’t use these combinations in your projects .
Complementary color schemes are often more complex than simply using two colors from opposite sides of the color wheel .
A double - complementary color scheme , for instance , is one in which two complementary color sets are used in a single theme .
Similarly , a split complimentary theme is one in which a color is paired with the two colors adjacent to its compliment .
For instance , if you wanted to create a split - complimentary theme using the colors on our color wheel , you would first select a color you want to use , like yellow .
Then , you ’d choose the dark blue and pink that are adjacent to yellow ’s complement , violet .
Here are a few solid examples of complementary color schemes :
http://www.ufl.edu
– The University of Florida has been widely acclaimed for its recent XHTML redesign .
It ’s also a great example of a complementary color scheme .
Take note that although orange and blue are the main design colors , you do n’t really see them overlapping much â€ “ this would cause that whole movement illusion thing we discussed earlier .
http://www.modestmousemusic.com – Modest Mouse is another example of a pure complementary color scheme .
It ’s also one of the few sites I ’ve ever seen that ’s been able to pull off a green and pink color scheme .
http://www.panera.com
– Panera Bread offers an interesting example of a complimentary color scheme .
You can clearly see the double - complementary action with the green to red and the orange to blue relationships on the page .
Monochromatic
If you mix white with a pure color , you produce tints of that color .
If you mix black with a pure color , you get shades of that color .
So , what do you get if you create an image using only the tints and shades of one color ?
A monochromatic color scheme .
This example is yet another of color - theme based still life , and consists of only tints and shades of the color orange .
Here are a few examples of monochromatic color schemed sites :
http://www.target.com
– Target is the textbook definition of a monochromatic color scheme .
Everything is red , white , black , and combinations thereof .
On the homepage , it looks like they even avoid using photos that do n’t fall in this scheme .
Now that ’s design dedication !
http://www.macromedia.com – Macromedia has a similar idea with its teal gradient color scheme .
It , too , is strategically using images to tie together the look on the homepage .
http://www.yakima.com – Yakima does a terrific job of using multiple monochromatic schemes .
Each of the main navigational pages has an orange , blue , or green monochromatic scheme .
There are many variations of these three color schemes , and much research has gone into defining scientific methodologies for the coordination of colors , but these are the foundation principles .
The best advice I have for developing an eye for color is : keep your eyes open .
If you see a Website , advertisement , or illustration that really stands out , ask yourself what type of color scheme it uses .
Like analyzing a block of code , knowing the syntax of the language of color is a great start for understanding its purpose .
Hopefully you will find this information useful in choosing colors for your next Web application , or perhaps even as an introduction to your newfound painting hobby !
Remember , the color wheel is your friend .
You might even consider going out and buying a revolving plastic one from your local art supply store to keep on your desk .
At the very minimum you should be able to impress the designer (s ) in your department when you define for them the color scheme they used on their latest design comp .
Just remember : coders can use color , too .
But eventually the epinephrine and norepinephrine cannot stimulate the heart enough to meet the demands for blood .
The brain responds by releasing more and more of those fight or flight hormones until it is releasing them all the time .
At that point , the calcium channels in heart muscle are overstimulated and start to leak .
When they understood the mechanisms , the researchers developed a class of experimental drugs that block the leaks in calcium channels in the heart muscle .
The drugs were originally created to block cells ’ calcium channels , a way of lowering blood pressure .
Image Credit ... Chang W. Lee / The New York Times
Dr. Marks and his colleagues altered the drugs to make them less toxic and to rid them of their ability to block calcium channels .
They were left with drugs that stopped calcium leaks .
The investigators called the drugs rycals , because they attach to the ryanodine receptor / calcium release channel in heart muscle cells .
The investigators tested rycals in mice and found that they could prevent heart failure and arrhythmias in the animals .
Columbia obtained a patent for the drugs and licensed them to a start - up company , Armgo Pharma of New York .
Dr. Marks is a consultant to the company .
It hopes to start testing one of the drugs for safety in patients in the spring , but the tests will not be at Columbia because of the university and investigators ’ conflicts of interest .
In the meantime , Dr. Marks wondered whether the mechanism he discovered might apply to skeletal muscle as well as heart muscle .
Skeletal muscle is similar to heart muscle , he noted , and has the same calcium channel system .
And heart failure patients complain that their muscles are extremely weak .
“ If you go to the hospital and ask heart failure patients what is bothering them , they do n’t say their heart is weak , ” Dr. Marks said .
“ They say they are weak . ”
So he and his colleagues looked at making mice exercise to exhaustion , swimming and then running on a treadmill .
The calcium channels in their skeletal muscles became leaky , the investigators found .
And when they gave the mice their experimental drug , the animals could run 10 to 20 percent longer .

Democrats won the 2006 election largely thanks to public disgust with the Iraq war .
But polls  and Hillary Clinton ’s big victory in Ohio  suggest that if the Democrats want to win this year , they have to focus on economic anxiety .
Some people reject that idea .
They believe that this election should be another referendum on the war , and , perhaps even more important , about the way America was misled into that war .
That belief is one reason many progressives fervently support Barack Obama , an early war opponent , even though his domestic platform is somewhat to the right of Mrs. Clinton’s .
As an early war opponent myself , I understand their feelings .
But should and ought do n’t win elections .
And polls show that the economy has overtaken Iraq as the public ’s biggest concern .
True , the news from Iraq will probably turn worse again .
Meanwhile , a hefty majority of voters continue to say that the war was a mistake , and people are as angry as ever about the $ 10 billion a month wasted on the neocons ’ folly .

But just how hi def will YouTube go to keep video streaming instantly and a bit of bandwidth coin left in Google 's pockets ?
Above is an example of a precompressed 960x540 video ( not even HD ) at 6000 kbit /s that 's been snuck onto YouTube servers .

It 's a lot sharper than their 320x240 video standard , but the bitrate is obnoxious for the resolution , and you 'll notice that it has a tough time streaming .
Of course , these problems are exactly what Google is trying to eliminate before rolling the service out .

Britain acknowledged today for the first time that US planes on " extraordinary rendition " flights stopped on British soil twice .
The admission came from the foreign secretary , David Miliband , who apologised to MPs for incorrect information given by his predecessor , Jack Straw , and the former prime minister Tony Blair .
Miliband said the government had recently received information from Washington that two flights - one to Guantánamo Bay and one to Morocco – had stopped over at Diego Garcia , the British overseas territory in the Indian Ocean .
Each plane carried a single terror suspect and neither of the men had been tortured , the CIA said .
" Contrary to earlier explicit assurances that Diego Garcia had not been used for rendition flights , recent US investigations have now revealed two occasions , both in 2002 , when this had in fact occurred , " Miliband told MPs .
He said he had discussed the issue with the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice .
" We both agree that the mistakes made in these two cases are not acceptable , and she shares my deep regret that this information has only just come to light , " Miliband said .
Gordon Brown , speaking in Brussels , said he shared " the disappointment that everybody has " about the rendition flights issue .
The prime minister told reporters : " We have just been informed by the United States of America about what has actually happened .
The US has expressed regret for us not knowing about this issue .
We share the disappointment that everybody has about what 's actually happened . "
There have been long - standing suspicions that the CIA has used one of its so - called black site prisons on Diego Garcia , which is home to a large US military base , to hold suspects , although Miliband today assured MPs that no US detainees had ever been held on Diego Garcia .
Miliband has been told by the US that neither of the men in the rendition flight to Diego Garcia was British .
One is currently in Guantánamo Bay and the other has been released .
The foreign secretary said an " error in the earlier US records search meant that these cases did not come to light " .
The director of the CIA , Michael Hayden , acknowledged the agency had made a " mistake " in failing to establish the proper nature of the flights .
" The refuelling , conducted more than five years ago , lasted just a short time .
But it happened , " he told the Associated Press .
" That we found this mistake ourselves , and that we brought it to the attention of the British government , in no way changes or excuses the reality that we were in the wrong .
An important part of intelligence work , inherently urgent , complex and uncertain , is to take responsibility for errors and to learn from them . "
Reprieve , a legal charity that represents a number of detainees at Guantánamo Bay , has in the past accused the government of cooperating with the US on extraordinary rendition – the practice of seizing terrorism suspects and interrogating them on non-US territory .
The US president , George Bush , acknowledged in September 2006 the existence of the CIA 's black site prisons .
He said al - Qaida suspects or members of the Taliban who " withhold information that could save American lives " had been taken " to an environment where they can be held secretly , questioned by experts " .
Bush did not disclose the location of any prison , but suspicion has been growing for years that one may have been located on Diego Garcia , around 1,000 miles off Sri Lanka 's southern coast .
The 2,000 islanders were expelled in the early 1970s after the British government struck a secret deal to lease the 37 - mile - long island to the US military .
Barry McCaffrey , a retired four - star US general who is a professor of international security studies at the West Point military academy , has twice spoken publicly about the use of Diego Garcia as a detention centre for suspects .
In May 2004 , he said : " We 're probably holding around 3,000 people , you know , Bagram airfield , Diego Garcia , Guantánamo , 16 camps throughout Iraq . "
In December last year he repeated the claim .
The registration number of a Gulfstream executive jet has been linked to several CIA prisoner operations that flew from Washington to Diego Garcia , via Athens , on September 11 2002 , soon after the capture of Ramzi Binalshibh , a suspected planner of the September 11 attacks .
A European investigator said last year he had proof that Poland and Romania hosted secret prisons for the CIA in which it interrogated top al - Qaida suspects using methods akin to torture .
British police said they had found no evidence to support claims that CIA planes transporting terrorism suspects to face possible torture in secret prisons in Europe had landed illegally at British airports .
How many different ways can Paul tell us how he really feels about McCain 's foreign policy ?
It does n't look like Ron Paul is going to endorse McCain anytime soon .
Republican Rep. Ron Paul told the Tribune this morning he will not back Sen.
John McCain as his party 's nominee unless the Arizona senator " has a lot of change of heart . "
I can not support anybody with the foreign policy he advocates , you know , perpetual war .
That is just so disturbing to me , " Paul said .
" I think it 's un-American , un-Constitutional , immoral , and not Republican . "
Since McCain 's whole strategy is to be the biggest war hawk on the planet , I doubt he 'll have that change of heart .
If anything , he 'll start talking more about Iran .
Howie wondered if Paul would be forced to endorse him a few days ago , but that looks highly doubtful .
Guides Nov 28 , 2007 The 2007 Good Gift Games
As long as you ’ve got two to four friends , that ’s all you need for a fun afternoon of playing board games .
Oh , except for a board game that ’s actually fun .
Presenting this year ’s crop of games even sore losers will enjoy .
Growing up , I never had difficulty selecting Christmas presents for my sister .
I would simply pick out something I wanted , give it to her as a gift , and reclaim it shortly thereafter .
Oh , you should have seen the look of what I can only assume was elation when she opened the Land of the Jawas Action Playset in 1979 , and the Van Halen ’s Diver Down LP in 1982 .
It ’s harder to pull this stunt as an adult , alas , as my wife tumbled to all my crafty stratagems about a decade ago .
I do n’t think she was fooled last year when I gave her a Nintendo Wii and a subscription to Details .
Of course , the worst gift recipients are friends , as they are wont to whisk the presents you give them away to their own homes , the ingrates .
And then what do you have to show for your gift giving ?
An ephemeral warm feeling of beneficence , I guess .
But that ’s no Land of the Jawas Action Playset , let me tell you .
That ’s why I give my acquaintances board games .
Doing so strengthens the sacred bonds of friendships between us — and makes it likely that they will invite me over to play the very gift I gave them .
Yes !
In your face , altruism !
Of course , this only works if they actually like the game they receive .
That ’s why , every year , I keep an eye out for Good Gift Games ( G3s ) , titles that even those who do n’t typically play games will love playing .
Easy to learn , with rules that can be explained in less than five minutes
Entertaining enough that even the guy who comes in dead last has a great time playing
Quick , lacking downtime , and requiring an hour or less to complete
And so , without further ado , here are the games that those nearest and dearest to my heart can expect to receive from me this year .
Tuesday and Saturday evenings work best for me .
Zooloretto
Rio Grande Games , 2 to 5 players , 45 minutes , $ 45
Congratulations on your new zoo !
Now all you need to do is rustle up some animals .
Not to fear :
Trucks bearing kangaroos , flamingos , gorillas , and five other types of fauna are yours for the taking .
In fact , your problem is n’t lack of animals , but too many of them ; if you ca n’t fit all the critters into your enclosures , the remainders are relegated to the barn , and will count as negative points at the end of the game .
Complicating all this are your opponents , who will be more than happy to lob elephants your way — doubly so if you have nowhere to put them .
Zooloretto recently won the Spiel Des Jahres ( Game of the Year award ) , and it is routinely cited as the family game to get for 2007 .
Plus , it ’s got baby panda bears .
I mean , come on : baby pandas .
That should seal the deal right there .

Ca n’t Stop
Face 2 Face Games , 2 to 4 players , 30 minutes , $ 30
Roll four dice and group them into scoring combinations .
Every time you succeed , you advance your markers on the board and are given the opportunity to roll again .
You can call it quits at any time and “ bank ” your progress , but a roll that produces no combinations voids everything you earned during the turn .
That ’s Ca n’t Stop , a game that has long been considered amongst the best of the “ push - your - luck ” breed .
And yet , despite selling well upon its release in 1980 , Ca n’t Stop was inexplicably out of print in the U.S. for some 20 years .
Three cheers for Face 2 Face Games , which has finally reprinted this classic .
Snap up a copy before it disappears for another generation .

Mr. Jack
Asmodee Editions , 2 players , 30 minutes , $ 37
There ’s no shortage of games that replicate the formula of Monopoly ( make money ! ) and Risk ( wage war ! ) .
But few have gone the route of Clue , challenging players to unmask a killer via deductive reasoning .
Thankfully , Mr. Jack is picking up the slack .
Eight characters — ranging from Sherlock Holmes to Sir William Gull — wander the streets of Whitecastle ; one of them is secretly Jack the Ripper .
The Jack player knows the identity of the fiend , and works to keep it concealed ; the detective strives to apprehend the criminal by game ’s end .
Simple , brief , and ingenious , it ’s a perfect pastime for anyone who enjoys a good mystery .

Qwirkle
Mindware , 2 to 4 players , 45 minutes , $ 25
Cognizant that some folks refuse to play anything that does n’t resemble Scrabble , I always try and include a word game on this annual list .
Sadly , 2007 was n’t a great year for that particular genre .
Fortunately , the basic idea of Qwirkle will be familiar to your favorite Scrabbaholic , even if it does n’t involve letters or words .
Place tiles on the table to create rows and columns of matching shapes or matching colors ; the more previously placed tiles you incorporate into your play , the more points you score .
A fun and beautiful game , well - suited for families and couples .

Thebes
Rio Grande Games , 2 to 4 players , 90 minutes , $ 50
Thebes is a smidge weightier than the other games on this list , but worth the extra effort to learn .
Players divide their time between Europe , where they conduct research and listen for rumors of fabled riches , and the Mediterranean , where they excavate archeological sites in search of treasure .
In a novel twist , time is literally money in Thebes : Each player is given 52 weeks at the start of a year - long round , and must decide how to best spend them amongst study , travel , digging up artifacts , and putting on exhibits .
Ironic , that a game stressing the importance of doing your homework could be such a blast .
Goes great with a fedora and the Raiders of the Lost Ark soundtrack .

Heroscape Marvel : The Conflict Begins
Hasbro , 2 or more players , 45 minutes , $ 35
Sure , strategy is fun , but sometimes what you want in a game is muscle - bound superheroes beating the crap out of one another .
Enter Heroscape Marvel : The Conflict Begins .
Pit heroes against their arch - enemies , settle the “ who would win in a fight , Spider - Man or Captain America ” debate once and for all , or just let everyone brawl in a battle royale — the system accommodates pretty much any scenario you can envision , as long as it involves punching .
Plus , you can combine this set with the original Heroscape game and have the Hulk fight robots and dragons .
OMG , nerdgasm ! ( more info )
Bull in a China Shop
Playroom Entertainment , 3 to 5 players , 30 minutes , $ 10
Buy china and put it in your shop .
But the only way to buy china is with money .
And only way to make money is by letting bulls loose in your shop — where they inevitably break the china .
Bull in a China Shop features a bizarre economic model , I admit — though perhaps no more than the subprime mortgage industry .
Still , with crafty maneuvering and a bit of luck you can still come out ahead .
Named 2007 ’s “ Best Family Card Game ” by GAMES magazine .

Factory Fun
Cwali , 2 to 4 players , 45 minutes , $ 42
For a while there in the early ‘ 90s , I was hopelessly addicted to a series of computer games called The Incredible Machine , where you used contraptions ( ramps , conveyor belts , cannons , and more ) to get a ball from one side of the screen to the other .
Thoughts of this game were summoned when I first played Factory Fun , which evokes the same excitement and satisfaction of tackling and solving mechanical puzzles .
In this case you are trying to produce a product called Black from four raw materials : Yellow , Blue , Red , and Brown .
You do this by placing an assortment of machines into your factory , each of which has some specialized function .
Some people view these types of games as more work than fun , but I find them as engrossing as Sudoku . ( more info )
Wings of War
Fantasy Flight Games , 2 - 4 players , 20 minutes , $ 30
OK , totally cheating on this one .
Released in 2004 , the original edition of Wings of War ( Famous Aces ) featured WWI biplanes printed onto cards , which instantly transformed any playing surface into a battlefield .
But if the game is three years old , how can I justify weaseling it onto the 2007 list ?
I ’m glad you asked .
Simple , innovative , and loads of fun , Wings of War spawned a number of sequels and supplements — and the best one yet ( Miniatures ! ) was released this fall .
Now your dogfights can take place above your kitchen table rather than on it , as the 1/144 - scale model planes duke it for aerial supremacy .

Chateau Roquefort
Rio Grande Games , 2 to 4 players , 30 minutes , $ 50
You know : for kids !
Players race their mice around a castle , seeking the cheese hidden therein .
But Chateau Roquefort is the world ’s largest mousetrap ; players can shift the floors , dropping their opponent ’s unsuspecting rodents into the castle ’s dungeon to ( I like to imagine ) meet a ghastly end .
Yay !
Having once lived in a house infested with mice , I ’m a big proponent of games that teach children to snuff out the little bastards .
But do n’t buy it for the edutainment value alone , buy it because it ’s super cute and loads of fun .

So where do you find these wonderful toys ?
Well , in the last year or so , specialty game stores here in Seattle have been cropping up like fungus after a rain .
Maybe that ’s true of your hometown as well : Plug its name into Google Maps , search for “ games , ” and see what you get .
If the brick - and - mortar route fails you , there ’s always the online option .
Check out Funagain Games , Boulder Games , Boards & Bits , Gamefest , and Amazon , to name a few .
Have fun , and happy holidays !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Utility Southern California Edison said on Thursday it would spend $ 875 million to build a network of 250 megawatts of photovoltaic solar power generation , making it the biggest solar cell project in the nation .
SCE , a subsidiary of Edison International , said the photovoltaic cells on 65 million square feet of rooftops in southern California would generate enough power to serve 162,000 homes .
The project , which was submitted to state regulators for approval , is an effort to meet the state ’s mandate that 20 percent of California ’s electricity be generated from renewable sources by 2010 .
Utilities and power companies are increasing their portfolios of renewable energy to meet ever - increasing state demands to help reduce their output of carbon , the greenhouse gas blamed for contributing to rising global temperatures .
At 250 megawatts , the installation would be about half the size of the newest coal or natural gas - fired power generation units .
So far , companies behind the largest solar projects have favored solar thermal technology , in which parabolic mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to heat a liquid that drives a power - generating turbine .
Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight directly into electricity inside the solar cells .
On Wednesday , FPL Group Inc , the nation ’s largest generator of wind and solar power , announced it planned to build a 250 - megawatt thermal solar plant in California ’s Mojave Desert .
SCE said its new photovoltaic project was possible because recent advances had cut in half the traditional cost of installed solar generation in California .
The utility plans to begin installing the solar arrays immediately on to the rooftops of commercial buildings in southern California ’s Inland Empire , San Bernardino and Riverside counties .
“ These new solar stations , which we will be installing at a rate of one megawatt a week , will provide a new source of clean energy directly in the fast - growing regions where we need it most , ” Edison International Chairman and Chief Executive John Bryson said in a statement .
Hello all you twenty somethings out there .
The cost of first building and then updating fabrication facilities has forced a number of semiconductor companies that once owned their own foundries to pursue asset light fabless strategies .
A fabless semiconductor company develops its own technology and chip designs , but pays a separate , dedicated fabrication facility , such as TSMC , UMC , or Chartered , to produce the chips .
The fabless approach has saved integrated circuit ( IC ) design companies a great deal of money , but it has also enabled the rise of a thriving black market in counterfeit chips .
Computer engineers at the University of Michigan and Rice University think they may have the solution to this problem and have designed a hardware lock that could be built into each IC and activated by the IP holder .
According to the engineers who developed the new lock , the rise in IC design piracy is attributable to several factors .
Intellectual property rights are often loosely defined in Asian countries , and enforcement policies can be lax .
Theft is also an issue and can range from employees pocketing supposedly bad processors to fabrication firms allowing " unauthorized " manufacturers access to a client 's masks .
At this point , there is no simple way to change a hardware design to fight piracy , and current anti-theft technologies are inadequate to the task at hand .
The EPIC ( End Piracy of Integrated Circuits ) technique is designed to change all this .
EPIC uses public - key cryptography system , in which the IP holder generates a pair of Master Keys , one public , one private .
Each IC is engineered with its own true random number generator ( TRNG ) and support for public - key cryptography ; knowledge of the public Master Key ( MK - Pub ) is also baked into the chip .
Once the circuit 's original logic is properly connected to EPIC , a randomly - generated Common Key will be created .
This key is communicated to the IP holder and then erased .
The chip is then packaged and ready for activation .
At power - up , the chip generates a private and public Random Chip Key ( RCK - Pri and RCK - Pub ) , both of which are burned into a set of electrically - programmed fuses .
The fab would then send the new IC 's RCK - Pub to the owner of the IC itself .
Said owner would then transmit an Input Key back to the fab .
The Input Key corresponds to the already - communicated Common Key wrapped in a double - encryption layer consisting of the private Master Key and RCK - Pub .
Once it received the validation transmission , the chip would decrypt it using RCK - Pri and the public Master Key .
This produces the Common Key ( CK ) , unlocks the chip , and allows it to be sold .
Those of you who had trouble following the description of the process might find the following flow chart helpful .
It describes how EPIC can be integrated into an already - existing IC design without requiring any dramatic changes to chip layout .
EPIC is not insurmountable , and the paper addresses concerns that it might be breached , but its designers appear confident that the EPIC system will remain secure even in the face of considerable attack .
Additional key encryption can be incorporated at the fab level , if such is desired , and the ability to control when and how chip authentication requests are sent creates an additional obfuscation layer for chip pirates to overcome .

From the site :
The U.S. Department of Commerce ’s Economics and Statistics Administration ( ESA ) has decided to continue the economicindicators.gov website .
Featuring the economic releases from ESA ’s Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) , the site was started by this Administration in 2002 to give greater awareness to these economic statistics .
ESA initially planned to discontinue the service due to cost concerns but given the feedback ESA received , the decision has been made to continue the site and improve its functionality .
A popular feature of the site is the calendar that links directly to economic indicators on the Census and BEA websites .
By continuing the Economic Indicators ( EI ) site , the fifteen major indicators released by those bureaus will still be listed , along with links to the full text of each release .
EI ’s information will continue to be provided free of charge .
Many users also subscribe to the site and have economic indicators and the full releases emailed to them .
There are a number of technical challenges with this aspect of the EI site – the service often backs up and fails because of bandwidth issues , releases sometimes take hours to reach subscribers , and some subscribers receive multiple copies of the releases while others get none at all .
The cost of maintaining the site is almost entirely attributable to operating this feature .
To address these concerns we will redesign the subscription feature of economicindicators.gov .
The new system , which will remain free of charge , will email an abstract and link so that users can access the full release on the source website .
We believe the cost of rewriting the system will , in the long - run , be less than continuing to run the existing system .
The new subscription service will be operational in the next few months .
Existing subscribers of the economicindicators.gov service were offered a free trial subscription to the STAT - USA / Internet service ( http://www.stat-usa.gov).
A number of you have already signed up for that and we hope you will make full use of it .
Thank you for your responses to last week ’s notice .
We look forward to continuing to provide economic indicators , in the most efficient way possible .
If the lawyer described above had been just as charismatic but named , say , Achola Obama instead of Barack Obama , her goose would have been cooked long ago .
Indeed , neither she nor Hillary Clinton could have used Mr. Obama ’s public style  or Bill Clinton ’s either  without being considered too emotional by Washington pundits .
So why is the sex barrier not taken as seriously as the racial one ?
The reasons are as pervasive as the air we breathe : because sexism is still confused with nature as racism once was ; because anything that affects males is seen as more serious than anything that affects “ only ” the female half of the human race ; because children are still raised mostly by women ( to put it mildly ) so men especially tend to feel they are regressing to childhood when dealing with a powerful woman ; because racism stereotyped black men as more “ masculine ” for so long that some white men find their presence to be masculinity - affirming ( as long as there are n’t too many of them ) ; and because there is still no “ right ” way to be a woman in public power without being considered a you - know - what .
I ’m not advocating a competition for who has it toughest .
The caste systems of sex and race are interdependent and can only be uprooted together .
That ’s why Senators Clinton and Obama have to be careful not to let a healthy debate turn into the kind of hostility that the news media love .
Both will need a coalition of outsiders to win a general election .
The abolition and suffrage movements progressed when united and were damaged by division ; we should remember that .
I ’m supporting Senator Clinton because like Senator Obama she has community organizing experience , but she also has more years in the Senate , an unprecedented eight years of on - the - job training in the White House , no masculinity to prove , the potential to tap a huge reservoir of this country ’s talent by her example , and now even the courage to break the no-tears rule .
I ’m not opposing Mr. Obama ; if he ’s the nominee , I ’ll volunteer .
Indeed , if you look at votes during their two - year overlap in the Senate , they were the same more than 90 percent of the time .
Besides , to clean up the mess left by President Bush , we may need two terms of President Clinton and two of President Obama .
But what worries me is that he is seen as unifying by his race while she is seen as divisive by her sex .
In an editorial for The Hill , Rep. Howard Coble ( R- NC ) took aim this week at P2P file - swappers .
If the moral and legal arguments wo n't convince them to stop sharing , Coble suggests another tactic : scaring kids straight .
Identity theft , he says , is a consequence of file - swapping .
Coble 's editorial points out that one Gregory Kopiloff has pled guilty to grabbing information over Limewire and using it to commit identity theft .
Kopiloff is scheduled to be sentenced on March 17 .
While attempting to convince kids that this could happen to them ( Kopiloff 's victims " appear to have been of high school or college age " ) , Coble 's wider purpose does n't really concern identity theft at all .
His piece is titled " Share your music , lose your identity , " but , by the third paragraph , he 's already transitioning back to the " file - swapping is illegal and wrong " argument .
It 's as though he has no real faith in his premise , and most file - swappers are already aware that sharing all of your documents with the entire world is probably a bad idea .
Here 's how Kopiloff segues from the " it 's bad for you " to " it 's wrong " arguments : " This case is not the first time , however , Limewire and other peer - to - peer programs have been implicated in the deliberate theft of valuable property . "
Translation :
Your personal property is valuable , and you'd hate to have it taken , so why are copying valuable property that belongs to others without paying for it ?
From there , it 's a short skip and a jump to ISP filtering , though Coble addresses this only in the context of universities ( which , it turns out , are n't actually the hotbed of piracy the MPAA claimed ) .
He pointed to Ohio University , which instituted a total ban on P2P apps last year , and held it up as a model of responsible action .
" They responded by making leadership and personnel changes in their office of information technology , " said Coble , " filing student judicial charges against first - time offenders , and installing a technology that identifies computers engaged in sharing unauthorized copyrighted media and then disconnects them from the university network . "
While Coble touts this as an easy solution to the problem , others who have testified to Congress have pointed out that it creates an " arms race " that can be quite easily won by anyone willing to encrypt traffic .
For that reason , some schools have also taken to contacting students who exceed certain bandwidth thresholds , even if they have n't been doing anything wrong .
Fortunately , these schools are also " protecting student network users from identity thieves . "
Public Knowledge staff attorney Sherwin Siy objects to the editorial on the grounds that it equates P2P with piracy ( which everyone from NBC to Blizzard to Linux distributors to Vuze will tell you is n't true ) .
More troubling , Coble endorses
Ohio's move , which blocked an entire technology regardless of use — a draconian approach to a promising technology like BitTorrent .
" P2P is a manner of transferring data , " says Siy .
" It 's not an infringement - only protocol .
Software giants like Microsoft and Sun provide software tools for using P2P precisely because it's a good way for developers to share large files and updates . "
Coble 's view is n't surprising , but , as someone who sits on the House Subcommittee on Courts , the Internet , and Intellectual Property , one would hope for more nuance here .
Last year , though , Coble did support the content industry - backed Copyright Alliance , a group dedicated to pushing stronger IP laws through Congress , so nuance in this area may not be his defining quality .

ROCKY RIVER , Ohio  Senator John McCain said Monday that he needed to convince the American people that the troop escalation in Iraq was working and that American casualties there would continue to decline .
If he did not , he said , “ I lose ” the election .
“ Is there any doubt ? ” Mr. McCain said to reporters on his campaign bus .
But then he pulled back from his blunt assessment .
“ Let me not put it that stark , ” he said , explaining that he believed people would judge his candidacy on his ability to handle the economy , which has emerged as a pre-eminent voter concern , as well as on national security .
Nevertheless , Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , made clear that he believed his prospects in November would rest in large measure on the way the situation in Iraq played out .
“ If I may , I ’d like to retract ‘ I ’ll lose , ’ ” he said .
“ But I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that how they judge Iraq will have a direct relation to their judgment of me . ”
Summit County Republican Party Chairman Alex R. Arshinkoff has been bumped from the county 's Board of Elections after serving 30 years .
Arshinkoff , who was up for reappointment this year , was nominated by the county 's GOP , but Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , who by law approves board nominations , rejected it .
" It would be inappropriate to have him serve longer , " Brunner said .
Brunner said Arshinkoff , an old - style political boss , was running his GOP machine out of elections board offices , threatening and intimidating board workers who balked at his orders .
In a letter to Arshinkoff , she wrote : " Credible claims indicate that you have berated staff and created a hostile work environment in which board employees have endured coercion if not outright threats . "
Arshinkoff could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
But he has a right to appeal Brunner 's decision in court .
Republican state Sen. Kevin Coughlin , who is leading the first challenge to Arshinkoff 's 30 years as the county 's Republican party chairman , commended Brunner 's move .
" I think that it validates what we 've been saying , that Alex Arshinkoff is not a leader that Republicans can be proud of , " said Coughlin , of Cuyahoga Falls .
" He has abused his power .
He has abused his position .
He has abused employees at the board to strengthen his grip on the local party apparatus . "

ELEPHANTS have become such a pest in South Africa that the government wants to shoot some .
That looks like a victory for conservation , albeit a bittersweet one .
Almost 20 years ago the population of the African elephant was collapsing and the world banned the ivory trade .
If today there are enough elephants to shoot , is n't it time to rescue the rhinoceros and save the tiger and countless other endangered species , by redoubling the effort and getting the ban on trading them to work too ?
Not if you care about wildlife , it is n't .
That is partly because the story of the elephant is not all it seems , and partly because the best way to save a species is to make it valuable to people who may have other uses for the land .
Although short - term bans can give a breathing space to species in the direst straits , in the long run they will not save anything .
They may even make the situation worse .
The collapse in elephant numbers during the 1980s mostly took place in Tanzania , Zambia , Sudan and what was then Zaire .
They seem to have resumed their fall across large parts of Africa — indeed , one expert told America 's Congress this week that the illegal ivory trade is increasing .
In some parts of Africa poaching is now as bad as it ever was ( see article ) .
In Botswana and South Africa , where elephants thrive today , they thrived before a ban existed .
It is hard to argue that stopping the ivory trade has permanently transformed the elephant 's future .
Other trade bans offer an equally pessimistic lesson .
In the past few decades , the black rhino has become extinct in 18 countries where they were common , and populations have fallen fast in many others .
The message is the same with the tiger and the Yangzi river dolphin .
Even when a ban coincides with a fall in consumption , as with ivory , demand — and thus poaching — has a habit of coming back .
The idea of a ban is seductive , because it mobilises public support in rich countries and it can be shackled to a campaign to reduce demand .
Yet bans have many shortcomings .
They are vulnerable to the constant need to spend money enforcing the restrictions on trade .
Poaching is hard to control and is usually a low priority for the police and the army .
And if demand remains rampant , as with rhino horn and tiger bone , prices rise and the ban becomes a way for illegal traders to make a lot of money .
In recent years the business has increasingly involved gangs of criminals that are almost impossible to eliminate .
Better forensic techniques are helping to track down the sources of some wildlife seizures , but corruption and inertia mean that successful prosecutions are rare .
Moreover , species are dying off for many reasons — trade is not even the most important .
Wildlife is threatened by the loss of land , fragmentation of habitats , deteriorating ecosystems and invasive foreign species .
Something as blunt as a trade ban is poorly equipped to sort all of that out .
For instance , the leopard and Goffin 's cockatoo are seen as pests by local people in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indonesian island of Tanimbar .
A trade ban means that endangered animals have no value .
That encourages landowners and land users to kill the animals or to allow them to be killed or to die off through neglect .
A better policy is to make wildlife more valuable to man , not less .
One way that suits everybody is tourism .
The gorillas in the Virunga mountains of Rwanda attract a lot of money from visitors .
They are doing well , unlike their cousins over the border in Congo which do not earn their keep , and are prey to hunters who want to clear them out and take their land .
Tourism is one way to help the Indian tiger , which is much rarer than people thought .
A second , less popular way to make money is to exploit animals sustainably .
Killing individual creatures need not harm populations .
Many animals may be farmed or ranched to create a valuable legal trade .
That is what has happened with the vicuña , and with crocodiles and their kind .
Rhino horns can be cut off without even killing rhinos .
The cull of the wild
Yet the potential for sustainable exploitation is untapped .
Although governments , greens and consumers have embraced the sustainable use of resources , including wildlife , the killing of large , attractive species keeps being shelved at the meetings of CITES , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora .
Animal - welfare groups are more concerned with harm to individual animals than with the survival of entire species , so they do not want any animals killed at all .
Conservation groups worry that sustainable killing is hard to sell to their members .
A disappearing species is good for fund - raising ; blood on your hands is not .
Sustainable exploitation is not easy and it will not always work .
To start with , you need a valuable product .
You need the rule of law and government backing .
Local people must feel secure in their ownership of the animals and what they produce if they are going to put in the effort to manage and protect them .
But exploitation has a crucial edge over straight bans : it earns money .
And that is why it can save animals .
It may not sound like a classic Saturday night blow - out , but at 8 p.m. on March 29 , millions of people around the world will turn off their lights to celebrate Earth Hour .
This event , sponsored by the WWF , a global conservation organization , is intended to increase awareness of global warming and spur action to combat the issue .
The movement began last year when the WWF asked residents of Sydney , Australia , to turn off their lights for an hour .
So on March 31 , 2007 , 2.2 million people and 2,100 Sydney businesses turned off their lights .
Even icons such as the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House went dark .
Electricity in many cities and countries is powered by coal - fired plants that produce carbon dioxide , the most important greenhouse gas that human activities emit into the atmosphere .
The WWF estimates that if the greenhouse gas reduction achieved during the Sydney Earth Hour was sustained for a year , it would be equivalent to taking 48,616 cars off the road for a year .
The event has expanded this year to include cities in other countries , such as the United States , Canada , Denmark , Israel and Thailand .
Chicago will serve as the U.S. flagship city for the event , with Atlanta , Phoenix and San Francisco joining it as leading partners in the endeavor .
Individuals can sign up to participate on the Earth Hour site — so far 240,000 people have signed their support of the event .
Celebrities such as singer / songwriter Nelly Furtado and the band Fall Out Boy have pledged to turn out their lights , as have the Phoenix Suns and Chicago Cubs .

Room 216
Washington , DC CONTENTS PANEL 1 : SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 : THE ATTACKS AND THE RESPONSE
WITNESSES : SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION NORMAN MINETA ; MAJOR GENERAL CRAIG MCKINLEY , NORAD ; MAJOR GENERAL LARRY ARNOLD , ( RET . ) ; COL .
ALAN SCOTT ( RET . ) ; LT .
GENERAL MIKE CANAVAN ( RET . ) , FORMER ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR , CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY PANEL 2 : REFORMING CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY : NEXT STEPS
WITNESSES : STEPHEN MCHALE , DPEUTY ADMINISTRATOR , TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AGENCY ; MAJOR GENERAL O.K. STEELE ( RET . ) ; MARY SCHIAVO , FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL , DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PROCEEDINGS MR . KEAN : Yesterday the Commission received testimony from members of Congress and from expert witnesses about the U.S. civil aviation security system that operated in the period leading up to September 11 , 2001 .
Today we move forward with the first look at the 9/11 hijackings themselves and the security system 's performance of that day .
Our final panelists will then address the changes which have been made in aviation security since 9/11 and also options for further improvements in the current system .
Before we proceed further , I want the record to be made very clear that the Commission is intensely aware of any number of reports indicating failures outside the area of the aviation security system .
These would include failures in intelligence , law enforcement and border security , which may have played a major part in making 9/11 possible .
The Commission has a statutory mandate and will be examining those areas as well .
They may even be the subject of future hearings .
Our focus today , however , is the field of civil aviation .
Today 's first -- where we start , we pick up the story of the hijackings on September 11th itself .
How did the civil aviation security system operate that day with respect to the 19 hijackers ?
What weapons and tactics did they employ to defeat the system ?
Why could n't we stop them or , at least in the three out of four cases that reached their target , prevented successful completion of their mission ?
This hearing record will remain open for 14 additional calendar days for any of the witnesses who want to to submit additional material and perhaps for the commission to send follow - up questions .
We are very pleased with the group of witnesses who are here today , particularly our first witness .
And we 're going to hear from the secretary of Transportation , with a long record of public service in the United States Congress , Secretary Mineta .
MR .
MINETA : Thank you very much , Chairman Kean , Vice Chairman Hamilton and distinguished members of the Commission , for this opportunity to testify before you .
I want to compliment the Commission on its intention to collect and provide the information on the circumstances surrounding the tragedies of September 11th , 2001 .
I would like to provide the Commission with a brief account of what happened on September 11th , 2001 .
I believe I can be most helpful to this Commission by providing information in which I have personal knowledge and a few observations from my perspective as Secretary of Transportation .
There are many events that occurred on September 11th that I do not have personal knowledge of , though I have learned about them in subsequent investigations and reports .
I know this commission will be speaking to the same agencies and individuals that provided me with that information , so I will let the Commission collect that information from those primary sources .
However , I do want to comment on what I believe is an important responsibility of this commission , and that is to add to the understanding of the American people about what we call terrorism and the threat that it poses .
I have seen terrorism in several forms and from several vantage points over the years , as an intelligence officer in the United States Army during the era of the Korean conflict , and in Congress as one of the early members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence .
Like a mutating virus , I have seen terrorism take different form over the years in an effort to defeat the safeguards that have been devised to protect against it .
And I believe it is critical to recognize this important truth about terrorism :
The threat of terrorism is constant , but the nature of that threat changes , because to be successful , terrorism must continually change how it operates .
On Tuesday morning , September 11th , 2001 , I was meeting with the Belgian transport minister in my conference room adjacent to my office , discussing aviation issues .
Because of the agenda , FAA Administrator Jane Garvey was also in attendance .
A little after 8:45 a.m. , my chief of staff , John Flaherty , interrupted the meeting .
He asked Administrator Garvey and me to step into my office , where he told me that news agencies were reporting that some type of aircraft had flown into one of the towers of New York 's World Trade Center .
Information was preliminary , so we did not know what kind of aircraft nor whether or not it was intentional .
Jane Garvey immediately went to a telephone and contacted the FAA operations center .
I asked to be kept informed of any developments and returned to the conference room to explain to the Belgian prime minister that our meeting might have to be postponed .
In an incident involving a major crash of any type , the Office of the Secretary goes into a major information - gathering response .
It contacts the mode of administration overseeing whatever mode of transportation is involved in the incident .
It monitors press reports , contacts additional personnel to accommodate the surge in operations , and centralizes the information for me through the chief of staff .
In major incidents , it will follow a protocol of notification that includes the White House and other agencies involved in the incident .
These activities , albeit in the nascent stage of information - gathering , took place in these initial minutes .
A few minutes after my return to the conference room , my chief of staff again asked me to step back into my office .
He then told me that the aircraft was a commercial aircraft and that the FAA had received an unconfirmed report that a hijacking of an American Airlines flight had occurred .
While Mr. Flaherty was briefing me , I watched as a large commercial jet flew into the second tower of the World Trade Center .
At this point things began to happen quickly .
I once more returned to the conference room and informed the minister of what had happened and ended the meeting .
I received a telephone call from the CEO of United Airlines , Jack Goodman , telling me that one of United 's flights was missing .
I then called Don Carty , the CEO of American Airlines , and asked him to see if American Airlines could account for all of its aircraft .
Mr. Flaherty reported to me that Jane Garvey had phoned to report that the CEO of Delta Airlines had called the FAA and said it could not yet account for all of its aircraft .
During this time , my office activated the Department of Transportation 's crisis management center , which was located on the 8th floor at that time of the Department of Transportation headquarters , and provides for senior DOT personnel to conduct surge operations in a coordinated manner .
By this time , my office had contacted the White House .
A brief moment later , the White House called my chief of staff and asked if I could come to the White House and operate from that location .
I decided that , given the nature of the attack and the request , that I should be at the White House directly providing the president and the vice president with information .
When I got to the White House , it was being evacuated .
I met briefly with Richard Clark , a National Security Council staff member , who had no new information .
Then the Secret Service escorted me down to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center , otherwise known as the PEOC .
I established contact on two lines , one with my chief of staff at the Department of Transportation , and the second with Monty Belger , the acting deputy administrator of the FAA , and Jane Garvey , both of whom were in the FAA operations center .
And as the minutes passed , the developing picture from air traffic control towers and radar screens became increasingly more alarming .
Some aircraft could not be contacted .
While on a normal day that may be just a communications snafu , we were faced with trying to quickly sort out minor problems from significant threats .
We did not know how many more attacks might be in progress .
The FAA began to restrict air travel in the Northeast United States by a combination of actions which included sterilizing air space in certain regions and at various airports , and ultimately a nationwide ground stop of all aircraft for all locations , regardless of destination .
Within a few minutes , American Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon .
At this time , as we discussed the situation with the North American Aerospace Defense commander and his staff , we considered implementing an emergency system of coordinated air traffic management to allow maximum use for defensive activities .
It was clear that we had to clear the air space as soon as possible to stop any further attacks and ensure domestic air space was available for emergency and defensive use .
And so at approximately 9:45 a.m. , less than one hour after I had first been notified of an airplane crash in New York , I gave the FAA the final order for all civil aircraft to land at the nearest airport as soon as possible .
It was the first shutdown of civil aviation in the history of the United States .
Within minutes , air traffic controllers throughout the nation had directed 700 domestic and international flights to emergency but safe landings .
Within another 50 minutes , air traffic controllers , working with skilled flight crews , made sure another 2800 airplanes returned safely to the ground .
By shortly after noon , less than four hours after the first attack , U.S. air space was empty of all aircraft except military and medical traffic .
A total of approximately 4500 aircraft were landed without incident in highly stressful conditions .
Additionally , all international inbound flights were diverted from U.S. air space and U.S. airports .
Unfortunately , during this time we also learned that United Flight 93 crashed in Stony Creek Township , Pennsylvania .
As America knows , but it is important to keep repeating , that aircraft never reached the terrorists ' target due to the heroic actions taken by the passengers and crew on United Flight 93 .
A question has been asked whether or not there is evidence that other hijackings and attacks were prevented by the actions that were taken that day .
There are classified reports , media reports and investigative documents that indicate that other attacks may have been planned .
But the evidence on this question is speculative at best , and I do not believe anyone can assert that other attacks were thwarted on that day unless he or she is the one who either planned the attack or planned to carry it out .
I also want to tell the Commission that although the focus of this commission 's interest is on the airplane crashes on September 11th , as secretary of the United States Coast Guard , I was involved that day in the mass evacuation of more than 350,000 people from Manhattan .
In addition to the largest maritime evacuation conducted in the history of the United States , our department 's agencies were working with the various New York authorities on the devastating infrastructure damage suffered there .
Over the next few days , our department spent hours working with various state , local and federal agencies to reopen roads , tunnels , bridges , harbors and railroads while getting essential relief supplies into the area .
I have talked about the staff at the Department of Transportation and how proud I am of how they responded on September 11th and in the days and the months afterward .
I also want to remark on the families , friends , the victims of that tragic day and those who were injured physically and emotionally .
I share in much of their grief and heartache , although I can never experience the depth of it .
The consequences of September 11th affected all of America , but the greatest effect was on these people .
And I have spent a great deal of physical and emotional effort this past year trying to make sure that what happened on that day does not happen again .
We must do everything we can to try and prevent other Americans from enduring the pain that these families and friends have suffered .
But in that work , we must never forget those families and that pain and anguish .
I know I do n't .
It helps me in the work I continue to do .
They are in my thoughts and prayers .
Thank you very much .
MR .
KEAN : Thank you , Mr. Secretary .
When you were being prepared in the sense of preparing yourself to take your role in the Cabinet , were you briefed in any way , or what part of the possibility of terrorism occurring was part of your preparation ?
I mean , as you 've looked at all the vast things you have to understand for your position , was the possibility of terrorism and what you might have to do in the result of terrorism a large part of that briefing , a small part of that briefing ?
MR .
MINETA : The nature of what was happening in the civil aviation industry in the United States at that time did not put terrorism high on the list of priorities .
We were still dealing with the whole issue of delays , of congestion , of capacity issues , and so terrorism was really not something that I was prepared to deal with except as it came up on that tragic day .
MR .
KEAN : So you had to improvise , in a sense , based on what was happening and the news reports you were getting .
MR .
MINETA : Absolutely .
And in terms of what motivated me to bring all the aircraft down , as you see one thing happen , that 's an accident .
When you see two of the same thing occur , it 's a pattern .
But when you see three of the same thing occur , it 's a program .
And so at that point I decided to bring all the aircraft down .
MR .
KEAN : But in a sense , what I 'm trying to get at , I guess , is the government was really unprepared for this kind of event .
Nobody had anticipated it , this event or any kind of major terrorist event .
So this was not a major preparation .
You were n't prepared .
You had to do your best under very difficult circumstances .
MR .
MINETA : That 's correct , sir .
MR .
KEAN : There 's been some confusion as to the issue of box cutters .
You testified , I gather , that as of September 11th , the FAA did not prohibit box cutters , before Congress .
Yesterday we got testimony from the ATA that in checkpoint operation guides , box cutters were classified as restricted items , which could be kept off an aircraft if identified .
What was the status of box cutters within the aviation system as a whole , and certainly in Boston , where those checkpoints were ?
MR .
MINETA : The FAA regulation referred to blades of four inches or greater as prohibited items .
And so a box cutter was really less than four inches .
Now , on the other hand , the airline industry had a guideline .
And in that guideline , they did prohibit box cutters , as it was in that guideline .
But in the FAA regulations , that was not the case .
All they referred to was the length of the blade , and that was four inches .
And so under the FAA regulations , box cutters would have been okay on an airplane .
MR .
HAMILTON : Mr. Secretary , we 're very pleased to have you here this morning .
I understand your time is short and you 'll only be able to spend a few minutes with us .
We 're grateful for the time that you 're able to make available .
It might very well be that we 'll have some questions that we would want to submit to you in writing subsequently .
MR .
MINETA : And I will submit those to the Commission in writing .
MR .
HAMILTON : We thank you for that .
I wanted to focus just a moment on the Presidential Emergency Operating Center .
You were there for a good part of the day .
I think you were there with the vice president .
And when you had that order given , I think it was by the president , that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists , were you there when that order was given ?
MR .
MINETA : No , I was not .
I was made aware of it during the time that the airplane coming into the Pentagon .
There was a young man who had come in and said to the vice president , " The plane is 50 miles out .
The plane is 30 miles out . "
And when it got down to , " The plane is 10 miles out , " the young man also said to the vice president , " Do the orders still stand ? "
And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said , " Of course the orders still stand .
Have you heard anything to the contrary ? "
Well , at the time I did n't know what all that meant .
And -- MR.
HAMILTON : The flight you 're referring to is the -- MR .
MINETA : The flight that came into the Pentagon .
MR .
HAMILTON : The Pentagon , yeah .
MR .
MINETA : And so I was not aware that that discussion had already taken place .
But in listening to the conversation between the young man and the vice president , then at the time I did n't really recognize the significance of that .
And then later I heard of the fact that the airplanes had been scrambled from Langley to come up to DC , but those planes were still about 10 minutes away .
And so then , at the time we heard about the airplane that went into Pennsylvania , then I thought , " Oh , my God , did we shoot it down ? "
And then we had to , with the vice president , go through the Pentagon to check that out .
MR .
HAMILTON : Let me see if I understand .
The plane that was headed toward the Pentagon and was some miles away , there was an order to shoot that plane down .
MR .
MINETA : Well , I do n't know that specifically , but I do know that the airplanes were scrambled from Langley or from Norfolk , the Norfolk area .
But I did not know about the orders specifically other than listening to that other conversation .
MR .
HAMILTON : But there very clearly was an order to shoot commercial aircraft down .
MR .
MINETA : Subsequently I found that out .
MR .
HAMILTON : With respect to Flight 93 , what type of information were you and the vice president receiving about that flight ?
MR .
MINETA : The only information we had at that point was when it crashed .
MR .
HAMILTON : I see .
You did n't know beforehand about that airplane .
MR .
MINETA : I did not .
MR .
HAMILTON : And so there was no specific order there to shoot that plane down .
MR .
MINETA : No , sir .
MR .
HAMILTON : But there were military planes in the air in position to shoot down commercial aircraft .
MR .
MINETA : That 's right .
The planes had been scrambled , I believe , from Otis at that point .
MR .
HAMILTON : Could you help me understand a little the division of responsibility between the FAA and NORAD on that morning ?
MR .
MINETA : Well , FAA is in touch with NORAD .
And when the first flight from Boston had gone out of communications with the air traffic controllers , the air traffic controller then notified , I believe , Otis Air Force Base about the air traffic controller not being able to raise that American Airlines flight .
MR .
HAMILTON : A final question and then we 'll let other commissioners ask a question .
And this is kind of a broad , sweeping one .
What worries you most about transportation safety today ?
What are the most vulnerable points , do you think , in our transportation system today ?
A lot of steps have been taken , obviously , to improve security , a lot of progress made .
What would be towards the top of your list ?
Or would there be two or three items that worry you the most ?
MR .
MINETA : I would say today the most vulnerable would be the maritime ports .
With the number of containers coming into this country , we really do n't have a good handle on what 's in those containers .
And to me that is one that we still have n't really been able to put our hands on .
I know that the Transportation Security Agency is looking and working on that matter diligently .
But with the number of containers that come off of ships every day , something like 16 million a year , it 's a formidable task .
MR .
HAMILTON : Mr. Chairman , thank you very much .
I understand the secretary 's time is very tight now .
MR . KEAN : I have one final question and then we 'll go to Commissioner Roemer .
Is there one recommendation that you know of that 's pending now , either in the administration or in the Congress or other , that you believe would be most important to making the traveling public feel safer ?
MR .
MINETA : I suppose , in terms of aviation , I think that we are probably as confident about the security relating to aviation issues today in terms of where we were before the 11th of September and improvements that were made subsequent to the 11th of September and in terms of each month , each day it gets better .
But , again , I would go back to my maritime containers as still the most vulnerable and the one that really needs the funding to get to the bottom of that issue .
MR .
KEAN : Thank you , Mr. Secretary .
Commissioner Roemer .
MR .
ROEMER : Nice to see you , Mr. Secretary , and nice to see you feeling better and getting around as well , too .
I want to follow up on what happened in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center and try to understand that day a little bit better .
You said , if I understood you correctly , that you were not in the room ; you were obviously coming from the Department of Transportation , where you had been busy in a meeting in official business , but you had not been in the room when the decision was made -- to what you inferred was a decision made to attempt to shoot down Flight 77 before it crashed into the Pentagon .
Is that correct ?
MR . MINETA : I did n't know about the order to shoot down .
I arrived at the PEOC at about 9:20 a.m .
And the president was in Florida , and I believe he was on his way to Louisiana at that point when the conversation that went on between the vice president and the president and the staff that the president had with him .
MR .
ROEMER : So when you arrived at 9:20 , how much longer was it before you overheard the conversation between the young man and the vice president saying , " Does the order still stand ? "
MR .
MINETA : Probably about five or six minutes .
MR .
ROEMER : So about 9:25 or 9:26 .
And your inference was that the vice president snapped his head around and said , " Yes , the order still stands . "
Why did you infer that that was a shoot - down ?
MR .
MINETA : Just by the nature of all the events going on that day , the scrambling of the aircraft and , I do n't know ; I guess , just being in the military , you do start thinking about it , an intuitive reaction to certain statements being made .
MR .
ROEMER : Who was the young man with the vice president ?
MR .
MINETA : Frankly , I do n't recall .
MR .
ROEMER : And was there another line of communication between the vice president -- and you said you saw Mr. Richard Clark on the way in .
Was Clark running an operations center as well on that day ?
MR .
MINETA : Dick was in the Situation Room .
MR .
ROEMER : So there was the Situation Room making decisions about what was going to happen on shootdowns -- MR .
MINETA : I do n't believe they were -- MR. ROEMER : -- as well as the PEOC ?
MR .
MINETA : I do n't believe they were making any decisions .
I think they were more information - gathering from various agencies .
MR .
ROEMER : Could it have been in the Situation Room where somebody in the Situation Room recommended the shoot - down and the vice president agreed to that ?
MR . MINETA : Commissioner Roemer , I would assume that a decision of that nature would have had to be made at a much higher level than the people who were in the Situation Room .
MR .
ROEMER : So take me through that .
The Situation Room is monitoring the daily minute - by - minute events and they find out that Flight 77 is headed to the Pentagon .
Somebody 's got to be getting that information .
The Situation Room is then communicating with the PEOC and saying , " We 've got another flight that 's on its way toward the Pentagon .
Here are the options . "
Then the vice president talks to the president and says , " Here are the options ; we have a shoot - down recommendation .
Do you agree , Mr. President ? "
Is that what happens ?
MR .
MINETA : Again , that would be speculation on my part as to what was happening on that day , so I just would n't be able to really answer that -- on that inquiry .
MR .
ROEMER : I know , because you had been conducting official business , and I 'm sure you were hurriedly on your way over there .
MR .
MINETA : As I was listening -- MR .
ROEMER : I 'm just trying to figure out how the Situation Room , which was gathering the minute - by - minute evidence and information and talking probably to a host of different people , and how they 're interacting with the PEOC and then how the PEOC is interacting with the president , who is at that point on Air Force One , how a decision is made to shoot down a commercial airliner .
And then would you say -- let 's say we 're trying to put that part of the puzzle together .
Then would your inference be that they scrambled the jets to shoot down the commercial airliner , it failed , and the commercial airliner therefore crashed into the Pentagon , the jets were not able to get there in time to succeed in a mission that they 'd been tasked to do ?
MR .
MINETA : I 'm not sure that the aircraft that were scrambled to come up to the DC area from Norfolk were under orders to shoot the airplane down .
As I said , I just -- MR.
ROEMER : But it was an inference on your part .
MR .
MINETA : It was an inference , without a doubt .
And that 's why , in thinking about the United plane that went down in Pennsylvania , the question that arose in my mind -- MR .
ROEMER : Right away was " Was that shot down ? "
And did you ever get an answer to that ?
MR . MINETA : Yes , sir .
The vice president and I talked about that .
We then made the inquiry of the Department of Defense .
They then got back to us saying , " No , it was not our aircraft . "
MR .
ROEMER : No shots were fired and no effort was made to shoot that down .
MR .
MINETA : That 's correct .
MR .
KEAN : I 'm going to go to another questioner .
MR .
ROEMER : Thank you .
MR .
KEAN : The secretary 's time is limited .
Commissioner Lehman .
MR .
LEHMAN : Mr. Secretary , I have one question , and that is , we had testimony yesterday that there were many intelligence reports leading up to 9/11 and actual plots uncovered to use aircraft as missiles .
Do you feel that the system set up to provide to you as secretary of Transportation the latest intelligence bearing on your responsibilities , such as that subject , was adequate before 9/11 ?
If not , have measures been taken to see that you are provided with the best possible product on a daily basis as to threats to the broad range of transportation assets under your purview ?
Could you comment on before and after ?
MR .
MINETA : Well , I do get a daily briefing , intelligence briefing .
And I did during that time period , prior to the 11th of September and subsequent to the 11th of September .
And there 's no doubt that the nature of the intelligence data has improved .
And so -- but again , there was nothing in those intelligence reports that would have been specific to anything that happened on the 11th of September .
There was nothing in the preceding time period about aircraft being used as a weapon or of any other terrorist types of activities of that nature .
And so -- but I do get briefings , and I think that since the 11th of September , 2001 , the nature of the briefings have improved .
MR .
LEHMAN : Just to follow up , Mr. Secretary , given the fact that there were , in the preceding couple of years , about half a dozen novels and movies about hijackings being used as weapons and the fact that there were reports floating around in the intelligence community , did you personally think that that was a possibility , that it could have happened ?
Or when it happened , did it just take you totally by surprise ?
Because yesterday we had testimony from the former FAA administrator that , in effect , it never entered her mind .
MR .
MINETA : Well , I would have to , again , say that I had no thought of the airplane being used as a weapon .
I think our concentration was more on hijackings .
And most of the hijackings , as they occur in an overseas setting , or the hijacking , if it were to be a domestic one , was for the person to take over the aircraft , to have that aircraft transport them to some other place .
But I do n't think we ever thought of an airplane being used as a missile .
MR .
LEHMAN : Given that there was so much intelligence , not a specific plot , but of the possibility and the fact that some terrorists had , in fact , started planning , would n't you view it as a failure of our intelligence community not to tell the secretary of Transportation that there was such a conceivable threat that the people like the Coast Guard and FAA should be thinking about ?
MR .
MINETA : We had no information of that nature at all .
And as to whether that was a failure of the intelligence agencies , I think it would have been just even for them hard to imagine .
MR .
KEAN : Thank you .
We recognize your time constraints .
We have two more commissioners -- MR .
MINETA : Absolutely .
MR. KEAN : -- who have questions .
Commissioner Gorelick and then Commissioner Fielding .
MS .
GORELICK : Secretary Mineta , again , thank you for being here .
We all know that in the spring and summer of 2001 , the intelligence community was putting out reports of a , I would say , near - frantic level suggesting that we were expecting there to be some type of terrorist attack somewhere in the world -- we did n't know where , we did n't know the modality , but a very high level of concern .
My first question to you -- and I 'll just give them to you all at once , is , one , were you called to any meeting or summoned at a Cabinet level , or was there any sort of cross-functional group put together across the government to say , What can we do as a government to respond to this very heightened level of intelligence warning that we are getting generally ?
Second , even though in response to Commissioner Lehman 's questions you have indicated that this particular modality of attack was not made known to you clearly , hijackings and use of aircraft , bombings , bombs on aircraft , were a favorite tool , if you will , of terrorists .
Did you yourself do anything within the agencies under your control to seek out mechanisms for being on alert and for heightening our security in this period of reporting ?
What did you know , what was anyone telling you , and what did you do in response ?
MR .
MINETA : First of all , on the first question I would say , no , that we had no meetings of an interagency nature given the nature of intelligence that you 're describing .
I think most of the response at that time was to what you might call the chatter , because the chatter is really just increased communication between people , but nothing specific as to the nature of the kind of attack that might be coming .
We 're at orange level now , and what prompted that was again increased chatter .
But it was n't anything specific about the nature of what the threat might be .
MS .
GORELICK : Well , let me just contrast perhaps the chatter , the same kind of chatter level right in advance of the millennium .
As I understand it , that information was widely disseminated in the government .
There were Cabinet - level and sub -Cabinet - level meetings , and each agency essentially searched to do what they could to harden our country against attacks .
Now , clearly when you do n't know where the attack is coming from or what mode will be used , it 's difficult .
But what I am asking essentially is :
Did this higher level of chatter , the what I believe to be a frantic quality to the intelligence warnings , result in any action across the government , and particularly in the area of transportation ?
I take it your answer to that is no ?
MR . MINETA : That 's correct .
MR .
KEAN : Commissioner Fielding .
MR .
FIELDING : Mr. Chairman , I would like further explanation of the division of responsibility between the FAA and NORAD on the morning of 9/11 , because there seems to be some confusion about that .
I 'd like the secretary 's views , but I 'd be very happy in respect to his time to submit that in writing to him .
MR .
MINETA : All right , I 'll submit that in writing .
MR .
KEAN : Mr. Secretary , thank you very much .
MR .
MINETA : Very well .
Thank you very much to the Commission .
MR .
HAMILTON : Mr. Chairman ?
MR. KEAN : Mr. Hamilton .
MR .
HAMILTON : I just wanted to be recognized for a moment to comment on a headline really in The Washington Post that appeared this morning .
The headline states that a -- and I 'm quoting it now -- " New Panel , Independent of 9/11 Commission , Is Sought , " end of quote .
And I want to observe that I do n't see how it is possible to get that headline out of the article .
And the article really does not say anything at all about a separate panel .
When I first saw the headline it occurred to me that maybe I had attended a different meeting yesterday than The Washington Post reporters and headline writers had attended .
But I hope the Post will see fit to prominently correct that headline which is quite erroneous .
MR .
KEAN : Thank you very much .
I would certainly agree .
I would like to have Major General Craig McKinley , commander , 1st Air Force , Continental U.S. NORAD , here representing NORAD .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Governor Kean , Congressman Hamilton and members of the committee , thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today on behalf of the combatant commander , United States Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command , to provide testimony on the events surrounding the events of September 11th , 2001 , when our nation was attacked from within by foreign terrorists using commercial aircraft as weapons of mass destruction .
It is an honor to represent the thousands of men and women from the Air National Guard , the active duty forces and the Air Force Reserves still serving around the clock defending America from further attacks in support of the North American Aerospace Defense Command .
I personally was inside the Pentagon on September 11th , and I personally know what it feels like to be attacked by hostile forces .
Although over 18 months have passed since that tragic day , our vigilance remains focused .
We have flown almost 30,000 airborne sorties in support of Operation Noble Eagle in the continental United States alone .
Every day Americans and Canadians work side by side in NORAD to defend North America .
We have forged unprecedented relationships with in the U.S. government , with federal agencies to strengthen our ability to detect and defend against further attempts to harm our nation from the air .
We are now patterned with the new United States North Command to extend and perfect our mission in both homeland defense as well as civil support missions .
We are proud to be a part of this team focused on defending our nation against all threats , and supporting our government in its role , primary role , of protecting its citizens .
First Air Force is a subordinate command of Air Combat Command , and is responsible to the North American Aerospace Defense Commander for the execution of the air defense mission to protect our nation .
First Air Force , as NORAD 's continental United States NORAD region , is responsible for the air defense of the continental United States under the NORAD agreements .
I personally took command of 1st Air Force in the continental United States 's NORAD region on August 1st of 2002 , and then became the joint force air component commander for General Eberhardt .
This was 11 months after the attacks .
I am pleased to say today that when I saw the nature of your questions , that I asked General Eberhardt 's permission , and received it , to invite Major General Retired Larry Arnold , the past commander of 1st Air Force , and the commander on the day of the attacks , that led the command through those trying days during and after the event .
He is with us today , and has volunteered to be part of this commission 's hearings .
I also asked for probably the best subject matter expert I could find on the chronology , the series of events that is so vital to this commission , to be with us today with your concurrence to walk us through the NORAD timeline .
I also have with me today Major Don Arias to show you the human nature of this .
Don 's brother , Adam , was killed in the South Tower 2 .
He was talking to his brother at 8:59 on the 11th of September , ' 01 , and Mr. Arias is our public affairs officer .
Please stand up , Don .
I 'd like to thank the Commission staff , especially Miles Kara , for his help in preparing for this .
The committee has posed many questions regarding the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks .
Our intention is to provide the chronology first to the events leading up to September 11th , as well as taking your questions to give you a detailed look at how NORAD 's response was made on 9/11 , and any subsequent questions you may have on our posture since .
Mr. Commissioner , that concludes my formal statement .
The rest will be provided for the record .
And , with your indulgence , sir , I would like Colonel Scott ( ret. ) , Alan Scott , to walk you through the timeline .
MR .
SCOTT : Good morning , Mr. Chairman , commissioners .
It is my pleasure to be here with you today .
General Arnold and I worked together that day on September the 11th .
What I will walk you through here is a chronology of the attacks , and I 've presented it in a matrix form .
And the only thing I lay claim to is having studied all of the attacks and how they are interwoven together .
This was not a linear sequence of events where one attack began and ended and then a second attack began and ended .
This was a coordinated , well - planned attack .
We had multiple airplanes in the air .
The fog and friction of war was evidence everywhere in the country , both on the civil side as well as the military side .
And this hopefully will show you how those interwoven events came about .
I will tell you the times on this chart come from our logs .
The time on the chart is the time that 's in the log .
It may not be the exact time the event happened .
It may be the time when the log - keeper was advised or became aware of the event .
The first thing that happened in the morning related to the events at 9:02 , or I 'm sorry 8:02 a.m. , Eastern Standard Time , is when American Airlines 11 took off out of Boston .
American Airlines 11 was a 767 , and it was headed , I believe , to Los Angeles .
Fourteen minutes later , also coming out of Boston Logan , United Airlines 175 , a 757 , also headed to Los Angeles , took off out of Boston , and initially took roughly the same ground track as American 11 .
Three minutes later , American Airlines 77 took off out of Dulles here in Washington , also headed to Los Angeles , and also a 757 , and proceeded westbound toward the West Coast .
So now the first three airplanes are airborne together .
The first time that anything untoward , and this was gleaned from FAA response , that anything out of the ordinary happened was at 8:20 , when the electronic transponder in American Airlines 11 blinked off if you will , just disappeared from the screen .
Obviously the terrorists turned that transponder off , and that airplane , although it did not disappear from the radarscope , it became a much , much more difficult target to discern for the controllers who now only could look at the primary radar return off the airplane .
That was at 8:20 .
At 8:40 in our logs is the first occasion where the FAA is reporting a possible hijacking of American Airlines Flight 11 .
And the initial response to us at that time was a possible hijacking had not been confirmed .
At that same moment , the F - 15 alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base , Massachusetts , about 153 miles away , were placed immediately on battle stations by the Northeast Air Defense Sector commander .
At 8:43 , as this is going on , the fourth airplane , United 93 , takes off out of Newark , New Jersey .
It 's a 757 .
It is headed for San Francisco .
At 8:46 , our next log event , we get the last , and , by the way , much of this radar data for these primary targets was not seen that day .
It was reconstructed days later by the 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron , and other agencies like it who are professionals at going back and looking at radar tapes and then given that they are loaded with knowledge after the fact , they can go and find things that perhaps were not visible during the event itself .
At 8:46 , the last data , near the Trade Center , 8:46 , the first impact on the Trade Center .
At that minute is when the Otis F - 15s were scrambled .
And , again , they were 153 miles away .
And that scramble came , and General Arnold , I am sure can address this , based on a conversation between the Northeast Sector commander and himself .
Those F - 15s were airborne in six minutes .
That is well inside the time that is allowed for them to get airborne .
But because they were on battle stations , the pilots were in the cockpits ready to start engines , that scramble time was shortened by a significant amount of time .
At 8:53 , that 's a minute later , in the radar reconstruction , we are now picking up the primary radar contacts off of the F - 15s out of Otis .
At 8:57 , which is seven minutes after the first impact is , according to our logs when the FAA reports the first impact .
And about this time is when CNN coverage to the general public is beginning to appear on the TV , not of the impact , but of the burning towers shortly thereafter .
So you can see what in the military I am sure you have heard us talk to the fog and friction of war , and as the intensity increases the lag tends to also increase for how quickly information gets passed .
9:02 -- United 175 , the second airplane , which by the way never turned off its transponder before impact , crashes into the North Tower at 9:02 .
The distance of those fighters which had been scrambled out of Otis , at that particular point they were still 71 miles away , about eight minutes out , and going very fast .
At 9:05 , FAA reports a possible hijack of United 175 .
Again , that 's three minutes after the impact in the tower .
That 's how long it is taking now the information to flow through the system to the command and control agencies and through the command and control agencies to the pilots in the cockpit .
At 9:09 , Langley F - 16s are directed to battle stations , just based on the general situation and the breaking news , and the general developing feeling about what 's going on .
And at about that same time , kind of way out in the West , is when America 77 , which in the meantime has turned off its transponder and turned left back toward Washington , appears back in radar coverage .
And my understanding is the FAA controllers now are beginning to pick up primary skin paints on an airplane , and they do n't know exactly whether that is 77 , and they are asking a lot of people whether it is , including an a C - 130 that is westbound toward Ohio .
At 9:11 FAA reports a crash into the South Tower .
You can see now that lag time has increased from seven minutes from impact to report ; now it 's nine minutes from impact to report .
You can only imagine what 's going on on the floors of the control centers around the country .
At 9:11 -- I just mentioned that -- 9:16 , now FAA reports a possible hijack of United Flight 93 , which is out in the Ohio area .
But that 's the last flight that is going to impact the ground .
At 9:24 the FAA reports a possible hijack of 77 .
That 's sometime after they had been tracking this primary target .
And at that moment as well is when the Langley F - 16s were scrambled out of Langley .
At 9:25 , America 77 is reported headed towards Washington , D.C. , not exactly precise information , just general information across the chat logs ; 9:27 , Boston FAA reports a fifth aircraft missing , Delta Flight 89 -- and many people have never heard of Delta Flight 89 .
We call that the first red herring of the day , because there were a number of reported possible hijackings that unfolded over the hours immediately following the actual attacks .
Delta 89 was not hijacked , enters the system , increases the fog and friction if you will , as we begin to look for that .
But he lands about seven of eight minutes later and clears out of the system .
At 9:30 the Langley F - 16s are airborne .
They are 105 miles away from the Washington area ; 9:34 , through chat , FAA is unable to precisely locate American Airlines Flight 77 ; 9:35 , F - 16s are reported airborne .
And many times , reported airborne is not exactly when they took off .
It 's just when the report came down that they were airborne .
At 9:37 we have the last radar data near the Pentagon .
And 9:40 , immediately following that , is when 93 up north turns its transponders off out in the West toward Ohio , and begins a left turn back toward the East .
At 9:49 , FAA reports that Delta 89 , which had been reported as missing , is now reported as a possible hijacking .
So again he is -- MR. : That 's 9:41 , sir .
MR .
SCOTT : I 'm sorry , 9:41 .
Again , he is in the system .
He is kind of a red herring for us .
Now , the only thing that I would point out on this chart is this says 9:43 , American Airlines 77 impacts the Pentagon .
The timeline on the impact of the Pentagon was changed to 9:37 -- 9:43 is the time that was reported that day , it was the time we used .
And it took about two weeks to discover in the parking lot of the Pentagon this entry camera for the parking lot , which happened to be oriented towards the Pentagon at the time of impact , and the recorded time is 9:37 .
And that 's why the timeline went from 9:43 to 9:37 , because it is the best documented evidence for the impact time that we have .
Getting toward the end now , 9:47 is when Delta 89 clears the system by landing in Cleveland .
So he is not a hijack .
Lots of things are going on now in the system as the sectors begin to call both units that are part of 1st Air Force and NORAD , as well as units that have nothing to do with us .
We are beginning to call everyone now and the 103rd Air Control Squadron , for instance , stationed in Connecticut , is an air control squadron , a radar squadron , and they got their radar online , operational , and begin to link their radar picture into the Northeast system .
They are not normally part of NORAD .
This is really the initial part of a huge push the rest of that day to link as many radars in on the interior as we can , and to get as many fighters on alert as we can .
At 10:02 , United 93 last radar data and the estimated impact time for United 93 is 10:03 .
At 10:07 FAA reports there may be a bomb on board 93 -- that 's four minutes after the impact .
At 10:15 they report that it 's crashed .
And you can see now that fog and friction lag time has increased from seven minutes to nine minutes to 15 minutes , because of the level of activities that are going on .
And there are notations here about other airplanes as we begin to divert other airplanes that are just out were intended for training that day .
We 're picking up the phone , calling Syracuse , the Air National Guard .
They 're beginning to get flights airborne .
They 're beginning to arm those aircraft with whatever weapons they have handy so we can posture that defense .
That is how the timeline unfolded .
As you can see , it is a fabric of interwoven actions .
This is not just a linear event .
So lots of things going on , lots of activities , and lots of C2 centers .
Sir , that completes my piece .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Mr. Chairman , we thought right up front we'd put that on the record so we can have that as a departure point for your questions .
I 'd again caveat by saying that this is the North American Aerospace Defense Command and continental NORAD region timeline .
Other agencies may have other logs that may have different times .
But this is the best and most accurate data that we could piece together for your Commission , sir .
With that , I open up to questions .
MR .
KEAN : Thank you very much .
Commissioner Ben-Veniste .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Good morning , gentlemen .
First I would like to personally commend each of you and the dedicated men and women who serve our nation through NORAD .
I 'd like to explain to you what you probably know already , and that is that our mandate as a commission is to provide the most detailed and accurate exposition in our final report of what occurred leading up to the 9/11 tragedy and the events subsequent thereto .
And so please understand that our questions may be very pointed .
We mean no disrespect , but we have our mission as well .
Now , General McKinley , is it fair to say that the mission and the primary responsibility of NORAD is to defend our homeland and our citizens against air attack ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : On the day of September 11th , 2001 , our mission was to defend North America , to surveil , to intercept , to identify , and if necessary to destroy , those targets which we were posturing were going to come from outside our country .
In fact , that tracks originating over the landmass of the United States were identified friendly by origin .
Therefore those alert sites that were positioned on the morning of September 11th were looking out primarily on our coasts at the air defense identification zone , which extends outward of 100 to 200 miles off our shore .
So that was the main focus of NORAD at the time .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : I asked you about your responsibilities , sir , and I ask you again , whether it was not your responsibility as NORAD to protect the United States and its citizens against air attack .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : It is , and it was , and I would just caveat your comment by saying that our mission was at that time not designed to take internal FAA radar data to track or to identify tracks originating within our borders .
It was to look outward , as a Cold War vestige , primarily developed during the Cold War , to protect against Soviet long - range bomber penetration of our intercept zone .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Well , I think , sir , that you have used a good term , not good for the United States , but accurate , in terms of the vestigial mandate operationally to look outward toward the borders rather than inward .
And as vestigial you mean , I am sure , as a result of our decades of confrontation with the former Soviet Union .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Correct , sir .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
And so on the day of September 11th , as you can see these dots -- I know it may be difficult to see -- NORAD was positioned in a perimeter around the United States , but nothing in the central region , nothing on the border with Canada ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : That 's correct , sir .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Now , let me ask you , sir , whether the concept of terrorists using an airplane as a weapon was something unknown to the intelligence community on September 10th , 2001 .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Very good question , and I -- MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Thank you .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : -- I asked our staff to provide me some data on what they had that morning .
As I said , General Arnold was at the helm that morning .
But basically the comments I received from my staff was that there was no intelligence indication at any level within NORAD or DOD of a terrorist threat to commercial aviation prior to the attacks .
And information from the daily Joint Chiefs intelligence report on the morning of September 11th indicated no specific dangers or threats within the country .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : My question , sir , and I mean no disrespect , but we 'll save time if you listen to what I ask you .
My question is :
The concept of terrorists using airplanes as weapons was not something which was unknown to the U.S. intelligence community on September 10th , 2001 , is n't that fair to say ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : I 'd like the intelligence community to address that .
I would find it hard to believe that they had n't speculated against that .
But it was unavailable to us at the time .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Well , let 's start , for example , with September 12th , 1994 , a Cessna 150L crashed into the South Lawn of the White House , barely missing the building , and killing the pilot .
Similarly , in December of 1994 , an Algerian armed Islamic group of terrorists hijacked an Air France flight in Algiers and threatened to crash it into the Eiffel Tower .
In October of 1996 , the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Iranian plot to hijack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into Tel Aviv .
In August of 1988 , the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive - laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center .
The information was passed on to the FBI and the FAA .
In September of 1998 , the intelligence community obtained information that Osama bin Laden 's next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it .
In August 2001 , the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane , or crash an airplane into it .
In addition , in the Atlanta Olympics , the United States government and the Department of Justice and my colleague Jamie Gorelick were involved in planning against possible terrorist attacks at the Olympics , which included the potential of an aircraft flying into the stadium .
In July 2001 , the G - 8 summit in Genoa , attended by our president , among the measures that were taken were positioning surface - to - air missile ringing Genoa , closing the Genoa airport and restricting all airspace over Genoa .
Was not this information , sir , available to NORAD as of September 11th , 2001 ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : It 's obvious by your categorization that those events all took place and that NORAD had that information .
I would only add , sir , that the intelligence data that we postured our forces for and the training and the tactics and the procedures that we used to prepare our missions for support of the combatant commander of NORAD had hijacking as a primary intercept tactic .
And we have some of the finest fighter pilots , as you know in the world , who are some of the best people in the world who can do their mission extremely well .
But we had not postured prior to September 11th , 2001 , for the scenario that took place that day .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
Well , obviously it would be hard to imagine posturing for the exact scenario .
But is n't it a fact , sir , that prior to September 11th , 2001 , NORAD had already in the works plans to simulate in an exercise a simultaneous hijacking of two planes in the United States ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Colonel Scott , do you have any data on that ?
I 'm not aware of that , sir .
I was not present at the time .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : That was Operation Amalgam Virgo .
MR .
SCOTT : Yes , sir .
Specifically Operation Amalgam Virgo , which I was involved in before I retired , was a scenario using a Third World united -- not united -- uninhabited aerial vehicle launched off a rogue freighter in the Gulf of Mexico .
General Arnold can back me up -- at the time one of our greatest concerns was the proliferation of cruise missile technology and the ability for terrorist groups to get that technology , get it close enough to our shores to launch it .
In fact , this exercise -- in this exercise we used actual drone -- NQM - 107 drones , which are about the size of a cruise missile , to exercise our fighters and our radars in a Gulf of Mexico scenario .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : You are referring to Amalgam 01 , are you not ?
MR. SCOTT : Yes , sir , Amalgam 01 .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : I am referring to Amalgam 02 , which was in the planning stages prior to September 11th , 2001 , sir .
Is that correct ?
MR .
SCOTT : That was after I retired , and I was not involved in 02 .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Will you accept that the exercise involved a simultaneous hijacking scenario ?
MR . SCOTT : I was not involved in 02 .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , I do have some information on 02 , if you would allow me to read it for the record .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Please .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Amalgam Virgo in general , 02 , was an exercise created to focus on peacetime and contingency NORAD missions .
One of the peacetime scenarios that is and has been a NORAD mission for years is support to other government departments .
Within this mission falls hijackings .
Creativity of the designer aside , prior to 9/11 , hijack motivations were based on political objectives -- i.e. , asylum or release of captured prisoners or political figures .
Threats of killing hostages or crashing were left to the script writers to invoke creativity and broaden the required response for players .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Well , is n't that a bit fatuous given the specific information that I 've given you ?
It was n't in the minds of script writers when the Algerians had actually hijacked the plane , which they were attempting to fly into the Eiffel Tower .
And all of the other scenarios which I mentioned to you .
I do n't mean to argue with you .
But my question is , sir , given the awareness of the terrorists use of planes as weapons , how is it that NORAD was still focusing outward protecting the United States against attacks from the Soviet Union or elsewhere , and was not better prepared to defend against the hijacking scenarios of a commercial jet laden with fuel used as a weapon to target citizens of the United States ?
When you say our training was vestigial , I think you said it in capsulated form .
But would you agree that on the basis of the information available that there could be , could have been better preparedness by NORAD to meet this threat ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : In retrospect , sir , I think I would agree with your comment .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : With respect to the bases that were available for protecting the East Coast , you -- and Colonel Scott has gone through the scrambling of aircraft -- I wanted to focus just on one flight , Flight 77 , and then Secretary Lehman will ask you some more specific questions .
With respect to Flight 77 , sir , you testified previously before the House Armed Services Committee , and General Eberhardt was questioned -- you are familiar with his testimony ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Yes , sir .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Okay .
He was questioned about Flight 77 , and because of the use of Langley Air Base , which is 105 miles from our capital , as opposed to , say , Andrews Air Force Base , which is in the neighborhood , the question arises again about the positioning and the thought behind the positioning of fighter planes to protect our capital in an enhanced terrorist situation such as existed on September 10th , September 9th , 2002 .
Let me ask you about Flight 77 again .
The question was the timeline we have been given is that at 8:55 on September 11th American Airlines Flight 77 began turning east away from its intended course , and at 9:10 Flight 77 was detected by the FAA radar over West Virginia heading east .
That was after the two planes struck the Trade Center towers .
Is that correct , Colonel Scott ?
MR. SCOTT : Yes , sir .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Now , 15 minutes later , at 9:25 , the FAA notified NORAD , according to this statement , that Flight 77 was headed toward Washington .
Was that the first notification , 9:25 , that NORAD or DOD had that Flight 77 was probably hijacked ?
And , if it was , do you know why it took 15 minutes for FAA to notify NORAD ?
General Eberhardt said , " Sir , there 's one minor difference : I saw it as 9:24 , which you do as well , that we were notified , and that 's the first notification we received . "
" Do you know if that was the first notification to DOD ? "
" Yes , sir , that 's the first documented notification that we received . "
And I want to focus on the word " documented , " because it 's very important for us to know when NORAD actually received notification , given the fact that planes had already crashed into the World Trade Center , and given I am sure the assumption that these were terrorist acts and there could be more coming , more planes coming .
Is it in fact correct , sir , that the first notification of any type that NORAD received was not until 9:24 with respect to Flight 77 ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : With your concurrence , sir , I would like to ask General Arnold to address that .
He was on the floor that morning .
GEN .
ARNOLD : Thank you .
The simple answer to your question is I believe that to be a fact : that 9:24 was the first time that we had been advised of American 77 as a possible hijacked airplane .
Our focus -- you have got to remember that there 's a lot of other things going on simultaneously here , was on United 93 , which was being pointed out to us very aggressively I might say by the FAA .
Because our radars looking outward and not inward , the only way for us to know where anything was was for the FAA to pass along that information to us .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Well , is it not the case , General Arnold , that there was an open line established between FAA , NORAD and other agencies , including CIA and FBI , that morning ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Well , I was n't on that line at that particular time if that were the case .
In fact , there is an open line established between our sectors at really the tactical level where they are controlling the aircraft talking to the FAA controllers from time to time .
We did not have an open line at that time with the FAA .
That is not accurate .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : You did not .
You were not -- NORAD was not in contact -- GEN .
ARNOLD : The continental United States NORAD region , my headquarters , responsible for the continental United States air defense , did not have an open line with the FAA at that time .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Was there some NORAD office that had an open line with the FAA -- GEN .
ARNOLD : Our -- MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Excuse me .
Let me finish my question , please .
Was there some NORAD office -- and you 'll forgive us because we had asked for this information prior to the hearing from FAA and did not receive it -- but we are advised that there was indeed an open line between either the net or some other name given to a -- essentially an ongoing conference where under , in real time , FAA was providing information as it received it , immediately after the first crash into the Towers , we were told , with respect to each of the events that were ongoing of any remarkable nature ?
I see General McKinley is nodding .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : I 'd like to , if I may , address this , based on my research and review for this commission .
It 's my understanding that the FAA was in contact with our Northeast Air Defense Sector at Rome , New York .
Understanding the relationship of how we defend North America from threats , NORAD located in Peterson Air Force Base , Colorado Springs , our continental NORAD region , our air operations center located at Tindel Air Force Base in Florida -- that 's where the joint force air component commander resides .
And then we have three sectors based on the size and volume of our country that handle that .
It is my understanding from talking with both FAA and our supervisors at the Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome , that those lines were open and that they were discussing these issues .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : So , is it fair to say that at least the NORAD personnel in Rome , New York , had information available to it in real time once it saw -- and we were advised that this occurred at 9:02 , which was then 22 minutes earlier that Flight 77 first was observed deviating from its course , something which in the context of what was going on that day would be quite interesting , if not remarkable ?
Colonel Scott , any comments ?
MR .
SCOTT : Sir , I think it's also important to understand that like the CONUS region , the FAA is also broken down into subordinate command and control centers as well .
I know that the Boston center was talking directly to the Northeast sector .
I do n't believe Flight 77 was in Boston Center 's airspace .
They were in Cleveland .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : I think the FAA can report accurately on this , but I believe 77 was in Cleveland Center airspace when it developed the problem where they lost its radar image .
And I believe -- and the FAA again can testify better to this -- they would take action based on losing that identification in Cleveland .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Well , actually I think according to the information that we have , the first indication was not a loss of radar contact but rather a course deviation with respect to Flight 77 .
Now , I do n't mean to take up any more time on this , because we are going to want to follow up on all of this information in great detail .
But let me ask whether there is regularly made a tape recording of these open - line communications .
GEN .
ARNOLD : (?)
Not to my knowledge .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Not to my knowledge .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Does FAA to your knowledge keep a recording of these crisis situations ?
GEN . ARNOLD : (? )
I am unaware , but I would certainly direct that to them , please .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
To the best of your knowledge , you do n't have anything further to shed light on when you first learned -- you , NORAD -- first learned of Flight 77's probable hijack status prior to 9:24 a.m.?
GEN . ARNOLD : (? ) I can provide that for the record .
I do not have any further knowledge at this time .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : We would ask that you do so .
GEN .
ARNOLD : (?)
Yes , sir .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Thank you , Mr. Chairman .
I will have some other questions after .
MR .
KEAN : Secretary Lehman .
MR .
LEHMAN : Thank you .
General , I would also like to echo my colleagues ' expression of great admiration for you and your predecessor , your command and your pilots , even though they might require long runways to land .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : We understand .
MR .
LEHMAN : One of the most serious responsibilities we have in addition to air security is identifying the real dysfunctions in our intelligence system that contributed to the tragedy .
And we had prior as you know to your testimony Secretary Mineta , who indicated despite the fact of this long litany of events and intelligence reports of the growing probability that aircraft would be used as weapons , nothing ever got to him , and nothing apparently got to you , and I assume , General Arnold , nothing got to you .
This would seem to be a pretty significant failure of our system , because it exists to provide product precisely to you , the most important users tasked with defending it .
So I would like to ask -- we 'll provide you a copy of this , which is from the Joint Inquiry staff statement -- if you could give us your studied assessment of what went wrong in the way you interact with , your command interacts with the intelligence community , and why the product did not get to you .
These were pretty dramatic events , facts and intelligence reports .
It would be very helpful to us to have your assessments as a customer of the system to what went so seriously wrong that you were still only looking out .
There 's another , an issue that I would ask perhaps General Arnold to address , because there 's a great deal of unease and distress , I think understandably , among many of the families that somehow those aircraft should have been shot down if people had not made mistakes .
And I wonder if you would just take us through each flight , given the posture that NORAD was in at the time , which was national policy and not whatever based on erroneous intelligence perhaps .
But given that posture and given the times that NORAD was notified of the deviation from -- the possibility of hijacking , could the aircraft on alert for instance at Otis have intercepted ?
And then if you could also take us through 77 and 93 as well with the F - 16s , which -- and if you would tell us as you take us through what the armament was on the F - 15s and the F - 16s that were scrambled against 77 and 93 .
GEN .
ARNOLD : Thank you , sir , and I will try to do that to the best of my ability .
And perhaps General McKinley has some data that he could shed light on , because I have been retired a little while , and do not have access to the staff for some of the very specifics on that .
But I will try to do my best .
As you know from previous testimony from General Eberhardt to Congress , we were in the middle of a NORAD exercise at that particular time , which means that basically our entire staff was focused on being able to do the air operations center mission , which was our job to do .
We had just come out of a video teleconference with the NORAD staff and with our folks at that particular time , when I was handed a note that we had a possible hijacking at Boston center , and it had come from the Northeast Air Defense Command , Colonel Bob Mahr ( ph ) , who is commander up there , and he had requested that I call him immediately .
And I was upstairs in our facility , immediately went downstairs , picked up the phone , asking on the way to my staff , " Is this part of the exercise ? "
Because quite honestly , and frankly we do do hijacking scenarios as we go through these exercises from time to time .
But I realized that it was not .
This was real life .
And I also remembered as I went downstairs , before I even talked to him , that it had been a long time since we had had a hijacking , but the fact that we had reviewed the procedures of what it is we do for a hijacking , because we were in the middle of an exercise .
So we were pretty well familiar with those procedures , and of course we have our own checklist that we follow .
As I picked up the phone , Bob told me that Boston Center had called possible hijacking within the system .
He had put the aircraft at Otis on battle stations , wanted permission to scramble them .
I told them to go ahead and scramble the airplanes and we'd get permission later .
And the reason for that is that the procedure -- hijacking is a law enforcement issue , as is everything that takes off from within the United States .
And only law enforcement can request assistance from the military , which they did in this particular case .
The route , if you follow the book , is they go to the duty officer of the national military center , who in turn makes an inquiry to NORAD for the availability of fighters , who then gets permission from someone representing the secretary of Defense .
Once that is approved then we scramble aircraft .
We did n't wait for that .
We scrambled the aircraft , told them get airborne , and we would seek clearances later .
I picked up the phone , called NORAD , whose battle staff was in place because of the exercise , talked to the deputy commander for operations .
He said , you know , " I understand , and we 'll call the Pentagon for those particular clearances . "
It was simultaneous almost for that decision that we made that I am looking at the TV monitor of the news network and see a smoking hole in what turned out to be the North Tower of the World Trade Center , wondering , What is this ?
And like many of us involved in that , Does it have anything to do with this particular incident ?
Which we did n't think it did , because we were talking Boston Center , and we were not thinking of the immediate New York metropolitan area .
Shortly after that , of course our airplanes became airborne .
It just so happens that Colonel Duffy , who was a pilot of that first F - 15 , had been involved in some conversation because , as telephone calls were made , he was aware that there was a hijacking in the system .
It 's kind of interesting because he concluded that that indeed might have been that airplane himself , and [ he ] elected to hit the afterburner and to speed up his way towards New York .
It was then very shortly thereafter that we saw on television the second airplane , United 175 , crash into the South Tower .
And the first thing that I think most of us felt was , was this a rerun of the first event ?
And then it turned out to be the second event .
We had no warning of that whatsoever .
In fact , that airplane was called possibly hijacked later on , which as General McKinley referred to , as the fog and friction of war , actually caused further confusion , because we were not aware which aircraft actually crashed into the towers .
We just knew that by now we had two airplanes that have crashed into the towers .
We have two airplanes that are called hijacked .
Again , we are still minutes away -- I think the record said eight minutes away from New York City with F - 15s that are moving very rapidly in that direction .
Now we have , before I get to 77 , if it were , we get a call of United Flight 93 .
MR .
LEHMAN : Before you go to that , I just wanted to just make -- there was no possibility given the lateness with which you were notified from FAA of a possible hijacking that those airplanes in full after burner flying supersonic could have gotten there in time to intercept either of those two flights .
Is that correct ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : That 's correct .
That 's correct .
The first aircraft , of course , American 11 , crashed before our interceptors were airborne .
We ordered the scramble almost simultaneously ; our records show the same minute .
I 'm not even sure which occurred first , but it was almost simultaneous that we ordered the scramble of the aircraft , and the impact into the North Tower had occurred .
And so by the time even the pilot accelerating to 1.5 mach , moving pretty fast , was still eight minutes out by the time the second aircraft had crashed into the tower .
And though when the second aircraft crashed into the tower , by now , you know , I think Secretary Mineta said , this becomes a pattern certainly .
I would like to tell you that I was absolutely certain at that time that we were under an attack , but I was not absolutely certain we were under attack at that particular time .
But we knew that this pattern had to be dealt with at that particular time .
And then very shortly thereafter we got a call from on the United 93 flight being a possible hijacking .
And that aircraft , as you -- well , I do n't know if you know , but it wandered around .
That aircraft wandered around and flew up over the northern part of Pennsylvania and Ohio .
Mixed in with this was a call about a Delta flight that was possibly hijacked .
So now our focus is we are under attack .
What are we going to do in order to be in position to intercept another aircraft should it threaten someplace in the United States ?
That place of course , we would not know .
In the Northeast at this particular time we had no other aircraft available .
The aircraft out of Otis had taken off .
We looked at aircraft that were returning from a Michigan , an Air Michigan National Guard aircraft returning from the range , because at one time we thought either the Delta flight or the United 93 might pose a threat to Detroit .
We tried to get airplanes airborne out of the Toledo Air National Guard at that particular time .
Can you get anything airborne ?
Because we have this United 93 and this Delta .
We need to intercept it and see what is going on with those particular aircraft .
Syracuse , New York Air National Guard unit -- we inquired with them , their ability to get airborne , and ultimately they did somewhat later at that particular time .
And so in the record you see the time when we were notified of the American Flight 77 as being a possible hijack .
And I can tell you that I did not know , and I do n't believe anybody in the NORAD system , knew where that airplane was .
We were advised it was possibly hijacked .
And we had launched almost simultaneously with that , we launched the aircraft out of Langley to put them over top of Washington , D.C. , not in response to American Airline 77 , but really to put them in position in case United 93 were to head that way .
They were the closest fighters we had , and we started vectoring them to move towards the Washington , D.C. area , to -- MR.
LEHMAN : Did they also go into burner ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : No , sir .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , they , based on their configuration , traveled at .98 Mach , roughly 575 knots , 660 miles per hour , about 10 nautical miles per minute .
MR .
LEHMAN : If they had gone into burner , could they have gotten there in time to get 77 ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I think if those aircraft had gotten airborne immediately , if we were operating under something other than peacetime rules , where they could have turned immediately toward Washington , D.C. , and gone into burner , it is physically possible that they could have gotten over Washington , D.C. MR .
LEHMAN : Why did they head out to sea first ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Our standard -- we have agreements with the FAA , and by the way we are looking outward .
This is an advantage to us , and so we'd have agreements for clearance .
When we scramble an aircraft , there is a line that is picked up , and the FAA and everyone is on that line .
And the aircraft take off and they have a predetermined departure route .
And of course , it 's not over water , because our mission , unlike law enforcement 's mission , is to protect things coming towards the United States .
And I might even add in all of our terrorist scenarios that we run , the aircraft , if we were to intercept aircraft , it is usually always from outside the United States coming towards us .
So our peacetime procedures , to de-conflict with civil aviation 's , so as to not have endanger civil aviation in any particular way .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Secretary Lehman , also if I may add , the complexity of the air traffic over the Northeast corridor is so complex that to just launch fighters , as you know , sir , from your background , into that air traffic system can cause potential damage or midair collision .
So we rely on the FAA to de-conflict those corridors .
And that is another reason why it vectored east originally .
MR .
LEHMAN : The armament on the F - 15s and the F - 16s was ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : The armament , as I recall , and General McKinley can correct me on that , we had full - up armament on all those aircraft with both radar and heat - seeking missiles as well as guns .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : AIM - 7 , - 8 , - 9 .
MR .
LEHMAN : So , to continue with 77 , it 's fair to say if you had got a more timely notification from FAA , and particularly with regard to where it was heading , that those F - 16s launched from Langley could possibly have gotten there before they hit the Pentagon ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : It is certainly physically possible that they could have gotten into the area .
And the speculation is as to whether we could actually have intercepted the aircraft by that time , because everything that we were doing , remember , was being relayed from the FAA .
We had no visibility on those aircraft -- could n't see , we had no radars , could n't talk to our pilots .
FAA did a marvelous job during that period of time in doing radio relays and assisting us with being able to control them .
MR .
LEHMAN : Now , had 93 not crashed , would it not have been possible for the F - 16s to have intercepted 93 , and do you think they would have ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : It was our intent to intercept United Flight 93 .
And in fact my own staff , we were orbiting now over Washington , D.C. by this time , and I was personally anxious to see what 93 was going to do , and our intent was to intercept it .
But we decided to stay over Washington , D.C. , because there was not that urgency .
And if there were other aircraft coming from another quadrant , another vector , we would have been pulled off station , and we would not have been able to -- there might have been an aircraft that popped up within the system closer that would have posed a larger threat to the Washington , D.C. area .
So we elected to remain over D.C. until that aircraft was definitely coming towards us .
And , as you know , the brave men and women who took over that aircraft prevented us from making the awful decision which the young men that were flying those aircraft would have lived with for the rest of their lives if they had to do that .
MR .
LEHMAN : In a short answer , why with the previous attempt of a light plane to hit the White House , was n't Andrews Air Force Base with F - 16s and Marine F - 18s available , part of the alert ?
And I understand , and I 'd also like to have you comment on what the role of the Secret Service was in scrambling those F - 16s .
GEN .
ARNOLD : Are you talking about scrambling the -- MR .
LEHMAN : Andrews -- GEN .
ARNOLD : The Andrews airplanes .
It is my understanding that the Secret Service -- obviously they work with the 113th , because the president 's Air Force One is located out at Andrews Air Force Base .
So they had personal knowledge of those , of the people out there and the telephone number , and were - I cannot speculate whether they knew what we were doing or not , but in the urgency to get something done they made a phone call to the 113th , I learned later -- I did not know that at the time -- and asked them to get anything they could airborne , and I think the quote was " to protect the House . "
GEN .
MCKINLEY : And the 113th is the 113th Fighter Wing at Andrews , the District of Columbia Air National Guard F - 16 Wing .
GEN .
ARNOLD : And not part of NORAD .
MR .
LEHMAN : Now , you said that the clear delineation was you were looking outward , and to do anything inward you had to get authorization from a law enforcement agency .
And that is covered , as I understand it , by JCS instruction 3610 on aircraft piracy .
In that instruction , as I read it , which I believe is still in effect -- GEN .
MCKINLEY : That 's correct , sir .
MR . LEHMAN : -- you do n't have any delegated authority to interdict .
In fact , there is no mention of interdiction , and it 's purely an escort function .
This is still in effect .
Now , presumably you are not following it to the letter , and I would like you to speak to what the chain of command is now .
Who has authority to interdict , to shoot down , where is it delegated , and are there published rules of engagement as to what criteria apply to make that decision ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , I 'd be happy to answer that , and I thank General Arnold for the comments about the actual data .
I appreciate him being here today .
Quite frankly , sir , since September 11th , 2001 , the Department of Defense , United States Air Force has put a lot of resources into what we call Operation Noble Eagle .
As President Bush said , it 's the second front on the war on terrorism .
And , as I said in my opening remarks , we have flown 30,000 sorties .
In fact overhead today here our Noble Eagle pilots are flying , in addition to being supplanted with ground - based air defense artillery .
A lot of effort has gone into taking a look at the things that were not done right prior to prepare ourselves for the aftermath .
And it is an honor for me to represent the men and women who do that .
Quite frankly , our relationships began at 9/11 , and the aftermath , with General Arnold and our staff to work with the Federal Aviation Administration to bring in those radar facilities so our controllers at our Northeast , Southeast and Western Air Defense sectors had visibility internally now .
And that has been completed .
In addition to seeing internally to the United States , we must be able to communicate to the pilots who fly our interceptor missions , so we can have clear lines of control back to our command element , General Eberhart , in Colorado Springs .
MR .
LEHMAN : Just to interrupt now , on the radar visibility , are you dependent on the FAA radars , which can have very little capability in a non-transponder environment , or can you , do you have the better air defense radar ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , we try to put the best radars in effect for the mission .
Most of those are FAA radars .
Most of them are old radars , but they 've been maintained properly , and we are actually putting Department of Defense people out to make sure those radars are calibrated for our mission .
So therefore we are using their radars .
We are using air control squadrons , both active duty Guard and Reserve , to supplement those .
We in fact use the United States Navy every chance we can , because their Aegis cruisers are so capable that we link their pictures into our air combat command center at Tindel .
So we are doing the absolute best job with the resources we have been given to make sure that internal picture now is transparent to our air battle managers , so that military controllers , when asked now , can pinpoint immediately an aircraft in distress , that we can find the nearest suitable fighter location , which I can say is substantial today .
In open testimony I would not like to go into the details of the numbers of alert facilities , but it goes up and down depending on the threat .
It is internal now to the United States , which it was n't on the 11th of September .
So this capacity , this Operation Noble Eagle , which gives the military far more responsibility and latitude to do this mission now , has allowed us to be far more capable .
And we have been involved in every airline incident that we have been asked to perform with , with the Federal Aviation Administration subsequent to 9/11 , whether there be a disturbance onboard , whether it be an aircraft emergency , whether it be to protect critical infrastructure , our major population centers .
We are there .
MR .
LEHMAN : To follow up on that , General Arnold , did you have authority to shoot down 93 when it was heading towards Washington ?
And where did you get it ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : A lot of discussion on that .
Our intent on United 93 -- the simple answer is , to my knowledge , I did not have authority to shoot that aircraft down .
We were informed after the airplane had already hit the ground .
That 's the simple answer .
MS .
GORELICK : I 'm sorry , could you say that again ?
You were informed of what after it hit the ground ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : We were informed of presidential authority some five minutes after that aircraft had hit the ground , according to our records .
MR .
LEHMAN : So you were given it after the fact , presidential authority to shoot it down ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : To my knowledge .
Now , I can tell you that in our discussion with the NORAD staff at that particular time that we -- you know , we intended to intercept that aircraft at some point in time , attempted to deviate that aircraft away from the Washington , D.C. area .
There was discussion at that particular time whether or not that aircraft would be shot down .
But we , I did not know of presidential shoot down authority until after that aircraft had crashed .
MR .
LEHMAN : Mmm-hmm .
And , General McKinley , could you take us to the present and where those authorities lie now ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Yes , sir .
Subsequent to 9/11 , the president delegated to the secretary of Defense , delegated to the combatant commander at NORAD , and now United States Northern Command , has the authority to declare a hostile target .
Our fighter interceptors will be in position to accept that hostile declaration , and the clearance authorities will be passed up to the highest authority .
We have improved our communications equipment .
We have secure telephones that allow us to contact immediately the powers in the chain of command .
And I , as the joint force air component commander , have delegated emergency authority in the very rare occasion where a telephone fails or we cannot get authority , and under emergency powers can exercise that authority .
So the clearances now are in place .
General Eberhart is in place in Colorado Springs , or his designated representative .
We exercised this in real world , not exercise , probably between eight and 15 times a week .
So it 's been well documented .
Any national security event will bring together the forces and those lines of communication are open now .
Clearances are there .
MR .
LEHMAN : Thank you .
As you know , our rules of engagement are many V - 1 , so I will take rest and let my colleagues go at you .
MR .
KEAN : Commissioner Ben-Veniste .
MR . BEN - VENISTE : Thank you , Mr. Chairman .
Following up on this shootdown authority , General Arnold , from what source did you receive the shootdown authority ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I did not receive shootdown authority .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : You say it was received subsequent to the crash of 93 ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Yes , that 's correct .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : From what source was that received ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : It was passed down to us from the NORAD , from Cheyenne Mountain , that they had received shootdown authority .
And then , you know , the timeframe escapes me at the moment , but you know for example over the Washington , D.C. area it was declared a no - fly zone by clear -- just by the fact that any aircraft was present , if we could not determine if that aircraft was friendly , then we were cleared to shoot that aircraft down .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
When was the declaration of no - fly zone authorized ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I do n't know .
It was shortly during that timeframe .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
So are you saying that that declaration gave you shootdown authority ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : It gave us -- that particular declaration that I am referring to is a class bravo airspace within the Washington , D.C. area that was shut down to aviation , except for military or for law enforcement emergency response aircraft at that particular time .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
To help me understand , does it mean once that condition exists , that unless you were able to determine that this was a friendly aircraft , which under the circumstances I suppose means under the control of the terrorists at that time making it an unfriendly aircraft , that you had authority -- GEN .
ARNOLD : That 's correct .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : -- by whatever means to bring that down ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Yes .
The -- MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
At what time during this process was that order issued , and who issued it ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I do not know who issued it .
It is my understanding it was issued by the president , or the vice president in his stead , that that order was issued .
And it was issued around the time that we decided to put all the aircraft on the ground , as Secretary Mineta had referred to , at that particular time .
So -- MR.
BEN - VENISTE :
We would ask you to supplement your testimony today with specific information about that .
At what point was , to the best of your knowledge , any order received from either the president or the vice president of the United States with respect to action to be taken by the military in connection with the ongoing situation ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : It was my understanding that that occurred , the direct communication , to me .
I can't answer if it was done at a higher level at some point in time around five minutes after the United 93 had crashed into Pennsylvania .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
And so you will be able to check the records of NORAD generally , or the DOD generally , to find out when a presidential directive was issued ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I am sure General McKinley will do that for me .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Thank you .
And if I understand the context of what you said about closing the perimeter around Washington , the president 's directive or the vice president 's directive would have been moot , because of the prior order , which would have enabled you to shoot down an unfriendly plane in that sector ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : We developed a certain -- I guess the short answer again , that is correct .
But it 's very specifically in the Washington , D.C. area by presence that aircraft was hostile unless we could determine it was friendly .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Let me go to the issue again to revisit Flight 77 , because as we understand it , tragically , it appears that that was the only plane which reached its intended target which might have been interdicted that day , if everything had gone right .
Are you in agreement with that ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I think , from a physics perspective , yes .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Let 's go beyond physics for a moment , and let me ask you about the planes which were scrambled from Andrews Air Force Base .
MR. : Langley .
MR. BEN - VENISTE : No , from Andrews Air Force Base by the Secret Service of the United States .
Who gave the order to scramble jets -- F - 16s also , I believe -- out of Andrews ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : It 's my understanding that the Secret Service requested that they launch anything they could to get them airborne .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Of whom did they make that request ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I 'm not sure if it 's General Dave Worley ( ph ) , and I think they actually talked to him .
And I did not know this at time of course , but they called him up and said , What do you have that you can get airborne ?
He had some airplanes returning from the range on training mission .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : What would be the flight time from Andrews Air Force Base of two F - 16s to the Pentagon ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : From the time they were notified ?
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Yes .
GEN .
ARNOLD : Probably 15 to 20 minutes , because it takes about 10 minutes to get airborne , and they are not set up on alert or scrambled .
In fact , it could have taken , f they did n't have any airplanes immediately ready to go , it could have taken them 20 , 30 minutes .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : And under the circumstances -- GEN .
ARNOLD : They already had airplanes airborne .
By the time those airplanes were airborne we had airplanes over Washington , D.C. MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Right .
Now if the order had been given to Andrews , even simultaneously with the order that you gave to scramble your planes , is it not fair to say that those planes would have reached the Pentagon sooner ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : They might have , but they would have been unarmed .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , what would be my comment , sir , is those aircraft are not prepped or built up for that mission .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE :
And in fact we have received reports that are almost incredible in terms of the bravery of the two pilots who went up that day in unarmed aircraft with the mission , I presume authorized somewhere in the executive , to use their airplanes to bring down Flight 77 or 93 if they could interdict them .
That means to clip their wings , crash into them , perhaps the pilots at the risk of their own lives .
Is that correct ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , as I evacuated the Pentagon that morning , as I came out the river entrance and looked up , virtually simultaneously those F - 16s coming back from the range had been airborne , had dropped their weapons , were returning low on fuel -- were visible to 10 to 15,000 people , and it was a very heartening sight to see United States Air Force fighters overhead the Pentagon .
And it is my understanding from the review of the records that that was their guidance .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : And who provided that guidance to them ?
Was that a decision made internally by Secret Service , or did Secret Service require higher executive order in order to launch those planes on that mission ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I do not know that .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : I am unaware of the answer to that , sir .
MR .
BEN - VENISTE : Mr. Chairman , thank you very much , gentlemen .
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Thank you .
MR .
KEAN : One question .
Suppose for a minute that this weekend , God forbid , that some terrorists got on board another plane in Boston and headed for New York .
What would be different ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Sir , I am very proud to say that I think the interagency process has worked very , very well .
The Transportation Security Administration , under the direction of Secretary Ridge , has implemented stringent procedures on the ground .
Let 's face it : solving this problem before the terrorists get on the airplane , I think , is the most critical step to protecting commercial aviation , because once the airplane is in the air , then it resolves back to the Department of Defense to take the appropriate action .
So TSA deserves a great deal of credit .
The Federal Aviation Administration , with their procedures , and they way they are lashed up with us now and the military , and the formation of the Northern Command , I think is vitally important to the security of the United States of America .
I think those things in context make it far less likely for this to happen .
But , as my boss says , we are not 100 percent safe .
We can never be 100 percent safe .
I take nothing for granted when I am in our air operations center when any aircraft fails to communicate or fails to make a turn or fails to do what its flight plan said it was supposed to .
So we are very , very serious today about what 's happening in the skies over America .
MR .
KEAN : But if it were able to get into the air , headed for New York , what procedures exist now that did n't exist then ?
Would you be able to intercept them ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : It 's my understanding and firm belief that the Federal Aviation Administration would immediately notify us at the first sign of any impropriety , in any aircraft , whether it 's commercial , cargo or civilian .
We would immediately take action to get our fighters airborne from the nearest suitable location -- and we have that location set now where we did n't have it prior to the 11th .
We should be able to protect our critical infrastructure , our major population centers .
But there is , as in any case of a military effort , there are some risks .
But we are postured to accept that responsibility .
The example you gave us out of Boston is the F - 15s out of Otis would be immediately scrambled , they would immediately intercept the aircraft , and we would stand by for further authorities from those above us .
GEN .
ARNOLD : And I want to just point out that if the question was if it were to happen today , you have airborne interceptors that would be vectored into that aircraft to intercept .
MR .
KEAN : Commissioner Hamilton ?
MR. HAMILTON : I just want to clarify a few things after listening to all this testimony .
It 's not all that clear to me .
As of September 11th , only the president had the authority to order a shootdown of a commercial aircraft .
GEN .
ARNOLD : That 's correct , sir .
MR .
HAMILTON : And today who has the authority ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : We see the president delegated to the secretary of Defense , delegated to the combatant commander of Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Command , and there are emergency authorities if that fails .
MR .
HAMILTON : So you have the authority ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : Yes , sir , and others .
MR .
HAMILTON : And how many others ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : I prefer not to say in this forum , sir , but I can provide it for the record .
MR .
HAMILTON : And you do not have to go up the chain of command at all in the event of a -- GEN .
MCKINLEY : We certainly will try , we will make every effort to try .
MR .
HAMILTON : I 'm sure you would .
But you do n't have to ?
GEN .
MCKINLEY : In an emergency situation we can take appropriate action , yes , sir .
MR .
HAMILTON : Now , one of the things that 's curious to me , General Arnold , you said that you did not learn of the presidential order until after United 93 had already crashed .
That was about a little after 10 o'clock in the morning .
The first notice of difficulty here was at 8:20 in the morning when a transponder goes off on the American Flight 11 .
I do n't know how significant that is , but 20 minutes later you had notification of the possible hijack .
So there 's a long lapse of time here between the time you are initially alerted and you receive the order that you can shoot that aircraft down .
Am I right about that ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : That 's correct .
MR .
HAMILTON : In your timeline , why do n't you put in there when you were notified ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Of which flight , sir ?
MR .
HAMILTON : Getting the notification from the president of the United States that you had the authority to shoot a commercial aircraft down is a pretty significant event .
Why would that not be in your timeline ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I do n't know when that happened .
MR .
HAMILTON : Had you ever received that kind of a notice before ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Not to my knowledge .
MR .
HAMILTON : So this is the first time in the history of the country that such an order had ever been given , so far as you know ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Yes , sir .
I 'm sure there 's a log that would tell us that , and I appreciate the question .
MR .
HAMILTON : Maybe you could let us know that .
And then , finally , as I understand your testimony , it was not possible to shoot down any of these aircraft before they struck .
Is that basically correct ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : That is correct .
In fact , the American Airlines 77 , if we were to have arrived overhead at that particular point , I do n't think that we would have shot that aircraft down .
MR .
HAMILTON : Because ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : Well , we had not been given authority -- MR .
HAMILTON : You did n't have authority at that point .
GEN .
ARNOLD : And , you know , it is through hindsight that we are certain that this was a coordinated attack on the United States .
MR .
LEHMAN : But had you gotten notified earlier , 77's deviance , about when it turned east , for instance , certainly you could have gotten the F - 16s there , and certainly there would have been time to communicate to either get or deny authority , no ? -- for 77 ?
GEN .
ARNOLD : I believe that to be true .
I believe tha

To get a better idea of what ails the world , let ’s use our imagination to transport ourselves into outer space .
From there , we can look down on Earth not as an American or as a European , but as a disinterested alien .
We see a collection of sovereign nations — some large , some small , some powerful and some weak .
We also see that some of the powerful nations do not respect the sovereignty of some of the others .
For example , by what right do the United States and the Europeans tell Iran it cannot enrich uranium ?
Other nations enrich uranium .
Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and it grants the right to enrich uranium .
Where does the United States get off telling the Iranians they ca n’t do it ?
Oh , the U.S. claims Iran wants to build nuclear weapons .
Well , first and foremost , Iran denies that , and there is no proof to the contrary .
But suppose Iran does want to build nuclear weapons .
Why should n’t it ?
We have nukes .
The British , the French , the Russians , the Chinese , the Indians , the Pakistanis and the Israelis all have nuclear weapons .
Why should n’t Iran ?
For that matter , what right does anyone have to tell the North Koreans they can’t have nukes and ca n’t even test their missiles ?
Everybody else tests the missiles .
What you see is that the United States and some of the European states are still trying to run the world to suit them , even though formal colonialism has been a long time dead .
President Bush seems to think that he has the right to engineer regime change in any country he chooses .
The U.S. record on regime change is poor .
One reason so many Iranians hate us is because we engineered a regime change in the 1950s that threw out their elected nationalist leader and replaced him with the Shah .
A lot of Iranians were executed , tortured and imprisoned before the Iranian people could finally get rid of him .
What right do we have to tell Syria and Iran that they can’t supply arms to Hezbollah ?
We supply arms to Israel .
In fact , we are about the world ’s largest arms peddler .
Mr. Bush calls Hezbollah a terrorist organization .
The government of Lebanon and the European Union do not .
Just because an American politician sticks a label on a group of people does n’t mean those people lose all of their rights .
I do n’t think the world will know peace until all the nations of the world agree to respect each other ’s sovereignty .
That means no sanctions , no externally arranged coups , no invasions , no refusal to talk .
We would do much better if we talked to the Iranians and North Koreans and , while acknowledging their right to nuclear technology , offered incentives — including a security guarantee — not to develop it .
You know , of course , that the U.S. refuses to talk to the Iranians and the North Koreans and has refused their requests for security guarantees .
Countries do n’t like to be " dissed " any more than individuals do .
I ’ve been accused by some right - wingers of not liking America .
As usual , they have it wrong .
I love America , but I do n’t like this present administration one bit .
I think the Bushies are a dangerous combination of ignorance and arrogance , and that they act in a reckless manner .
They ignore what they should pay attention to and pay attention to what they should ignore .
Bush seems intent on pursuing regime change in Syria and Iran .
If he persists , he will likely unleash a regional war , the consequences of which will be catastrophic .
What have you gotten for your $ 300 billion , your 2,600 dead , your 8,000 seriously maimed in Bush ’s ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Stability ?
Do n’t make me laugh .
Security ?
America is hated in more parts of the world today than at any time in its history .
What has Bush done right ?
Before you resurrect the slogan " Stay the course , " remember that one of the definitions of insanity is to keep doing the wrong thing .
Let ’s face it , folks .
We elected ourselves a disaster .
Bush did n’t understand the world when he was elected ; he does n’t now ; and when he goes home to Crawford , Texas , he will still be puzzled by it all .
