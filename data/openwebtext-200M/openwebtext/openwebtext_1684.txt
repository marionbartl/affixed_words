TORONTO - Thousands of people in downtown Toronto were left without power over the lunch hour Wednesday during an outage believed to have been caused by an underground cable .
In all , an estimated 20,000 hydro customers saw their power go down around 11:35 a.m. ET -- an event that flooded the Internet with tweets about people trapped in elevators .
Still , the city and its major institutions took the blackout in stride .
A major hospital switched to emergency power , subway trains and streetcars were unaffected , and the headquarters of the major banks managed to keep their lights on .
One Tim Hortons continued selling its remaining donuts to customers after its coffee ran dry .
With the G20 summit of world leaders coming to the city at month 's end , at least one business saw it as an opportunity to put its summit backup plan to work .
" We 've had to shut down our office and send everybody home , " said Jeff Sciarra , who works at a technology company .
" But we have our G20 plan in place , and we 're trying to enable that right now , " said Sciarra , who added most people would be working from home .
The major disruptions expected from G20 security measures , and the threat of protests , reportedly has many downtown businesses making contingency plans , including having staff work from home during the event .
Samantha Hatton , who works for a web development company on Adelaide Street , said they too were being sent home early -- but working from home was n't part of the plan .
" I 'm going to go to the mall and make the best of it , " she said .
The blacked - out area was bordered by Bay Street in the west , Jarvis in the east , Shuter in the north and Lakeshore Boulevard in the south .
While lights flickered back on shortly after 1 p.m. for most of the area , it took another 20 minutes or so to bring three remaining buildings back up .
Toronto Hydro spokeswoman Tanya Bruckmueller said it was believed an underground cable fault was to blame , and crews had turned their attention to finding the source of the problem in the afternoon .
The headquarters of the major banks were apparently not affected and the Toronto Stock Exchange was not hit by the outage .
St. Michael 's Hospital was affected but operated on emergency power , a spokeswoman said .
Firefighters were called to several buildings to help people trapped in elevators .
People were also using Twitter to say they were stuck in elevators .
One person tweeted there was someone trapped in an elevator at the CFL head office on Wellington Street , just east of Yonge .
Numerous traffic lights were knocked out in the affected area , causing traffic snarl - ups on streets already clogged with late morning traffic .
Toronto police spokeswoman Isabelle Cotton said officers were sent to those locations to keep traffic moving .

A team of scientists from the Instituto Astrofísica de Canarias ( IAC ) and the University of Texas has succeeded in identifying one of the most complex organic molecules yet found in the material between the stars , the so - called interstellar medium .
The discovery of anthracene could help resolve a decades - old astrophysical mystery concerning the production of organic molecules in space .
The researchers report their findings in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
' We have detected the presence of anthracene molecules in a dense cloud in the direction of the star Cernis 52 in Perseus , about 700 light years from the Sun , ' explains Susana Iglesias Groth , the IAC researcher heading the study .
In her opinion , the next step is to investigate the presence of amino acids .
Molecules like anthracene are prebiotic , so when they are subjected to ultraviolet radiation and combined with water and ammonia , they could produce amino acids and other compounds essential for the development of life
' Two years ago , ' says Iglesias , 'we found proof of the existence of another organic molecule , naphthalene , in the same place , so everything indicates that we have discovered a star formation region rich in prebiotic chemistry . '
Until now , anthracene had been detected only in meteorites and never in the interstellar medium .
Oxidized forms of this molecule are common in living systems and are biochemically active .
On our planet , oxidized anthracene is a basic component of aloe and has anti-inflammatory properties .
The new finding suggests that a good part of the key components in terrestrial prebiotic chemistry could be present in interstellar matter .
Since the 1980s , hundreds of bands found in the spectrum of the interstellar medium , known as diffuse spectroscopic bands , have been known to be associated with interstellar matter , but their origin has not been identified until now .
This discovery indicates that they could result from molecular forms based on anthracene or naphthalene .
Since they are widely distributed in interstellar space , they might have played a key role in the production of many of the organic molecules present at the time of the formation of the Solar System .
The results are based on observations carried out at the William Herschel Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma in the Canary Islands and with the Hobby - Eberly Telescope in Texas in the United States .
Sometimes , recessions can breed a hunker - down - and - save mentality .
Not so this time .
Canadian household debt - a perennial worry in recent years - has ballooned to a point where it's now more than double 1989 levels - just as rising borrowing costs are set to squeeze budgets , a national report cautioned Tuesday .
Household debt in Canada reached a record $ 1.41 - trillion in December .
If that was spread among all Canadians , each person would carry more than $ 41,740 in outstanding debt - an amount 2.5 times greater than 1989 after adjusting for inflation and population growth , according to a report by the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada .

And Canadians are okay with taking on still more debt .
Nearly 60 per cent of respondents whose debt had increased through the recession - and 92 per cent whose debt decreased or stayed the same - still felt they could either manage it well or take on more debt .

The recession has done little to dampen Canadians ' enthusiasm for taking on debt , the 13 - page study said .
" This report is another indication of Canadians ' readiness to consume today and pay later , " said Anthony Ariganello , president and chief executive of CGA - Canada .
" The concern is do they understand the full cost of paying later ? "
Canada now has the dubious distinction of ranking first in terms of debt - to - financial assets ratio among 20 OECD countries , with its debt - to - income ratio hitting 144 per cent by the end of last year .
Read the study
" The growth in household debt has been strong during good times and showed remarkable resilience during challenging times , " said Rock Lefebvre , co-author of the report .
Now , it seems " set to continue its upward trend as we navigate interesting times . "

The culture of consumption - or the habit of unrestricted spending - is likely one of the important factors explaining the unaltered trend in household borrowing , the report added .

Mortgage rates - which have been trimmed in recent days - are higher than the start of the year , and poised to rise further as the Bank of Canada readies for a rate hike in the next month or two .
If mortgage rates rise by 2 percentage points , mid-income to mid- to - high income families may have to cut about 10 per cent from other expenditures if they want to maintain the same level of spending on shelter , taxes , food and transportation , the report said .
A separate report yesterday said almost half a million more mortgage holders would be in trouble if their rates hit 5.25 per cent .
The study , by the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals , said about 375,000 mortgage holders " are already challenged " by their current payments .
Canada 's personal savings rate -- which climbed during the recession -- is now starting to fall .
The rate ebbed to 4.6 per cent in the fourth quarter , down from 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter , according to Statistics Canada data .
Tuesday 's report , based on a partly survey of 1,530 people conducted in February , advised Canadians to consolidate their credit card debt and replace it with a lower - cost line of credit .

" But it 's still debt , " Mr. Ariganello noted .
" You do n't want to hang onto it any longer than necessary . "

SAN SALVADOR , El Salvador ( AP ) 
Gang members opened fire on a bus on the outskirts of El Salvador 's capital , then doused it with gasoline and set it on fire , killing at least 14 passengers in what the president on Monday called an act of terror .
Police managed to break windows and help 13 people escape the flames but others died inside .
Sixteen people suffered injuries in the late Sunday attack , officials said .
" This is an act that seeks to generate terror among the population , " President Mauricio Funes said , adding that his security Cabinet was to meet to increase security in the country .
Violent youth gangs have besieged the public transit system in this small Central American nation to extort bus workers and largely impoverished commuters and travelers .
The armed assault was the deadliest attack this year on a passenger bus .
The attack took place in a gang - plagued part of the municipality of Mejicanos , just outside San Salvador , National Police Commissioner Carlos Ascencio said .
At least 14 people were killed , he said .
Moments later , gang members opened fire on another bus in the same neighborhood , killing two people .
Ascencio said Monday night that eight suspects had been arrested in the bus burning , including one who was detained minutes after the attack and smelled of gasoline .
Among the detained were a woman and two minors .
Earlier , Funes said seven suspects had been detained , most accused of being members of the Mara 18 street gang .
Justice Minister Manuel Melgar called the attack " a typical terrorist act , " but said the motive was under investigation .
At least 217 drivers and other employees of El Salvador 's public transport industry have been killed over the last year and a half in suspected gang attacks , said Catalino Miranda , president of the national federation of transport workers and businessmen .
Most victims were shot to death .
He said more than 50 buses had been set on fire .
Three of the burnings , including Sunday 's attack , caused deaths .
Two people were killed in a bus burning earlier this year , and one was killed last year .
Miranda estimated extortion demands had cost the industry some $ 18 million in 2009 .
El Salvador has an estimated 13,500 gang members , some 5,700 of whom are in prison .
It is one of Latin America 's most violent countries .

Locke grinds up a paste which he later applies to Boone 's head gash . ( " Hearts and Minds " )
This drug refers to the material John Locke ground up and used as a hallucinogen to " speak to the Island " .
After mixing the ingredients in a coconut bowl , the resulting paste had the color and consistency of chocolate pudding .
( " Further Instructions " )

Unanswered Questions
Is the real purpose of the drug to see visions ?
Did Locke create the mixture himself ?
The 2000s .... ushered in an era of aggressive , government - backed offshore oil production .
In May 2001 , Bush , acting on recommendations from the oil industry , signed an executive order that required federal agencies to expedite permits for energy projects and paved the way for greater domestic oil exploration .
May 18 , 2001 .
That was the day Bush and Cheney decided they could withstand a huge oil spill .
But they probably deemed it unlikely because of the Republican belief that corporations will in self - interest avoid serious risks , and take precautions to avoid catastrophes .
Only that is not true .
Bush / Cheney were aware of the many risks and gave Big Oil free rein while they restrained the good people at MMS who wanted to control the industry from doing harm .
. MMS commissioned reports .
They knew what was unsafe .
. MMS did not require certain important practices .
. MMS made regulations they then did not enforce .
Giving the pretense of safety , they were effectively neutered by Bush / Cheney who got MMS to require a mere 30 days to approve permits .
Various studies and reports alerted the oil industry .
Rig safety hinged on Blow Out Preventers which were at serious risk from failure .
But this is not the only rig at risk !
One test showed that 45 % of BOP 's failed .
An industry study four that in only six out of 11 cases had activated BOP 's prevented a spill when loss of control of well had occurred .
Yet they talk as if these BOP's are the " ultimate failsafe device , " offering absolute safety .
..oil industry executives had long known ( Blow Out Preventers ) could be vulnerable and temperamental .
Other tests showed that two " blind " shear rams were necessary for safety -- not just one .
Today , 11 of 14 Transocean rigs have two , the other three were built prior to DW Horizon .
From the NYT article today & graphic on how shear rams work :
It was the last line of defense , the final barrier between the rushing volcanic fury of oil and gas and one of the worst environmental disasters in United States history .
Its very name — the blind shear ram — suggested its blunt purpose .
When all else failed , if the crew of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig lost control of a well , if a dreaded blowout came , the blind shear ram ’s two tough blades were poised to slice through the drill pipe , seal the well and save the day .
Everything else could go wrong , just so long as " the pinchers " went right .
All it took was one mighty stroke .
On the night of April 20 , minutes after an enormous blowout ripped through the Deepwater Horizon , the rig ’s desperate crew pinned all hope on this last line of defense .
But the line did not hold .
Subsequent test show that only one side of the shears worked .
They are extremely vulnerable in that one component not working can cause the whole device to fail .
The problems highlighted by these cases were common knowledge in the drilling industry .
Blind shear rams failed time and time again just as they did on the Deepwater Horizon .
Checks were done .
They found seven which " ** had never been checked * * " for deepwater performance .
" This grim snapshot .... illustrates the lack of preparedness in the industry to shear and seal a well with the last line of defense against a blowout . "
But they moved into deeper water .
The industry argued for fewer safety checks .
This is the kind of redundancy in safety mechanisms that the president is talking about , that his Commission will investigate .
The Times also states that the MMS had not acted on it's own expert 's advice on how to minimize this shear ram failure and that the Obama administration needs to stop this .
Even when MMS enacted a rule about it , they failed to enforce it .
So it is on all sides that the failures occured , due to the wink , the nod , the Executive Order by Bush / Cheney .
A report ( May 2000 ) from our own regulators concluded that a big spill from a deepwater oil well could be disastrous , having major , disastrous effects on wildlife and wetlands .
Incoming Bush / Cheney ignored this report .
If Republicans are going to blame this disaster and its cleanup on Obama then let the true blame be placed on Bush / Cheney for enabling the oil industry to run roughshod over safety precautions , regulations and oversight .
Fortunately we now have a president who knows how to make things right and I have every confidence he will wipe out the Bush Executive Order on Expediting Permits to the oil industry :
Obama does the right thing .
One tool that the Bush Team used to approve MTR projects was an expedited permit process : Obama suspended this expedited process last week .
Government regulators told Bush / Cheney that a deepwater oil spill would be disastrous because :
McClatchy :
... there were few good ways to capture oil underwater .
They said in effect , SO WHAT ?
They cared only , only , for the oil corporations .
They did everything they could to squelch all oversight .
Hearings by Congress to do their job and oversee the MMS ?
Forget about that .
They put out the word .
No hearings that would reveal their treachery of this administration and its directives to push forward on deepwater drilling and the lack of environmental impact studies .
As clear as anything :
They put out the word : Restrain the regulators at MMS .
MMS knew better .
They had commissioned reports , they put out advice but stopped at requiring certain practices that were of great importance .
They made regulations and did not enforce them .
They were neutered , made ineffective by Bush / Cheney while giving the pretense of safety .
McClatchy : The Minerals Management Service had never required any of these backup systems to be tested despite a report it commissioned in 2003 that said these systems " should probably receive the same attention to verify functionality " as the rest of the blowout preventer .
The agency had also declined to take the modest step of requiring rigs to have these backup systems in place at all , though it had sent out a safety alert encouraging their use .
Yes , they did restrain MMS .
How can we get MMS , they pondered , to approve drilling applications quickly ?
Let 's simply make it impossible for them to do the job .
We 'll make it a requirement for MMS to make 30 - day decisions on matters concerning the environmental impact of deep water oil wells .
Thirty days .
Not 60 .
Not 90 .
Not 120 .
But 30 days .
How many days does your local Wetlands Protection
Act provide for consideration as to whether or not your building a dog house on your property will adversely impact wetlands ?
( Wetlands regulations are critical . )
Bush and Cheney , they both had oil interests or ties to companies working in that field .
From the moment Cheney had his secret meetings with oil executives we suspected he had nefarious plans .
He and George decided probably before they took over the White House that their administration was going to be oil friendly , above all else , at the expense of all else .
Environment ?
Oceans ?
Who cares ?
Sea life ?
Who cares ?
Jobs for the people ?
Who cares ?
Money for oil corporations ?
We care .
That is their mentality , those are their values .
Cronyism , corruption .
That 's GOP values .
Forget that family values thing , unless it 's our family .
The result of those GOP values ?
A spill the size of the Exxon Valdez every few days !
Eleven lives lost !
A huge oil gusher for months in our precious Gulf of Mexico and all the tragedy it entails .
They knew from the deepwater Shell Plan :
" Regaining well control in deep water may be a problem since it could require the operator to cap and control well flow at the seabed in greater water depths . . . and could require simultaneous firefighting efforts at the surface . "
Now all of us have to bear the burden of having had that president and vice president who cared more about the interests of rich oil corporations / friends / family , than about the broader interests of the American people .
They care more about the interests of oil corporations than they do about jobs , about the economy , about people losing hope and a way of life .
And many of their GOP friends and colleagues are exactly the same !
The GOP cannot -- even now in the disaster 's ongoing tragic effects -- stop saying DRILL BABY DRILL .
They shout it from the rooftops .
They preach it on tv and in Congress .
They have no common sense , no values , no care for anything else .
Just give them their oil and fast .
The earth to them is an expendable commodity , just as are rain forests , whales , the land , the marsh , the beach , the sea , the people .
All they can do now , the GOP is try to re-focus the people 's interest onto the current administration , onto jobs lost temporarily from a time - out on drilling in deepwater of 24 oil rigs so they can be checked for safe operation and plans to deal with spills .
The GOP and some Democratic politicians gain from drilling because some get huge amounts from oil corporations .
You can tell which ones get the most by listening to their speeches in favor of drilling .
From Open Secrets , amounts from BP and Oil Industry totals : John McCain ( R - AZ ) $ 36,649 & $ 2,428,287 , Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) $ 16,200 & $ 329,100 , Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK ) $ 8,500 & $ 223,326 , Mitch McConnell ( R- KY ) $ 8,500 & $ 408,400 .
This McClatchy article is a must read , especially the paragraph down a ways that begins : " The 2000 Shell plan also cautioned that an oil gusher would n't behave the same way in deepwater ... "
And the next paragraph : " Among its other warnings ... "
This will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up .
I promise .
The Shell drill plan written in 2000 by MMS , describes what we are now experiencing .
Catastrophic .
It :
indicates that some federal regulators were well aware of the potential hazards of deepwater oil production in its early years ...
Note : I hope I did not mess up attributions here , but will go check to try make sure of that .
Merging the two diaries complicates things .

What Exactly Is An Extra ?
A Day In The Life Of An Extra
Technical Information For All Extras
How To Become A Working Extra
An EXTRA is anyone who fills out the background scene of a movie , television show or commercial shot .
It could be a concert crowd , the non-specific apes in Planet of the Apes , or people on the street passing by the main actors or action .
As an EXTRA , it is your job to make the scenes being filmed , look natural and as lifelike as possible .
Extras are sometimes called Background , Atmosphere or Non-Principal performers .
You could also be a specific character like a doctor or lawyer , or a face in the crowd at a baseball game , rock concert , or rally .
It is your job to be present and service the �picture� , without getting in the way of the �stars� .
That is the general rule , unless you are � Directed� to do something special by the Director of the film .
This usually means you would be given some dialogue .
If given dialogue , you will make more money and be allowed to join the Screen Actor Guild , ( S.A.G. ) the largest actors Union .
We�ll talk about that later on .
Some extras make �extra work� a profession , and work steadily , going from project to project .
This is a way to have an exciting , flexible career in the entertainment industry .
Some people do �extra work� because it�s an interesting way to earn cash while going to school or pursuing other interests .
Some people become EXTRAS , to earn the right to join SAG .
For most EXTRA work is another way to pay the bills , while you are taking classes and learning to be a good actor , singer or dancer .
It is definitely possible that EXTRA work can lead to other work as an actor .
As a working EXTRA you will be exposed to a whole new and exciting world .
It is also a great place to start if you have other showbiz ambitions , and no experience .
You can get an overview of the entire industry and see if a career here is for you .
As an extra you are on a �live � set and can check out all the different specialty jobs it takes to make a film , everything from camera operators to electricians , wardrobe , makeup , location scouting , producing , on and on .
As an extra , you can more closely explore these possibilities .
Being on the set also gives you an chance to make valuable connections with people already working in the film or tv industry .
These experiences can help you find the best fit , and allow you to be an integral part of the entertainment industry .
As an EXTRA every day will come with a totally different schedule and routine .
Flexibility is key .
Today you may have a �call time� of 6 am ; the time that you are required to be � On Set� for filming .
To make your call time , you will have to wake up between 4:00 am and 4:30 am in order to be ready .
If you are late , you could be sent home without pay and not be allowed to work again for this company .
Promptness is ABSOLUTELY essential in getting consistent work as an EXTRA .
Once you arrive on set , you will report to the 2nd AD ( second assistant director ) , and get your payment voucher .
The 2nd AD works under , and answers to the 1st AD .
The 1st ADs job is to help the Director in every way , and hardly ever leaves his side .
The 2nd AD is in charge of the EXTRAS and everything that involves them .
Practically all of your instructions , interactions and paperwork will come through the 2nd AD or his Production Assistants .
They are known as the P.As .
The payment voucher you will receive is a time card that has your name on it .
This is what you need to guarantee you will get paid for your work .
The voucher will be filled out by you , but won�t be signed by the A.D. until the end of the day .
This helps insure you are in the right place at the right time , always exactly where you �re supposed to be .
Once you have your voucher , you will report to the wardrobe department .
Here your wardrobe will be looked at and hopefully approved .
This is usually an outfit or two that you were required to bring .
On occasion , you might receive a costume from the Production Company to wear for the shoot .
In between paper work and wardrobe and sometimes hair / make - up you can often expect to enjoy a free breakfast provided by craft services ( catering ) .
Hopefully , about an hour after the call time , filming is set to begin .
The EXTRAS are called to the set and instructed on what to do for the current scene .
These things can range from sitting or standing in a specific location , to walking behind or near the stars .
If you are lucky you may get to interact with the stars of the film .
Every EXTRA has a purpose and while some are more �seen� than others , all are important .
Your instructions will almost always come from the 2nd AD .
It is rare for the Director or 1st AD to instruct the EXTRAS personally .
Although it does happen , don�t expect to interact with them very much .
Once all the directions have been give out to cast and crew , there will be a couple of practice run throughs of the scene .
This is called Rehearsal , whether it is for the actors , extras or cameras .
Throughout this process , the Director checks that the actors have the right emotional intent , know their lines , and have their correct movements down , called Blocking .
The Director of Photography , ( called the DP ) , makes sure the lighting is right for the scene , and the cameras are set correctly .
The Gaffer ( electrician ) makes sure that all the electrical gadgets are working , while the hair and make - up people attend to the �look� of the stars .
The wardrobe and prop people are extremely busy , making sure the Actors and EXTRAS are perfect and have everything the scene requires .
When the Director is satisfied , the cameras will start rolling and actual filming will begin .
One scene can take as long as three to four hours to complete , depending on how many angles the director wants to film from , and how all the aspects come together .
Some film directors may take days with only one scene in order to get exactly what they want .
It is a very long process , and as an EXTRA , patience is a must .
This is because everything is repeated over and over again , until the Director decides it�s time to move on .
Not every EXTRA on the set will be used in all the scenes .
Those not being used in the current scene must hang out in the � Holding Area . �
This is the area away from the set , where the EXTRAS can read , play cards or try to line up work for the next day .
It is your free time to do what ever you want until being needed in a scene .
It is certainly a great time to � Network� with the other Extras .
Get friendly with other folks who do what you do , find out who hires them , and how they go about getting consistent work .
This is a wonderful opportunity to build a support system with other Extras .
Other extras are also a great source to provide insider information on where to get the best deals on photos , coaches , and what other projects are coming up in town .
Film and TV jobs usually last for a short amount of time .
Everyone on the present Production will move on to other jobs when the project is completed .
It is important to build friendships with as many of these people as you can .
We cannot stress enough that Networking is an important thing to master in the entertainment industry .
However , when you first start out you probably won�t know very many people in the industry , don�t worry .
Build relationships with as many working industry people as you go along .
Learn people�s names , exchange phone numbers and keep in contact .
Talk to everyone and everybody .
You never really know just who knows whom , and what will lead where .
If you are in � Holding � always be prepared to keep occupied , because boredom can lead to trouble .
It is also important to understand that you are there to do a job , even if that means hanging out for hours and hours and hours .
On the set , remember you are not there to talk to stars , get their autographs or take pictures with them .
In some cases EXTRAS are asked not to approach or talk to the stars on the set .
Stars are people too , and please understand that they are under a lot of stress trying to memorize lines and get their scenes just right .
Don�t take it personally if they ignore you .
They too are there to do a job , so just be honored that you get to work along with them , and are part of this exciting process .
Lunch is usually called within six hours of the Call time , because of Union rules .
Lunch will last for about an hour and is typically provided by the Production Company .
Sometimes you will be asked to provide your own lunch or told to go off lot and buy your own lunch on smaller projects .
After lunch , if you are still needed on set , you may spend the rest of the day doing the same thing as before .
This will last until the director calls a � Wrap� ( end of filming ) , or you are no longer needed in the scene .
There are no normal days in Show Biz , so your day could last anywhere from 2 to 12 hours .
The longer days with overtime , brings more money and free meals , whereas the shorter days mean good money for less work .
In either case , when your day is done you will return any wardrobe and prop items that were borrowed .
Then it is time to have the 2nd AD sign you out .
He or she will verify that all the information on the voucher is correct and then you sign your Time out .
Once signed , you will be given a copy and are free to go home and prepare for the next day .
Hopefully , there are more days in the nightclub or courtroom and you will be back for more work on the film .
Training : THE GREAT THING is that there is no special training or experience required for you to become an EXTRA .
What you need is the right �look� and wardrobe for the current projects available .
Also , the more skills you have , the more projects you may qualify for .
For example , if you are trained in � Ballroom Dancing � then you will qualify to be an EXTRA in a project that has a � Formal Dancing� scene .
Sports , martial arts , and military training are a few great things to have on your resume , and will increase your work potential .
Even if you don�t get hired for these skills , once on set you might be asked about different abilities .
Sometimes directors make last minute changes , and if you have the skill that will make their ideas come to life , all the better .
Just remember , always be honest about your skills , and do not say you can do something that you cannot .
That is a huge waste of everyone�s valuable time and money .
Telephone / Answering Machine / Pager / Cell :
When they want you they need a phone number on your picture and resume .
When they call you , they want to be able to leave a message , and hear back from you within one hour .
That is professional and that is what are expected .
You must be reachable .
A pager is good on set because you can still feel it on Vibrating mode if you �re working and you get a call during filming .
Public phone booths are harder to come by these days , so we recommend a cell phone as well .
Headshot :
In the beginning you may not need a head shot to get some work .
If the person needed is someone that is going to be in a Star Wars outfit or in a crowd scene you will probably be able to get work with out the expense of having pictures taken .
Also be aware that there are a lot of cons out there .
Check with someone in the industry for a good recommendation .
If you are really serious though about acting , you will need a photo that looks just like you do , on a great day .
These 8 by 10 calling cards are called Headshots .
Postcard size photos with your phone number on it are also very popular in addition , as reminders to Casting Directors .
You are the product you are selling , and the only way for people to know you is through your picture .
It �s best to go to a professional photographer for an actor�s headshot , usually taken in Black and White film .
Color is sometimes seen around town , but definitely not necessary and quite costly .
You will then take the photo you like the best and duplicate it at a quantity reproduction house .
Now that you have the required headshot it�s time to make a resume for yourself .
This will be attached to the back of your 8 by 10 .
Resume :
This will include your name , all current contact numbers , hair color , eye color , height , weight , age range ( no more then 8 years , like Age range 22 - 30 years old ) , and any acting experience you may have .
If you are chunky that �s fine , just be truthful .
There is work for overweight folks too .
Be honest .
Education and any acting training are important to list , although not necessary .
Special skills like skiing , football , tap dancing etc , are to be listed here as well .
Staple securely your resume to the back of your 8 by 10 .
You can also get your resume printed directly on the back of your headshot .
Wardrobe :
The most important thing to have as an EXTRA is an extensive wardrobe .
The more outfits you own or can borrow , the more projects you will eligible for .
As an EXTRA you will almost always be required to bring your own wardrobe .
This saves the production companies lots of money and helps the casting directors decide which EXTRAS they will hire .
The best things for you to own are a tux or formal gown , three to four types of business suits , and several styles of casual wear .
It is smart to have both typical and unusual colors .
It �s great if you to have several outfits from different time periods like the 60�s , 70�s and 80�s .
Hospital clothes , like a nurse or doctor uniform is good as well .
Alternative or unusual outfits are useful on those off the wall projects that come up from time to time .
The more extensive and varied your wardrobe , the more you will work you will be ready for .
Equipment :
It is not necessary to have any type of equipment to be an EXTRA .
But like the wardrobe , the more things you have the more you will work .
It is a good idea to have a usable bike , roller - blades , and other sports equipment you know how to use .
These can help you get work on projects that have major outdoor scenes in parks , beaches or schools .
Another way to increase your job potential is to have a unique or odd colored car .
Sometimes production companies don�t want you as the EXTRA ; they just want your car .
If you �re lucky they�ll use both and you will make even more money .
Pay - Rates : For Film :
There are two types of EXTRAS in the industry , Union EXTRAS and Non-Union EXTRAS .
Both have their own pay - rates based on the same work ( see the next section for more information on unions ) .
Just starting out you will be a Non-Union EXTRA .
Union EXTRAS are members of the Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) .
Pay - rates are based on several factors .
These include a base rate for the first eight hours of work , overtime pay for work between eight and twelve hours , double time pay for anything over 12 hours of work , meal penalties , bonuses called � Bumps � for wardrobe changes , working around smoke , and mileage driven to special locations .
The following is a more detailed description of each : Base Rates - Overtime - Double Time
The base rate is the amount of money that an EXTRA will make for any work done during the first eight hours of being on set .
It is also the figure that is used to determine overtime and double time rates .
The base rate for Non-Union EXTRAS is $ 54.00 and the rate for Union Extras is $ 110 .
To get overtime and double time rates , you will divide the base rate by 8 .
This number is then times by 1.5 to get the hourly rate of pay for overtime hours and by 2 to get the hourly rate of pay for double time hours .
Therefore the rates for Non-union EXTRAS are $ 10.13 per hour for overtime ( hours 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 worked ) and $ 13.50 per hour for double time ( all hours after 12th hour worked ) .
Rates for Union EXTRAS are $ 20.63 for overtime and $ 27.50 for double time .
Meal Penalties
Meal penalties are bonus payments added to your check when Extras are not given their mandatory meal breaks in accordance of state and Union laws .
They rule is extras must be given a meal break every six hours or the production company has to pay you bonus money for every 30 minutes they make you wait .
The rates per meal penalty for Non-Union EXTRAS vary by production , and have no set rate .
They are usually around $ 2.50 each .
The rates for Union EXTRAS are $ 7.50 for the 1st , $ 10 for the 2nd and $ 12.50 for all others .
Bumps :
Every time you change your wardrobe in the same day , OR are required to work around fire or smoke , OR are made to drive to a special location , you will be paid extra money called bumps .
The rates are as follows : Non-Union Union Wardrobe : $ 5 $ 9 Smoke / Fire $ 5 $ 14 Mileage ( per mile ) $ 0.30 $ 0.30 As a Non-Union EXTRA you will not always be eligible for � Bumps . �
This is something that your 2nd AD will inform you at the appropriate time .
If in the Union , the bumps will be added to your base pay .
This will make your overtime and double time pay higher .
Also lunch and dinner breaks are always non-paid .
Therefore these times will be deducted from the total time you are on set in order to determine when overtime and double time hours begin .
For the most money , the two best days to do Extra work will be the really long days , OR the quick short ones .
On the long days you have more chances to earn overtime pay and � Bumps � making you check bigger .
On the really short days you will get paid the full base rate for only 1 or 2 hours of work .
Then you are free to play the rest of your day , having made a full days pay !
Unions :
The main Union for EXTRAS is the Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) .
This is the Union that almost every working actor in America belongs to .
As you have seen , being in the Union means that you will make more money than Non-Union EXTRAS .
But getting in is the tricky part - there are only two ways currently to do it .
The first is to get a Taft - Hartly opportunity .
It is when you are cast in a speaking role in any Union project , and are not currently SAG .
If the Production Company casts a non-union person into a speaking role , automatically they are allowed to join SAG .
This can happen to you as an EXTRA as well .
Say you show up to the set to work as a Non-Union EXTRA and the director sees you and thinks you would be perfect to say a line to make the scene better .
In order to do this you must be in the SAG .
Since you are not , they will Taft - Hartly you .
This will cost the Production Company a union fine , so it doesn�t happen everyday , but it does happen .
The second way to become a member is to earn three union vouchers , while working as a non-union EXTRA .
Every union project requires a certain number of union EXTRAS be present on the set .
For TV shows this is 15 and for movies it is 45 .
When not enough union EXTRAS are on a set , for whatever reason , the Production Company must now pay a non-union EXTRA ; the union pay for each one not present .
Each time you get paid as a union EXTRA you will receive a union voucher .
If you earn three of these vouchers , you are eligible to join the union .
To become a member of SAG at this time you must pay the initiation dues of $ 1,310.00 plus dues .
You can learn more about the Screen Actors Guild by going directly to their web site at http://www.sag.org/
Register with your local Extra Casting companies .
Call them up ; find out their hiring policies and when they see new people .
Almost every major U.S. city has at least one casting agency that handles movies being filmed nearby .

INFO # 818 562-2755
They handle a majority of the work in the LA area .
This is the best place for all newcomers to start .
There is a one - time registration fee of $ 20 .
This is a fee that is well worth paying because of the work they will get you .
You should expect to pay some small fee at many casting companies in Los Angeles .
Never pay more than $ 100 to register and never pay a company that doesn�t ask you about your wardrobe , special skills and talents .
When registering at any Casting company remember dress to impress .
Be ready to supply all the necessary information regarding your wardrobe , skills or training .
The more skills you have the more valuable you are .
Once registered , it is up to you to call the casting company every day to book your own work .
This is a long process , but it�s the best way to get work .
You call a work hotline that describes the projects that are available and what they are looking for .
If you fit the qualifications , you will then be instructed to call a specific casting director .
Call that person , who will pull up your file , and decide if you are right to work for the project .
If they hire you , they will give you all the info you need , usually for work the next day .
If they don�t , you can keep calling the hotline until you are booked on a project .
In Los Angeles Calling Service
If you are not into doing this work yourself , you can hire a calling service ( booking agent ) to call the casting companies for you .
You will pay them $ 50 - $ 150 a month to call the casting companies you are registered with and book you on projects .
If you hire a great booking agent , then you will work 3 - 4 days per week .
Be cautious here , as some booking agents can only get you work 1 day a week .
You can find the best booking agents through references from the casting companies you are registered with .
Television Extra Work
The daytime soaps will hire both Union , and non-union extras .
The Actors Union that covers Soaps is called AFTRA and the pay rate is slightly different .
It is also much easier to join .
Mail in your Pictures & Resumes , ( P&R ) , and postcards .
Be sure to write Available for Extra Work on your resume and envelope .
It is a good idea to include a short , professional cover letter asking for a general meeting .
The Casting Director or Casting Assistant is the one to try to meet .
This is not necessary for work , but people like to hire people they know and like .

Florida AG Bill McCollum has officially escalated the BP fiasco to the next level .
In a post on his website today , McCollum announces that he has " sent a letter to BP asking the company to deposit no less than $ 2.5 billion into an interest - earning escrow account so Florida can be assured of its availability to the state and its citizens and businesses over the long - term recovery period . "
And now that BP is perceived as the surrogate replacement of the " all free lunch all you can eat " US government , McCollum concludes : “ Based on recent estimates from an economist , Florida could ultimately see losses as great as $ 2.2 billion , as well as a sharp decline in employment in the industries directly impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
As Florida braces for what will likely be a staggering blow to its economy with significant impacts to our state ’s workforce and the revenues of the state and local governments , it is essential that BP establish immediately a dedicated escrow account solely for the purpose of paying claims and damages to Florida and its citizens . ”
In other news , the Florida economy is strong and vibrant according to the Beige book .

Surging inflation is eating into consumers ' spending power
Indian inflation has risen to a two - year - high , raising the possibility of interest rate rises .
The wholesale price index rose to 10.16 % in May , the highest since 2008 .
Rising food and fuel costs have pushed the rate well above forecasts , which were nearer 9 % .
The government says prices will come down soon .
The rise in the inflation rate comes after India recorded its fastest growth in manufacturing in at least 15 years in April .
Unlike most countries , India calculates inflation on the wholesale price of a basket of 435 basic goods , which means actual prices paid by the consumer are much higher .

The Kepler spacecraft has found over 750 candidates for extrasolar planets , and that is just from data collected in the first 43 days of the spacecraft ’s observations .
“ This is the biggest release of candidate planets that has ever happened , ” said William Borucki , Kepler ’s lead scientist .
“ The number of candidate planets is actually greater than all the planets that have been discovered in the last 15 years . ”
This is an astounding amount of potential exoplanets from data taken during such a short period of time , however Borucki added that they expect only about 50 % of these candidates to actually turn out to be planets , as some may be eclipsing binary stars or other artifacts in the data .
But still , even half would be the biggest group discovery of exoplanets ever .
And the exciting part is that 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates with sizes from as small as Earth to around the size of Jupiter .
The team says the majority have radii less than half that of Jupiter .
The Kepler team has found so many candidates , they are sharing .
They will keep the top 400 candidates to verify and confirm with observations using other telescopes – with observations done by Kepler team members .
And today they have released the other 350 candidates , including five potential multiple planet systems .
However , some astronomers are upset about this and think the Kepler team should release all of their findings from the first year , as is typically done with NASA data .
Kepler launched on March 6 , 2009 , and has been on the hunt for exoplanets .
Of course , the holy grail is finding an Earth - like or Earth - sized planet , especially those in the habitable zone of stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist .
In the spring of 2009 the Kepler Mission conducted high precision photometry on nearly 156,000 stars to detect the frequency and characteristics of small exoplanets .
Kepler studied an area in the constellation Cygnus , looking for the small changes in light that would signal a planet passing in front of its star .
But it takes time to verify candidates and find out if they are actually exoplanets .
Usually , confirming the transit of an extrasolar planet requires observations of three different transits .
While NASA ’s policy requires astronomers to release their data from NASA instruments in a year , the Kepler team has worked out an agreement with the space agency so they can keep a certain portion of their data until they actually have time to verify this huge amount of exoplanet data .
Between launch delays of other telescopes , cloudy nights for Earth based telescopes , and viewing a part of the sky that is only visible from the ground from April until September , they have n’t had the observing time they needed to check out all their planet candidates .
The extension of the deadline gives the Kepler team the time to make sure they have gone through and found all the false positives and other potential misinterpretations of the Kepler data .
Dennis Overbye in the New York Times has written an article that delves more deeply into this little controversy .
What is propriety data , and what is public ?
It ’s a tough argument either way : scientists who have put years of their life into building a spacecraft should have the time they need to verify their data .
But others feel the science should be open and available , and a policy is a policy : the deadline for releasing the data is here .
Whatever your feelings on open or closed data ( and the Kepler team is only getting an extra six months on just part of their data , by the way ) , you have to be impressed with the quantity of potential exoplanet finds .
And Kepler still has at least two years left of observations .

March 4 , 2010 ( Updated with comment March 10 , 2010 ) — Experimenting with marijuana at a young age increases the risk for hallucinations or delusions later in life , a new study shows .
" Early cannabis use increases the risk of psychosis in young adults , " lead investigator John McGrath , MD , from the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research in Brisbane , Australia , told Medscape Psychiatry .
" Apart from having an increased risk of having a disorder like schizophrenia , the longer the young adults reported since their first cannabis use , the more likely they were to report isolated symptoms of psychosis . "
Cannabis is a risk factor for psychosis , and we need to let the general community know about these risks .
Psychotic disorders are common and typically affect 1 or 2 people of every 100 .
" Despite our best efforts with treatment , not everyone makes a full recovery , " Dr. McGrath said .
" We need to think about prevention .
Cannabis is a risk factor for psychosis , and we need to let the general community know about these risks . "
Dr. McGrath says he was surprised that the results were so strong and so consistent .
The study was published online March 1 in Archives of General Psychiatry .
Investigators studied 3800 young adults born at an Australian hospital taking part in the Mater - University Study of Pregnancy .
Prospective studies have already identified an association between marijuana use and later psychosis - related outcomes , but concerns remain about unmeasured confounding variables .
Dr. McGrath and his team focused instead on 228 sibling pairs in the prospective birth cohort to reduce the influence of unmeasured residual confounding .
Investigators followed up study participants at ages 5 , 14 , and 21 years .
The researchers assessed first marijuana use and 3 psychosis - related outcomes .
These outcomes included nonaffective disease , hallucinations , and the Peters et al delusions inventory score .
Table .
Odds Ratio of Psychosis- Related Outcomes With Marijuana Use
Marijuana Use Nonaffective Psychosis Hallucinations Peters Delusion Inventory Never 1 ( reference ) 1 ( reference ) 1 ( reference ) ≤ 3 years 1.5 1.4 1.6 4 - 5 years 1.6 1.5 2.5 ≥ 6 years 2.1 2.5 4.0
Investigators evaluated all associations between duration of marijuana use and psychosis - related outcomes using logistic regression adjusted for sex , age , parental mental illness , and hallucinations at the 14 - year follow - up .
The results mirror those of another study published in the November issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry ( 2009 ;166:1251 –1257 ) .
That work suggests a link between daily cannabis or tobacco use and early - onset psychosis .
In that study , investigators looked at 109 patients in a psychiatric unit and found that daily marijuana and tobacco use was common .
More than 40 % of patients used one or both substances .
Of those who abused cannabis , almost 88 % were classified as weekly or daily users before the onset of psychosis .
Escalating Marijuana Use Hastened Psychosis
It is not clear why escalating marijuana use may hasten psychosis , lead investigator Michael Compton , MD , from the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia , noted in November .
However , studies have shown increased cannabinoid receptor density in areas of the brain and elevated levels of endogenous cannabinoids in the blood of some patients with psychosis .
This new study , Dr. McGrath points out , provides additional evidence that early cannabis use is a risk - modifying factor for psychosis - related outcomes in young adults .
Asked by Medscape Psychiatry to comment , Emma Barkus , PhD , from the University of Wollongong in New South Wales , Australia , says the findings are consistent with the substance literature , which suggests that those who are engaging in risk behaviors at the age of 14 years are more likely to persist as they get older .
" Despite the restrictions of the methodologies , " she noted , " such as use of retrospective recall and the pseudoquantification of cannabis exposure , the sample size and the persistence of the findings in the face of controlling for confounding variables and analyses on subsets of participants lend strength to an area of literature which is still fraught with controversy . "
Dr. Barkus says the findings add further support to the role of cannabis use in psychoses in outcomes .
This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia .
Coauthor Dr. Rosa Alati is supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council Career Development Award in Population Health .

Mossad Chief Meir Dagan said on Tuesday that Israel is progressively becoming a burden on the United States .
" Israel is gradually turning from an asset to the United States to a burden , " said Dagan , speaking before the Knesset 's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee .
Dagan said that the U.S. government has recently examined the possibility of coercing a settlement on Israel and the Palestinians , but retreated from the idea after realizing it would not lead to a peace agreement .

Meanwhile , a senior Israel Defense Forces officer also spoke at the committee meeting on Tuesday , explaining the details of the IDF 's operation on the Gaza flotilla on Monday .
He said that the army had decided against sabotaging a ship in the Gaza flotilla at the center of Monday 's deadly clashes , out of fear that the vessel would be stranded in the middle of the ocean and at risk of a humanitarian crisis .
The flotilla , carrying tons of aid , had set sail from Turkey on Sunday , with the intention of breaking Israel 's blockade on the Gaza Strip .
Israel said Monday that it had repeatedly asked the convoy to turn back , and offered to deliver the aid via land , both of which were rejected by the convoy .
Israel Navy troops boarded five of the six ships without incident before dawn Monday , but clashes erupted on the sixth boat , and nine passengers were killed .
During his briefing on the operation to the Knesset 's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , Colonel Itzik Turgeman hinted that the IDF had sabotaged the engines of the other five ships , saying that " they took care of them . "
He also noted that soldiers found pistols in the hands of two of the activists who were killed , along with empty casings .
Turgeman said that at 4:20 A.M. local time Monday , IDF troops had observed the Mavi Marmara and as the deck seemed quiet , assessed that the passengers on board were sleeping .
In reality , the activists were waiting for the soldiers armed with clubs and other weapons .
The committee also heard further details about the naval operation , including that the officer in charge had photographed the head of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel , Sheikh Raed Salah , and sent the photo to Israel in order to refute rumors that he had been wounded or killed during the clashes .
Turgeman also said that Israeli Arab MK Hanin Zoabi had tended the wounded on the ship .
Nine out of 10 Americans eat too much salt every day , and many of them get more than twice the recommended daily amount , according to a new report from the CDC .
Researchers surveyed nearly 5,000 U.S. adults and found that they consumed a daily average of almost 3,500 milligrams of sodium .
Current dietary guidelines say that Americans should get less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium each day .
However a government advisory panel recently urged officials to decrease the recommended daily sodium limit to 1,500 milligrams for all Americans .
Even people who steer clear of salty foods may not be avoiding excessive sodium .
The report notes that many foods with a high sodium count , like breads , cookies and crackers , may not taste salty .
“ Sodium has become so pervasive in our food supply that it ’s difficult for the vast majority of Americans to stay within recommended limits , ” according to a statement by Janelle Peralez Gunn , lead author of the report .
Eating a lot of sodium increases blood pressure , which increases the risk for stroke , coronary heart disease , heart failure and renal disease , according to the CDC .
Current guidelines advise people already at high risk for these diseases to keep their sodium levels below the 1,500 - milligram mark .
In the report , researchers note that almost two - thirds of the sodium in a typical American diet comes from processed grains , like pizza and cookies , and meats , like poultry and lunch meat .
They also estimate that 77 percent of daily sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods .
We ’ve been pretty wrapped up in ’90s nostalgia lately .
But here at Flavorpill , we ’re not just about TV .
In fact , if you really want to know , our heart truly and unironically belongs to the music of the early ’90s : grunge .
Everyone knows that Pearl Jam are still selling out stadiums , Soundgarden and Alice in Chains have recently reunited , Mudhoney are doing a Superfuzz Bigmuff victory lap , Stone Temple Pilots are still … doing whatever it is that they do , and Hole / Courtney Love is knee - deep in comeback / Twitter .
And , of course , we all remember how things ended for Nirvana and Blind Melon .
But what ever happened to Screaming Trees post -“ Nearly Lost You ” or Toadies post -“ Possum Kingdom ” ?
How about the ladies of 7 Year Bitch , Babes in Toyland , and L7 ?
We even checked in on radio - friendly unit shifters like Silverchair and Collective Soul .
Listen to their best - known songs and get an update on their whereabouts after the jump .
Screaming Trees
The song you remember them by : “ Nearly Lost You ” ( 1992 )
Where are they now ?
Screaming
Trees did record one album after their 1992 breakthrough , Sweet Oblivion .
But despite decent reviews , Dust ( 1996 ) came after the grunge moment had passed , and its sales were disappointing .
The band did n’t break up until 2000 , after performing at a concert for the debut of Seattle ’s Experience Music Project .
By then , lead singer Mark Lanegan was already four albums into a solo career .
He ’s also frequently guested on Queens of the Stone Age and Twilight Singers albums ( that band , by the way , was founded by Afghan Whig Greg Dulli ) and collaborated with Soulsavers on 2006 ’s
It ’s Not How Far You Fall , It ’s the Way You Land and 2009 ’s Broken .
But perhaps the biggest Lanegan news in the past half - decade has been his and Belle & Sebastian alum Isobell Campbell ’s enchanting 2007 full - length Ballad of the Broken Seas , its 2008 followup Sunday at Devil Dirt , and another Lanegan / Dulli project , The Gutter Twins , whose debut Saturnalia appeared in 2008 .
( A third Lanegan / Campbell album , Hawk , is due out later this summer . )
As for Screaming Trees members who are n’t Lanegan , lead guitarist Gary Lee Conner has supposedly been working on a project called Amanita Caterpillar since 2004 … but we ca n’t find it on Allmusic , and it does n’t look like they ’ve released much of anything .
( Their MySpace page is also down . )
Conner does have a MySpace page that led us to Microdot Gnome , a psychedelic solo project with a trippy song called “ Confessions of the White Rabbit . ”
He lives in Texas with his wife and daughter and , according to Wikipedia , is a “ newspaper courier . ”
Van Conner , Gary Lee ’s brother and Screaming Trees ’ bassist , has sat in with Dinosaur Jr. and Queens of the Stone Age .
He , too , has a MySpace page .
Van is now in a pretty bizarre metal band called Valis , which you can listen to at MySpace .
Back in January , he recorded this loopy , atmospheric song and made the video for it , all in five hours .
Barrett Martin , the drummer who joined the group after original Mark Pickerel left in 1992 , has been the most prolific .
As a session musician , he played with everyone from Luna to Air to R.E.M .
He ’s also traveled around the world , studying indigenous drummers from South America to Africa .
But perhaps the biggest news is that Martin is now a Zen monk who creates music and visual art inspired by his beliefs .
He also recently became part of the rock band Big High .
7 Year Bitch
The song you remember them by : “ Hip Like Junk ” ( 1994 )
Where are they now ?
7 Year Bitch endured more than their fair share of tragedy :
In 1992 , their original guitarist Stefanie Sargent died of a drug overdose .
The next year , their friend Mia Zapata of The Gits was raped an murdered .
Somehow , despite that , the band managed to release three great albums during its seven - year run .
After the band broke up in 1997 , when members moved to different parts of the country , frontwoman Selene Vigil started Cistine , a goth / psychedelic band that must be defunct and may never have released an album , because we can’t find out anything about it .
In 2005 , she married her boyfriend of ten years , Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave .
The couple has two sons , Luka and Max .
Bassist Elizabeth Davis hooked up with sci-fi- flavored Clone for a while before forming Von Iva , whose fusion of soul and punk reminds us a bit of Gossip and Yeah Yeah Yeahs .
Watch the video for their song “ LALA ” here .
According to Wikipedia , Davis ( now Davis - Simpson ) is no longer part of the band but is married with a son named Thor .
In an undated but clearly semi-recent ( as in , within the last five years ) interview with Popular 1 , drummer Valerie Agnew mentioned that she was doing double duty in the produce department at a worker - owned grocery and as a massage therapist .
Agnew added , “ Elizabeth is also a massage therapist .
And Selene is a Pilates teacher .
So we all went from rock - n - roll lifestyle to a super - healthy lifestyle . ”
At the time of the interview , Roisin Dunne , the guitarist who replaced Sargent , was married and living in New York .
UPDATE : About 10 minutes after we published this post , Selene Vigil - Wilk ’s publicist sent around an announcement that the former 7 Year Bitch frontwoman is prepping a solo album .
That Was Then will come out September 14 via Tuck and Roll .
A video preview of her new material is at her brand spanking new MySpace page .
Consider our minds blown .
Candlebox
The song you remember them by : “ Far Behind ”
Where are they now ?
Rejected by some grunge purists as too lightweight or derivative , Candlebox still qualifies for the list in our book .
The band broke up in 2000 but reunited in 2006 in honor of that year ’s Best of Candlebox album .
As you may or may not know , the group now consists of three original members Kevin Martin , Peter Klett , and Scott Mercado ) and two newcomers ( Adam Kury and Sean Hennesy ) .
They released an album of new material , Into the Sun , in 2008 .
You can listen to some of the new stuff here and check them out over the summer , as they tour motorcycle rallies and other such events .
Meanwhile , Klett and Mercado also have a band called Lotus Crush .
Hennesy and Martin are among the members of hard - rockin ’ The Gracious Few , along with some guys who were also in …
Live ?!
Nineties alternative overload !
The Fluid That song you remember them by : “ Candy ” ( which appeared on a split Sub Pop 7 ” with Nirvana ’s Vaselines cover “ Molly ’s Lips ” )
Where are they now ?
This band formed in 1984 , stayed mostly underground , and released most of its albums before grunge exploded in the early ’90s .
They did reunited in 2008 , though , to perform at Sub Pop ’s 20th anniversary celebration .
At that time , Denver ’s Westword spoke with each and every one of the band members .
For a few years post - Fluid , frontman John Robinson played in a band called New United Monster Show , which never got it together to release a proper album .
Since then , he ’s been out of the music business .
“ I ’ve been a freelance set designer , ” he told the paper .
“ I do a bit of creative direction and set design , prop styling , that kind of thing .
I work mostly in still - photography advertising .
I ’ve been fairly lucky with that stuff , too . ”
In late 2009 , they opened for the Pixies in Denver .
As for the other guys , Garrett Shavlik went on to be part of the bands Alta May and Spell .
He is now singing for The Press Corps , a group that also includes members of Green River , Mother Love Bone , and Mudhoney and definitely retains the ’90s alternative feel .
Bassist Matt Bischoff also played in local Denver bands ( Boss 302 and ’ 57 Lesbian ) after The Fluid split .
These days , he has a “ real job ” and is n’t doing much music making .
Guitarist James Clower dabbled in music post - Fluid , but , as of 2008 , was back in school studying mechanical engineering .
And other guitarist Rick Kulwicki had some kids , who now have their own band … called The Purple Fluid .
Babes in Toyland
The song you remember them by : “ He ’s My Thing ” ( 1990 )
Where are they now ?
Babes in Toyland ’s breakup was painful and protracted , beginning sometime in the mid-’90s and finishing when frontwoman Kat Bjelland ’s band mates bassist Maureen Herman and drummer Lori Barbero threatened legal action when they found out she was touring as Babes in Toyland without them .
By then , Bjelland had already formed Katastrophy Wife with then - husband Glenn Matson .
They recorded two albums , 2001 ’s Amusia and 2004 ’s All Kneel .
In that time , the band expanded and contracted , as Bjelland found a new beaux , Adrian Johnson , who took Matson ’s spot .
There was supposed to be a third full - length ( Pregnant ) in the works , slated for a 2008 release , but Katastrophy Wife missed that deadline and has now been silent for over a year .
Oh , and when former pal Courtney Love asked Bjelland ( with whom she co-created the famous “ kinderwhore ” look ) in 2002 to join her new band Bastard ( which , as you might imagine , never really happened ) , the Babes in Toyland singer flat - out refused .
As for Herman , she became a journalist , writing for Rolling Stone and working as an editor as Musician .
She also did some artist management and worked for the defunct start - up Fuzz .
These days , she is Executive Director of the Project Noise Foundation .
Supposedly , she ’s writing a book about her life in music .
Drummer Lori Barbero played in Eggtwist and Koalas , but she too turned to the business side of music as co-owner of Spanish Fly Records , which is no longer in business .
Unfortunately , in 2008 , she was faced with DUI charges .
PopMatters checked in with her at SXSW 2009 ; the resulting noisy - as - hell interview video will only be tolerable to big fans .
The short version : she ’s still pals with everyone from Babes in Toyland but Bjelland .
And in late 2008 , she moved from Minneapolis to Austin , TX , where she was working with SXSW and still settling in to her new life .
Collective Soul
The song you remember them by : “ Shine ” ( 1994 )
Where are they now ?
There is some debate as to whether Collective Soul is grunge or “ post - grunge , ” a genre we would like to ignore .
As for us , the flannel and long hair and deep - voiced emoting in the video above satisfies our definition .
In any case !
Did you realize that Collective Soul is still around , featuring three of its original members ( Ed Roland , Dean Roland , and Will Turpin ) ?
Between 2002 and 2004 , they took a hiatus .
But the group just released an album , Collective Soul ( Rabbit ) , last year via Roadrunner Records .
Now , before you start looking down your indie - snob nose , know that the record debuted at # 24 on Billboard ’s Hot 100 !
Listen to new tracks at the band ’s MySpace and watch the video for “ Staring Down ” at YouTube .
How about the former band members ?
Ex-lead guitarist Ross Childress can now be found helming the considerably poppier Starfish and Coffee .
As for founding drummer Shane Evans , all we can find is a MySpace blog post claiming he was arrested in 2008 in connection with a deadly car accident .
But it seems suspicious that we can’t locate any more news coverage about the crash .
Can anyone confirm or deny ?
The Toadies That song you remember them by : “ Possum Kingdom ” ( 1994 ) No really , you know this song .
You probably just forgot its name .
It ’s the one with this chorus : “ Make up your mind / And I ’ll promise you / I will treat you well / My sweet angel / So help me , Jesus . ”
Where are they now ?
Toadies are also still around !
We are irrationally happy about this !
The band had broken up back in 2001 , when original bassist Lisa Umbarger left .
In 2006 , the band began playing a few shows without Umbarger , and in 2008 they officially reunited .
The full - length No Deliverance appeared that August .
You can listen to the biting title track here .
And earlier this month , Toadies posted a YouTube video announcing that they will release a re-recorded version of Feeler , an album Interscope refused to release back in 1998 .
You can keep up to date with them via their website , where they ’ve informed fans that they ’re planning to put out more new material as early as next year .
If you ’d like to see them live , they ’ll be touring the western U.S. in July .
As for Umbarger , she has n’t quite vanished .
Here ’s her MySpace page !
It seems that her most recent project is a synthy band called Tile , which you can listen to here .
Silverchair
That song you remember them by : “ Tomorrow ” ( 1994 )
Where are they now ?
If you were a true grunge fan , in the indie Sub Pop Seattle sense , you were probably too cool for this band of teenage Aussies .
And yet , if you were a suburban pre-teen who was n’t buying what Hanson was selling , you were probably all over Silverchair .
( Or maybe we ’re just projecting ? )
Personally , we followed them to 1997 ’s Freak Show ( “ Come on , abuse me more , I like it ” ) and glimpsed manorexia anthem “ Ana ’s Song ( Open Fire ) , ” from 1999 ’s Neon Ballroom , on MTV .
But what happened after that ?
But it looks like we quit just when things started to get interesting .
In 2002 , Silverchair released Diorama , which shed the trappings of late grunge in favor of orchestral arrangements and collaborations with Van Dyke Parks .
Check out the video for “ Greatest View ” here .
The band then went on hiatus for a few years , when lead singer Daniel Johns spent some time on wife Natalie Imbruglia ’s 2005 album Counting Down the Days .
( They ’ve since split . )
Also during that time , Johns teamed up with musician and producer Paul Mac to release some material as The Dissociatives .
By 2005 , Silverchair was back together .
Two years later , Young Moder appeared to mixed reviews .
The original trio is currently at work on an as yet untitled new album .
In April , they took to their website to update fans : “ While our album is still in it ’s early stages , the demos are coming together well .
We are really excited with the sounds emerging from the studio and everyday is a new surprise . ”
L7 The song you remember them by : “ Pretend We ’re Dead ” ( 1992 )
Where are they now ?
Before there were riot grrrls , there was L7 .
They were smart and political and looked awesome and , frankly , we wanted to be them .
The band lasted until about the turn of the millennium , a few years after the release of 1999 ’s Slap - Happy , when they went on an “ indefinite hiatus . ”
But do n’t worry :
You can still satisfy your Donita Sparks girl - crush : Her new band is called Donita Sparks and the Stellar Moments .
Sparks experts can test their knowledge here to earn a free copy of the group ’s most recent album , 2008 ’s Transmiticate .
You can also listen to some Stellar Moments tracks at their MySpace .
Those who adored Sparks ’ politics ( she was a co-founder of Rock for Choice ) will be happy to learn she used to blog for FireDogLake — but the most recent entries are about two years old .
All we know about what ’s become of L7 guitarist Suzi Gardner is that in 2000 , Cynthia Plaster Caster casted her boobs .
And that ’s good enough for us .
Drummer Demetra Plakas is similarly hard to track down .
But Jennifer
Finch , the bassist who left the band back in 1996 , has been in a slew of bands , from OtherStarPeople ( remember “ The Half of You I Love ” ? ) to The Shocker .
I tell my alarm clock to shut up constantly , but — unlike the Moshi alarm clock radio — it never listens and I have to fondle it in order to get a few moments of blissful silence .
Well , no more of that .

A typical PC keyboard with 109 keys
This is all the PCB that hides inside a keyboard .
Only 26 connectors are used to interface all 109 keys !
Thanks to the matrices .
What you probably have in front of you , is a keyboard with more than 100 keys on it ...
If you are not familiar with the key matrices , then you may think that inside this keyboard , there is a chip ( probably a microcontroller ) that has at least the same number of inputs to read each key separately .
Well , this is far from true ...
What are the key matrices ?
The matrices are actually an interface technique .
It can be used to interface inputs like the PC keyboard keys , but also to control multiple outputs like LEDs .
According to this technique , the I/O are divided into two sections : the columns and the rows .
You can imagine a matrix as an excel sheet .
Here is a 4 x 4 matrix
The blue lines are the columns and the red lines the rows .
There are 16 knots that the rows and columns intersect .
The columns and the rows are NOT in contact !
Suppose that we want to make a key matrix .
To do this , we will have to connect a button to each knot .
The buttons will have a push - to - make contact .
When the operator pushes this button , it will connect the column and the row that it corresponds to .
Now i will put the push - to - make buttons onto the matrix
The buttons are named with the Column : Row name that they connect .
For example , the top - left button is named A1 and the bottom right is named D4 .
How does a key - matrix works ?
To understand the operation principle , i will re-draw the above matrix without colors .
I will also put connection pins to each row and column wire .
Then , i will give power to only one column , the column B .
The wire that is red , indicates that it has power , and the button that is purple indicates that the button is pressed .
Then , i will simulate a button press to button number B3 :
Watch the above animation .
The column wire B has power all the time .
No other wire has power , until the button B3 is pressed .
This button makes contact between the column B and the row 3 .
Because column B has power , the row 3 will also have power as long as the button B3 is pressed !
What this means it that , if we know which column has currently power , and we watch the rows , then we can understand which button was pressed , if we detect power on a row !
If for example we know that the column B has power , and we detect also power to row 3 , then we understand that the button B3 is pressed .
A matrix in the real life
So , how does a matrix finally works ?
If you have understand the previous example , then it will be very easy for you to follow .
The matrix is controlled by a microcontroller .
For the above 16 - button 4x4 matrix , 8 pins of the micro controller will be used .
The first 4 pins will be OUTPUTS and will be connected to the COLUMN wires , while the other 4 pins will be INPUTS and will be connected to the ROW wires .
The OUTPUTS of the microcontroller will NOT all have power at the same time .
The outputs will go high one by one in cycle .
This happens many times per second , but i will slow things down ...
So , this is - in VERY VERY slow motion - how a typical microcontroller would cycle its outputs .
During this time , it will also monitor the inputs for a signal .
As long as all inputs are LOW ( with a pull down resistor or with internal uC pull - down resistors ) , the uC will take no action .
Now , suppose that the operator presses the button 3C .
Look what happens :
The microcontroller loops its outputs normally .
The operator has pressed the C3 button .
This button has connect the matrix col C , with the matrix row 3 .
When the output C of the microcontroller becomes HIGH , the signal arrives also at the input 3 of the microcontroller , through the pressed button .
The uC monitors the 4 inputs and detects that when the specific output ( C ) is high , there is a HIGH signal at the input 3 .
So , this means that the input C3 is pressed !
Easy it is not ?
Pressing multiple buttons on a matrix
Pressing multiple buttons simultaneously on a matrix is not always a good idea .
There are situations that the matrix operates normally , but not always .
Suppose for example that someone pressed the buttons B1 , B2 and B3 simultaneously .
What will happen ?
Let 's take a look :
When the output B becomes HIGH , then the three inputs 1,2 and 3 of the microcontroller will also become HIGH .
Supposing that the firmware is written in a way that can handle such an event , the operation will be carried out normally .
The uC will understand that the buttons B1 , B2 and B3 are pressed .
Let 's see another situation where the buttons A3 , B3 and C3 are pressed :
In this situation , the matrix will also work normally .
The microcontroller will detect a signal at input number 3 , when the output A , B and C are HIGH .
When the output D is HIGH , no signal is detected .
The ghosting problem
I will continue the above examples with another situation , where the buttons C2 , B2 and B3 are pressed simultaneously :
When the output C is HIGH , then the input 2 will also become HIGH .
The uC will understand that the button C2 is pressed .
But something else happens here .
The button B2 is also pressed !
This means that the HIGH signal will go through the button B2 to the column B .
And due to the fact that the button B3 is pressed , the signal will arrive simultaneously at input # 3 as well !
But the microcontroller knows that at this moment , only the output C is HIGH , and because it detects HIGH signal at inputs 2 and 3 , it will think that buttons C2 and C3 are pressed , something that is wrong !
The button C3 is NOT actually pressed !
This is known as ghosting , and usually gives a headache to PC gamers , especially when the game requires multiple buttons to be pressed simultaneously .
Take for example the MAME console , which simulates arcade games .
If you play samurai shodown 1 v1 , and one player has low defense and kicks while the other is flying high and uses the sword , this will require 6 keys to be pressed !
Yawks !
Ghosting occurs .
( that 's why i made my MAME arcade console )
The masking problem
By pressing buttons C2 , B2 and B3 simultaneously , the ghosting problem occurs .
The operator presses button C3 , yet nothing changes Now the operator releases button C2 .
Still nothing changes and the uC cannot detect the button release !
Masking has occur .
Any solution to the ghosting and masking ?
Yes there is !
And it is a cheap one .
Using a diode for each button , the masking and ghosting problems are instantly solved !
This is how it works :
The above situation would normally cause ghosting .
Yet , the diodes prevents the current to go backwards .
For better understanding , you can see the 3 steps of the above animation here ( as always , click to enlarge images ) :
Because the cycling speed must be quite fast ( some Khz ) , you should choose proper diodes .
A cheap solution is the 1N4148 general purpose diodes .
If you plan to have many keys and thus you need faster sampling , then select a schottkey diode instead .
And what about a matrix with outputs instead of inputs ?
This is also a very interesting chapter with matrices .
Using matrices , you can control for example 9 LEDs each one separately , with only 6 outputs .
Look how it works :
Above there is a typical 3 x 3 LED matrix .
All microcontroller pins , for both columns and rows are now OUTPUTS .
Suppose now that all outputs are HIGH .
All LEDs will have HIGH on both anode and cathode , and this means than none LED will light !
This is how to turn completely off the LED matrix , by giving either HIGH or LOW to all outputs .
Now suppose that we want to turn on the middle LED .
To do this , we give HIGH to column 2 and rows 1 and 3 , and LOW to column 1 and 3 and row 2 .
This is what will happen :
The middle LED is forward biased and therefore it lights .
All other LEDs are either reverse biased , or they have the same voltage ( positive or negative ) to their both leads , and therefore they do not light .
This way , someone can control for example 64 LEDs each one separately , with an 8x8 matrix , using only 16 outputs from a microcontroller .
One Bizarre Night — Poker Scam in Saigon
I met Mr. Giang in the park across from my hotel .
He was a very amiable old guy and we spent a half hour chatting .
He had to leave , but wondered if I ’d meet him back here the next day so he could introduce me to his niece and we could all have a “ nice conversation . ”
I warily agreed .
It would turn out to be one of the weirdest experiences I ’ve ever had .
That night I met up with with fellow travel bloggers , Dave and Colin , and we spent the night drinking cheap beer and Vietnamese whiskey .
Dave and I were comparing events of the day and he mentioned how he ’d been befriended by a local who took him home for dinner to meet his sister who was a nurse and was about to move to New Zealand .
After a friendly dinner and chit chat , he ’d been told a story about their sick grandmother and had give them $ 10 US to help with medical costs .
He suspected that it was a scam , but had got a good meal and a taxi ride out of the deal so he was n’t too worried about the money .
I told him about my appointment to meet Mr. Giang tomorrow at 3:00 .
Dave laughed and said “ I wonder if his grandmother is sick , too ? ”
Mr. Giang met me at the park as agreed and brought his cousin ( whose name I forget ) along .
She was in her late thirties and was very interested in learning more about the US .
As we crossed the park , I saw Dave sitting on a bench reading .
He laughed and waved — his bus left at 7:00 and he was killing time .
I thought we were just going to meet for coffee , but they flagged down a taxi , explaining that they wanted to treat me to a real meal and introduce me to their family .
I did n’t really want to go , but hated to be rude , so I went along .
Traffic was heavy and the taxi took a good fifteen minutes to reach their house .
I was , of course , completely lost .
Mr Giang introduced me to his brother , Woody , who worked on a cruise ship as a blackjack dealer
Their home was a nice two story concrete place with a living room area and small kitchen filling the lower floor .
As I walked in , I smelled food cooking and saw a Vietnamese man sitting on the sofa watching the basketball finals .
Mr Giang introduced us — this was his brother , Woody , who was a Lakers fan and worked on a cruise ship .
Woody ’s English was flawless and we chatted about Vietnam and his job as a dealer in the ship ’s casino .
Woody worked on his days off as a dealer for the VIP room of a club here in Saigon and gave me the low down on rich people and their attitude towards gambling .
“ They do n’t care if they lose a hundred grand gambling , but they ’ll stiff you on tips every time . ”
He had run a game just last night with some foreigners and the agreement was that the dealer got 10 % of the winnings , but a businessman from Singapore had won $ 80,000 and only tipped him $ 50 .
About this time , dinner was served and the four of us sat down to enjoy rice , a couple of vegetable dishes , and baked fish .
Woody asked if I was familiar with a game called “ Poker 21 ″ and I admitted that I ’d never heard of it .
“ After dinner , I ’ll teach it to you . ”
I replied that I ’d like to learn but that I was n’t interested in gambling .
Warning bells were starting to tinkle in the distance .
“ No , no … I ’ll just show you how to play , ” was the reply .
After we ’d eaten , Woody led me upstairs to his room where he had a small table and chairs set up by his bed .
He pulled out a pad of paper and drew a map of the casino where he worked , showing me how his job was to watch the tables for cheating and where the VIP room was , where he ’d deal cards for an hour a night .
“ Never play against me because you cannot win . ”
Poker 21 turned out to be a form of blackjack where you could bet after each card and bluffing was an integral part of the game .
He pulled out some cheap poker chips and I reminded him that I was not going to play for money .
“ Oh no , ” he replied .
“ Never play against me because you cannot win . ”
After we ’d covered the basics , he said “ Now , I will show you how to cheat . ”
He had me shuffle the cards , then dealt out two hands .
The imaginary player ’s hand was a twenty and mine was a twenty one .
He dealt again and I had a twenty while the other hand was a nineteen .
I watched his hands closely and could n’t see any sleight of hand .
He was good .
“ I ’m working the casino in Nepal in August .
We could make a half million dollars in an hour , and split it 50 - 50 . ”
He then showed me his method of signaling what the other person ’s hidden card was .
After dealing , if he placed his hands together right over left , the down card was an ace .
Touching his elbow was an nine , etc .
To further simplify things , he could tell me when to bet by touching his wedding ring .
“ I ’m working the casino in Nepal in August .
Maybe you can come visit and I ’ll get you into the VIP room .
We could make a half million dollars in an hour , and split it 50 - 50 . ”
“ I ’m afraid I wo n’t be in Nepal until much later in the year , Woody .
And I do n’t have the kind of money I ’d need to even play . ”
“ Oh , I could get you the chips as a loan .
You ’d repay me and we ’d split the winnings , ” he replied with a wink .
“ But before I could get you into the VIP room , you ’d need to practice .
And then I would want to test you to see if you can handle the pressure .
With chips , it ’s easy but real money makes a man nervous . ”
He wrote the word “ TEST ” on the sheet of paper .
He produced two $ 100 bills and laid them on the table .
“ I thought we agreed there would be no money , Woody . ”
“ This is just for learning .
It ’s my money , so there ’s no risk for you . ”
About this time , the phone rang and he spoke to someone for a minute .
“ That was the man from Singapore — he wants me to deal for him again tonight — says I ’m his lucky dealer .
Maybe this time he will pay me . ”
He wanted me to come play at his table tonight , thinking we were going to scam some foreigners .
Now , it was starting to fall into place — or so I thought .
He wanted me to come play at his table tonight , thinking we were going to scam some foreigners .
I , of course , would be the one fleeced in the end .
I started looking for a way to wrap this up .
His cousin had joined us and was telling me how good a dealer he was and babbling on about this or that .
There was a knock at the door and a sweaty , spastic man in a shirt and tie walked in , carrying a small satchel .
Woody said “ Oh , you ’re early , ” and then introduced us .
This was Mister Li from Singapore .
Oh shit .
“ We ’re just playing a friendly game , ” Woody explained to Mr. Li. “ Perhaps you ’d like to join in before we leave for the casino ? ” Mr. Li would , of course , be honored to play against an American .
“ America is a great country , ” he declared .
“ But Singapore is number one ! ”
Should you ever find yourself in such a situation , this is the point where you stand up and walk away .
Should you ever find yourself in such a situation , this is the point where you stand up and walk away .
Apparently , I ’m not that smart .
I was n’t thinking quickly enough and was awestruck by how smooth and well - played this setup was .
Deer in the headlights .
Within a minute , I had $ 200 in chips sitting in front of me and Mr. Li had produced $ 500 which he had swapped for chips .
Woody was shuffling the cards .
None of the money was mine , but I knew it was n’t intended to stay that way .
I only had about $ 50′s worth of Vietnamese dong on me , but visions of me standing at an ATM with a knife to my back were starting to flit around my head .
Mr. Li was a damned good actor , playing to role of a arrogant –but stupid– businessman .
He had a greased - down hair , thick glasses , and a cheap tie .
There was always a hint of spittle hanging around the corner of his mouth .
The cards were dealt and I realized only then that I was trapped .
I could n’t fold the hand and walk away , because then I would owe Woody his $ 200 .
Woody was winking at me furiously but Mr. Li was somehow oblivious to it .
I , of course , won the hand and now had $ 600 in chips .
Looking back , that was the moment to give them the chips back and walk away , but it did n’t occur to me at the time — I was so busy trying to think of a way out that I could n’t see the obvious .
They kept the pace up and any quiet moment was smoothly interrupted by a question from the cousin or Mr. Li .
The cards flew again and I won again .
Mr. Li got another $ 1,000 in chips .
Mr. Li was dealt a blackjack and won the ante .
On the next hand , I drew a twenty - one , beating his twenty .
“ I ’m sorry , but I have an appointment to go to , ” I lied .
“ This is my last hand .
Mr. Li was disappointed , but agreed .
Woody was shaking his head — apparently , we had n’t ‘ taken ’ Mr. Li for enough yet .
I was done with the whole thing and was tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop .
In just ten minutes , things had spun completely out of control .
I had no money in the game , but knew it was just a matter of time .
For the last hand , Woody touched his ring again and I drew a card to give me a twenty one .
Mr. Li had a ten showing .
I bet low and he raised me so that I had to go all in .
Woody slipped up then and announced that no more cards would be dealt , despite the fact that Mr. Li had not indicated whether or not he wanted a card .
A real gambler would have caught it .
If I ’d had any doubts about their collusion , that would have answered them .
Mr. Li reached into his bag , pulling out a brick of $ 100 bills that was at least eight inches thick .
“ I bet $ 50,000 ″ he said .
It was Mr. Li’s turn to bet and he reached into his bag , pulling out a brick of $ 100 bills that was at least eight inches thick .
“ I bet $ 50,000 ″ he said with a big smile .
The shoe had dropped and it was one hell of a big one .
“ I thought this was a friendly game , Mr. Li .
You ’re trying to buy the pot . ”
“ I like to win , ” he replied , grinning wide .
I had two choices : fold and owe Woody $ 200 , or agree to match a $ 50,000 bet .
Woody was winking furiously again , as if he had something stuck in his eye .
“ I ’m sorry , but I do n’t have that kind of money on me , ” I explained .
Woody jumped in and said that he would guarantee my bet , as I had plenty of cash back at my hotel room .
Mr Li insisted on seeing the money and we waited patiently while Woody left the room to get his stash .
How the hell am I going to get out of this ?
He returned with $ 18,000 in cash , but Mr. Li was still not satisfied — he wanted to see all of it .
“ I ’ll accept any currency — I am a business man .
Gold is good , too . ”
Woody did one hell of a job of looking annoyed and feigning insult that Mr. Li would n’t take him at his word .
Seeing my chance , I asked “ Perhaps , you have time for me to go to my hotel and get my money ? ”
Mr. Li thought this was a great idea — he would leave , too , and we ’d call him when I returned .
Woody pulled two envelopes from a cabinet and we sealed our cards inside with a glue stick that just happened to be lying around .
The cash and cards went into the cabinet , which was locked .
Mr. Li insisted on holding the key .
“ I have $ 50,000 in that cabinet .
Maybe someone tries to help themselves to my money . ”
Woody glared at him .
“ This is very exciting !
What will you do with your $ 25,000 ? ”
Woody led Mr. Li out of the room and the cousin started complaining about how rude Mr. Li was , insulting Woody in his own home .
I tried to tune her out , calculating the odds of my escaping the situation .
When she noticed I was n’t paying attention , she said “ This is very exciting !
What will you do with your $ 25,000 ?
Stay in Vietnam longer ? ”
Woody returned and calmly explained that he had friends who would loan him money for a short period of time , but he was n’t sure he could come up with the full $ 50,000 .
“ How much can you contribute , Johnny ?
I might not need it , but a reserve would help — even if it ’s only six or seven thousand . ”
“ The banks are closed , Woody — I ca n’t get that kind of money . ”
“ He said he would take gold .
You can buy gold with your card from a shop .
Just get a receipt . ”
Woody was a resourceful man .
“ Okay , I ’ll get what I can .
Can you call a cab ? ”
The cab arrived and Mr. Giang and the cousin climbed in with me .
Everyone had been asking what hotel I was staying at , but I ’d conveniently forgotten the name , so we agreed to meet at the same spot in the park again .
Traffic was very heavy and it took nearly half an hour to reach the park .
The cousin peppered me constantly with inane questions about the US — how much a cab costs there , how far away Mexico was from my home town , and such .
Mr. Giang joined in with more of the same , always keeping me busy so I would n’t have time to think .
Neither of them seemed overly excited about the fact that their family was about to win $ 25,000 .
I think the plan was for me to return with as much money as I could gather , only to find that Mr. Li and I both had twenty - one .
The cards would have to be dealt again and Mr. Li would insist on cutting them or such , denying Woody his opportunity to give me a winning hand .
Either that , or I ’d just be robbed outright .
I ’d expected one of them to insist on coming with me to the hotel and had planned on telling them to screw themselves and making a run for it .
To my surprise , they both agreed to wait at the park while I got my passport and the money .
I crossed the busy street , walked past my hotel , turned the corner and ran into the first alley I saw .
Saigon is famous for it ’s narrow , twisting alleys and I got lost as quickly as I could , taking every turn that led away from the park .
Five minutes later , I popped out on a main street and saw the awkwardly - named Dung Restaurant , where we had eaten dinner the night before .
Looking over my shoulder , I rushed in and took a table in the back , as far from the entrance as possible .
“ Fancy meeting you here ! ” a voice said , scaring the living hell out of me .
I looked up and saw Dave sitting at the table across from me , working on his laptop .
“ Dude , ” I said .
“ Do I have a story for you … ”
I was completely amped with adrenaline , and launched into my tale while ordering a beer .
When I mentioned the card game , Dave laughed loudly and said “ Poker 21 ? ”
He crossed his hands together and touched his elbow , saying “ Ace. Nine . ”
“ You ran into the same scam ? ! ” I was stunned .
“ Yeah , did n’t I tell you last night ?
I got the same deal , right before they told me about their sick grandmother . ”
“ No , I do n’t remember you mentioning it .
How far did you go with the whole thing ? ” I asked .
“ Oh , when he mentioned the test and pulled out money , I said ‘ This is where I stop . ’ ”
“ You ’re obviously a smarter man than me , Dave .
Now I have to change hotels . ”

One of the recurring themes of Science - based medicine is that we live in the age of misinformation .
The internet and social networking have made everyone their own expert – by democratizing information ( which I favor , as it has many benefits to society ) the field has been leveled for various types and sources of information .
But this has the very negative effect of equalizing information in terms of quality as well – so low quality and even outright incorrect or fraudulent information can compete on equal footing with more reliable , vetted , and professionally sourced material .
That is exactly why one of the primary goals of SBM is to be a resource for consumers and professionals to help sort through it all .
Recently David Gorski sent around a link to an e-book , Natural Cancer Treatments , that epitomizes the dark underbelly of health misinformation on the internet .
The book opens up with the standard disclaimer that ostensibly is to protect the public but in reality is simply legal cover for the purveyors of misinformation – it says to seek the advice of your physician and that this book is not meant to discourage anyone from seeking standard therapy for cancer .
This is boiler plate CYA for quacks .
It is also utter hypocrisy as it is placed immediately below two quotations that set the tone for the book :
“ It should be forbidden and severely punished to remove cancer by cutting , burning , cautery , and other fiendish tortures .
It is from nature that the disease comes , and from nature comes the cure , not from physicians . ”
Paracelsus , ( 1493 -1541 AD ) “ …. never take defeat .
When all is lost , try something new .
Life is too precious to let it slip away from lack of initiative or plain inertia . ”
Hulda Regehr Clark , Ph.D. , N.D. “ The Cure for All Advanced Cancers ”
The Paracelsus quote essentially says to forgo standard therapy , and do n’t trust your doctor – in direct contradiction to the disclaimer .
I would also point out that , while Paracelsus was an interesting figure in the history of medicine , he did practice in an essentially pre-scientific era .
He fought with the establishment medicine of his time , but this was a fight between two pre-scientific systems .
He was criticizing Galenic medicine – which bears no resemblance to modern medicine .
The medicine of his time was largely worse than doing nothing , and so the often magical interventions of Paracelsus ( he was first and foremost an alchemist ) were an improvement .
He is also an ironic person to quote , as he focused his attention on using toxic minerals to treat disease .
The “ natural ” cures he was talking about were horrible toxins long out of favor as part of medicine .
For example he favored the use of mercury to treat syphilis .
The second quote essentially encourages acting out of desperation .
There is , of course , a kernel of reasonable advice in the notion of not giving up .
But it must be tempered by reality – whereas Hulda Clark and other cancer quacks take these words of encouragement to their absurd extreme – try anything , especially the implausible treatment that they are trying to sell .
Clark , who recently died of cancer , believed that all cancer , and in fact all disease , is caused by a liver fluke .
The introduction is far worse , in which the authors state :
The consensus of the majority of alternative cancer therapists is that , the chance of full recovery using alternative therapies is almost 100 % .
with a newly diagnosed condition of early cancer , before any traumatic or toxic treatments have been received .
Unfortunately , by the time most patients consider alternative treatments , they have already undergone other treatments .
The consensus of practitioners of X is that X works .
Well that ’s comforting .
The notion that “ alternative ” treatments are almost 100 % effective for cancer is a great example of telling a lie so great that people will tend to believe it – because no one could be that bold and outrageous a liar .
No evidence , of course , is presented to back up this absurd claim .
But further , this claim directly contradicts their disclaimer – essentially they are saying that you need to consult an alternative practitioner before you subject yourself to standard ( i.e. evidence - based ) treatment .
This is also another attempt at preemptively blaming the patient for treatment failures .
If your goal were to kill and harm as many cancer sufferers as possible , you could give no more effective advice than what is found in this book .
The book itself , while selling itself as a source of “ natural cancer cures that work ” – is really a collection of cancer cures that do not work .
The term “ natural ” is there purely for marketing , as the book contains disproved and implausible treatments of every type , to the point that the vague concept of “ natural ” loses all meaning .
You can go to just about any page on the book and find gems like this one , under the entry for colloidal silver :
“ Naturopathic Medicine regards Cancer as a viral and fungal [ candida septicemia ] process .
Microorganisms depend on a specific enzyme to breathe .
Colloidal Silver is a
catalyst that disables these enzymes , and as a result they die .
To this day , there has been no recorded case of adverse effects from it when it is properly prepared .
There also has been no recorded case of drug interaction with any other medication .
Unlike pharmaceutical antibiotics which destroy beneficial enzymes , Colloidal Silver leaves the tissue - cell enzymes intact . ”
I like that – “ Naturopathic Medicine regards . ”
What does that mean , exactly – that they just made it up ?
It ’s a clever way to make a claim without making a claim – no appeal to scientific evidence , plausibility , or basic science .
Naturopaths just choose to believe that cancer is really a viral or fungal infection – despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that cancer is a category of disease caused by various mutations that cause cells to grow unrestrained by the usual mechanisms that limit cell growth .
Some viral infections may increase the risk of developing certain cancers ( like HPV and cervical cancer ) , but the cancer itself is not an infection .
So of course , treating it like an infection is useless .
Further , colloidal silver is not a safe or effective treatment for infections .
Silver can be used as a bacteriostatic compound to prevent contamination of equipment , but it is not safe and effective when used internally .
It is also highly misleading to say that there are no recorded adverse effects “ when it is properly prepared . ”
This is a lie – there are numerous case reports of argyria , a permanent skin disease resulting from use of colloidal silver .
Developing argyria also has nothing to do with how the colloidal silver is prepared – it is a matter of dose .
But what they are trying to do is dismiss adverse effects as being due to improper use .
This is like saying that there are no adverse effects to any surgical procedure properly performed , because all adverse effects from surgery were due to improper technique .
It ’s a semantic game meant to mislead .
Finally the quote takes a swipe at standard antibiotics ( again betraying the lie that the authors do not intend to discourage standard therapy ) .
Antibiotics are designed to affect bacterial enzymes , proteins , or structures without affecting Eukaryotic cells – they do not disrupt “ beneficial enzymes ” .
We could spend a year and write an encyclopedia examining every claim collected in the book , but let me just give one more example .
I literally flipped to a random page and found :
In Japan , Dr. Hasumi claims outstanding success in curing cancer with a vaccine made from the patient ’s own urine ; however , it works only if the immune system is still
sufficiently strong .
Here we see the common strategy of preparing an excuse for failure – if the treatment does not work , it is the patient ’s fault because their immune system was not strong enough .
Dr. Hasumi ’s treatment is over 50 years old .
He is a typical guru running his own clinic , claiming that science is behind his genius .
The book also offers this quote from Dr. Hasumi ’s website :
“ To date , more than 130,000 people have been treated with the Hasumi Vaccine and today approximately 16,000 people in Japan and 6,000 people overseas are continuing treatment with the vaccine .
The therapeutic advantage of the Hasumi Vaccine has been demonstrated to prevent recurrence after cancer surgery . ”
What does that mean ?
Did the other 108,000 patients die ?
Are the 22,000 people still being treated cured or improved in any way by the treatment ?
Those figures are entirely unhelpful , except , perhaps to potential investors .
The book provides only one reference to back up the claim that the treatment prevents recurrence – Hasumi ’s website from which the claim was taken , and which itself contains no reference .
Hasumi has only two publications , in 2003 and 2008 .
The first one is simply an examination of T - cell function , and has nothing to do with any intervention .
The second only demonstrates that T - cell activity is increased in response to “ anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 coated beads . ”
Essentially , if you stimulate the immune system , the immune system is stimulated .
This is typical quack cancer pseudoscience – trump up some sciencey sounding results by looking at some marker of immune function , which always seem to be elevated in response to any intervention .
These results say absolutely nothing about the plausibility of the Hasumi vaccine and of course they do not provide any clinical data to show that the vaccine is safe and effective for anything .

The charger uses a bottle dynamo to provide power
Mobile phones can now be recharged while riding a bike .
Phone firm Nokia has released a charging kit that uses a dynamo powered by a bicycle 's wheels .
Any cyclist wanting to re-charge their handset using the kit will need to maintain a speed of about 4mph ( 6 km / h ) , said Nokia .
The charging kit is intended for nations where bicycles are ubiquitous but will work with any phone using a 2 mm charger jack .
" Bicycles are the most widespread means of transport in many markets around the world , so this is just one more benefit to be gained from an activity people are already doing , " said Alex Lambeek , Nokia vice president in a statement .
Nokia said charging times will vary by speed but a cyclist completing a 10 minute journey at 6 mph ( 10 km /h ) will produce enough power for 28 minutes of talk time or 37 hours of standby time .
Also included in the kit with the dynamo is a holder to secure a phone to a bicycle while it is being re-charged .
Nokia said the charging kit will be available through its stores worldwide by the end of 2010 .
Prices will vary by market .
In Kenya , where the kit was first unveiled , it will cost about £ 12.50 ( 15 euros ) .
When it unveiled the charger , Nokia also showed off four phones designed for developing nations .
The handsets are made for places where the electricity supply is limited and have a six - week standby time .
Nokia is not the first firm to produce a dynamo charger .
Similar devices from firms such as Pedal & Power have been widely available for some time .
Dear friends , the Buddhadharma is described as something that you can come and see by yourself .
You do n’t have to believe something through another person , even the clergy , the priest , the mediator .
The ultimate dimension of reality is something you can touch , you can see by yourself .
And you can do it now , and here ; it ’s not a problem of time .
It ’s not a promise .
In the method of Buddhism as I see it , it ’s very concrete ; there ’s no place to speculate , to suppose , to create an hypothesis .
When the Buddha set out to teach and to help people , the first thing he asked people is to look directly into their suffering .
Suffering is not an abstract thing ; suffering is there , very real .
Suffering is one of the basic truths called holy truths , the Noble Truths .
Suffering is a holy truth .
Why ?
In Vietnamese we call it thanh de , the holy truth .
The word that the Buddha used is dukkha ; dukkha means ill - being , pain , suffering , translated by Chinese kou .
This word , kou , originally in Chinese means bitter , the opposite of sweet .
It makes you suffer .
And you have to look at it .
Why is suffering a holy truth ?
Because , without suffering , you have no way out .
The first thing you have to do is to look , and look deeply , into the nature of your suffering .
If you cannot do that , if you try to run away from it , there ’s no way that you can transform your suffering .
That is why suffering is the basic truth and a holy truth .
It means we have to learn from our suffering .
We have to understand our suffering .
If we do n’t know anything about our suffering , if we cannot learn anything about our suffering , suffering is no longer a holy truth .
Holy or not holy : it depends on our way of handling suffering .
And the Buddha said suffering is absolutely necessary for you to find a way out .
A Zen teacher in Vietnam during the 13th century urged his students to practice diligently in order to get out of the world of birth and death .
And a student asked him , “ Teacher , please show us how to get out of the world of birth and death . ”
And he said , “ You have to look for the world of no birth and no death . ”
Then the student asked , “ But where can we find the world of no birth and no death ? ”
And the teacher said , “ You look for it right in the world of birth and death . ”
It means , out of suffering you will find the way of transcending the suffering .
It sounds like something contradictory , but it is the basic Buddhist teaching .
So looking into the nature of suffering , you can see many , many things that you need to know .

Joe Lieberman wants to give the federal government the power to take over civilian networks ' security , if there 's an " imminent cyber threat . "
It 's part of a draft bill , co-sponsored by Senators Lieberman and Susan Collins , that provides the Department of Homeland Security broad authority to ensure that " critical infrastructure " stays up and running in the face of a looming hack attack .
The government 's role in protecting private firms ' networks is one of the most contentious topics in information security today .
Several bills are circulating on Capitol Hill on how to keep power and transportation and financial firms running in the event of a so - called " cybersecurity emergency . "
Last week , Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn floated the idea of extending a controversial cybersurveillance program to hacker - proof the firms .
Meanwhile , the military 's new Cyber Command is readying itself to march to these companies ' aid .
Lieberman and Collins ' solution is one of the more far - reaching proposals .
In the Senators ' draft bill , " the President may issue a declaration of an imminent cyber threat to covered critical infrastructure . "
Once such a declaration is made , the director of a DHS National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications is supposed to " develop and coordinate emergency measures or actions necessary to preserve the reliable operation , and mitigate or remediate the consequences of the potential disruption , of covered critical infrastructure . "
" The owner or operator of covered critical infrastructure shall comply with any emergency measure or action developed by the Director , " the bill adds .
These emergency measures are supposed to remain in place for no more than 30 days .
But they can be extended indefinitely , a month at a time .
The DHS cybersecurity director has to ensure that the emergency measures " represent the least disruptive means feasible " and that " the privacy and civil liberties of United States persons are protected , " according to the bill .
It also allows the private firms to handle network threats on their own – if DHS approves of the measures .
Senate staffers familiar with the bill acknowledge that it grants broad powers over private businesses ; the staffers could n't think of an analog in the physical world , except for the Federal Aviation Administration 's authority to ground air traffic after 9/11 .
But the staffers say that the emergency powers will only apply to a relatively small number of companies , and only in the most extreme cases – when an electronic exploit might cause " catastrophic regional or national damage " resulting in " thousands of lives or billions of dollars " lost .
In order for the President to declare such an emergency , there would have to be knowledge both of a massive network flaw – and information that someone was about to leverage that hole to do massive harm .
For example , the recent " Aurora " hack to steal source code from Google , Adobe and other companies would n't have qualified , one Senate staffer noted : " It 'd have to be Aurora 2 , plus the intel that country X is going to take us down using that vulnerability . "
A second staffer suggested that evidence of hackers looking to leverage something like the massive Conficker worm – which infected millions of machines and was seemingly poised in April 2009 to unleash something nefarious – might trigger the bill 's emergency provisions .
" You could argue there 's some threat information built in there , " the staffer said .
The Lieberman / Collins bill is hardly the the most extreme cybersecurity proposal that 's circulated on Capitol Hill in recent years .
That dubious distinction belongs to a bill from Senators Jay Rockefeller and Olympia Snowe that empowered the feds to " order the disconnection of any Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information systems or networks in the interest of national security . "
That provision was neutered after a public outcry .
Now , it calls on the U.S. government to " develop and rehearse detailed response and restoration plans " in the event of a major network threat .

Despite the fervent wishes of thousands , Rally America wo n't let Bill Caswell , Jalopnik 's $ 500 Craigslist rally - car driver , compete in July 's X Games .

A recap , in case you missed it : Back in March , an unemployed Chicagoan took a $ 500 Craigslist BMW to a World Rally Championship event in Mexico .
He went with no crew , no real tools , a rented cargo van , a co-driver he barely knew , and little more than a dream .
After being mobbed by crowds , having his car fall apart , and nearly dying behind the wheel , he finished third in his class , ahead of drivers with six - figure budgets and years of experience .

This Is How You Can Help
Here 's the latest : Last Friday , we published a story announcing the winners of the Jalopnik / Live Sockets Caswell T - Shirt Contest , where one lucky person won both a Microsoft XBox 360 and the chance to ride , at speed on a shakedown stage , in Caswell 's rally car .
In that post , I pointed out that Bill was n't getting an invite to the rally - car portion of X Games 16 , which takes place in July .
I suggested that you friend him on Facebook as a show of support ; Bill 's friend count subsequently went through the roof .
I suggested you write on the wall of the X Games Facebook page , and you did .
Enough people posted that the moderator started yanking comments .
I also mentioned the existence of a last - minute , grassroots campaign to get him entry into the Games .
I suggested that , if you wanted to see Bill and his ancient BMW there — even though the official invites have already been issued — you email J.B. Niday , Rally America 's managing director , and tell him what you think .

Wow , did you guys get off your ass .
You Have Upset This Man
Niday is apparently not happy , and while it may not be connected , several commenters claim to have received terse replies to their inquiries .
Cloud81918 received the following at 8:15 PM on Friday :

So there 's that .
And he 's right — the invites ( you can see the driver list here ) went out a while ago ( did n't we mention the campaign was last - minute ? ) , as did the last - minute " at large " invites , and Caswell 's chances of making it into the event are pretty slim all but nonexistent .
This post is just a reaction to an awful lot of people telling us that they wanted to see him in the Games .
And we 're all for making a statement .
Sign the Petition
Let 's make a few things clear : Bill is not invited to the Rally America - sanctioned portion of the X Games .
We have n't talked to him about it ( with the exception of a few text messages regarding his Pikes Peak effort — 13:50 up the hill and still alive !
— we have n't talked to him at all ) , but knowing his personality , he 's probably fine with this .
We 're not .
Do you believe this guy did something amazing ?
Do you want to see a homebuilt , DIY , $ 500 crapcan run in a stadium , on national television , with some of the most tricked - out rally cars in the country ?
Of course you do .
So do we .

Full Disclosure : Bill Caswell is my friend and has been for years .
Neither I nor Jalopnik profit in any way from his exposure or sponsor deals , and he is not a part of our editorial planning or privy to our publishing schedule .
The staff of this website thinks he 's worth getting behind simply because of what he does and how he does it .
Portugal were the favorites to win against North Korea but with recent shockers , it could still have been a great game .
With 1:0 at the end of first half as with Raul Meireles scoring the opener in the 29th minute .
The game looked like it could go both sides , but after few minutes into the second half – Simao made it 2 - 0 after 53 minutes and was followed by Hugo Almeida in the 56th to make it 3:0 .
Just four minutes after that at the 60th minute , Ronaldo cut the ball back to an on-running Tiago , who side - footed the ball into the net from the edge of the 18 - yard box to make it 4:0 .
With 3 goals in 7 minutes , Portugal had it easy .
But that did n’t stop them , as at 81st minute , substitute Liédson made it 5:0 with his first touch of the ball .
Ronaldo changed it to 6:0 at 87th minute as he was fortunate to see a goalkeeper ’s botched clearance fall perfectly for him to knock the rebound into the empty net ( video below ) .
At 89th minute , Tiago got his second and Portugal ’s seventh with a nice glancing header .
Final score – Portugal 7 and North Korea 0 .

Watch out for it .
Six BP executives , including ( from left ) CEO Tony Hayward , BP America Inc. President and Chairman Lamar McKay , BP General Counsel Rupert Bondy , and BP Managing Director Bob Dudley arrived at the White House around 10 a.m. and were still inside after noon .
BP : We care about the ' small people '
BP officials agreed to the White House ’s demand that they create a $ 20 billion escrow fund to pay claims to Gulf Coast residents and business owners , whom the company ’s chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , referred to as “ the small people . ”
Emerging from a four - hour meeting with more than a dozen senior administration officials , and a brief face - to - face with President Barack Obama , Svanberg told reporters that BP will also suspend dividend payments to shareholders this year and create a $ 100 million fund to assist oil rig workers left jobless by the government ’s six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling .

“ He ’s frustrated because he cares about the small people , and we care about the small people , " Svanberg said of Obama .
" I hear comments that sometimes large oil companies are greedy companies that do n’t care .
But that is not the case with BP .
We care about the small people . "
Minutes earlier , Obama veered from his teleprompter script to urge BP officials to consider Gulf residents and business owners , already struggling to rebound from Hurricane Katrina , when making financial decisions .
“ This season was going to the season when they were going to bounce back , ” said Obama , who returned from a two - day trip to the oil - fouled coast on Tuesday to deliver remarks on the spill in his first Oval Office address to the nation .
“ And so I emphasized to the chairman that when he ’s talking to shareholders , when he is in meetings in his boardroom , to keep in mind those individuals ; that they are desperate . ”
“ And so I emphasized to the chairman that when he ’s talking to shareholders , when he is in meetings in his boardroom , to keep in mind those individuals ; that they are desperate ; that some of them , if they do n’t get relief quickly , may lose businesses that have been in their families for two or three generations .
And the chairman assured me that he would keep them in mind , ” Obama said .
The concessions from BP are victories for Obama , particularly the $ 100 million fund for oil rig workers displaced by the moratorium .
Carol Browner , Obama ’s energy adviser , suggested the White House had no legal authority to force BP to pay lost wages .
“ There ’s a very significant legal question about their liability , ” Browner told reporters .
But BP executives appeared to get something out of their first meeting with the president .
Obama expressed confidence that the company is in sound financial condition – a question raised by a drop in its stock amid tough rhetoric – and he made a rare appeal for BP critics to heed its financial interest , for the good of the people along the Gulf .
“ I ’m absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people .
BP is a strong and viable company and it is in all of our interests that it remain so , ” Obama said .
“ So what this is about is accountability . ”
Lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , who was in charge of payments to families of victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , will oversee the $ 20 billion fund .
The White House made a point to stress that the balance is not a “ cap ” on the company ’s liabilities , and those hurt by the spill can still file lawsuits against BP , Obama pointed that out in his remarks .
And White House press secretary Robert Gibbs reiterated it in his briefing with reporters .
The White House had announced this past weekend that it would press BP to set up an escrow fund to pay claims from Gulf Coast residents amid growing complaints about difficulties in getting adequate compensation .
Officials said the fund would be administered by a third party .
Senate Democrats also sent a letter to BP naming the $ 20 billion price tag .
Wednesday marked Obama 's first discussion with Svanberg and BP CEO Tony Hayward since their oil rig exploded on April 20 , despite the president ’s four trips to the Gulf Coast .
The six BP executives arrived at the White House about 10 a.m. and remained inside until after 2 p.m .
The oil giant brought its top brass and even came armed with a top Clinton administration Justice Department official , Jamie Gorelick , whose name was floated as a possible attorney general pick for Obama .
The White House side of the conference table in the Roosevelt Room was stacked : Obama , Vice President Joe Biden , five Cabinet secretaries , Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , Attorney General Eric Holder and top presidential advisers .
Both sides had their lawyers on hand .
Obama was scheduled to spend 20 minutes in the meeting .
He entered the room with an entourage : Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and her coordinator for claims oversight , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Energy Secretary Steven Chu , Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett .
The first words BP executives uttered to Obama were an apology , White House officials said .
Asked if Obama accepted their apology , Gibbs said , “ I assume so , yes . ”
The White House gave BP executives a bit of cover at the start of the meeting , allowing them to arrive on the side of the West Wing and walk at a distance from reporters , rather than forcing them to come through the main entrance for visitors , which would have made it impossible for them to ignore the news media .
But ignore the news media they did , refusing to respond to shouted questions on about the size of the fund and whether they had met with the families of the 11 workers who were killed on April 20 .
Returning four hours later , the executives spoke to reporters for about five minutes .
“ I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the American people on behalf of all the employees in BP , many of whom are living on the Gulf coast , and I do thank you for the patience that you have in this difficult time , ” Svanberg said .
In overseeing the BP fund , Feinberg brings his years of experience running the Sept. 11 fund , which paid billions to the victims of the terror attacks , through a complex legal process where families would agree to take the government payment but give up their right to file a lawsuit separately — a process that conceivably could be replicated for the Gulf disaster .
Feinberg also works for the Treasury Department as the “ pay czar , ” reviewing compensation of executives of firms that received bailout funds .
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) said he was a good choice , based on his work for the Sept. 11 families .
“ The victims can be confident that real help is on the way with someone as fair , diligent and sympathetic as Ken Feinberg running this fund .
He did an amazingly good job in New York for the families of those lost on Sept. 11 and received plaudits from all sides .
I believe when Feinberg completes his mission here , the people in the Gulf will feel the same way , ” Schumer said .
Also Wednesday , Obama , intensifying his push for passing climate change legislation before the midterms , invited a bipartisan group of senators to the White House on June 23 in hopes of reaching a compromise on the stalled energy bill .
The intent is “ to discuss the process that the Senate will use going forward , ” Gibbs told reporters .
So far the invitees include Sens. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) , Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) , Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) , Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , Dick Lugar ( R - Ind. ) , Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) .
Obama drew sharp criticism from environmental groups for failing to back a carbon cap in his Oval Office address Tuesday night .
Instead , the president — who has vowed to wrangle the 60 votes necessary to overcome a GOP filibuster — said he was open to a variety of possible approaches heading forward .
Senate Democrats interpreted that as a virtual admission that Obama has given up on a controversial cap - and - trade bill passed in the House last year .
ThyssenKrupp CEO Ekkehard Schulz Iron Ore Speculators ' Serious Threat ' to Global Economy
Changes in the pricing system for iron ore have opened up possibilities for speculators , warns the CEO of steel producer ThyssenKrupp CEO in a SPIEGEL interview .

Here is my most recent Chicken of the Word : The Commando .
He is a Vietnam War era-inspired soldier .
I ’m trying to think of more to say than just that …
I guess I hope the painting speaks for itself ?
I can say , though , that after painting The Zulu and The Commando , I do n’t want to do any more jungle foliage for a while .
On a final note , I have one more chicken painting to post here … but I think I ’ll wait until tomorrow so as not to steop on this one ’s heels , or the heels of the yokai painting I have to paint and then post tonight .
Yikes , I ’ve got my hands full !

Much of what follows may seem obvious to some readers , pedantic to others .
But very few people seem to have much of a grasp of the basic technological , economic , and environmental issues that arise as resource extraction proceeds , and as a society adapts to depletion of its resource base .
So , at the risk of boring the daylights out of those already familiar with the history of extractive industries , here follows a spotlighting of relevant issues , with the events in the Gulf of Mexico ever - present in the wings and poised to take center stage as the subject of some later comments .
Readers in the “ already familiar ” category can skip straight to part 5 .
Following the failure of the latest efforts to plug the gushing leak from BP ’s Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , and amid warnings that oil could continue to flow for another two months or more , perhaps it ’s a good time to step back a moment mentally and look at the bigger picture — the context of our human history of resource extraction — to see how current events reveal deeper trends that will have even greater and longer - lasting significance .
1. The Pyramid Scheme
Perhaps it ’s best to start with the most familiar metaphor : resource extraction always proceeds on the basis of the low - hanging fruit principle .
We typically go after the most easily accessible , highest quality portions of the resource first , and save the hard - to - get , low - quality portions for later .
Geologists use a different metaphor ; they commonly speak of a “ resource pyramid . ”
The capstone represents the easily and cheaply extracted portion of the resource ; the next layers are portions of the resource base that can be extracted with more difficulty and expense , and often with worse environmental impacts ; while the remaining bulk of the pyramid represents resources that geologists believe are unlikely to be extracted under any realistic pricing scenario , usually because of depth , location , or quality issues .
There ’s a pyramid for oil , one for coal , one for iron ore , and so on .
As we chew our way down the layers of each pyramid , starting at the top , some fairly predictable things happen with regard to technology , economics , and environmental impacts .
These effects often mutually interact , and I will try to highlight those mutual interactions as we go .
2. Technology
Some resources can be extracted , at least in initial stages , with very simple tools .
Primitive mining was accomplished with stone and wooden picks and shovels , using reed baskets to carry ore ( usually copper , gold , or silver ) to nearby sites where it could be smelted in charcoal fires .
Once copper , tin , and iron had been smelted in sufficient quantities , metal tools began to be used in mining .
Early coal mining consisted simply of digging lumps from surface outcrops , but by the 18th century British miners were working in shafts over 300 feet deep .
Many very early oil wells consisted of shallow pits ( up to 100 ft deep ) dug into natural seeps ; the earliest known drilling for oil occurred in China in the fourth century , achieving depths of up to about 800 feet using bits attached to bamboo poles .
As petroleum became a heavily traded commodity in the early 20th century , rotary drills using steel pipes and bits were developed , able to penetrate to depths of thousands of feet .
The patterns are clear and unsurprising :
As resources near the Earth ’s surface become depleted , we have to work harder and dig deeper to extract more of what we want and have come to need .
Production problems lead to the development of new extractive technologies — which , in solving those problems , often also make more of the resource accessible .
As a larger portion of the resource base becomes available to society , more uses for the resource are discovered .
The new technologies themselves ( starting with metal tools ) also frequently wind up having other purposes — ones that may increase demand for the resource they were developed to extract .
There is no more significant or instructive example of these trends than the story of the steam engine — which was invented to pump water out of deepening coal mines , but ( when applied to other ends , such as providing the motive power for railroads ) became a prime user of coal .
Tellingly , iron rails were also first used in coal mines .
And thus , of course , began the Industrial Revolution .
Fast - forward to deepwater drilling rigs , satellite and seismic geological surveys , horizontal drilling , fracking , and Blowout Preventers ( BOPs ) for finding and extracting oil ( and unconventional natural gas ) ; Steam - Assisted Gravity Drainage ( SAGD ) technology for obtaining oil from tar sands ; long - wall mining , Underground Coal Gasification ( UCG ) , and Carbon Capture and Sequestration ( CCS ) in the coal industry ; and so much more .
Each extractive industry boasts its own fleet of cutting - edge technologies , each consisting of a suite of tool systems all working together to make the production of some fuel or ore cheaper or more environmentally benign .
The 21st - century search for useful non-renewable resources is testing the limits of science ; and both the brawn and the intricacy of machines that have been developed to feed our growing human needs for nonrenewable resources are truly impressive .
Watching some of these machines in action , it is tempting to think that human ingenuity has no bounds .
Moreover , since we are still fairly close to the top of the pyramid with regard to many nonrenewable resources , it is also natural to assume that constantly improving machines will enable us to dig very far down indeed , so as to continue supplying our burgeoning collective appetite for energy and minerals for many generations to come .
However , as we are about to see , the development of extractive technologies also involves tradeoffs and limits .
3. Economics
Fancy extraction technology comes at a price .
But investment in more expensive tools is often justified by greater efficiency of production , reduced environmental impacts , or by the ability to open more of the resource base to exploitation .
The relationship between cost and payoff is captured to some extent by the simple ratio of Return on Investment ( ROI ) , to which every drilling or mining company ’s bean counters pay vigilant attention .
This ratio can easily go sour in situations where the resource is n’t present in sufficient quantities ( even using the newest oil exploration techniques , two out of three initial wells — each costing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars — still comes up dry ) or where environmental problems get out of hand ( note to self : at end of fiscal year , remember to review BP ’s balance sheet for Gulf of Mexico operations ) .
But financial ROI is not the only return on investment that matters .
If we ’re discussing energy resources ( oil , gas , or coal ) then we also have to keep track of the ratio between the energy invested in exploration and production versus the energy yielded by the resources extracted .
This is commonly termed Energy Return on Energy Invested , or EROEI .
Technology uses energy , and bigger and more complicated machines usually use more of it .
Moreover , the mining and refining of deeper or lower - grade fossil fuels generally takes more energy regardless of what technology is used .
When the amount of energy required to produce a given quantity of fuel equals the amount of energy obtained from burning it , that fuel ceases to be a net energy source .
There may be financial reasons to continue the production process ( including government subsidies or tax write - offs ) , but from an energetic standpoint the exercise has become pointless .
The EROEI for fossil fuels is declining for all the above reasons .
Since each layer further down the resource pyramid requires more expensive extractive machinery , while yielding lower - quality or more expensively produced fuels or ores , one would expect that the market price for resources would continually be rising .
But this has not been the case in most instances — until recently .
During the 20th century , most commodity prices ( including prices for metal ores and , often , fossil fuels ) actually declined in inflation - adjusted terms .
Why ?
More areas for exploration were continually being opened , while payoffs from the ability of new technology to access lower layers of the resource pyramid trumped both the extra cost of the technology itself and the declining resource quality ( a factor that must be overcome with increasing investment in refining or ore upgrading ) .
Over the past few years , that situation has begun to change .
A study , Increasing Global Nonrenewable Natural Resource Scarcity by Chris Clugston tracks the production levels and price of 57 Non-renewable Natural Resources ( NNRs ) .
Clugston begins by pointing out that
During the 20th century , global production levels associated with 56 of the 57 analyzed NNRs ( 98 % ) increased annually , while global price levels associated with 45 of the 57 analyzed NNRs ( 79 % ) decreased annually .
Generally increasing global NNR production levels in conjunction with generally decreasing global NNR price levels indicate relative global NNR abundance during the 20th century .
On the whole , global NNR supplies kept pace with ever - increasing global demand during the 20th century .
So far , so good .
But that ’s changing .
Generally slowing or declining global NNR production growth in conjunction with generally increasing global NNR prices indicate increasing NNR scarcity during the early years of the 21st century .
. . .
Annual global production levels increased during the 20th century , then decreased during the 21st century ; while annual price levels decreased during the 20th century , then increased during the 21st century .
. . .
Case in point : for petroleum , between the years 2000 and 2010 production increased 9 percent , while prices rose by almost 400 percent .
No , we ’re not “ running out ” of oil , but we are running out of cheap oil .
Clugston echoes this conclusion more generally : “ We are not about to ‘ run out ’ of any NNR ; we are about to run ‘ critically short ’ of many . ”
Something else we learn from petroleum : as production expands and high - quality deposits deplete , continually higher prices do not represent the full extent of the problems that arise .
At some point , regardless of price , production reaches a maximum rate and begins to decline ( this , of course , is what the whole “ Peak Oil ” discussion is all about ) .
This “ peaking ” phenomenon has occurred with regard to the extraction of many different resources , and in many places and times , so its dynamics are now the subject of fairly sophisticated study .
Standard economic theory holds that , as a resource becomes scarce , potential buyers will bid prices upward ; and as prices escalate , increasing numbers of users will turn to substitutes .
It ’s easy to point to historic examples where these things happened , but there have also been instances where prices responded in a highly non-linear fashion ( more on that below ) , and where substitutes were unavailable or inadequate .
In the case of fossil fuels , substitutes do exist ; however , most have drawbacks of one kind or another ( see my report Searching for a Miracle ) and the scale of current global fossil fuel usage makes a full transition to substitutes a truly daunting prospect .
It is important to know whether commodity prices escalate linearly as petroleum and other on - renewable resources become scarcer .
If they do , then the invisible hand of the market will solve many of the problems that scarcity brings : in addition to making substitutes more attractive , higher prices will motivate efforts to increase efficient usage of the resource .
But a recent historic example calls such rosy scenarios for painless , market - led resource transitions into question .
In the years and months leading up to July 2008 , demand for oil was increasing , but global production remained stagnant .
Traders bid the price up to a record $ 147 per barrel — and global financial mayhem followed .
While a concurrent derivatives / real estate crash was responsible for much of the bloodshed , dramatic slumps in the auto , airline , trucking , and shipping industries seemed closely tied to the oil price spike .
These ( along with the general economic convulsion ) resulted in declining fuel demand , which in turn caused petroleum prices to plummet nearly to $ 30 per barrel in December 2008 .
This then led to curtailed investment in oil exploration — which , in due course , will provoke another rapid price rise as supplies dwindle .
The cycle will presumably begin again ; and each time it recurs , it will likely have an even more devastating economic impact .
Not all non-renewable resources will provoke similar scenarios as they deplete , as very few are so essential to the economy that scarcity or price spikes could trigger a major recession .
However , price volatility does seem to be a typical sign of depletion - led resource scarcity .
Finally , perhaps the most significant economic factor with regard to the extraction of nonrenewable resources is growth .
Modern economies depend on growth in provision of goods and services ; meanwhile , world population continues to expand .
As we make our way down the down the pyramid , increasing appetites ( growing population times growing per capita consumption rates ) translate to increasing dependence on depleting resources .
If total consumption rates were declining or even constant , the economic and environmental problems stemming from resource depletion would be easier to solve .
Growth makes all such problems more intractable with every passing year .
4. Environmental Impacts
In many respects , advancing technology tends to reduce the environmental impact of each increment of resource extraction ( though there are exceptions ! ) .
Underground coal mining in the early days — only a few decades ago — was far more dangerous , dirty , and dreary than it is today , though mine disasters still occur ( as we sadly discovered just a few weeks ago in West Virginia ) and miners still die from pneumoconiosis .
Similarly , the oil business in the early 20th century lacked regulations and safety technology , and resulted in more frequent oil spills and fatal accidents than does today ’s high - tech industry .
The first successful exploratory oil wells nearly always produced gushers because there was little to prevent pressurized oil from shooting out the top of the drill pipe once reservoir contact was made .
These days , gushers are extremely rare due to modern oil well pressure control systems .
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico , we see on display all the most advanced technology for drilling safety and spill cleanup .
Blowout preventers , pressure monitors , careful planning , regulations , and advanced engineering combine to make accidents rare .
If something does go wrong , there are remote - controlled underwater vehicles , top kills , and junk shots to seal off the leaks , and oil booms and chemical dispersants to deal with the spill itself .
And yet , despite all this technology and expertise , we still we are witness to one of the worst environmental disasters in history .
Why ?
As we are still learning , the Deepwater Horizon disaster was due largely to gross negligence on part of several companies , primarily BP , and also to the approval of a flawed drilling plan by the Federal Government ’s Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) .
Such lapses are to be anticipated .
In a deepwater drilling operation with a budget running upwards of a hundred million dollars , every minute costs money , so there are strong incentives to cut costs .
Often , engineers ( who may be more concerned about safety ) are overruled by management ( who are more concerned about budgets and ROI ) .
Then there is the phenomenon — common throughout government — of regulators being figuratively ( or literally ) in bed with industries they are supposed to be regulating .
So in March 2009 , when BP filed a plan with the MMS , repeatedly asserting that it was “ unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities , ” so unlikely in fact that “ a blowout scenario . . . is not required for the operations proposed , ” the regulators simply took the company at its word .
In the bigger scheme of things , an event such as the Deepwater Horizon explosion becomes more likely with every passing year , despite the continuing development of superior technology : as oil production levels grow to meet rising demand , and as the industry is forced to drill deeper in ever more hostile environments , there are more things to go wrong ; and when problems happen , they are harder to fix .
While the world ’s attention is appropriately riveted on the consequences of the Macondo blowout , it is important to remember the ongoing , routine environmental devastation that comprises the background static of contemporary industrial life : climate chaos , air and water pollution , and loss of biodiversity .
In many instances of resource extraction — including “ mountaintop removal ” coal mining and tar sands oil production — massive environmental destruction is the result not of unforeseen accidents , but of normal operations .
With the convergence of climate change and “ clean coal ” technology we see the culmination of many of the trends discussed here .
Climate change is an environmental consequence of nonrenewable resource usage , and one that is so horrendous it will stop civilization in its tracks .
Therefore something must be done to stop it .
Several key industrial nations can’t afford to give up coal , the highest - carbon fuel , because their economies depend on it and the alternatives would be too costly to develop .
The ideal solution would be a new technology to clean up carbon emissions from burning coal .
Voila !
Such a technology exists — Carbon Capture and Sequestration ( CCS ) , which entails burying carbon dioxide from the coal combustion process underground .
But CCS will cost so much to build to scale that the technology will almost certainly never actually be implemented .
( see China 's Coal Bubble and How It Will Deflate US Efforts to " Develop Clean " )
The upshot : there is no apparent solution to the coal / climate conundrum that preserves economic growth much longer .
The trends end in some sort of unpredictable discontinuity .
5. Deepwater Horizon : Impact on Future Oil Production
Now , back to the events in the Gulf of Mexico .
The U.S. Department of Energy forecasts that “ a vast majority ” of projected increases in U.S. oil production in the near term will come from Gulf deepwater fields similar to the site of the Deepwater Horizon spill .
Such deepwater fields currently represent about 70 percent of all Gulf oil production ( the other 30 percent come from shallow depths , typically of a few hundred feet ) .
Offshore oil provides almost a third of total U.S. oil production of 5.5 million barrels per day , and that percentage is rising .
For the world as a whole , the International Energy Agency projects that by 2020 deepwater will be providing 40 percent of all oil being extracted .
Why the emphasis on deepwater ?
Because we ’ve already chewed our way down through the higher levels of the oil pyramid : there ’s very little onshore or shallow - water oil left to find .
So down we go !
The BP spill is likely to throw a wrench into these plans .
Heavier regulations , and higher ( more expensive ) standards are on the way .
President Obama has just ordered the suspension of all current U.S. deepwater drilling operations for six months , and future deepwater projects could be delayed by years .
Insurance costs for deepwater projects will soar ( “ The cost of insuring a rig against a so - called physical loss — damage to the rig itself — can easily surpass $ 3 million a year , and could reach $ 9 million depending on the deductible , ” according to Rigzone www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?hpf=1&a_id=93614).
Total insurance claims on the Deepwater Horizon disaster could far exceed the total premiums paid by all oil drillers to insurance companies in 2010 , so a bankrupting of some insurers is at least possible .
Further , deepwater projects require financing — however , in case anyone has n’t noticed , the economy is falling apart .
Banks are n’t lending because of all the bad loans on their books ; and , though oil companies may be flush with cash , they prefer to spread risks around .
Now that the risks associated with deepwater exploration appear much larger , and credit is tight in any case , fewer investors are likely to want to jump aboard .
Oil companies may want to just hang onto their cash by buying up their own stock shares .
After all , the object of the game is to make a profit ; producing more oil is just a means to that end , and if a better means is available , why not go with it ?
Sure , “ financializing ” the oil industry does n’t work over the long term , as oil companies need booked reserves in order to attract investors , and maintaining reserves requires exploration .
But who ’s in it for the long term ?
Hey , in the long term , we ’re dead .
Maybe it ’s time to cash out and let a new generation of managers figure out what to do next .
Then there is the problem of over - optimism .
Developers of production projects are naturally inclined to talk up the prospects for the latest “ play . ”
Later , when reality sets in , initial rosy forecasts may not be borne out .
Case in point : BP ’s flagship deepwater Gulf of Mexico project , Thunderhorse , was slated to produce a billion barrels of oil at the rate of 250,000 barrels a day ( b / d ) .
Production hit 172,000 b/d in January 2009 , but then declined rapidly to 61,000 b/d by the end of last year .
BP has not commented publicly on the reason for this unexpected production crash , but outside observers are skeptical that the platform will ever actually produce the promised billion barrels .
According to Post Carbon Institute Fellow Tom Whipple in “ Peak Oil Review ” for May 24 , “ At least 25 other deepwater projects are said to be facing problems of falling production , raising the question of just how much oil these very expensive deepwater projects will ever produce . ”
www.energybulletin.net/node/52897
Take one Thunderhorse , add a Deepwater Horizon , mix thoroughly , and what do you get ?
Investor jitters .
Economic optimists never tire of pointing out how enormous the resource pyramid is when viewed as a whole .
When society is desperate , they say , we will go after energy resources and raw materials no matter where they are , no matter how expensive the process , and no matter how much environmental destruction comes with it .
We ’ll solve problems that arise as best we can and move on .
Growth is inevitable and unstoppable , and if fuels and materials that enable growth exist , we will find and use them .
In reality , though , things may not work out that way .
New extraction projects require the cooperation of many functioning systems including manufacturing / fabrication , finance , insurance , regulation , and advanced technical education .
As that system of systems becomes more complicated , the sites of potential breakdown multiply .
The current economic crisis is likely to rupture the system in multiple places , crippling extractive industries .
Much of the remaining oil , coal , gas , and mineral resource base that could technically be extracted may well end up staying in the ground simply because society can’t continue to organize itself functionally at a high enough level to maintain the growing effort needed .
In short , the Deepwater Horizon story is not just an environmental tragedy .
It is a story about the limits of both extractive technologies and the increasingly complex societal systems that support them .
It ’s a reminder that the whole project of basing unending economic growth on ever - increasing rates of extraction of depleting nonrenewable resources is wrongheaded from start to finish .
And it ’s a signal that hopes for our economy to magically “ dematerialize ” have turned out to be just that — mere hopes .
6 . This Is What the End of the Oil Age Looks Like
There will be plenty of blame to go around , as events leading up to the fatal Deepwater Horizon rig explosion are sorted out .
Even if further efforts to plug the gushing leak succeed , the damage to the Gulf environment and to the economy of the region are incalculable and will linger for a very long time indeed .
The deadly stench from oil - oaked marshes — as spring turns to hot , fetid summer — will by itself ruin tens or hundreds of thousands of lives and livelihoods .
Then there ’s the loss of the seafood industry : we ’re talking about more than the crippling of the economic backbone of the region ; anyone who ’s spent time in New Orleans ( my wife ’s family all live there ) knows that the people and culture of southern Louisiana are literally as well as figuratively composed of digested oysters , shrimp , and speckled trout .
Given the historic political support from this part of the country for offshore drilling , and for the petroleum industry in general , this really amounts to sacrificing the faithful on the altar of oil .
President Obama has called the spill a “ massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , ” and his representatives are now referring to it as both the worst oil spill and the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history .
But it ’s much more than that .
It is a sign that we ’re nearing the end of a trail we ’ve been following for at least a couple of centuries now .
Once again , I must repeat : we ’re not even close to running out of oil , coal , gas , or most minerals .
But we face a convergence of entirely predictable but severe consequences from the depletion of the concentrated , high - grade resources at the top of the pyramid : less affordable and more volatile commodity prices ; worse environmental impacts — cumulative , mutually reinforcing impacts — both from accidents and from “ normal ” extraction operations ; declining resource quality ; declining EROEI for fossil fuels ; and the need for massive new investment both to grow production levels , and to keep environmental consequences at bay .
And all of this is happening just as investment capital ( needed to fix all these problems ) is becoming scarce .
In short , the monetary and non-monetary costs of growth have been rising faster than growth itself , and it looks as though we have now gotten to the inevitable point where growth may in fact no longer be an option .
The Deepwater Horizon disaster reminds us that , of all non-renewable resources , oil best deserves to be thought of as the Achilles heel of modern society .
Without cheap oil , our industrial food system — from tractor to supermarket — shifts from feast to famine mode ; our entire transportation system sputters to a halt .
We even depend on oil to fuel the trains , ships , and trucks that haul the coal that supplies half our electricity .
We make our computers from oil - derived plastics .
Without oil , our whole societal ball of yarn begins to unravel .
But the era of cheap , easy petroleum is over ; we are paying steadily more and more for what we put in our gas tanks — more not just in dollars , but in lives and health , in a failed foreign policy that spawns foreign wars and military occupations , and in the lost integrity of the biological systems that sustain life on this planet .
The only solution is to do proactively , and sooner , what we will end up doing anyway as a result of resource depletion and economic , environmental , and military ruin : end our dependence on the stuff .
Everybody knows we must do this .
Even a recent American president ( an oil man , it should be noted ) admitted that , “ America is addicted to oil . ”
Will we let this addiction destroy us , or will we overcome it ?
Good intentions are not enough .
We must make this the central practical , fiscal priority of the nation .
In my 2006 book , The Oil Depletion Protocol : A Plan to Avert Oil Wars , Terrorism and Economic Collapse , I laid out a simple formula that could guide us in systematically reducing our global dependence on oil .
The same general plan could be adapted for use with all other nonrenewable resources .
At the time , I naively thought that environmentalists would eagerly take up the idea , and that a few courageous politicians would champion it .
So far , there has in fact been very little interest in the Protocol .
It turns out that nearly everyone likes the idea of using less oil , but nobody wants to take the step of actually mandating a reduction in its production and consumption , because that would require us to dethrone our Holy of Holies — economic growth .
It ’s so much more comfortable to spout support for the intention to build more electric cars — a technology that in fact will take decades to gain even moderate market penetration .
Fair enough .
But where does that leave us ?
In an oily mess at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . . . and entangled in what may be the ultimate Catch 22 :
We want more petroleum - fueled economic growth , but we hate what the pursuit of petroleum is doing to us ( not to mention the environment ) , and it looks as though “ more ” may not be an option much longer in any case .
There ’s just no easy answer here , folks .
GUATEMALA CITY ( Reuters Life ! ) - Biologists tracking jaguars in the Guatemalan jungle might smell nice but it ’s all in the name of science , with researchers finding the Calvin Klein cologne Obsession for Men attracts big cats .

Biologists Rony Garcia and Jose Moreira from the Wildlife Conservation Society ’s ( WCS ) Jaguar Conservation Program say they use hidden cameras as a primary source for observing and tracking jaguars in Guatemala ’s Maya Biosphere Reserve .
But they also rely on Obsession for Men , a cologne known for its complex scent , to help lure then research and hopefully ultimately preserve jaguars in the Central American country .
“ The method we are using to study the jaguars here in Guatemala is a non-invasive method which is based on photographing the individuals by using camera traps , ” Moreira told Reuters Television .
“ It has been very useful using Obsession ( for Men ) to get the jaguars in front of these camera traps ... and that allows us to estimate with greater confidence the genders and the numbers that live in each studied site . ”
The discovery that Obsession for Men acted as a magnet for jaguars was the result of an experiment by the WCS ’s Bronx Zoo in New York .
The WCS was looking for ways to get cheetahs in front of camera traps , and , after several years of testing with different fragrances , found spraying the musky Obsession For Men near the heat - and - motion - sensitive cameras drew the cats for longer than other scents .
They also tried out about 23 other fragrances but Obsession for Men kept the cats ’ attention for longest with Nina Ricci ’s L’Air du Temps coming second .
The practice made its way down to Guatemala , where Garcia and Moreira said they have been recording similar success in the wild since 2007 , allowing them to track jaguars and even record their mating rituals .
Garcia said the results will be invaluable to conservation efforts .
“ These camera traps help us to identify how many jaguars are living in this area ... ( and ) helps us to have control over the population and lets us say to the government , to the public , that Laguna del Tigre still deserves conservation , ” he said .
The WCS said it tentatively plans to expand the use of the cologne in programs in Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Peru and Ecuador in coming years .

BP 's woes over the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster increased today when the company 's latest attempt to contain the spill foundered as a result of a saw getting stuck in the pipe from which the oil was gushing .
Remote - controlled equipment on the sea bed , a mile beneath the surface in the Gulf of Mexico , positioned a diamond - edged saw against the bottom of the damaged pipe from which up to 19,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily .
Engineers were hoping to make a clean cut across the pipe to allow a custom - built cap to be put on top , to siphon the oil to tankers on the surface .
But after the saw jammed , a second device had to be taken down from a nearby ship , further delaying efforts to contain the spill , which is now in its fifth week .
Admiral Thad Allen , leader of the federal response to the disaster , said : " Anybody that has ever used a saw knows every once in a while it will bind up .
That 's kind of what 's happening there . "
But later a source close to the operation said the operation to free the saw had been a success and the operation was continuing .
BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said today that the oil industry might have to change the way it operated in extracting deep - water oil .
He told the Financial Times : " We have been driving safe , reliable , operations through the company within the existing industry paradigm .
What this causes us to question is whether that paradigm is right for the future . "
He conceded that BP had not been fully prepared to deal with the deep - water blow - out on 20 April .
" What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit . "
BP 's survival as an independent company is now being openly discussed in the City .
Its share price continued to tumble today following the failed well - capping .
Analysts are wondering whether merger talks – as happened between BP and its arch rival Shell in 2007 – might arise again as BP 's ability to pay dividends is questioned , and its public credibility in America , which provides 40 % of its income , plummets .
BP 's share price fell 3 % in early trading on top of the double - digit falls seen on Tuesday , and it has now lost a third of its value ( equating to £ 44bn ) since the Deepwater Horizon explosion .
" If BP 's share price continues to fall , it could become a takeover target , " said David Buik , a financial commentator at the brokerage BGC Partners in London .
" There are so many imponderables over whether its liabilities would be capped or not . "
He said Hayward 's position seemed vulnerable .
Hayward 's handling of the crisis has come under scrutiny following a series of gaffes .
On Wednesday , he was forced to apologise for saying : " I want my life back " .
He said the remark had been " hurtful and thoughtless " especially to the families of the 11 men who died in the well explosion .
To add to the oil company 's problems , the wind has shifted and is now blowing the huge oil slick towards Florida .
Authorities there have been laying booms along the threatened shoreline , anticipating the arrival of oil by the end of the week .
Oil slicks have already polluted barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi , and more than 100 miles of coastline in Louisiana .
Speculation about BP 's future intensified after the US attorney general , Eric Holder , announced a criminal investigation of the disaster , though he did not specify BP by name .
Analysts agreed that doubts about BP 's prospects were inevitable while the crisis continued .
Kim Fustier , oil analyst with Credit Suisse , in London , said the risk of a dividend cut was clearly rising since potential spill liabilities could reach $ 37bn .
But Fustier was not willing to comment on whether BP was a possible takeover target .
Shell , which announced a $ 4.7bn cash purchase of the US shale gas producer East Resources last week , said it never responded to that kind of speculation .
The previous chief executive of BP , Lord Browne of Madingley , revealed in a recent autobiography entitled Beyond Business that he took BP to the brink of a merger with Shell six years ago only to be thwarted at the last minute by opposition from a handful of his own board members .
" We missed the boat .
We estimated that a merger could create synergies of around $ 9bn a year in three to five years ' time . "
But there were also reports that Hayward had held similar discussions in 2007 when BP 's share price had been weakened by the Texas City refinery fire , in which 15 workers died .
The plunging value of BP is a blow to British pension funds as it is estimated to provide £ 1 in every £ 7 paid in dividends by FTSE - 100 companies .
BP is also a big provider of revenue to the exchequer .
It said last night that it paid $ 6.3 bn in global corporate income tax , of which $ 1.1 bn ( £ 690 m ) was in the UK .
BP expects to pay about $ 4bn in 2009 in production taxes globally , of which £ 130 m would be in Britain .
Duncan Exley , of lobby organisation FairPensions , cautioned investors : " Social and corporate governance issues have a history of precipitating crises which damage our economy and our investments . "
The tensions between Israel and Turkey may have escalated a notch : Turkey reportedly froze billions of dollars worth of defense deals with Israel following the Israel Navy 's raid on the aid flotilla to Gaza on May 31 .
The report in the newspaper Today 's Zaman has not been confirmed by any official announcements .

" There is no change at the moment in defense plans with Turkey .
We have received no message , " said a top Israeli defense official .
However , defense industry sources say it 's probably just a matter of time before Ankara freezes defense deals with Israel .
Some companies have already returned their representatives from Turkey .
Thursday 's news followed Israel 's refusal to apologize or offer concessions for the deaths of the Turkish citizens killed aboard the Mavi Marmara ship , the newspaper said .
The 16 projects reportedly suspended include a $ 5 billion deal for 1,000
Merkava Mark III tanks , a $ 50 million plan to upgrade Turkish M - 60 tanks , and an $ 800 million agreement to buy two Israeli patrol aircraft and an Airborne Warning and Control System jet .
Turkey is also putting aside a $ 632.5 million deal for 54 F - 4 Phantom jets , and a $ 75 million program for 48 F - 5 fighter bombers , says the report .
Bilateral corporate deals in the private sector would continue as usual unless the companies decide otherwise , according to Today 's Zaman .
The earliest the frozen deals could be reinstated is after the next election in Turkey , say defense sources .
But in fact , not all these deals are being executed and some already have been completed , say industry sources .
Top people in the army and Defense Ministry say they have received messages from their counterparts in the Turkish army decrying the anti-Israel bent in Ankara , led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
Flourishing relations take a downturn
The military alliance between Israel and Turkey developed in the mid-1990s .
The two countries signed a series of agreements , including intelligence sharing and joint military exercises .
Israel Air Force pilots flew in Turkish airspace and , according to foreign news reports , Israel placed monitoring stations on Turkey 's borders with Syria and Iran .
The relations included a large number of contracts for Israeli companies to sell arms and systems , and to upgrade Turkish military systems .
But , as the defense sources say , some of the deals never came to fruition and others are already done .
The warm relations began to cool not with the flotilla incident but a year and a half ago , when Israel embarked on Operation Cast Lead .
In 2009 , Turkey excluded Israel from its annual Anatolian Eagle military drill , and it has done so again this year .
Yet the two armies continued to cooperate : Israeli naval forces took part in a rescue exercise under the auspices of NATO , and three months ago , Turkish chief of staff General Ilker Basbug hosted Israel 's top officer , Gabi Ashkenazi , at a conference in Ankara .
Two months ago Uri Shani , director - general of the Defense Ministry , participated in a ceremonial inauguration of Patton tanks that had been upgraded by Israel Military Industries .
But military ties may have to be suspended as well until a change to a friendlier government .
The Defense Ministry said there has been no change in cooperation with Turkey .
But a defense establishment source told TheMarker on Thursday : " I 'm not sure we 'll want to participate in Turkish tenders , given its relations with Iran . "
On the suspension of defense deals , he said the only open transaction at the moment is the $ 180 million deal for drones - for which Turkey has already paid in full and six of the unmanned aerial vehicles have been delivered .
Fifty years ago this Sunday , feminist theology of the second wave was born .
Well , maybe not born — but it made it into Time , under the headline “ Religion : Male and Female Theology . ”
Yes , Monday , June 27 , 1960 .
The cover picture : US Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II .
Here ’s how the article opened :
Modern theology should be labeled FOR MEN ONLY , according to one woman who has made a study of the subject .
In the current issue of the quarterly Journal of Religion , Valerie Saiving Goldstein , 39 , instructor in religion at Hobart and William Smith colleges in Geneva , N.Y. , lodges a feminine complaint against contemporary theologians : they are making the mistake of assuming that a thinking man ’s theology is equally good for a thinking woman .
The essay cited in the Time article was Saiving ’s “ The Human Situation : A Feminine View . ”
Originally published in a scholarly venue alongside a piece by Rudolf Bultmann , it went on to be reprinted in the widely influential anthology Womanspirit Rising , edited by Carol P. Christ and Judith Plaskow ( re-issued in 1992 and still available today ) .
As a result , Saiving ’s scholarly article was read by generations of feminists — or soon - to - be- feminists — and generations of college and graduate students across the United States and beyond .
Its influence was substantial .
Mary Daly , for example , cited Saiving in her own influential early work , The Church and the Second Sex , and Plaskow herself wrote a ( published ) dissertation drawing substantially on Saiving ’s essay entitled Sex , Sin and Grace : Women ’s Experience and the Theologies of Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich .
Womanspirit Rising published Saiving alongside others whose names came to define the second wave of feminist theology : Mary Daly , Rosemary Ruether , Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza and Elaine Pagels , Rita Gross , Merlin Stone , Starhawk , and Aviva Cantor among them ; as well as Christ and Plaskow themselves .
While critiqued ( not least by its own editors in their 1992 preface and their sequel , Weaving the Visions ) , the anthology continues to bring women , and men , to an understanding of why gender matters and why it matters when it comes to religion .
It lets us see burgeoning feminist work — both critical and constructive — in Christianity , in Judaism , and in what were then new “ goddess ” religions .
Despite sometimes being seen as dated in her essentialism , Saiving is , and was , key to this and much much more .
Womanspirit Rising was not the first time nor the last that the 1960 essay would be reprinted .
It appeared again in a scholarly venue , the journal Pastoral Psychology , in 1966 .
And it has been repeatedly anthologized in the decades since , appearing in The Nature of Man in Theological and Psychological Perspective ( 1962 , 1973 ) edited by Sam Doniger and in Readings in Ecology and Feminist Theology in 1995 .
Even more recently , in 2009 , Saiving ’s piece was anthologized in Creation and Humanity : The Sources of Christian Theology edited by Ian McFarland .
Here , Saiving ’s essay appears alongside selections from Augustine and Calvin , Justin Martyr , Schleiermacher , Barth , and Aquinas .
“ The Human Situation ” is bracketed by the work of Reinhold Niebuhr and James H. Cone .
Saiving is among nine ( primarily twentieth and / or early twenty - first century ) women to appear among the fifty - one thinkers .
That Saiving ’s essay remains influential is attested to , as well , in both Catholic and Mormon discussions on the Web .
And yet , many of those influenced by “ The Human Situation ” have forgotten Valerie Saiving and are surprised to discover her work .
Witness the blogosphere of today .
Theological Nostalgia
“ I am a student of theology ; I am also a woman , ” wrote Saiving in the first two sentences of “ The Human Situation . ”
She was recognized in that issue of Time alongside reports of the Nixon / Kennedy rivalry , of unrest at Vanderbilt over the expulsion of “ Negro Divinity Student James M. Lawson Jr. for promoting sit in demonstrations , ” and of various university commencements that saw , for example , two “ Negro ” Ivy League graduates as newsworthy .
It included , as well , a book review , entitled “ The Ogre of Merion , ” examining a book entitled Art and Argyrol ; yes , about the same suburban Philadelphia man whose art collection is the subject of a 2010 documentary called Art of the Steal .
Elsewhere in the magazine , science raised and answered questions that seem so contemporary : Can science help parents choose in advance the sex of their baby ?
The answer : not now , but perhaps before very long .
That same magazine included this commentary on the era ’s pessimism :
If the world outside was anything like the one described at commencements across the U.S. last week , the 1960s graduate would do well to forget that $ 600 - a- month job offer and bury himself as far back in the library stacks as he can squirm .
Reading about Saiving alongside such details : the sense of discovery , the hope , the odd combination of so familiar and so unfamiliar that makes for theological nostalgia .
Whether we are talking about oil paintings or feminist theology , so long ago , so recently , fifty years .
Nixon is long dead , as is Kennedy .
“ Negroes ” have become African Americans .
Radcliffe no longer produces graduates , and it is not quite so newsworthy when students of color graduate from the Ivy League .
We remain unsure whether parents can ( or should ) choose their baby ’s sex ( even though we also know they do ) .
And we continue to care about Philadelphia ’s Barnes Collection .
But we know so much more .
Fifty years have passed .
Women ’s Sins
Saiving ’s essay focused on much more than the linking of her identity to her theological perspective .
She made the argument more broadly that , for example , Christianity ’s condemnation of pride and will - to - power as the central human sin and selfless ( sacrificial ) love as the solution .
By emphasizing difference between male and female , masculine and feminine , Saiving pointed to the tragedy of selflessness in the absence of the capacity to develop a self and the risks of disappearance into the lives of others ( including one ’s children ) as typically feminine temptations .
As she writes of women ’s sins :
They are better suggested by such terms as triviality , distractability , and diffuseness ; lack of an organizing center or focus ; dependence on others for one ’s sense of self - definition ; tolerance at the expense of standards of excellence ; inability to respect the boundaries of privacy ; sentimentality , gossipy sociability , and mistrust of reason — in short , underdevelopment or negation of the self .
( Journal of Religion , Vol. 40 , No . 2 )
Saiving ’s analysis looks to culture as well .
She does so by naming modernity a “ hypermasculine culture , ” with its emphasis on external achievement , self - differentiation , and separation of man from nature .
And , she points , as well , to “ the feminizing of society itself ” that she witnessed around her .
Here , she has in mind a kind of selflessness and community that risked the merging of “ individual identity in the identities of others , ” leaving us with “ a chameleon - like character who responds to others but has no personal identity of his own ” .
( This fifty - year - old characterization may indeed have been prophetic — of , if nothing else , our poll - driven democracy . )
But it points to more ; Saiving quotes Lionel Trilling as well :
The American educated middle class is firm in its admiration of non-conformity and dissent .
The right to be non-conformist , the right to dissent , is part of our conception of community .
Everybody says so …
Admiring non-conformity and loving community , we have decided that we are all non-conformists together .
In the face of memory and nostalgia , what the phrase “ I am a student of theology .
I am also a woman ” might mean remains up for grabs .
What it might mean to be a culture embracing dissent through conformity , too , remains a dilemma .
Saiving gave us the gift of identity — and we live with it and wonder , perhaps , what she would make of what we have done with her gift .
We have made theology , and we have made women ’s studies .
And we have deconstructed both .
We have certainly not made a world where women are free .
How inviting it looks , the fruit laid out for us in grocery stores and supermarkets in a profusion of bright color .
Red , green , yellow , orange , purple . . .
Cherries , grapes , berries .
Apples and oranges , bananas , peaches oh , especially the peaches .
Or maybe you prefer apricots , maybe melons , or something else from nature ’s overflowing cornucopia .
And the vegetables , their color subdued , but their variety and quantity as great as the fruit yellow corn , green peas , carrots , potatoes , squash .
And lettuce , of course , and cauliflower , and so much more .
It ’s a daily show of the great abundance of food that springs from the fertile soil of many , many farms and is rushed to stores and markets for our choosing .
But what of the people who clamber up and down ladders , reaching high in trees to pluck fruit for us ?
Who pluck it from bushes or vines ?
Reaching , stretching and picking .
Reach , stretch , pick .
Reach , stretch , pick . . . Their dirty , sweaty work seems endless .
And what of those who wield short - handled hoes as they scurry over dirt fields like spiders , bent double , rhythmically bending and straightening .
Bending and straightening as they move swiftly along dirt rows to deftly free vegetables from the earth ’s grasp .
Much of that work is done by child labor .
An estimated 400,000 workers 18 or younger – some as young as six – are among those who do the vital , difficult and dangerous work in our fields , orchards and vineyards , for poverty - level pay and few , if any , benefits or protections from some of the country ’s most exploitive employers .
Virtually all farmworkers need our help , for virtually all farmworkers are treated badly .
But help is particularly needed by the younger workers , many of them migrants , who have little , if any , say in how they ’re treated .
Children as young as 12 often work in the fields 8 to 12 hours a day , sometimes more , six days a week when school ’s not in session , risking injury and poisoning from the pesticides that are regularly sprayed in areas where they work .
They risk exhaustion and dehydration caused by working under the hot sun .
And like most farmworkers , the young often work in fields that lack such simple amenities as fresh drinking water and field toilets .
The young workers suffer fatalities at five times the rate of children doing other work , and far more disabling injuries .
Although federal law prohibits children under 18 from doing hazardous work in other industries , it allows 16 and 17 - year - olds to do hazardous work in agriculture , which the National Safety Council cites as our most hazardous industry .
Even when school is in session , the youngsters are allowed to put in up to 18 hours of work per week , the main cause for their generally poor school attendance .
They ’re too busy earning money for their poor families and just too tired anyway to attend .
Many end up dropping out .
Barely half manage to graduate from high school .
Some of the pre-school children of workers also are affected by the poor conditions and dangers .
Their parents have little choice but to bring them along to the fields , where they often play around dangerous harvesting machinery .
Many end up working beside their parents , earning money that ’s badly needed by their poverty - stricken families .
U.S. agriculture is in many ways quite advanced , but its labor practices are strictly 19th century .
We ’ve come a long way since child labor was a common practice , and it ’s way past time that agriculture caught up .
That could happen with passage of a bill that ’s been pending in Congress for several years – the Children ’s Act for Responsible Employment , or CARE , that was introduced by Democratic Congresswoman Lucille Roybal - Allard of Los Angeles .
The bill would generally bring the regulations setting limits on the working hours of young farmworkers in line with those covering young workers in other industries .
That would mean , for example , that workers would have to be at least 16 to work in agriculture and 18 or older to work in especially dangerous farm jobs .
Fines for violations by grower employers would increase to $ 15,000 per instance , and growers would face prison terms for repeated violations that lead to death or serious injury .
The bill , strongly supported by labor and civil rights groups , also would tighten restrictions on pesticide use , require full and regular reports and investigations of serious work - related injuries to younger workers and otherwise tighten and broaden enforcement .
The United States is under pressure from child labor advocates in other nations to enact such legislation .
As one advocate group says , “ It ’s a matter of urgency ” that the United States take a leadership role and update its laws and regulations on child labor .
The CARE bill is designed to d just that and to provide critically needed help to some of our most vulnerable , most needy and most valuable workers .

Hate it when you click on an iTunes link or an App Store link and the iTunes application launches , forcing you out of your browser and into the cludgy music / everything media app ?
You ’re not alone !
Fortunately with a little free extension , you can completely stop iTunes and App Store links from opening iTunes entirely .
And yes , this completely stops iTunes launching when an iTunes link is clicked from the Safari browser .
The extension works by blocking the script that tries to start iTunes when you click on a link to the iTunes Store , App Store , or any other iTunes link .
This is seriously useful , and I am quite pleased for it to be my first installed Safari 5 extension , I ’ve tried a few others but this is the first to actually stay installed .
I ’m looking forward to when Apple has the full iTunes App & Music Store directly on the web , but I have no idea when that will be , until then , this extension will be installed .
Good stuff !
We ’ve covered a technique to stop the iTunes links from opening iTunes in the past but it involves modifying a filetype within the Finder which is n’t the best solution now that new versions of Safari allows extensions .
So , if you use Safari 5 or newer , get the NoMoreiTunes extension and be gone with those annoying iTunes links for good .
This is the best Safari extension I ’ve seen yet , it prevents all iTunes links from launching the iTunes application , keeping you contained within Safari , meaning that an iTunes link will go to the relevant iTunes website rather than sending you off into application launching land .
Wonderful .

Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson , Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and Portland Mayor Sam Adams have signed a protocol agreement that will unite the three major cities in the push to secure a high - speed railway service through the Pacific Northwest region .
Mayor Robertson made the announcement at a special meeting of key state , business , railway and government leaders in Vancouver to discuss advancing high - speed rail between British Columbia , Washington , and Oregon .
“ Having a high - speed link to Seattle , Portland and points further south will help get more vehicles off the road , provide an attractive tourist option and create significant economic opportunities , ” Mayor Robertson said .
“ We are seeing the benefits of Amtrak passenger rail expansion in Vancouver .
We need an organized , strategic approach to ensure we have a strong , united voice for the expansion of rail service along the key Pacific Northwest corridor . ”
“ Regional cooperation on high - speed rail between our cities is a tremendously positive step , ” said Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn .
“ We look forward to working with Vancouver and Portland to bring our cities even closer . ”
" The Pacific Northwest leads the way in sustainable development and smart transit , " said Portland Mayor Sam Adams .
" Linking our region will mean increased trade and tourism , long - term manufacturing and engineering work , and a significant reduction in our collective carbon footprint . "
As part of the on - going push to strengthen railway links through the Cascadia corridor , Mayor Robertson hosted a meeting of senior rail , government and business leaders to discuss international railway links and to hear about California ’s plan for a $ 2.25 billion high - speed rail connection between San Francisco and San Diego .
The Vancouver meeting of rail and government officials was arranged by Seattle ’s Cascadia Institute and the Vancouver Economic Development Commission .
The meeting is being held in conjunction with the American Public Transit Association Convention .

COLUMBUS , Ohio --
Less ice covers the Arctic today than at any time in recent geologic history .
That 's the conclusion of an international group of researchers , who have compiled the first comprehensive history of Arctic ice .
For decades , scientists have strived to collect sediment cores from the difficult - to - access Arctic Ocean floor , to discover what the Arctic was like in the past .
Their most recent goal : to bring a long - term perspective to the ice loss we see today .
Now , in an upcoming issue of Quarternary Science Reviews , a team led by Ohio State University has re-examined the data from past and ongoing studies -- nearly 300 in all -- and combined them to form a big - picture view of the pole 's climate history stretching back millions of years .
" The ice loss that we see today -- the ice loss that started in the early 20th Century and sped up during the last 30 years -- appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years , " said Leonid Polyak , a research scientist at Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University .
Polyak is lead author of the paper and a preceding report that he and his coauthors prepared for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program .
Satellites can provide detailed measures of how much ice is covering the pole right now , but sediment cores are like fossils of the ocean 's history , he explained .
" Sediment cores are essentially a record of sediments that settled at the sea floor , layer by layer , and they record the conditions of the ocean system during the time they settled .
When we look carefully at various chemical and biological components of the sediment , and how the sediment is distributed -- then , with certain skills and luck , we can reconstruct the conditions at the time the sediment was deposited . "
For example , scientists can search for a biochemical marker that is tied to certain species of algae that live only in ice .
If that marker is present in the sediment , then that location was likely covered in ice at the time .
Scientists call such markers " proxies " for the thing they actually want to measure -- in this case , the geographic extent of the ice in the past .
While knowing the loss of surface area of the ice is important , Polyak says that this work can't yet reveal an even more important fact : how the total volume of ice -- thickness as well as surface area -- has changed over time .
" Underneath the surface , the ice can be thick or thin .
The newest satellite techniques and field observations allow us to see that the volume of ice is shrinking much faster than its area today .
The picture is very troubling .
We are losing ice very fast , " he said .
" Maybe sometime down the road we 'll develop proxies for the ice thickness .
Right now , just looking at ice extent is very difficult . "
To review and combine the data from hundreds of studies , he and his cohorts had to combine information on many different proxies as well as modern observations .
They searched for patterns in the proxy data that fit together like pieces of a puzzle .
Their conclusion : the current extent of Arctic ice is at its lowest point for at least the last few thousand years .
As scientists pull more sediment cores from the Arctic , Polyak and his collaborators want to understand more details of the past ice extent and to push this knowledge further back in time .
During the summer of 2011 , they hope to draw cores from beneath the Chukchi Sea , just north of the Bering Strait between Alaska and Siberia .
The currents emanating from the northern Pacific Ocean bring heat that may play an important role in melting the ice across the Arctic , so Polyak expects that the history of this location will prove very important .
He hopes to drill cores that date back thousands of years at the Chukchi Sea margin , providing a detailed history of interaction between oceanic currents and ice .
" Later on in this cruise , when we venture into the more central Arctic Ocean , we will aim at harvesting cores that go back even farther , " he said .
" If we could go as far back as a million years , that would be perfect . "

This is one of those motorcycles that ’s going to make it onto websites that do n’t normally feature motorcycles .
It ’s exotic and terrifyingly quick , and it ’ll cost as much as the GDP of a small African nation .
It ’s called the ‘ Millona 16 ’ and it ’s the latest road missile from NCR — the wraps came off just a few hours ago at the Misano racetrack , at the World Ducati Week event .
NCR takes a $ 72,500 Desmosedici D16RR straight off the factory floor , transports it round the corner to its neighboring Bologna factory , and makes it lighter and more powerful .
And a lot faster .
It ’s easy to see where the money goes : carbon fiber is everywhere on the M16 , and that includes load - bearing parts such as the frame , swingarm and wheels .
The fuel tank , fairing , tail and fenders are carbon too .
Mechanical parts are either titanium , right down to the bolts , or ‘ avionic grade ’ aluminum .
A stock 989 cc V - four Ducati motor sends around 175 horsepower to the back wheel , but NCR has tuned the M16 to send “ 200 + hp ” to the tarmac .
Current - generation MotoGP suspension helps get that power down , and the M16 also uses race - style electronics with traction control , data recording and user - selectable maps .
Without gas , weight is a claimed 319 lbs ( 145 kg ) , which is 15 % lighter than the stock D16RR .
( That ’s even lighter than the regulation 330 lb minimum of a four - cylinder MotoGP bike . )
The only unanswered question is the price — but for the collectors and enthusiasts who will buy the M16 , that wo n’t matter .
They ’ll be able to say they own ‘ the most exclusive motorcycle in the world ‘ .

The title is :
Carbon Dioxide Has Played Leading Role in Dictating Global Climate Patterns
OK , so I read .
Increasingly , the Earth ’s climate appears to be more connected than anyone would have imagined .
El Niño , the weather pattern that originates in a patch of the equatorial Pacific , can spawn heat waves and droughts as far away as Africa .
Now , a research team led by Brown University has established that the climate in the tropics over at least the last 2.7 million years changed in lockstep with the cyclical spread and retreat of ice sheets thousands of miles away in the Northern Hemisphere .
The findings appear to cement the link between the recent Ice Ages and temperature changes in tropical oceans .
Apparently , I must not understand something .
The study seems to trumpet as a huge finding that tropical ocean temperatures on Earth dropped at the same time that temperatures dropped in the upper latitudes and Earth experienced ice age glaciation .
Uh , OK .
Is it really surprising that when part of the Earth got much colder , other parts of the Earth got colder too .?
Is n’t the simplest explanation that whatever made it cold in the poles made it cold at the equator too ?
Would n’t a solar change act this way ?
The research team , including scientists from Luther College in Iowa , Lafayette College in Pennsylvania , and the University of Hong Kong , analyzed cores taken from the seabed at four locations in the tropical oceans : the Arabian Sea , the South China Sea , the eastern Pacific and the equatorial Atlantic Ocean .
The cores tell the story .
Sedimentary cores taken from the ocean floor in four locations show that climate patterns in the tropics have mirrored Ice Age cycles for the last 2.7 million years and that carbon dioxide has played the leading role in determining global climate patterns .
The researchers zeroed in on tropical ocean surface temperatures because these vast bodies , which make up roughly half of the world ’s oceans , in large measure orchestrate the amount of water in the atmosphere and thus rainfall patterns worldwide , as well as the concentration of water vapor , the most prevalent greenhouse gas .
Looking at the chemical remains of tiny marine organisms that lived in the sunlit zone of the ocean , the scientists were able to extract the surface temperature for the oceans for the last 3.5 million years , well before the beginning of the Ice Ages .
Beginning about 2.7 million years ago , the geologists found that tropical ocean surface temperatures dropped by 1 to 3 degrees C ( 1.8 to 5.4 F ) during each Ice Age , when ice sheets spread in the Northern Hemisphere and significantly cooled oceans in the northern latitudes .
Even more compelling , the tropics also changed when Ice Age cycles switched from roughly 41,000 - year to 100,000 - year intervals .
Again , so what ?
What am I missing here guys ?
Why is this astonishing ?
But the interesting part to me is that all the data is on developping a proxy for sea surface temperatures .
Do n’t know if it is accurate , but it seems a good endeavor .
Fully worthwhile of the effort .
But remember the title .
What about CO2 ?
And through the article we keep getting teasers like this :
Based on that new link , the scientists conclude that carbon dioxide has played the lead role in dictating global climate patterns , beginning with the Ice Ages and continuing today .
And this
Candace Major of the National Science Foundation agrees : “ This research certainly supports the idea of global sensitivity of climate to carbon dioxide as the first order of control on global temperature patterns , ” she says .
“ It also points to a strong sensitivity of global temperature to the levels of greenhouse gases on very long timescales , and shows that resulting climatic impacts are felt from the tropics to the poles . ”
All they did was develop a tropical temperature proxy and show the tropics got colder during ice ages .
Duh .
I mean , is n’t this really just a reality check — we developed a proxy and we think its pretty good because the temperatures drop right when we think they should .
I kept waiting for the evidence that CO2 had anything to do with this .
This is all I get , and comes not from their study but a link to data from a completely different data set having nothing to do with their study :
Climate scientists have a record of carbon dioxide levels for the last 800,000 years –spanning the last seven Ice Ages–from ice cores taken in Antarctica .
They have deduced that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere fell by about 30 percent during each cycle , and that most of that carbon dioxide was absorbed by high - latitude oceans such as the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean .
According to the new findings , this pattern began 2.7 million years ago , and the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans has intensified with each successive Ice Age .
Geologists know the Ice Ages have gotten progressively colder–leading to larger ice sheets –because they have found debris on the seabed of the North Atlantic and North Pacific left by icebergs that broke from the land - bound sheets .
“ It seems likely that changes in carbon dioxide were the most important reason why tropical temperatures changed , along with the water vapor feedback , ” Herbert said .
What ?
How does he determine this ?
My sense is that we are back to the old 800 - year lag / ice core issue where scientists are confusing cause and effect between temperature and CO2 levels .
I am willing to credit dropping CO2 levels ( through ocean absorption ) as a positive feedback effect , though I would argue that it is small just as they seem to argue that it is large .
The key , though , is that nothing in their data supports a sensitivity number for CO2 at all , just a rough possible causal relationship where even the direction of the causation is unknown .
One fatal flaw of this argument is that while people can make an argument for CO2 as an amplifier ( either weak or strong ) , no one can explain how it might trigger the beginning of an Ice Age or warming recovery , and without this there is no way to call CO2 the main driver of these changes .
Maybe these guys have found the evidence of the trigger ?
Herbert acknowledges that the team ’s findings leave important questions .
One is why carbon dioxide began to play a major role when the Ice Ages began 2.7 million years ago .
Also left unanswered is why carbon dioxide appears to have magnified the intensity of successive Ice Ages from the beginning of the cycles to the present .
The researchers do not understand why the timing of the Ice Age cycles shifted from roughly 41,000 - year to 100,000 - year intervals .
Oops , maybe not .
But surely they understand the mechanism
“ We think we have the simplest explanation for the link between the Ice Ages and the tropics over that time and the apparent role of carbon dioxide in the intensification of Ice Ages and corresponding changes in the tropics , ” said Timothy Herbert of Brown University and the lead author of the paper in Science .
Herbert added , “ but we do n’t know why .
The answer lies in the ocean , we ’re pretty sure . ”
Oops , maybe not .
OK , as a public service , I will create a more truthful summary of the study :
Emergency crews say they have responded to more than 400 calls for help as wild weather continues to lash parts of Sydney .
Flash flooding closed roads across the city , while a three - car accident on Roseville Bridge caused long delays .
Sydney was also hit by its own mini tornado , which damaged 11 homes in the city 's eastern suburbs after it came ashore just before midday AEST .
Homes in Garrett Street , Maroubra , have mostly minor damage such as holes in roofs and tiles being blown off .
The wet weather is expected to continue well into the night .
SES crews are on standby for more flooding .
The Sydney twister comes a day after more than 30 homes were damaged in the north coast town of Lennox Head when a waterspout crossed the coast and became a tornado .
Andrew Haigh from the Bureau of Meteorology says the Sydney storm was not as bad .
" The one in Lennox Head yesterday - we call it a full - scale tornado , " he said .
" That was clearly more intense than what we have in Sydney today .
" The clouds are a lot lower , there is n't as much instability but nevertheless it is always possible in these situations that with the updraught of a shower cloud you can get a rotation of the air underneath ... and the formation of what we would call a waterspout or a very small tornado . "
Mr Haigh says the tornado was too small to be picked up on radar screens , and would have even been hard to see with the naked eye .
" The fact that not many people have spotted this is probably due to it being hidden amongst a lot of heavy rain , so it would n't have been all that visible , " he explained .
" But it does appear there has been a significant whirlwind type feature which we 'll call a water spout if it 's coming in off the water , and that has caused some damage . "
The bureau issued a flood warning for Sydney 's east as heavy rain continued to lash suburbs .
Paul Johnson from the New South Wales Fire Brigade says crews have had a busy day .
" From about 1.30 pm we had hundreds of firefighters out attending various incidents such as flooding , trees down , we were pumping out flooding basements , houses were about to flood , " he said .

Will nVidia ’s GTX485 be able to woo the undecideds ?
If you have a production line with one person , and that person works a little harder , then you get a little more product at the end of the day .
Pack the line with 480 people , and even a relatively small increase in productivity can deliver clearly measurable results .
Now spend time moving the production lines around and installing better air conditioning , then you might find that they produce more and in a nicer , cooler environment .
KitGuru has heard that nVidia ’s been through the first iteration of the GTX480 with a fine tooth comb , to create a GTX485 product that can run at least 20 MHz more on the core clock , with improved cooling and performance .
It ’s also worked through some neat driver improvements that will also help .
Nice .
How has this improvement been made possible and why has it taken so long ?
Bill Dally is a smart cookie .
One that spent 10 years at MIT creating massive , experimental , parallel processing systems .
He ’s used to increasing the smoothness of a machine ’s operation by reducing the effort needed to synchronize disparate components .
Useful , now that he has Fermi to tame .
So what is the GeForce GTX 485 ?
Simply put , it ’s what Fermi should have been at launch .
A little quicker .
A little cooler .
A little easier to make .
With the earlier price move announced exclusively by KitGuru , we ’re now expecting the GTX485 to come in around $ 20 higher into distribution than the launch price of the GTX480 .
It will also overclock easier , because more of the pesky electrons will be going where they are supposed to go .
Nice .
KitGuru says : Interesting move by nVidia .
VERY unusual for the company with the single fastest chip to beat their own product within a few weeks of launching .
We guess that Northern Islands ( the revamped Radeon 5000 chip ) must be very close to launching and nVidia wants to push every soldier it has into battle now .
Good news for nVidia fanbois who have been holding off on GTX480 because they were not sure about all that heat and noise .
What does that mean to the street pricing ?
We expect the £ 395 GTX480 to come down to £ 375 and the GTX 485 will launch at £ 419 .

Via Tom Elia of the New Editor , here 's a list of the top 100 pensions of Illinois school administrators .
The valuations represent the worth of the pension assuming the beneficiary retired at age 56 with a life expectancy of another 29 years .
The average value of these pensions is $ 8.879,257.90 .
The number one pension goes to Neil C. Codell of Niles Township Community High School District ( a suburban area just north of Chicago and just west of the lakefront ) .
Mr. Codell 's salary is $ 885,327 and his estimated first - year pension is $ 601,978 .
The pension is valued at $ 26,661,604 .
You got that ?
More from the original New Editor piece , which headlines its bit " And you thought California 's pensions were out of control ? " and notes " The total estimated cost of these pensions is almost $ 1 billion — at $ 887,925,790 — for 100 people ! "

Mexico has demanded a full inquiry after a Mexican teenager died after a US border patrol agent opened fire from the US side of the border .
The youth , believed to be 14 or 15 , was found on the Mexican side under a bridge linking Ciudad Juarez with El Paso .
US authorities said the agent was defending himself and colleagues after they came under attack from people throwing stones and rocks .
The FBI is investigating the incident .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the shooting and called for the incident " to be thoroughly investigated and those responsible punished " , his office said .
" Using firearms to respond to an attack with rocks is a disproportionate use of force , particularly coming from officials that are specially trained , " the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement .
" A worrying increase in the use of excessive force " showed the need for greater co-operation on border security , it added .
The FBI said the agent opened fire during a confrontation with a group of suspected illegal immigrants trying to enter the US .
It said two people were arrested but the others retreated into Mexico , throwing rocks .
" The subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him .
The agent then fired his service weapon several times , striking one subject who later died , " the FBI said .
The teenager was identified as Sergio Adrian Hernandez .
Photographs showed his body lying on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande .
His mother denied reports he had been trying to cross the border .
" He was not going to cross to El Paso , it is not true , he was here in Mexico .
They killed him in Mexico , " she said .
A witness told Reuters TV that he saw half a dozen youths being chased back into Mexico after they had briefly crossed the dividing line under the Paso del Norte international bridge .
" They were not carrying anything .
They were n't carrying weapons , packages , backpacks , only the clothes they were wearing , " said the man who did not want to give his name .
" The agent shot at him twice .
He shot at him once , which left him stunned and then he shot him again . "
Tension
The US Border Patrol says rock attacks on its agents are frequent and capable of causing serious injury .
The issue of illegal migration , and the treatment of Mexicans on the border , is a source of abiding tension between the US and Mexico .
Last week Mexico made similar protests over the death of a Mexican migrant after he was given electric shocks by US agents who were trying to deport him .
Mexico 's foreign ministry says its records show so far this year 17 Mexican nationals have been killed or injured by US immigration authorities , up from 12 last year and five in 2008 .
There has also been anger in Mexico over a new law in the US state of Arizona , which requires police to question people about their immigration status , if officers suspect they are in the US illegally , and if they have stopped them for a legitimate reason .
But in the US , there is substantial political support for stronger measures to stop the flow of illegal migrants across the Mexican border .
Mexicans make up three - quarters of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the US .
Scientists are studying the carcass of a 25 - foot " sub- adult " sperm whale found in the Gulf of Mexico to see if it 's oil spill - related .
We all knew local wildlife would be devastated , but who knew it would all happen so fast ?
In 1860 , an ill - fated Pony Express rider , whose name has been lost to history , was crossing the trackless wastes of Nevada when he vanished , likely killed by Indians .
Two years later , in May 1862 , the mail pouch from that doomed mission , still containing letters bound for the East , was recovered .
Today , only a few remnants from the contents of that saddlebag survive .
Among them is an envelope — a rare artifact of the mid-19th - century ’s legendary Pony Express mail service , founded 150 years ago .
( The letter that was inside has long since disappeared . )
The philatelic treasure will reside on long - term loan at the Smithsonian ’s National Postal Museum ( NPM ) .
Recently , the envelope ’s owner , William H. Gross , a passionate stamp collector since childhood , donated funds for a new 12,000 - square - foot gallery at the museum , scheduled to open in 2012 .
The envelope will take pride of place in the new exhibition space .
“ There are only two pieces of what collectors call ‘ interrupted mail ’ from the Pony Express known to exist , and they were in that rider ’s pouch , ” says NPM curator Daniel Piazza .
The concept of expedited mail delivery by a relay of single riders on fast horses — a kind of grass - fueled FedEx —echoed the vision that won the West .
Established in April 1860 , the Pony Express failed to win a major contract from the federal government and was replaced by a stagecoach line after only 18 months .
Yet its bravado has colored the mail service ever since .
The transcontinental delivery system was marvelous in its simplicity .
Across 1,900 miles , at 186 stations between St. Joseph , Missouri , and Sacramento , California , fresh horses awaited carriers who rode at full gallop in 10 - to 12 - mile segments ( judged to be the maximum distance that a good mount could maintain a speedy clip ) .
At each station , the rider leapt off one horse and onto the next , then sped on .
The tough , wiry horsemen covered up to 125 miles at a stretch — a punishing pace that commanded a then - substantial salary of $ 25 per week .
William “ Buffalo Bill ” Cody and James “ Wild Bill ” Hickok boasted they had earned their spurs as young Express riders .
“ Or so they claimed , ” says Piazza .
( There is no evidence that either did so . )
The rare 1860 envelope attests that hard riding was not the most daunting aspect of the job .
Routes passed through deserted , often forbidding , territory .
A note scrawled on the front of the artifact alludes to its tragic backstory : “ Recovered from a [ sic ] mail stolen by the Indians in 1860 . ”
The nameless victim is thought to have been the only Pony Express rider killed , though a few station agents died when Indians attacked their outposts .
The letter at last reached its destination — a New York City business recorded only as Fred Probst & Co. — in August 1862 .
Says Piazza : “ So much happened between when the letter was sent and when it arrived — Lincoln ’s election , the secession crisis , the beginning of the Civil War . ”
( In March 1861 , the Pony Express set a record for transcontinental delivery — 7 days 17 hours — when riders carried Abraham Lincoln ’s Inaugural Address to the West Coast . )
The envelope bears an oval stamp that reads “ The Central Overland California & Pikes Peak Express Company , ” the enterprise that administered the Pony Express .
It had disbanded nine months before , on October 26 , 1861 .
The envelope also bears a basic 10 - cent stamp , which normally would have meant a two - month trip , as the letter traveled from San Francisco by ship down the West Coast , across the isthmus of Panama and by sea up the East Coast to New York City .
The additional cost for Pony Express service — guaranteed to reach the East Coast in about 12 days — was $ 5 ( roughly $ 133 in today ’s currency ) per half - ounce .
Ultimately , says Piazza , even the envelope ’s stamp , with its image of George Washington , offers a history lesson .
“ Although the letter was delivered , ” he says , “ the 10 - cent stamp was no longer valid .
At the beginning of the [ Civil ]
War , all existing postal stamps were demonetized so the Confederacy could n’t use them . ”

I saw Tom Six 's truly unique film The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) last week ... and I still can't stop thinking about this film which is alarming both for how disturbing it is ... and how effective and well - made it is .
Today I got to talk with the man who brought this twisted vision to the silver screen ( who is one hell of a nice guy , actually ) about the film , which will be released on video - on - demand on April 28 and will hit theaters on April 30 .
While I 'll have my full interview and film review up next week , I had to share what he had to say about the sequel that he 's planning to shoot in a few months , The Human Centipede II ( Full Sequence ) ( If you 're not familiar with this first film , which has been tearing up the festival circuit , you might want to watch the trailer , so CLICK HERE to watch ) .
Here 's what the director had to say about the sequel .
I believe you 're getting ready for production on the sequel and , from what I read in the production notes , it 's going to be 12 people in that centipede for the Full Sequence ?
Tom Six : Exactly .
It 's going to be 12 people and I 've been telling people all over the world that The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) will be My Little Pony in comparison to this film .
In part one , I really wanted people to get used to this idea , this sick idea and in the second part , I can really use all my imagination and everything I could n't do in Part I , I can now do in Part II .
I really tried to make it original , of course , because you see all these sequels that are disappointing .
Hopefully it works , creating something really original and something the audience does n't expect .
One of the really cool elements of the film is you have the two American actresses ( Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie ) and the Japanese actor ( Akihiro Kitamura ) who does n't speak any English at all so they can't really understand each other .
Are you going to have that kind of international dynamic with these 12 people in this new centipede ?
Tom Six :
No , not really that dynamic .
It 's going to be completely different .
I can tell you that we 're going to shoot in London so the whole cast will be English - speaking this time .
For me , the first part , that was very necessary because the girls can't speak because they 're attached to this ass , and you do n't want the foreign guy to be able to communicate with the doctor , that 's why I wanted to have that Japanese actor .
He 's also speechless too , because nobody understands what he 's saying .
Will there be more of an interaction with the doctor in the Full Sequence then ?
Tom Six :
Well , the question is even , ' Is there going to be a doctor ? ' or ' Is ( Dieter Laser's ) Dr. Heiter going to return or not ? '
I still want to keep it a surprise , what happens in Part II .
All I can say is they 're all English - speaking people now .
I read that you are going to start filming this summer in London .
I was wondering if you were planning on a late 2010 release or maybe a 2011 release ?
Tom Six : Yeah , later 2010 release .
That is our goal to show it at the festivals .
We are going to shoot it in June this year so we hope to present it somehow at the end of 2010 .
Be sure to check back for my full interview with writer - director Tom Six in the very near future , and keep an eye out for my full movie review of The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) as well .
In basements and backrooms across the province , with outdated and unsterilized tools , a cottage industry of illegal and sometimes dangerous dentistry is thriving among immigrant communities , a Toronto Star investigation has found .
Offering cut -rate prices for inferior dental care , these bogus dentists attract patients , overwhelmingly new immigrants , who share the same culture .
Vulnerable , ill - informed and desperate to save money , they have low expectations for care .
And why not ?
Immigrant patients say that ’s the way it was in their home countries , and they do n’t expect much different in Canada — where some opt for the cheapest available service , and never mind the credentials .
It ’s all they can afford .
And those who complain of problems — a rarity — are nervous about speaking against community members .
The dental profession ’s watchdog is struggling to thwart this underground enterprise with a seven - year , $ 1 million crackdown that has netted 42 imposters .
But where one practice is knocked down another pops up .
The Star went undercover and visited two fake dentists .
We found dingy conditions — one with a patient chair in a bedroom , the other in a basement corner — rusty tools , dirty overhead lights , and no diplomas that would identify a properly trained and accredited dentist .
Treatment was offered for as low as $ 20 in this cash business .
“ I know it is illegal , ” Mikhail Genkin said after a Star reporter posing as a patient identified herself .
“ I think I help people because my price is very low and quality is quite good . ”
Genkin was the subject of an anonymous complaint to the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario , but he said he has done nothing wrong and has no recollection of the issues raised in the complaint .
The college is investigating .
There are plenty of patients for unlicensed dentists to draw from : 32 per cent of Canadians — mostly low - income earners — do n’t have dental insurance .
And , 17 per cent of Canadians avoided seeing a licensed dentist last year because of cost , according to a recent Health Canada report .
In 2008 the province committed money for a dental plan for low - income adult Ontarians , but funding has yet to appear .
The Royal College ’s registrar , Irwin Fefergrad , said poor workmanship by bogus dentists can lead to complications , such as infection .
Radiation from X - ray machines can seep through unleaded ceilings and walls .
HIV and other blood - borne ailments can be transmitted through dirty tools and syringes .
In one recent London , Ont. , case , patients of an unlicensed dentist were urged by health officials to use condoms and get tested for fear they may have been infected with hepatitis B and C .
Both viruses are found in blood and saliva , and can live on unsterilized equipment for a month .
The college ’s mandate is to regulate licensed dentists , not backroom practitioners .
But in 2003 , after hearing numerous complaints , it went on an expensive mission , dispatching undercover operatives .
In 42 cases , the college obtained court injunctions to shut down the bogus dentist or signed an agreement that they would not practise again .
Fefergrad said this is the tip of an iceberg .
“ I suspect there are probably hundreds of them out there .
They ’re dangerous .
They ’re totally unregulated .
What standards do these bogus phonies have ?
What skills do they have ?
If someone ’s going to put a high - speed drill in my mouth , I want to know . ”
Olga Volchenko knew of her dentist in their native Moldova before they both immigrated to Canada several years ago .
She did n’t think twice about seeking her services in Toronto when she needed a root canal and other dental work .
The woman ’s rates were cheap , attractive to someone without dental insurance .
Today , Volchenko wishes she had been less frugal .
She curls a finger around her upper left lip and tugs to reveal a murky gum line of blackened flesh where four molars used to be .
“ Look at that , ” she says in Russian , with a grimace .
Her mouth is only partially healed .
“ Da. Look . ”
Volchenko rents a sliver - sized public housing apartment in the city ’s north end and has worked only part time or in temporary jobs since coming to Toronto in 1992 .
So far , she has spent close to $ 15,000 and countless hours in a licensed dentist ’s chair to repair the damage .
Working with old equipment in her basement , the practitioner did n’t wear gloves while prepping , Volchenko says , and was stingy with anesthetic while she pulled teeth that did n’t need to come out , filled others that should have had root canals and improperly fitted the 64 - year - old woman ’s mouth with bridges and crowns .
Volchenko did n’t realize the shoddiness of the work until two years later when she startled awake in the middle of the night with a toothache .
A couple days later she developed an abscess and infection so severe it caused her left cheek to swell with a baseball - sized bulge .
The dentist who has since helped Volchenko , Dr. Allen Aptekar , blames the unlicensed dentist for her problems .
He said an abscess so severe , if untreated , could lead to blindness , even death .
One of the complications was that Volchenko ’s upper jaw bone eroded .
Aptekar has had to painstakingly perform bone grafts , extractions and implant surgery .
The cost of the initial work paid to the unlicensed dentist was $ 6,000 .
Volchenko would not give the bogus dentist ’s name to Aptekar , fearing he would alert the Royal College .
Volchenko would not tell the Star either , saying she was worried about repercussions in her community .
In another case , Peter Krichevsky visited unlicensed dentist Yosef Istzer shortly after immigrating to Toronto from Poland more than a decade ago .
And he has spent close to $ 50,000 over the last four years to repair the dental damage .
A licensed dentist is in the midst of extracting all of Krichevsky ’s teeth to install a full mouth of implants .
Istzer would not speak to the Star , but his wife , Shifra , denies her 65 - year - old husband , a denturist licensed to work in Ontario , is also working illegally from their basement as a dentist .
While she said her husband does n’t work from home , she acknowledged there is a dentist ’s chair and paraphernalia in the house .
Wearing a white lab coat , her voice shaky , she said her husband is out of the country even though he answered the phone earlier that day .
“ There ’s an expression in Polish , ” Krichevsky says .
“ You pay cheap , you pay twice . ”
Phony dentists hail from all corners of the globe : Russia , Colombia , Lebanon , Southeast Asia , Africa .
In their windowless , subterranean settings they perform all manner of dental procedures from seemingly routine cleanings and fillings to complex dentures and implants .
Prices vary but are significantly cheaper than what a legitimate dentist charges .
A root canal is $ 250 instead of $ 900 , a filling is $ 40 instead of up to around $ 300 , and crowns are $ 175 apiece , compared to between $ 900 and $ 1,000 each in an office dressed with diplomas .
Some home clinics are filthy and littered with bloodied gauze .
At least one practitioner tried to use a toaster oven to “ sterilize ” his tools , the college says .
Yet others have typical dental office amenities , including business cards and secretaries .
In general , most of the illegal dentists make do with tarnished probes and mirrors , dated dental chairs , and spent and rusted lights and drills — all easily purchased on eBay .
Their materials , such as anesthetics and composite resin used in fillings , can only be legally purchased by registered dentists .
Some smuggle their supplies into Canada and others buy materials in illegal , untraceable cash deals with small , local dental supply stores .
Phonies who do bridge , crown and denture work sometimes purchase them from shady dental technologists .

Many registered professionals come into regular contact with a mouth mangled by an unlicensed practitioner .
Some are through referrals — the illegals actually send their patients to licensed dentists for second opinions and X - rays — some are by happenstance .
Dr. Samuel Barkin , a dental surgeon who handles serious cases in Thornhill , says he encounters problems at least twice a year .
His office is a stone ’s throw from Bathurst St. and Finch Ave.
W. , the epicentre of Russian Toronto and quite possibly this city ’s ground zero for unlicensed dentists .
“ It ’s almost like the ( patients ) are told , ‘ Here , bite down on some gauze and go stand on this street corner , ” Barkin says .
The Star went looking for unlicensed dentists and found several easily .
In two cases , a reporter visited the fake dentist posing as a patient in need of a checkup .
Michael ( Mikhail ) Genkin , a barrel - chested 64 - year - old clad in stained scrubs , slouch socks and flip - flops , works out of a dank basement in a bungalow near Bathurst and Finch .
The reporter climbed into a green vinyl chair , circa 1970 , and stared up into a creaking overhead light while Genkin , who did not wear sterile gloves , examined her mouth .
A dented autoclave , used to sterilize tools , was pushed against a wall .
Clutching a dental mirror and probe , Genkin prodded tooth after tooth before proclaiming nothing was wrong .
For this consultation he took $ 20 cash .
When the reporter identified herself , Genkin said he understood what he was doing was illegal , but he believes he has done a good job over the past 15 years , working out of various basements in North York , treating people who cannot afford a real dentist .
Genkin immigrated to Canada from Moscow , by way of Israel , at age 50 .
His age , he said , is partly why he did n’t bother trying to get registered .
Like many illegals , he said he did n’t have the time or money to attend the University of Toronto ’s two - year , five - month foreign - trained accreditation program .
Tuition and associated fees tally around $ 100,000 and more than 250 applicants compete annually for up to 28 spots .
The University of Western Ontario also offers such a program and there is a $ 7,500 fast - track option , Fefergrad said .
If their training and education are up to college standards , applicants who pass written and practical exams can be granted a licence .
About 24 foreign - trained dentists have passed since 2007 .
Many basement dentists say the licensing requirements are prohibitive , but Dr. David Mock , dean of U of T ’s dentistry school , said financial institutions are only too happy to bankroll future dentists and it is usually those who ca n’t meet the qualifications who go underground .
“ Many of them are dental mechanics , ” Mock said , adding such individuals are likely to be the most dangerous and inflict the most harm .
“ They may have some skill , but do n’t know why they ’re doing a procedure and do n’t know what to do if something goes wrong . ”
Unlicensed dentists are typically cautious about who they allow into their clinics .
When the Star booked an appointment to see Aleksander Zanger , his wife , Ann Shapiro , asked half a dozen times how the undercover reporter got their telephone number .
Zanger , 84 , later told the Star he has been practising from the tiny second bedroom in their modestly appointed apartment for close to 40 years since he failed to pass his accreditation exams .
Standing next to a machine that cuts dental moulds , Shapiro denied her husband is working at all .
After a few moments she conceded : “ We only see friends . ”
In a rare case before the criminal courts , Colombian - born dentist Humberto Solano Rosania allegedly operated an unlicensed clinic from his London , Ont. , basement for eight years .
Members of the local Colombian community said he began his alleged practice by helping the penniless among them , investigators said .
The 46 - year - old man was quick and wary of those out to shut him down .
He refused to see patients until he could confirm their identities .
That is why Joe Passmore , an undercover college investigator and retired Toronto police officer , could never get inside .
Eventually , a police department trainee whose mother was Solano Rosania ’s patient turned him in .
When Solano Rosania was arrested in March , police seized an appointment book containing more than 600 patient names , said an affidavit in support of the college ’s motion to shut him down .
Hiding inside his bungalow , he sent his 28 - year - old wife , Vanessa De-Avila to the door when the Star came seeking comment .
She said her husband will not speak publicly for fear it will influence custody decisions over her young daughter from a previous marriage .
Solano Rosania , who investigators say earned close to $ 100,000 cash annually and did not pay income tax , faces four criminal charges , including unlawfully inflicting bodily harm and fraud .
He recently consented to a civil order prohibiting him from practising dentistry .
Such an order — an injunction — is usually an illegal practitioner ’s worst fate .
None of the shuttered unlicensed dentists have resurfaced after they ’d been investigated , said Passmore , who has been involved in several investigations .
But if caught violating the injunction , Fefergrad said an underground dentist could face jail time .

The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , is today beginning legal action to remove the peace protesters camping in Parliament Square .
If successful , the move is likely to see the eviction of long - term ant - war demonstrator Brian Haw , who has been demonstrating on the square opposite the Houses of Parliament for the past nine years .
Haw first set up camp in June 2001 in a one - man protest against war and foreign policy – initially the sanctions against Iraq .
He said he had been inspired to take up his vigil after seeing images and information produced by anti-sanctions campaign the Mariam appeal .
The father of seven has been arrested many times – most recently last week – but has successfully resisted repeated legal attempts to remove him , conducted both by Tory - led Westminster council and the former Labour government .
The site has become more crowded with the arrival of environmental protesters , who set up tents five weeks ago .
Greater London authority ( GLA ) officers acting for the mayor began proceedings for trespass at the high court today .
" Parliament Square is a world heritage site and top tourist attraction that is visited by thousands of people and broadcast around the world each day , " a City Hall spokeswoman said .
" The mayor respects the right to demonstrate .
However , the scale and impact of the protest is now doing considerable damage to the square and preventing its peaceful use by other Londoners , including those who may wish to have an authorised protest . "
Johnson first outlined his decision to apply to the high court to begin legal proceedings for trespass last Tuesday – the same day David Cameron 's Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition government announced plans to " restore rights to non-violent protest " as part of its 18 - month legislative programme .
The Conservative mayor 's move has been welcomed by Westminster councillors .
Colin Barrow , the Westminster council leader , has accused the protesters of " hijacking " the square .
Students across the country are monitoring events at UC Irvine as pro- Israel groups try to reestablish their deterrence capacity on American campuses .
After a 4 - month - long investigation , UC Irvine ’s administration last week announced an unprecedented recommendation to suspend for one year the Muslim Student Union ( MSU ) , a registered campus organization , for its alleged involvement in disrupting a Feb. 8 speech by Michael Oren , Israel ’s ambassador to the U.S. Eleven students were arrested and may face criminal charges as well as disciplinary action by the university .
A June 17 Times editorial called the recommendation “ an apt punishment for what was clearly an inappropriate protest ” ; on the contrary , the administration ’s draconian response will unquestionably have a chilling effect on student activism at UC Irvine and across the country .
The decision comes after several months of intense pressure by a number of off - campus Zionist organizations .
In February , the Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) called upon Jewish donors to withhold donations from UC Irvine and urged Jewish students not to enroll there .
Their absence would be tragic .
No student wants a Judenrein campus , but we also do n’t want one in which Muslim student life is suffocated .
The ZOA ’s threat was intended solely to strong - arm university administrators into harsh action .
And it appears to have worked .
Hillel President Wayne Firestone pronounced that “ strong disciplinary procedures by the university … [ are ] in order here . ”
Shalom Elcott of the Jewish Federation of Orange County publicized his expectation of a “ very specific response from the University of California leadership ” and that he “ is working intensely with multiple channels of leadership on a local , national and international level ” so that “ justice may be served . ”
After a visit from leading Jewish leaders , including Gerald Solomon of the Samueli Foundation , a key donor to the UC system , UC President Mark Yudof , a self - proclaimed Zionist , declared his outrage at the students ’ protest of Ambassador Oren , that the students should be prosecuted and that the MSU should be disciplined .
Although the decision is being appealed by the MSU , it represents the alarming lengths to which defenders of Israeli policies will go to stifle criticism .
Three weeks ago the world watched in horror as Israeli commandos raided a flotilla of aid ships trying to break Israel ’s illegal siege of Gaza .
Nine humanitarian workers were killed .
In the days that followed Israel mounted a public relations assault aimed at quelling the international outrage .
Israel was chided by the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Foreign Press Assn. in Israel for releasing highly edited and reality - distorting footage it had stolen from journalists and flotilla passengers .
News outlets were warned to “ treat the material with appropriate caution . ”
Rather than demanding a full and independent investigation , several members of Congress have asked the Obama administration to ban flotilla participants from entering the United States ( where presumably they ’d be able to speak to Americans about what happened on the ships ) .
The university ’s decision seems similarly designed to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel .
Condemning an entire organization of more than 250 members that represents Muslim student life on campus to a yearlong hiatus and banning the leadership from assuming future positions conjures up images reminiscent of a military coup d'état and the subsequent banning of the deposed party ’s top brass from politics .
The MSU organizes more than 300 events annually for its members and for the larger campus community .
Most events aim to enhance members ’ spiritual lives through study circles , interfaith discussions and charity work .
Recently the Cross Cultural Center at UC Irvine honored the MSU with the Social Justice Award for its dedication to advocacy for the less fortunate .
Banning the organization will not only affect the students associated with the disruption , but all Muslims on campus and the entire student body .
Moreover , the administration ’s decision comes in the context of an ongoing effort by pro-Israel groups to effectively thwart growing criticism of Israel on American campuses .
All over the country , students , many of whom are Jews , are organizing for Palestinian rights and an end to Israeli aggression .
Zionist groups , woefully afraid of this phenomenon , are spending millions of dollars to stem this tide .
The students were fully within their rights to protest the presence of the spin doctor for Israel ’s January 2009 rampage in Gaza , what Amnesty International called “ 22 days of death and destruction , ” and what former South African judge Richard Goldstone concluded in a report for the United Nations was a war crime and possibly a crime against humanity .
Even President Obama was briefly disrupted by anti-abortion activists during his May 2009 commencement address at Notre Dame University , yet no one was arrested or punished for associating with the offenders .
History will surely absolve the 11 UC Irvine students and condemn those who legitimize war criminals .
Today as I write , hundreds of activists across the country and world are preparing for another flotilla to break the illegal siege on Gaza .
Similarly , Muslim and non-Muslim students at UC Irvine and nationwide will not be intimidated by McCarthy - era tactics .
They will continue to fight for justice and speak truth to power no matter the price they may have to pay .

DUBLIN , Ireland — Conall was found dead on Truskmore Mountain in the northwest of Ireland recently , and “ Dr Poison ” of Ballintrillick is the chief suspect .
But the killer does n’t give a damn , it seems , and he is pretty much beyond the law .
The victim was an Irish - bred Golden Eagle chick , reared in Glenveagh National Park , Donegal , and Dr Poison is the unknown farmer who put out the toxic meat bait that killed him .
He and another handful of maverick farmers in Ireland may become responsible very soon for the disappearance of eagles from the Emerald Isle , only a few years after they were reintroduced for the first time in over a century .
Conall was a juvenile male that won the hearts of the country in 2009 when he became one of the first wild Golden Eagles to be hatched here for over 100 years .
Then a White - Tailed Eagle was found dead in May in an area of sheep farms in Beaufort , County Killarney in the southwest of Ireland , also believed to be a victim of poisoning .
( May 2005 : Ireland 's golden eagles lays first egg since 1912 )
“ It ’s heartbreaking , ” said Alan Mee , manager of the three - year - old project to bring White - Tailed Eagles back to Ireland .
To date 55 White - Tailed Eagles , known as sea eagles , have been imported from Norway and of these 14 have died , of which seven are confirmed poisoning deaths .
“ I feel that we are at a critical point , ” said Mee .
“ The loss of the birds has put the project in danger .
If the poisoning continues the Norwegian authorities may decide the losses are unsustainable . ”
Mee travels to Norway every year to personally transport eagle chicks to Ireland .
He brought the first 15 in 2007 , and 20 each of the two years since .
To his relief , Mee was told by Norwegian authorities this week that the losses in Ireland are still just about sustainable .
However the Norwegian ambassador to Ireland , Oyvind Nordsletten , has expressed his concern and called on farmers to end to the practice of putting out poisoned meat bait to kill foxes and crows .
Most farmers are supportive of the project to renew the raptor population .
But those responsible cannot be prosecuted under Irish law unless they are actually seen setting the poison deliberately to kill an eagle , said Eric Dempsey , bird writer and broadcaster based in Dublin .
“ There is a legal loophole , " Dempsey said .
" It ’s OK to put out poisoned bait to kill foxes and crows , but not for these birds , so a farmer can just say he was putting out poison for foxes . ”
The rogue farmers — they could be counted on the fingers of one hand , believes Dempsey — could be doing damage to the economy .
“ Eagle tourism is the fastest growing form of tourism in the world , ” he said .
Eagle watchers have boosted tourism revenues by more than $ 2 million a year on the island of Rum off the west coast of Scotland , where sea eagles have been reintroduced in recent years .
“ Can you imagine the thrill of throwing a fish up in the air and seeing an eagle swooping down to catch it ? ” said Dempsey , author of several bird books and a professional guide for birdwatchers visiting Ireland .
The mainly brown sea eagles have bright yellow eyes , beak and talons and have a poetic Scottish Gaelic name , iolairesuilnagreine , meaning " the eagle with the sunlit eye . "
They became extinct in Ireland and Great Britain in the 19th century through hunting .
They are now a much - treasured sight for tourists visiting the national park at Killarney , County Kerry .
The reintroduction of eagles in Donegal and Kerry was initially opposed by local sheep farmers but most have come to accept that they can co-exist with the raptors .
One of the problems is that farmers are tired of all the restrictions placed on them due to rising conservation standards , said Lorcan O’Toole , manager of the Golden Eagle breeding project , which began in Glenveagh Park in 2001 .
“ They perceive the Green Agenda as a new form of Green Landlordism and the emotive and historical connotations that holds in rural Ireland , ” he writes on the Golden Eagle Trust website .
“ I sometimes sense however that some landowners still hold an old Imperial Feudal attitude toward their property — they own it and they will do as they please on their property . ”
BirdWatch Ireland , the largest independent conservation organization in the country , has called for a complete ban on the use of poisoned meat baits .
Dempsey said most people know who is putting out the poison in Kerry but that person ignores requests to stop .
“ It is not as if he is protecting pet lambs , ” he said .
“ They are for slaughter and he would get compensation . ”

Would he or she be charged with criminal negligence as in this case :
In 1994 , petitioner Edward Hanousek , Jr. , was employed by the Pacific & Arctic Railway and Navigation Company as the roadmaster of the White Pass & Yukon Railroad .
In that capacity , petitioner supervised a rock quarrying project at a site known as “ 6 - mile , ” which is located on an embankment 200 feet above the Skagway River six miles outside of Skagway , Alaska .
During rock removal operations , a backhoe operator employed by Hunz & Hunz , an independent contractor retained before petitioner was hired , accidentally struck a petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks .
The operator ’s mistake caused the pipeline to rupture and spill between 1,000 and 5,000 gallons of oil into the river .
Petitioner , who was off duty and at home when the accident occurred , was indicted and convicted under the Clean Water Act ( CWA or Act ) , 86 Stat. 859 , 33 U.S.C. § 1319 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , 1321 ( b ) ( 3 ) , for negligently discharging oil into a navigable water of the United States .
1
Petitioner was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to sequential terms of six months imprisonment , six months in a halfway house , and six months of supervised release .
On appeal , petitioner argued , among other things , that it would violate his due process rights to impose criminal liability for ordinary negligence in discharging oil into the river .
The Supreme Court refused to hear Mr. Hanousek 's appeal 7 - 2 .
He was sent to jail for criminally , negligently , dumping oil in navigable waters .
He did n't do it himself , it was probably an accident , but he was held responsible .
Since BP is a corporate " person " we may as well blame my Aunt Ellistine for the disaster .
Her pension fund owns some BP stock .
I 'm sick of talking about BP as if it were a real , incredibly evil person .
I want the names of actual people .
So should the media .
So should Ignacia S. Moreno .
As I sit here , typing on my MacBook Pro , my iPad sits charging in the bedroom .
It 's obvious to me that these products have been designed by the best minds working in gadgetry today -- they are beautiful , simple , and reliable .
Best of all -- they really work .
Now , I do n't know how they were made -- but I know that they were assembled in China , most likely at Foxconn .
And today , that knowledge does n't sit very well with me .
It 's a complicated issue which brings up complicated feelings .
I come from extremely humble beginnings -- immigrants who worked in factories and coal mines for long hours and little money , child laborers and people who died of lung cancer at 50 despite never having smoked .
And of course , this is the life they dreamed of .
In many ways it was better than dying of starvation in Ireland or Poland .
Most Americans have the same stories to tell , and look where we are today : I do n't know a single farm hand or factory worker .
As the United States became more successful its factories got better , and workers formed unions .
In Pittsburgh , where I was born , steel mills and glass factories came to pay great wages , amazing overtime , and had great benefits and pension plans which my grandparents benefit from to this day .
The demise of the American factory is yet another complicated issue I am not qualified to tackle .
Apple ( and companies like it ) now assembles its products in China for complicated reasons -- because that 's where the factories are , because it 's cheaper , because everybody does it -- but mostly , because it can .
Despite ever increasingly obvious signs that our gadgets are made in less than stellar conditions , the American addiction to the new and shiny must be fed .
I say this with the guilt of an addict , and admit that I am no better -- after all , I can't think of a single gadget off the top of my head that I could buy that would be 100 % American made , which , as an American , is the only way I could have first hand knowledge and security of a product 's origins and a factory 's working conditions .
I 'm not proposing we start up a Facebook group to boycott Apple or Microsoft or any other company .
Going on a Twitter rampage about human rights wo n't cut it in this case either , and whatever media attention these stories get -- while educational -- wo n't necessarily change anything .
I 'm not naive .
What I am asking is for something different -- something that sound bites on the internet wo n't have any effect on .
We , the people who buy and love gadgets , who write about them , who obsess over their design and minutiae , must think about what this means .
We should go into our purchases knowingly -- the way most of us think with more knowledge than our ancestors about what we put in our mouths and how we clothe ourselves .
Would I prefer that Apple assembled my iPhone in the US of A ?
Yes : there 's greater oversight and better working conditions here ( and there are many places in the world less opaque than China ) .
Would that mean I would have to pay more ?
Yes , exponentially .
Companies like Apple know that their images matter .
It 's why they 're scrambling to " green themselves up " and prove their products do n't end up contributing to the toxic garbage dump that we call Earth .
We should n't accept companies ' meaningless " we 're looking into it " press releases when issues like this come up , because at the end of the day , we must come to terms with the fact that they do n't actually care about the workers at Foxconn , not really -- as long as the factories keep churning out the goods .
There is , of course , the argument that our companies manufacturing in places like China is a largely good thing for China ( never mind the fact that it fulfills our need for cheap products ) , and its people ( think once again of my forebearers starving in Ireland before deciding to head down into the mines of Pennsylvania ) .
One look at the country 's economy will tell you that somebody is sure benefiting -- and I 'm not going to argue that this train of thought is incorrect .
Yes , even a terrible job is better than no job at all , and Foxconn 's wages are arguably better than many in China -- but we can't really get around the fact that the reasons our companies choose to manufacture goods outside of places like the United States are stark , sad , and undeniable : because it 's cheaper , and because the labor standards are much lower .
We should n't avoid knowing that , merely because there are other arguments that can make us feel better about it , and I 'm not sure the thought that we 're benefiting directly from a country 's growing pains should be reassuring .
We 're not going to stop buying gadgets .
But knowing where they come from , and seeing that with open eyes makes all the difference .
At a time where most people on the internet give more attention to oil spills , where their food is coming from , how animals are treated , what the earth will look like in 50 years , nuclear weapons -- the list is endless -- we can't really afford to have blinders on about our where our laptops and cellphones come from , who made them , and what they leave behind when we 've thrown them in the garbage -- no matter how beautiful their industrial design is .
As July 1st approaches , I ’ll take a look at the two biggest free agents coming off the roster for the Devils this offseason – Paul Martin and Ilya Kovalchuk .
I ’ve already taken a look at Martin , stating my case as to why the Devils should keep the young blueliner .
Today I ’ll profile Kovalchuk , whose presence would no doubt fuel the Devils ’ offense next season .
When Devils ’ general manager Lou Lamoriello executed a trade on February 4 to bring Kovalchuk to the Devils , a shockwave of excitement ran through all Devils ’ fans .
Here was an extremely talented left - winger who was a proven goal scorer .
Thoughts raced through the fans minds , picturing Kovalchuk complete the Devils ’ offense and immediately improve their powerplay .
I believed Kovalchuk could solve the Devils ’ scoring woes , and his ability would help bring the Devils out of their funk .
But things did n’t quite work out that way .
Kovalchuk did n’t vastly improve the powerplay , and we never really saw him flash his offensive brilliance .
At the end of the season , word came from the locker room that players struggled with the way Kovalchuk played .
The switch never seemed to click , and Kovalchuk played good , not great , hockey .
In order to give an in - depth look at Kovalchuk , I ’ll use stats from Behind The Net to show his impact during 5 - on - 5 play , powerplay opportunities and on the defensive side of the puck .
In looking at these stats , I ’ll show that Kovalchuk is still an elite winger who should be pursued , for the right price , by Lamoriello this offseason .
Kovalchuk During 5 - on - 5 Play
As we all know , Kovalchuk is a strong offensive player .
Last year ’s statistics only serve to strengthen this point .
Kovalchuk averaged 1.46 goals per 60 minutes , 1.45 assists ( primary or secondary ) per 60 minutes , and 2.91 points per 60 minutes .
These numbers ranked first on the Devils by a longshot .
The only other Devil close to his per game production was , not surprisingly , Zach Parise .
But it ’s not only his game statistics that prove his offensive worth .
In the on ice / off ice plus / minus ratings ( explanation here ) , Kovalchuk once again showed his offensive force .
His +0.90 shows Kovalchuk , when on the ice , provided a positive impact on his team ’s offensive production .
When off the ice , the team ’s production slipped , as Kovalchuk ’s off - ice plus / minus sat at - 0.33 .
These statistics continue to support Kovalchuk ’s offensive abilities , even on a struggling offensive team like last season ’s Devils .
Kovalchuk During 5 - on - 4 Powerplay
After acquiring Kovalchuk , former coach Jacques Lemaire stuck him right out on the point on the first powerplay line .
Eventually , the forward spent the entire two minutes out on the ice , trying to maximize the powerplay ’s efficiency .
But the plan never seemed to work .
The team only connected on 16.53 % of their opportunities after acquiring Kovalchuk , dipping from the 19.02 % success rate before the trade .
While that lack of success does n’t squarely sit on Kovalchuk ’s shoulders , his powerplay stats from this past season show he was n’t as valuable as many predicted he would be .
While on the ice during 5 - on - 4 opportunities , Kovalchuk put up solid numbers , with the goals for per 60 minutes at 6.17 and the shots for per 60 minutes at 38.3 .
While these are good numbers , they were n’t even the best on the team .
Parise outplayed him last season , with his goals for at 9.02 and his shots for at 51.3 .
Kovalchuk was n’t even the best offensive player on the team with the man advantage .
Whether it was a lack of comfort or a lack of unfamiliarity with the system , Kovalchuk just could n’t bring the Devils special teams to the next level and make them great .
Continue reading for an analysis of Kovalchuk ’s defensive performance and my take on whether or not the Devils should resign the dangerous left - winger .
Kovalchuk During Defensive Play
Many analysts criticized Kovalchuk for his defensive play .
They called him lazy , and many believed the left - winger would struggle in the defensive end with the Devils .
Many analysts believed the team took a risk , and that Kovalchuk would struggle with the team for that reason alone .
But Kovalchuk proved those analysts wrong , posting better defensive numbers than Evgeni Malkin .
While looking at Kovalchuk ’s defensive play , I ’ll use a stat called GVT .
GVT ( explained here ) chronicles the goals versus threshold when a player is on the ice .
A level of 0 represents an NHL replacement player , and regulars are expected to do better .
With the Devils last season , Kovalchuk played to a 2.2 GVT rating .
Now it ’s not a great GVT rating , but it shows that Kovalchuk is n’t a complete liability in his own zone .
He can contribute something defensively , which fits well with the Devils team - first philosophy .
**********
The biggest question facing the Devils pursuit of Kovalchuk is this – how much money will the left - winger accept ?
With the recent acquisition of Jason Arnott , the Devils now have about $ 11 million in cap space left to spend .
The team still needs to resign David Clarkson , which will take them below $ 10 million .
It ’s been reported that Kovalchuk will look for a deal upwards of that type of money per year .
Signing Kovalchuk may handcuff the Devils for the future .
Remember , the team will need to re-sign Zach Parise next year , and the contract of Martin Brodeur is also nearing its end .
Kovalchuk is a world - class player , and I think the Devils should put their efforts into resigning him .
However , the team needs to be cautious with the asking price .
The talent Kovalchuk brings to the table is great , but the team can use that $ 11 million to plug some holes along the blue line and possibly sign another capable scorer .
While Kovalchuk is worth every penny , the Devils ca n’t afford to handicap themselves by overpaying for his services .
As per this post by Gulitti , Kovalchuk would be looking to sign with a team like the Devils .
But everything has a price , and I believe the Devils should n’t break the bank to keep Kovalchuk .

A longer version of the Capture and Execution of Mussolini and 15 of his supporters .
Mussolini spent his last 7 days in power in Milan , which was the site of his rise to power .
Then on April 20 , 1945 , he disbanded his government offices .
On April 21 , Bologna was captured by the Allied troops and the Fascist chief Arpinati was slain .
Duce 's staff and friends tried to persuade Duce to flee to Spain but he refused to leave his country .
Duce submitted a proposal to the Socialist part of the Liberation Committee , that was flatly refused .
On April 24th , Cardinal Schuster made contact but nothing became of that as Duce became more apethetic to surrendering to his destiny .
He told the Cardinal , " I have no illusions " .
A meeting was held with the Liberation Committee at the Archbishop 's palace , where they informed him of the impending surrender of the German army in Italy .
Mussolini 's reaction was :
" They have always treated us like slaves , and now they betray us " .
On April 25th , they left Milan in a convoy headed for the lakes near Como with their desitnation as Valtelline .
The column consisted of some cars and German armored cars , followed by Clara Petacci and her family .
At Como , they discussed htier options over supper .
Duce wrote the last letter to his wife , Rachele , urging here to flee to Switzerland .
He signed it :
" Your Benito , Como , 27th April , 1945
Year XIII of the Fascist Era " .
They left Como on 26th and stopped at Menaggio .
A column of Fascists troops , lead by Pavolini , left Milan to join up with their leader .
News reached them of the decree from Liberation Committee calling for the death peanilty for Fascists responsible for the 1922 " insurrection " and those guilty of crimes against the state since September 8 , 1943 .
On April 27th , Pavolini went on ahead of his troops and reached Mussolini .
Accompanying him were Angela Curti , the former mistress of Mussolini .
At the same time a German anti-aircraft unit , commanded by Lt. Fallmeyer , arrived in Menaggio headed for Tyrol .
Duce decided once more to seek refuge with his German ally and head north -- only to escape capture , not to leave Italy .
At 7 am , they reached Masso , where the partisans had blocked the road .
Lt. Fallmeyer went to negotiate with the partisan commander , Count Pierluigi Bellini delle Stelle ( " Pedro " ) of the 52nd Garibaldi Brigade .
The partisans agreed to allow the Germans to pass but not the Italians .
The Germans persuaded Mussolini to don a German greatcoat and helmet and hide out in the back of a truck .
The German column left at 3:00 with Mussolini now all alone .
It was stopped at Dongo and searched .
Il Duce was easy to find , either because he still wore general 's riding pants with a red stripe or information was leaked to the partisan band .
Later , Clara Petacci and her brother , Marcello , were captured , but Clara 's identity was n't detected .
The partisan Liberation Committee was informed of the Duce 's capture .
Immediate orders were given for fair treatment of the prisoners with strict orders not to shoot them even if they attempted escape .
By 1:30 am on Saturday the 28th , Count Bellini tried to transport his captors back to the Como area .
Duce was once wrapped in bandages to disguise him as a wounded partisan .
After hearing about the advance of the American 1st Armored Division and even reports of gun fire , they decided to return along their route to Mezzegra .
There Mussolini and Clara spent their last night together in a local farmhouse .
The proceedings of the Liberation Committee is now hidden in secrecy .
However , it is known that Togliatti , the secretary of the Communist Party and the Vice - Premier of Italy ordered the execution of Duce .
Colonel Valerio was entrusted with this important mission in the name of the National Liberation Committee .
When he arrived at Dongo at 2 pm , there was some confrontation between the Communist leader and the partisan leader , Pedro .
Colonel Valerio damanded to see the list of Fascist prisoners .
He then revealed he had orders to execute Mussolini .
He arbitrarily selected 15 names from the list for execution .
( See The Fifteen , below . )
On April 28 , Colonel Valerio broke into the room where Mussolini and Clara had been resting .
Valerio told them he had come to rescue them .
They hurried to the awaiting car .
They drove about a mile away and stopped near gate to the Villa Belmonte .
They were ordered to get out of the car and stand next to the stone wall .
Machine guns were raised and both were shot .
A guard was placed over their bodies , and Valerio drove back to Dongo , where he rounded up the remainder of the 15 prisoners selected for execution from the list .
They were hurriedly brought out to the square and given 3 minutes for the ministrations of a priest .
They were shot down by a partisan firing squad .
Marcello Petacci was also shot while trying to escape by jumping into Lake Como .
At first , the partisans mistakenly thought Marcello was Vittorio Mussolini , the son of Il Duce .
On April 29th , the bodies were brought to the Piazzale Loreto in Milan .
There , six of the corpses were hung by their feet from a girder of an Esso gas station .
These included : Benito Mussolini , Clara Petacci , Francesco Barracu , Alessandro Pavolini , Fernando Mezzasomma and Paolo Zerbino .
To the pile of bodies lying beneath them was added Archille Starace , who had just been captured and summarily executed on the spot .
The crowd vented their anger on the corpses .
When they got out of hand , the police turned on water hoses to control the situation * .
The Allies ordered the bodies removed for burial .
( See photo at top of page .
One source said Starace was hung at Mussolini 's left .
Many of the photos show only six bodies ; only a few show all 7 bodies that were hung and the others lying on the ground .
See photo , above , for a description of each one . )
When Adolf Hitler heard how Mussolini was executed and put on public display , he vowed he would not let this happen to him .
A few days later , Hitler shot his mistress and new wife , Eva Braunn , and then swallowing some poison , he shot himself in the mouth .
Following Hitler 's orders , their bodies were placed in a shell hole outside of his Berlin bunker and burned .
The Russians found remains of his teeth .
* This incident is based on my Dad 's eye witness account of what he saw when he arrived at Milan .

Unless things change — or someone comes forward to pony up for the painting — the spot between George Ryan and Pat Quinn in the Hall of Governors gallery in the state capitol will remain forever blank .
But that does n’t mean the image of ex-Governor Blagojevich should n’t be enshrined .
So we commissioned our readers to create a portrait of the disgraced chief executive , and they answered the call .

English mathematician and computer scientist
" Turing " redirects here .
For other uses , see Turing ( disambiguation )
Alan Mathison Turing ( ; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954 ) was an English mathematician , computer scientist , logician , cryptanalyst , philosopher , and theoretical biologist . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science , providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine , which can be considered a model of a general - purpose computer . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence . [ 11 ]
Despite these accomplishments , he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act .
During the Second World War , Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC&CS ) at Bletchley Park , Britain 's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence .
For a time he led Hut 8 , the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis .
Here , he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers , including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine .
Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements , including the Battle of the Atlantic , and in so doing helped win the war . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
Due to the problems of counterfactual history , it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war , [ 14 ] but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives . [ 12 ]
After the war Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory , where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine .
The Automatic Computing Engine was one of the first designs for a stored - program computer .
In 1948 , Turing joined Max Newman 's Computing Machine Laboratory , at the Victoria University of Manchester , where he helped develop the Manchester computers [ 15 ] and became interested in mathematical biology .
He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis [ 1 ] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction , first observed in the 1960s .
Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts ; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that " gross indecency " was a criminal offence in the UK .
He accepted chemical castration treatment , with DES , as an alternative to prison .
Turing died in 1954 , 16 days before his 42nd birthday , from cyanide poisoning .
An inquest determined his death as a suicide , but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning .
In 2009 , following an Internet campaign , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for " the appalling way he was treated " .
Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013 .
The " Alan Turing law " is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts . [ 16 ]
Early life and education
Family
Turing was born in Maida Vale , London , [ 7 ] while his father , Julius Mathison Turing ( 1873 –1947 ) , was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ( ICS ) at Chatrapur , then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state , in India . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Turing 's father was the son of a clergyman , the Rev. John Robert Turing , from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet .
Turing 's mother , Julius 's wife , was Ethel Sara Turing ( née Stoney 1881 – 1976 ) , [ 7 ] daughter of Edward Waller Stoney , chief engineer of the Madras Railways .
The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo - Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford , while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare . [ 19 ]
Julius 's work with the ICS brought the family to British India , where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army .
However , both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain , so they moved to Maida Vale , [ 20 ] London , where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 , as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth , [ 21 ] [ 22 ] later the Colonnade Hotel . [ 17 ] [ 23 ]
Turing had an elder brother , John ( the father of Sir John Dermot Turing , 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets ) . [ 24 ]
Turing 's father 's civil service commission was still active and during Turing 's childhood years Turing 's parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom [ 25 ] and India , leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple .
At Hastings , Turing stayed at Baston Lodge , Upper Maze Hill , St Leonards - on - Sea , now marked with a blue plaque . [ 26 ]
The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012 , the centenary of Turing 's birth . [ 27 ]
Very early in life , Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently . [ 28 ]
His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 , and Turing lived there during school holidays .
The location is also marked with a blue plaque . [ 29 ]
School
Turing 's parents enrolled him at St Michael 's , a day school at 20 Charles Road , St Leonards - on - Sea , at the age of six .
The headmistress recognised his talent early on , as did many of his subsequent teachers .
Between January 1922 and 1926 , Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School , an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex ( now East Sussex ) . [ 30 ]
In 1926 , at the age of 13 , he went on to Sherborne School , a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset .
The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike , in Britain , but Turing was so determined to attend , that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles ( 97 km ) from Southampton to Sherborne , stopping overnight at an inn . [ 31 ]
Turing 's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne , whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics .
His headmaster wrote to his parents : " I hope he will not fall between two stools .
If he is to stay at public school , he must aim at becoming educated .
If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist , he is wasting his time at a public school " . [ 32 ]
Despite this , Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved , solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus .
In 1928 , aged 16 , Turing encountered Albert Einstein 's work ; not only did he grasp it , but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein 's questioning of Newton 's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit . [ 33 ]
Christopher Morcom
At Sherborne , Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom ( 13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930 ) , [ 34 ] who has been described as Turing 's " first love " .
Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing 's future endeavours , but it was cut short by Morcom 's death , in February 1930 , from complications of bovine tuberculosis , contracted after drinking infected cow 's milk some years previously . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
The event caused Turing great sorrow .
He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom .
In a letter to Morcom 's mother , Frances Isobel Morcom ( née Swan ) , Turing wrote :
I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited .
I regarded my interest in my work , and in such things as astronomy ( to which he introduced me ) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ...
I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive , because that is what he would like me to do . [ 38 ]
Turing 's relationship with Morcom 's mother continued long after Morcom 's death , with her sending gifts to Turing , and him sending letters , typically on Morcom 's birthdays . [ 39 ]
A day before the third anniversary of Morcom 's death ( 13 February 1933 ) , he wrote to Mrs. Morcom :
I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you .
I shall too , and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow .
I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here .
Your affectionate Alan . [ 40 ]
Some have speculated that Morcom 's death was the cause of Turing 's atheism and materialism . [ 41 ]
Apparently , at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit , independent of the body and surviving death .
In a later letter , also written to Morcom 's mother , Turing wrote :
Personally , I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a ' spirit ' , whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected .
When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies , the ' mechanism ' of the body , holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later , perhaps immediately . [ 42 ]
University and work on computability
After Sherborne , Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King 's College , Cambridge , [ 7 ] where he was awarded first - class honours in mathematics .
In 1935 , at the age of 22 , he was elected a Fellow of King 's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem . [ 43 ]
Unknown to the committee , the theorem had already been proven , in 1922 , by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg . [ 44 ]
A blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college 's Keynes Building on King 's Parade . [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
In 1936 , Turing published his paper " On Computable Numbers , with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem " . [ 47 ]
It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts , the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December . [ 48 ]
In this paper , Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel 's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation , replacing Gödel 's universal arithmetic - based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines .
The Entscheidungsproblem ( decision problem ) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928 .
Turing proved that his " universal computing machine " would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm .
He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable : it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt .
This paper has been called " easily the most influential math paper in history " . [ 49 ]
King 's College , Cambridge , where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935 .
The computer room is named after him .
Although Turing 's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church 's equivalent proof using his lambda calculus , [ 50 ]
Turing 's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's . [ 51 ]
It also included a notion of a ' Universal Machine ' ( now known as a universal Turing machine ) , with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine ( as indeed could Church 's lambda calculus ) .
According to the Church–Turing thesis , Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable .
John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing 's paper . [ 52 ]
To this day , Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation .
From September 1936 to July 1938 , Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University , [ 4 ] in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow .
In addition to his purely mathematical work , he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro - mechanical binary multiplier . [ 53 ]
In June 1938 , he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton ; [ 54 ] his dissertation , Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals , [ 55 ] [ 56 ] introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing , in which Turing machines are augmented with so - called oracles , allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines .
John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant , but he went back to the United Kingdom . [ 57 ]
Career and research
When Turing returned to Cambridge , he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics . [ 58 ]
The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim , including interjections from Turing and other students , from students ' notes . [ 59 ]
Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed , with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths , but rather invents them . [ 60 ]
Cryptanalysis
During the Second World War , Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park .
The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said , " You needed exceptional talent , you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing 's was that genius . " [ 61 ]
From September 1938 , Turing worked part - time with the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC&CS ) , the British codebreaking organisation .
He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany , together with Dilly Knox , a senior GC&CS codebreaker . [ 62 ]
Soon after the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine 's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine 's messages , Turing and Knox developed a broader solution . [ 63 ]
The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change , which they in fact did in May 1940 .
Turing 's approach was more general , using crib - based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe ( an improvement on the Polish Bomba ) . [ 64 ]
Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park .
Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 , before moving to Hut 8
On 4 September 1939 , the day after the UK declared war on Germany , Turing reported to Bletchley Park , the wartime station of GC&CS . [ 65 ]
Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war .
The others were : deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy ; developing a statistical procedure dubbed Banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes ; developing a procedure dubbed Turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 / 42 ( Tunny ) cipher machine and , towards the end of the war , the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah .
By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process , Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject .
He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches , titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography [ 66 ] and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions , [ 67 ] which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 , shortly before the centenary of his birth .
A GCHQ mathematician , " who identified himself only as Richard , " said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance , and their relevance to post - war cryptanalysis : [ 68 ]
[ He ] said the fact that the contents had been restricted " shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject " .
...
The papers detailed using " mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible . " ... Richard said that GCHQ had now " squeezed the juice " out of the two papers and was " happy for them to be released into the public domain " .
Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park .
He was known to his colleagues as " Prof " and his treatise on Enigma was known as the " Prof 's Book " . [ 69 ]
According to historian Ronald Lewin , Jack Good , a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing , said of his colleague :
In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever , and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off .
His bicycle had a fault : the chain would come off at regular intervals .
Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand .
Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen . [ 70 ]
Peter Hilton recounted his experience working with Turing in Hut 8 in his " Reminiscences of Bletchley Park " from A Century of Mathematics in America : [ 71 ]
It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius .
Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues .
We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source ; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts .
However , the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different ; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence , a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement .
Alan Turing was such a genius , and those , like myself , who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity , created by the strange exigencies of the Second World War , to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience , nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us .
Hilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets . [ 72 ]
While working at Bletchley , Turing , who was a talented long - distance runner , occasionally ran the 40 miles ( 64 km ) to London when he was needed for meetings , [ 73 ] and he was capable of world - class marathon standards . [ 74 ] [ 75 ]
Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury .
His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards '
Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes .
He was Walton Athletic Club 's best runner , a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone . [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]
In 1946 , Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) by King George VI for his wartime services , but his work remained secret for many years . [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
Bombe
Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park , [ 65 ]
Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe , which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna , from which its name was derived .
The bombe , with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman , became one of the primary tools , and the major automated one , used to attack Enigma - enciphered messages . [ 81 ]
The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message ( i.e. , rotor order , rotor settings and plugboard settings ) using a suitable crib : a fragment of probable plaintext .
For each possible setting of the rotors ( which had on the order of 1019 states , or 1022 states for the four - rotor U - boat variant ) , [ 82 ] the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib , implemented electromechanically .[ citation needed ]
The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting , moving on to the next .
Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded , leaving only a few to be investigated in detail .
A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter , which was impossible with the Enigma .
The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940 . [ 83 ]
By late 1941 , Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman , Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner - Barry were frustrated .
Building on the work of the Poles , they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals , but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals .
In the summer , they had considerable success , and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month ; however , they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments .
They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels , but had failed . [ 84 ]
On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties , with Turing as the first named .
They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces . [ 84 ]
As Andrew Hodges , biographer of Turing , later wrote , " This letter had an electric effect . " [ 85 ]
Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay , which read : " ACTION THIS DAY .
Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done . "
On 18 November , the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken . [ 85 ]
The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister 's response , but as Milner - Barry recalled , " All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth . " [ 86 ]
More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war . [ 87 ]
Hut 8 and the naval Enigma
Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma " because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself " . [ 89 ]
In December 1939 , Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system , which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services . [ 89 ] [ 90 ]
That same night , he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus , a sequential statistical technique ( what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis ) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma , " though I was not sure that it would work in practice , and was not , in fact , sure until some days had actually broken . " [ 89 ]
For this , he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban .
Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors , substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes . [ 91 ]
Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans ( one tenth of a ban ) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher . [ 92 ]
Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 [ 93 ] and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington ; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton , Ohio .
Turing 's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic :
The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes , one for each wheel order .
I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme , but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way .
Their test ( of commutators ) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices .
Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it . [ 94 ]
During this trip , he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices . [ 95 ]
He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943 .
During his absence , Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 , although Alexander had been de facto head for some time ( Turing having little interest in the day - to - day running of the section ) .
Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park . [ 96 ]
Alexander wrote of Turing 's contribution :
There should be no question in anyone 's mind that Turing 's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8 's success .
In the early days , he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut , but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe .
It is always difficult to say that anyone is ' absolutely indispensable ' , but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8 , it was Turing .
The pioneer 's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing 's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world . [ 97 ]
Turingery
In July 1942 , Turing devised a technique termed Turingery ( or jokingly Turingismus ) [ 98 ] for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans ' new Geheimschreiber ( secret writer ) machine .
This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park .
Turingery was a method of wheel - breaking , i.e. , a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny 's wheels . [ 99 ]
He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who , under the guidance of Max Newman , went on to build the Colossus computer , the world 's first programmable digital electronic computer , which replaced a simpler prior machine ( the Heath Robinson ) , and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages .
[ 100 ]
Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer .
Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher , [ 101 ] [ 102 ] but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development . [ 103 ]
Delilah
Following his work at Bell Labs in the US , [ 104 ]
Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system .
In the latter part of the war , he moved to work for the Secret Service 's Radio Security Service ( later HMGCC ) at Hanslope Park .
At the park , he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley .
Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah .
[ 105 ]
The machine was intended for different applications , but it lacked the capability for use with long - distance radio transmissions .
In any case , Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war .
Though the system worked fully , with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech , Delilah was not adopted for use . [ 106 ]
Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY , a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war .
Early computers and the Turing test
Between 1945 and 1947 , Turing lived in Hampton , London , [ 107 ] while he worked on the design of the ACE ( Automatic Computing Engine ) at the National Physical Laboratory ( NPL ) .
He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 , which was the first detailed design of a stored - program computer .
[ 108 ]
Von Neumann 's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing 's paper , but it was much less detailed and , according to John R. Womersley , Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division , it " contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing 's own " .
[ 109 ]
Although ACE was a feasible design , the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned .
In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime .
[ 110 ]
While he was at Cambridge , the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence .
It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 , and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it , including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G - 15 .
The full version of Turing 's ACE was not built until after his death . [ 111 ]
According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics , published by Genscher , Düsseldorf , there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse . [ 112 ]
It took place in Göttingen in 1947 .
The interrogation had the form of a colloquium .
Participants were Womersley , Turing , Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse , Walther , and Billing ( for more details see Herbert Bruderer , Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz ) .
In 1948 , Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester .
A year later , he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory , where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored - program computers — the Manchester Mark 1 .
Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer 's Manual for this machine , and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine , the Ferranti Mark 1 .
He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death .
[ 113 ]
During this time , he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics , [ 114 ] and in " Computing Machinery and Intelligence " ( Mind , October 1950 ) , Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence , and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test , an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called " intelligent " .
The idea was that a computer could be said to " think " if a human interrogator could not tell it apart , through conversation , from a human being .
[ 115 ]
In the paper , Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind , it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a child 's mind and then to subject it to a course of education .
A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet ; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer .
In 1948 Turing , working with his former undergraduate colleague , D.G. Champernowne , began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist .
By 1950 , the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp . [ 116 ]
In 1952 , he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 , but lacking enough power , the computer was unable to execute the program .
Instead , Turing " ran " the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard , taking about half an hour per move .
The game was recorded . [ 117 ]
According to Garry Kasparov , Turing 's program " played a recognizable game of chess . " [ 118 ]
The program lost to Turing 's colleague Alick Glennie , although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne 's wife , Isabel . [ 119 ]
His Turing test was a significant , characteristically provocative , and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence , which continues after more than half a century . [ 120 ]
Pattern formation and mathematical biology
When Turing was 39 years old in 1951 , he turned to mathematical biology , finally publishing his masterpiece " The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis " in January 1952 .
He was interested in morphogenesis , the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms .
He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space , termed a reaction - diffusion system , could account for " the main phenomena of morphogenesis " .
[ 121 ]
He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions .
For example , if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place , and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A , then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic , and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations .
Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A , but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A .
If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates , then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did .
To calculate the extent of this , Turing would have needed a powerful computer , but these were not so freely available in 1951 , so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand .
These calculations gave the right qualitative results , and produced , for example , a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots .
The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results , but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics .
Belousov was not aware of Turing 's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society . [ 122 ]
Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood , Turing 's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology . [ 123 ]
One of the early applications of Turing 's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats , large and small . [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ]
Further research in the area suggests that Turing 's work can partially explain the growth of " feathers , hair follicles , the branching pattern of lungs , and even the left - right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest . " [ 127 ]
In 2012 , Sheth , et al. found that in mice , removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb , suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing - type mechanism . [ 128 ]
Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A. M. Turing was published in 1992 . [ 129 ]
Personal life
Engagement
In 1941 , Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke , a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst , but their engagement was short - lived .
After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée , who was reportedly " unfazed " by the revelation , Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage . [ 130 ]
Conviction for indecency
In January 1952 , Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray , a 19 - year - old unemployed man .
Just before Christmas , Turing was walking along Manchester 's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch .
On 23 January , Turing 's house was burgled .
Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted , and Turing reported the crime to the police .
During the investigation , he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray .
Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time , [ 131 ] and both men were charged with " gross indecency " under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 . [ 132 ]
Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing 's solicitor " reserved his defence " , i.e. , did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations .
Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor , and he entered a plea of guilty .
[ 133 ]
The case , Regina v. Turing and Murray , was brought to trial on 31 March 1952 . [ 134 ]
Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation .
His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido .
He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol ( now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES ) , a synthetic oestrogen ; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year .
The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form , [ 135 ] fulfilling in the literal sense Turing 's prediction that " no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man , but quite who I 've not found out " .
[ 136 ] [ 137 ]
Murray was given a conditional discharge . [ 138 ]
Turing 's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946 , though he kept his academic job .
He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 , but was free to visit other European countries .
Turing was never accused of espionage but , in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park , he was prevented by the Official Secrets
Act from discussing his war work . [ 139 ]
Death
On 8 June 1954 , Turing 's housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41 ; he had died the previous day .
Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death . [ 140 ]
When his body was discovered , an apple lay half - eaten beside his bed , and although the apple was not tested for cyanide , [ 141 ] it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose .
An inquest determined that he had committed suicide .
Andrew Hodges and another biographer , David Leavitt , have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) , his favourite fairy tale .
Both men noted that ( in Leavitt 's words ) he took " an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew " .
[ 142 ]
Turing 's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954 , [ 143 ] and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium , just as his father 's had been . [ 144 ]
Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner 's historical verdict .
He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing 's death : the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons .
The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold .
Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room .
Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison .
Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed , and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half - eaten . [ 145 ]
In addition , Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment ( which had been discontinued a year previously ) " with good humour " and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death .
He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend .
[ 145 ]
Turing 's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental , resulting from her son 's careless storage of laboratory chemicals . [ 146 ]
Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment to deliberately allow his mother plausible deniability with regard to any suicide claims . [ 147 ]
Conspiracy theorists pointed out that Turing was the cause of intense anxiety to the British authorities at the time of his death .
The secret services feared that communists would entrap prominent homosexuals and use them to gather intelligence .
Turing was still engaged in highly classified work when he was also a practising homosexual who holidayed in European countries near the Iron Curtain .
According to the conspiracy theory , it is possible that the secret services considered him too great a security risk and assassinated one of the most brilliant minds in their employ . [ 148 ]
It has been suggested that Turing 's belief in fortune - telling may have caused his depressed mood . [ 144 ]
As a youth , Turing had been told by a fortune - teller that he would be a genius .
Shortly before his death , during a day - trip to St Annes - on - Sea with the Greenbaum family , [ when ? ]
Turing again decided to consult a fortune - teller . [ 144 ]
According to the Greenbaums ' daughter , Barbara : [ 149 ]
But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went ...
Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool .
We found a fortune - teller 's tent [ , ] and Alan said he'd like to go in [ , ] so we waited around for him to come back ...
And this sunny , cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale , shaking , horror - stricken face .
Something had happened .
We do n't know what the fortune - teller said [ , ] but he obviously was deeply unhappy .
I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide .
Government apology and pardon
In August 2009 , British programmer John Graham - Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing 's prosecution as a homosexual .
[ 150 ] [ 151 ]
The petition received more than 30,000 signatures .
[ 152 ] [ 153 ]
The Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , acknowledged the petition , releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as " appalling " : [ 152 ] [ 154 ]
Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated .
While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back , his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him ...
So on behalf of the British government , and all those who live freely thanks to Alan 's work I am very proud to say : we 're sorry , you deserved so much better . [ 152 ] [ 155 ]
In December 2011 , William Jones and his Member of Parliament , John Leech , created an e-petition [ 156 ] requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of " gross indecency " : [ 157 ]
We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of " gross indecency " .
In 1952 , he was convicted of " gross indecency " with another man and was forced to undergo so - called " organo - therapy " — chemical castration .
Two years later , he killed himself with cyanide , aged just 41 .
Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he 'd done so much to save .
This remains a shame on the British government and British history .
A pardon can go some way to healing this damage .
It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men , not as well - known as Alan Turing , who were subjected to these laws . [ 156 ]
The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures , [ 156 ] [ 158 ] and was submitted to Parliament by the Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally , who said : [ 159 ]
A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence .
He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted .
It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd — particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort .
However , the law at the time required a prosecution and , as such , long - standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and , rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right , ensure instead that we never again return to those times . [ 160 ]
John Leech , the MP for Manchester Withington ( 2005 – 15 ) , submitted several bills to Parliament [ 161 ] and led a high - profile campaign to secure the pardon .
Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing 's contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was " ultimately just embarrassing " that the conviction still stood .
[ 162 ]
Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed .
[ 163 ]
Leech is now regularly described as the " architect " of Turing 's pardon and subsequently the Alan Turing Law which went on to secure pardons for 75,000 other men and women convicted of similar crimes .
[ 164 ] [ 165 ]
At the UK premiere of a film based on Turing 's life , The Imitation Game , the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing 's pardon . [ 166 ]
His campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime .
Leech 's campaign gained public support from leading scientists , including Stephen Hawking . [ 167 ]
He is often described as the " architect " of ' Turing 's Law ' , which used Turing 's pardon as a precedent to eventually successfully grant a posthumous pardon to more than 49,000 other men historically criminally convicted of ' Gross Indecencey ' .
[ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] [ 175 ] [ 176 ]
On 26 July 2012 , a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 , of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952 .
[ 177 ]
Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph , the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees , President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse , Lady Trumpington ( who worked for Turing during the war ) and Lord Sharkey ( the bill 's sponsor ) called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request .
[ 178 ]
The government indicated it would support the bill , [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October . [ 182 ]
At the bill 's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013 , Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill , delaying its passage .
The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014 , [ 183 ] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons , [ 184 ] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy .
On 24 December 2013 , Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing 's conviction for " gross indecency " , with immediate effect . [ 185 ]
Announcing the pardon , Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be " remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort " and not for his later criminal conviction .
[ 158 ] [ 186 ]
The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014 . [ 187 ]
The Queen 's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War . [ 188 ]
Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent , and a request has been made by the family or other interested party ; neither condition was met in regard to Turing 's conviction . [ 189 ]
In a letter to the Prime Minister , David Cameron , human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons .
[ 190 ]
Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing 's death :
A new inquiry is long overdue , even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death — including speculation that he was murdered by the security services ( or others ) .
I think murder by state agents is unlikely .
There is no known evidence pointing to any such act .
However , it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated .
[ 191 ]
In September 2016 , the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences , in what was described as an " Alan Turing law " .
[ 192 ] [ 193 ]
The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom , contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017 , which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts .
The law applies in England and Wales . [ 194 ]
Legacy
Awards , honours , and tributes
Turing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946 . [ 80 ]
He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ( FRS ) in 1951 . [ 8 ]
Turing has been honoured in various ways in Manchester , the city where he worked towards the end of his life .
In 1994 , a stretch of the A6010 road ( the Manchester city intermediate ring road ) was named " Alan Turing Way " .
A bridge carrying this road was widened , and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge .
A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park , between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street .
The memorial statue depicts the " father of computer science " sitting on a bench at a central position in the park .
Turing is shown holding an apple .
The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text ' Alan Mathison Turing 1912 – 1954 ' , and the motto ' Founder of Computer Science ' as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine : ' IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ ' .
However , the meaning of the coded message is disputed , as the 'u ' in ' computer ' matches up with the ' u ' in ' ADXUO ' .
As a letter encoded by an enigma machine cannot appear as itself , the actual message behind the code is uncertain . [ 195 ]
A plaque at the statue 's feet reads ' Father of computer science , mathematician , logician , wartime codebreaker , victim of prejudice ' .
There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation : " Mathematics , rightly viewed , possesses not only truth , but supreme beauty — a beauty cold and austere , like that of sculpture . "
The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to " the godfather of all modern computers " .
[ 196 ]
In 1999 , Time magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and stated , " The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard , opening a spreadsheet or a word - processing program , is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine . " [ 9 ]
Centenary celebrations
To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing 's birth , the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee ( TCAC ) co-ordinated the Alan Turing Year , a year - long programme of events around the world honouring Turing 's life and achievements .
The TCAC , chaired by S. Barry Cooper with Turing 's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President , worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and Bletchley Park .
Historic England controversy
In May 2020 it was reported by Gay Star News that a 12 - foot ( 3.7 m ) high steel sculpture , to honour Turing , designed by Sir Antony Gormley , was planned to be installed in King 's College , Cambridge .
Historic England , however , was quoted as saying that the abstract work of 19 steel slabs " ... would be at odds with the existing character of the College .
This would result in harm , of a less than substantial nature , to the significance of the listed buildings and landscape , and by extension the conservation area . " [ 197 ]

I keep teasing the full video I have of the stage demo ( up later today … LARGE file ) , but Engadget posted video of @ Emeenz from Harmonix ( also of Spirit Kid fame … awesome set last night ! ) playing BOTH real and Rock Band 3 guitar at the same time yesterday at the MTV Games booth !
Gizmodo reader Zack recently had a chance to play with Verizon 's next offering , the Motorola Droid 2 .
He sent us his impressions , some details about the specs , and a few extra pictures .
Zack wrote :
I am a summer intern at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( NASA ) this summer and today there was a tech show on the lab .
There were a lot of cool new technologies along with booths for companies like Microsoft , Apple , Sprint , and Verizon .
I went over to the Verizon booth and was surprised to see a curious - looking phone next to regulars like Blackberries and the Droid Incredible .
I picked up the phone and once I looked at it more closely I realized it was the Droid 2 .
I asked the representatives and they told me that they were n't sure exactly what the name was going to be , but that it was indeed the successor to the original Motorola Droid .
It felt really nice in my hand .
It seems smoother than the original Droid .
A lot more curves and less sharp edges .
Held next to my original Droid , it seems exactly the same size
The headphone jack , volume buttons , power / sleep button , and the Micro - USB port were all in the same place and pretty much exactly like the original .
The camera button is also in the same place , but smaller and the same color as the volume buttons .
The camera on the back was a 5.0 megapixel , so I do n't know why it is n't any better than the original Droid's .
The camera was definitely faster though .
It took a picture very quickly compared to the original .
The whole device was a dark crome - like color instead of the original Droid 's black .
The soft keys were touch - sensitive at the bottom and were in a different order than on the original phone .
It still had the Motorola and Verizon logos , as well as the " with Google . "
Opening it up , the keyboard is definitely wider and has blue coloring instead of the gold from the original .
I did n't see any gold on the entire thing actually .
( No more Batman similarities ! )
I was happy to see that the directional pad was changed so that you have the four arrows — similar to a real computer keyboard .
It 's not easy to tell in the pictures , but it was nice that there was no lip on the right side when the phone was open .
That combined with the wider keyboard made it easier to type on the device .
My favorite part about the keyboard was the button for voice commands on the lower left .
I have always wanted that on my Droid , so I 'm glad to see it on the new one .
From what I have seen of the Droid X and the Ninjablur thing , this device was running the same skin on top of Android 2.1 .
When I asked about the software , the Verizon representatives told me that it most probably would n't be coming with that on it and would probably have Froyo ( Android 2.2 ) plain ( without any skin ) .
She said that if it does come out with Android 2.1 , it will gt updated very quickly .
The device was running 2.1 and it had 8GB of internal memory as well as an 8 GB micro-SD card .
The model number says A955 and on the bottom of the device it said " G4 DR 4722 , " but I believe this is just because it is a demo device .
The representative did tell me that it had a 1
Ghz processor , but she didnt say what kind .
The representative would n't tell me when it will be released , but she said in the next few weeks .
The " God particle " may actually be five distinct particles , evidence from a new atom - smashing experiment suggests .
Called the Higgs boson , the theoretical particle has been long sought by physicists who think it 's responsible for all mass in the universe — hence the name God particle .
According to the widely accepted standard model of physics , all particles acquire their mass by interacting with the Higgs boson .
But some theories say that the Higgs boson is not one , but multiple , particles with similar masses but different electrical charges .
Now , researchers at Fermilab in Batavia , Illinois , say they have found more evidence for this multiple - particle theory .
Single God-Particle Theory Challenged
In an experiment called DZero at the lab 's Tevatron particle collider , scientists recently found that collisions of protons and antiprotons produced pairs of matter particles more often than pairs of antimatter particles .
The difference was tiny — less than one percent — but it can't be explained by a standard model that assumes the existence of a single Higgs boson , said study co-author Adam Martin , a theoretical physicist at Fermilab .
" It 's a really small effect , but it 's still much bigger than if you turn all the cranks with all the original rules in the standard model , " Martin said .
" The standard model with just the one Higgs particle is too minimal to explain the DZero result . "
The DZero results can , however , be explained if scientists assume the Higgs boson is actually five particles — an extension of the standard model called the two - Higgs doublet model .
" When we extend the standard model , we put in new particles and new interactions , " said Martin , whose results were published recently on the physics - research website arXiv.org .
" These new interactions can even treat matter and antimatter differently and therefore lead to bigger effects in experiments . "
Multiple God Particles " Quite Provocative "
If multiple Higgs bosons exist , they may interact with matter differently , which could in turn lead to new kinds of undiscovered physics beyond the standard model , scientists say .
" A lot of the schemes for extending the standard model include as a first step adding [ more Higgs boson particles ] , " Martin said .
Chris Quigg is a theoretical physicist , also at Fermilab , but he was not involved in the study .
Though " quite provocative , " the results are still preliminary , Quigg stressed .
" I know of nothing to make me explicitly doubt the result , but when something is so unexpected and yet so subtle it bears taking time and taking a deep breath , " Quigg said .
" It 's important not to jump up and down too soon about this . "
If Martin 's team is correct and the Higgs boson is actually five different particles , then it should be detectable by the LHC in Switzerland .
( See Large Hadron Collider pictures . )
" In our interpretation , " study co-author Martin said , " these Higgses cannot be too heavy , so we should definitely see them during the LHC era . "
David Evans , a physicist at the University of Birmingham and the head of the LHC ’s ALICE project , added by email , " I personally think it is unlikely that we have five different Higgs particles .

If you ’re reading this blog post on a computer , mobile phone or e-reader , please stop what you ’re doing immediately .
You could be making yourself stupid .
And whatever you do , do n’t click on the links in this post .
They could distract you from the flow of my beautiful prose and narrative .
This is the alarm currently being rung by some in the bell towers of technology .
There is a lively discussion and some concern that computers , the Internet and multitasking are extracting a mental price .
Nicholas Carr argues in his book “ The Shallows , ” that the Internet , computers , Google , Twitter and the like , are making us into shallow thinkers and the neurocircuitry of our brain that long form reading creates is critical for society to function .
Mr. Carr thinks that the Web , with its colored hypertext and endless abyss of bite - sized morsels of information , is making us stupid .
And although there are plenty of others in this camp , there are some who argue that not only are our brains just fine on the Internet , but they are indeed better off for it .
Steven Pinker , a cognitive scientist and professor of psychology at Harvard , argues on the Op - Ed page in Friday ’s New York Times that the current outcry is nothing new .
The same was heard , he writes , after the invention of the printing press , newspapers , paperbacks and television .
Now , the fear stems from PowerPoint , search engines and Twitter .
Professor Pinker points out that our brains are intended to be rewired and learn new things .
It ’s the way we are built :
Critics of new media sometimes use science itself to press their case , citing research that shows how “ experience can change the brain . ”
But cognitive neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk .
Yes , every time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain changes ; it ’s not as if the information is stored in the pancreas .
But the existence of neural plasticity does not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into shape by experience .
Jonah Lehrer , author of “ How We Decide , ” also argues that our brains are likely just fine on the Internet .
Mr. Lehrer , a former neuroscientist , writes on his blog , The Frontal Cortex , that “ given this paucity of evidence , I think it ’s far too soon to be drawing firm conclusions about the negative effects of the Web . ”
In a recent blog post Mr. Lehrer notes that the evidence critics use to attack the Web could be used to argue that we should n’t even walk down a city street as the cognitive load is far too great for our brains to handle .
He notes that a in 2008 , a group of scientists from the University of Michigan engaged in a study that showed walking led the brain to see a “ dramatic decreases in working memory , self - control , visual attention and positive affect . ”
Mr Lehrer writes :
When people walk down the street , they are forced to exert cognitive control and top - down attention , and all that mental effort takes a temporary toll on their brain .
Based on this data , it would be easy to conclude that we should avoid the metropolis , that the city street is a hazardous place .
Then there is the reality that our brains , the tool that you , the reader , are currently using to decode these symbols and understand what they mean , has still not evolved to naturally learn to read : reading is an unnatural task that we still need to train our brains to learn .
Maryanne Wolf , the director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts , and author of “ Proust and the Squid : The Story and Science of the Reading Brain , ” notes that our brains were never actually designed to read .
In a blog post last year on The Times blog , Room for Debate , Ms. Wolf wrote :
After many years of research on how the human brain learns to read , I came to an unsettlingly simple conclusion :
We humans were never born to read .
We learn to do so by an extraordinarily ingenuous ability to rearrange our “ original parts ” — like language and vision , both of which have genetic programs that unfold in fairly orderly fashion within any nurturant environment .
Reading is n’t like that .
Ms. Wolf , who is concerned about the effects of the Web on children , recently explained in a phone interview that although our brains are not designed to read , the act and process children go through when decoding letters and narrative is an imperative part of a child ’s development and thinking .
Ms. Wolf points out different media have value .
“ I ’m not saying other mediums and technologies are not good for the brain , research shows that they are , ” she said , “ but we must understand the use of visual auditory narratives so we do n’t neglect the role of the reading circuit . ”
Research shows that each medium offers its own positive attributes : Neuroscience has shown that playing video games stimulates areas of our brains that control working memory , hand and eye coordination and attention and can stimulate and vastly improve our cognitive skills .
Reading on the other hand promotes deep thought and exercises areas of the brain responsible for reflection , reasoning and critical analysis .
And auditory storytelling stimulates areas of the brain involved with creativity , contextual thinking and executive function .
It could be argued that the Web , which is the ultimate library of words , video , images , interactivity , sharing and conversation , is the quintessential place to learn .
Times are interesting .
It is busy , but mostly with things I really enjoy doing .
So fear not if you did not see a posting for a little while here 🙂
Still working on my LockCon posting but in the meantime an interesting link came in I could not just let pass by .
An interesting video on what seems a ‘ self impressioning ’ attack on the Abloy Protec lock !
I will examine it more closely over the weekend but for now just wanted to share it with you … seems very interesting and very promising !
Enjoy the video !
Britain 's population of nightingales , the world 's most celebrated songbirds , has crashed in numbers by more than 90 per cent , new research has shown .
Although there have been concerns for some time that nightingales are declining , the scale of the fall has come as a shock to researchers at the British Trust for Ornithology ( BTO ) , who uncovered the trend .
Unpublished BTO figures , which can now be disclosed by The Independent , indicate that between 1967 and 2007 the nightingale population of Britain , which is confined to England , fell by 91 per cent .
This is the biggest fall in numbers since records began of any bird still breeding in the UK , apart from the tree sparrow , whose numbers have been decimated by intensive farming and which has dropped by 93 per cent .
" For every 10 nightingales which were singing in Britain when I was born 40 years ago , only one is doing so now , " said the BTO 's Dr Chris Hewson .
" The rest of them have vanished .
That 's the scale of what we 're talking about .
Pretty sobering , is n't it ? "
Famous for its powerful singing in the dark , and celebrated by poets since classical antiquity , the nightingale is the most versified bird in the world .
In Britain it has been lauded by poets from Chaucer onwards , most notably John Keats in his much - quoted Ode to a Nightingale , inspired by a bird he heard in a garden in Hampstead , North London , in 1817 .
Once familiar to everyone in southern England during the six weeks when it sings from mid-April to June , the bird has now disappeared from a huge number of locations in the countryside and as a consequence organised " nightingale walks " are attracting more and more participants .
" My parents went on one in Cambridgeshire and there were 300 cars parked there , " Dr Hewson said .
The bird is now almost completely restricted to the south and east of a line from the New Forest to the Wash , and is concentrated in the bottom right corner of Britain – in coastal Suffolk and Essex , and in Kent and Sussex .
Luscinia megarhynchos is one of a number of migrant bird species including the cuckoo , the turtle dove and the spotted flycatcher , which breed in Britain but winter in Africa , and which are the subject of mounting concern because of dramatic decreases in their populations .
The nightingale decline might come down to problems at both ends of its migratory range .
As reported in The Independent a month ago , BTO researchers have discovered that a major cause of nightingale decline in England is the explosion in the population of deer , whose browsing is destroying the woodland undergrowth which nightingales nest in .
But there may be also problems in its African wintering grounds , as other British species which winter in the same part of West Africa , the humid tropic zone south of the Sahel , are also in trouble , including the willow warbler , the garden warbler and the cuckoo .
The real scale of the nightingale 's decline had escaped attention because the BTO , which began detailed monitoring of Britain 's birds in 1966 with the of the Common Bird Census ( CBC ) , did not produce an annual trend for the nightingale as it was not picked up frequently enough .
It was not until 2008 that a reliable trend was published – and this showed that the bird had declined by 60 per cent since 1994 .
Now BTO researchers have re-examined the data to the start of the CBC and found the long - term trend is actually a 91 per cent decline .
Had the figure been known last year , the nightingale would have been included on the Red List of Britain 's most threatened birds , Dr Hewson said – as was done for the cuckoo in 2009 .
The Red List is updated every five years .
" People are aware of the decline of the cuckoo , but the case of the nightingale is even more dire , " he said .
" It is very sad .
Lots of people grew up hearing nightingale song in the past and now many people will never get that opportunity . "
THE FACTS
91 % The estimated decline in the nightingale population in Britain between 1967 and 2007

ABC and Jon Stewart of the Daily Show tear into BP for a ridiculous amount of serious safety violations and for lying on TV about them .
Watch the video below .
[ social_buttons ]
ABC News nails BP in an interview with CEO Tony Hayward , showing that BP had 760 “ egregious and willful ” safety violations in the past 3 - 4 years ( prior to the BP oil spill disaster in the Gulf ) .
Furthermore , this was compared to Sunoco having 8 , ConocoPhillips having 8 , Citgo having 2 , and Exxon having 1 !
Tony Hayward ’s response : “ Much of that record relates to a prior period , .. and , our absolute focus over the last three or four years has been on safe and reliable operations . ”
Jon Stewart nails Hayward for straight - up lying in this statement , since it was exactly that time period the figures were referring to .
And , of course , it is pretty sad if this is how well BP does while putting an “ absolute focus ” on safe and reliable operations .

The sources said the military has been working on the assumption that within hours of hostilities Israel would be struck by missile and rocket salvos from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon .
They said both Hamas and Hizbullah were amassing huge arsenals designed to strike Israeli cities , military bases and critical facilities .
All services of the military are training and preparing for the outbreak of hostilities that could turn into a multi- front war against Israel .
The sources said the assessment was that Iran and Syria would employ Hamas or Hizbullah in the opening stage of what could rapidly become a wider war that would include massive missile attacks .
" Hizbullah is expanding its arsenal and improving rocket accuracy , " Brig .
Gen. Itai Brun , a leading military planner , said .
In the 2006 war , Hizbullah missiles and rockets were said to have struck five percent of their targets in Israel .
The Hizbullah ratio was expected to increase in any future war .
" In the next war , there will probably be a 95 percent target hit , " Christopher King , director of force protection at the U.S. company Raytheon , said .
As a result , the military has expanded its exercise schedule in 2010 for the Army , Navy and Air Force .
The sources said a key goal was to significantly enhance air assault operations that would combine Army and Air Force assets .
" The idea is for rapid response , deployment and retaliation , " a senior military source said .
" Israel can not afford to spend weeks fighting a rocket war . "
The sources said the military has increased efforts to protect Israeli cities from missile and rocket attacks to ensure the rapid mobilization of the reserves .
They said the military was pressing for additional missile and rocket defense assets , particularly the Iron Dome short - range interception system .
" Hizbullah 's dream is to maintain an army of at least 40,000 men , " Israeli military analyst Alex Fishman said .
" Today it has less than half of that , and the increase it aspires for requires a compromise on manpower quality . "
The Israeli military has been dispersing its logistics and weapons to prevent their destruction in an Iranian or Syrian missile attack .
Officials said Iran and Syria have intensified efforts to identify key Israeli military facilities .
" Over the last two years , the Israel Defense Forces has been performing wide - scale efforts to examine the best way to protect its military equipment , including ammunitions , weapons , fuel and any other equipment meant to serve the army during war , " Brig .
Gen. Nissim Peretz , head of the army 's logistics division , said .
The military has determined that Iran and Syria would try to avoid an open confrontation with Israel .
Instead , the sources asserted that both countries would use Hamas , Hizbullah and other proxies to launch a missile war that would include the Scud- class ballistic missiles .

Toshiba AC100 Tegra 2 MID hands - on [ Video ]
Toshiba ‘s first MID ( Mobile Internet Device ) has made its debut , in the shape of the Android - based Toshiba AC100 .
Using a form - factor we ’d more commonly describe as a netbook or smartbook – Toshiba say they picked the classic design over a more common slate - style MID because it ’s more familiar for users and offers better ergonomics and text - entry – the AC100 runs NVIDIA ’s second - generation Tegra 250 chipset making it 1080 p HD capable .
First impressions and hands - on video after the cut
The 1GHz chip is paired with 512MB of RAM and 8GB of flash memory , while wireless connectivity includes WiFi b/g/n , Bluetooth 2.1+EDR and optional 3G / WWAN .
There ’s also GPS , a USB 2.0 port , miniUSB , HDMI , audio in / out and an SD card reader , together with a 1.3 - megapixel webcam .
The display is a 10.1 - inch 1024 x 600 glossy panel , though unlike on the Compaq Airlife 100 it ’s not a touchscreen .

Tipping the scales at 870g and measuring 14 mm at its thinnest , the AC100 promises up to 8hrs runtime or seven days standby from a single charge ; it ’ll also resume from standby in a smartphone - like 1 second .
Toshiba have picked Android 2.1 for their OS , though they ’ve sensibly made some tweaks to the build to make it more suitable for notebook - style use .
That includes preloading a number of apps – including Documents To Go for Office file editing , Fring , the Opera Mobile browser and their own Media Player – together with a custom homescreen that adds a dedicated launcher bar at the bottom of the display .
As usual on Android there are multiple homescreen panes which you can navigate between , as well as widgets for at - a - glance information like weather or news updates , and Toshiba have created their own Facebook , YouTube and Twitter widgets .
The AC100 can automatically switch between different homescreen layouts based on its physical location , toggling between work and home modes using GPS .
We spent some hands - on time with a pre-production Toshiba AC100 , and there ’s both plenty to like and a few caveats which could trip up unwary buyers thinking of it as just another netbook .
It ’s certainly a lightweight machine , though the prototype demonstrated a great deal of flex in both the chassis as a whole and in bowing of the keyboard .
We ’re guessing Toshiba still have a little work left to do in their software optimisation , too , since sometimes moving through the launcher bar icons using the arrow keys froze or grew sluggish , before catching up and whipping past the option we were aiming for .
Connecting over the optional 3G modem – in this case on the Vodafone UK network – rendering was slow despite displaying a decent signal .
There ’s also no Flash support in the browser , though you can view YouTube videos through the dedicated app and Toshiba tells us that an update to Android 2.2 complete with Flash 10.1 is scheduled for release sometime over the next few months .

Potentially more frustrating is the limited peripheral support of the Android OS , something Airlife 100 owners have also discovered .
External keyboards , mice and storage will work fine , but try to plug in , say , a printer or a digital camera and you ’ll only get an error message .
Toshiba have preloaded a printing app called “ Single - Click Printing ” that routes documents over your internet connection and then back to a shared printer on your home or office network , but it ’s not ideal if you ’re out and about but want a hard copy of something .
Finally , our natural inclination when faced with the Android homescreen was to reach out and tap it , something of course the AC100 is n’t set up to respond to .
Toshiba describes the AC100 as falling into a new segment , between the smartphone and the laptop , and co-existing with rather than replacing their current netbook line - up .
Their success at that will depend on how the MID is priced , particularly the 3G - equipped model , when it hits shelves in August 2010 .
Assuming they can keep to that release window , it should make the Toshiba AC100 the first second - gen Tegra based product to reach the market .
Press Release :
TVO 's Search Engine examines the Balanced Copyright for Canada site in this week 's podcast .
The podcast discusses some of Jesse Brown 's concerns with the site .
Meanwhile , Simon Doyle posts the names of some of the members of the site including many record company executives and their advisors .
Doyle 's post includes an update in which the site identifies two of its advisory members – Stephen Stohn ( former law partner of CRIA 's Graham Henderson , co-author of an op - ed on copyright reform last year with CRIA lawyer Barry Sookman ) and Loreena McKennitt ( well known musician who is a former client of Henderson 's and appeared alongside him at a Canadian Heritage committee hearing in April ) .
I should note that I do n't think there is anything wrong with Stohn or McKennitt serving on their board – they 're both passionate about copyright issues – nor with the existence of a site advocating positions such as those on the Balanced Copyright site .
I encourage everyone to speak out on Bill C - 32 , regardless of their position .
My concerns with the site are that it still has not disclosed who is behind it ( although I remain convinced it is CRIA and its members ) , that it engages in astroturfing activities on media articles and blog posts , that it has actively removed users it suspects of opposing its views without warning , and that its letter writing campaign blocks the ability for users to customize their comments to reflect their own views ( which is particularly striking given the earlier criticisms from some its members about the CCER form letter website that gave users full editorial control ) .
If I was a member of the advisory board , I 'd advise the site to make some changes .
Not all dust will return to dust when the pickled corpse of Vladimir Ilich Lenin leaves its glass sarcophagus in Red Square to rot in the soil of St Petersburg cemetery next to the bones of his mother .
Lenin's brain , the source of the Bolshevik revolution , will endure - sliced like prosciutto into 31,000 slithers , mounted on glass and stored behind three locked doors , each reinforced with metal and fitted with an alarm , in Room 19 of the Moscow Brain Institute .
Wafers of Stalin 's brain are kept down the hall .
Bits belonging to Vladimir Mayakovsky , the revolutionary poet who shot himself , are preserved next door .
And the brain of the physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov - proof that the institute is not impervious to time - is being cut into microscope - size chunks in another room .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The prize , though , is Lenin .
' No brain has ever been studied so closely , ' gushes the director , 70 - year - old Oleg Adrianov .
An institute veteran of 32 years , he keeps a wood - cut print of Lenin - alive and pensive - on the wall above his desk .
He explains : ' I am much obliged to Lenin 's brain .
But it has nothing to do with politics . '
He says he would much rather have studied Mozart .
Freed from the taboos that bound his three predecessors , Dr Adrianov has just published the first account of Lenin brain studies in Successes in Physiological Sciences , the journal of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences .
Its main conclusion : Lenin 's brain was nothing special .
He had a big frontal lobe and a ' large number of especially big pyramidal neurons ' but , says Dr Adrianov , ' all we can do is speculate about what this means ' .
He is still more dismissive about Stalin : ' It offers nothing . '
Far more intriguing , he says , are the brains of deaf mutes .
This is not what the Communist Party had in mind when in 1926 it invited Oskar Vogt , a pioneering German neurologist , to help unlock the keys to Lenin 's genius .
The Brain Institute 's main handicap today is poverty , not ideological mumbo- jumbo .
A special microscope with a video display imported from Austria is broken .
Its brain slicer , custom built but which could do service in a New York deli , is wonky .
Laboratory staff in white coats eat their lunch next to jam jars floating with whole and fragmented brains .
But whatever is happening to his body and his political reputation , Lenin 's brain is treated with more respect .
It is kept on the third floor in two large roll - top wooden cabinets .
Each has dozens of meticulously labelled drawers .
( ' Right hemisphere , 1 - 18 block , sections 1 - 35 , ' reads a handwritten card on one . )
Around 1,000 have been stained purple and black for study under microscopes .
The vast majority , though , are a milky grey , unsullied and awaiting new techniques to probe the mysteries of Lenin 's thought .
Next to a window , shielded by a padlocked metal shutter , stands another cabinet .
It holds 14 large volumes bound in thick green leather and embossed in the top right hand corner with a single word : LENIN .
They contain what used to be one of the most sensitive of Soviet secrets - a detailed map of Lenin 's brain .
If Marxism was a science , reason was its tool .
And Lenin 's brain was its ultimate weapon .
The brain itself is shrivelled and small .
No cross-section is bigger than a baby 's fist .
Large sections of the left hemisphere were damaged by a series of strokes and these patches have been coloured with dark ink in photographs .
But Dr Adrianov dismisses as ' muckraking rubbish ' rumours that it was eaten away by syphilis .
' A brain is like a water - melon , ' he says , '95 per cent of it is liquid . '
But he adds : ' Frankly , I do not think he was a genius . '
He offers a once classified detail : Lenin 's brain weighed 1,340 grams .
This makes it lighter than Turgenev 's two - kilo monster but heavier than Anatole France 's puny 970 grams .
A dusty museum downstairs devotes much attention to this problem , displaying a 7 kg elephant brain in a vat of murky green fluid along with a jars of unborn foetuses to illustrate brain development .
Lenin died on 21 January 1924 .
He had been ill since the summer of 1922 , when he suffered the first of at least five strokes .
His last recorded words , uttered during a sleigh ride outside his country house near Moscow , did not suggest immortal genius : ' Good Dog . '
The autopsy , conducted the same day , took over four hours .
Cause of death : brain haemorrhage .
After two months of squabbling , it was announced in March 1924 that the Communist Party had ' decided to take all measures available in current science to preserve the body for as long as possible ' .
The state Funeral Commission promptly became the Commission for the Immortalisation of the Memory of VI Ulyanov ( Lenin ) .
The decision was inspired in part by the pharaoh Tutankhamun , whose mummified remains had recently been found by Lord Carnarvon near Luxor on the Nile .
In August , the first Lenin Mausoleum opened in Red Square .
The party became obsessed with Lenin 's immortality .
' Lenin lived , Lenin lives , and Lenin will live , ' ran a favourite slogan .
Maxim Gorky celebrated the mysterious after - life working of Lenin 's brain : ' Vladimir Lenin died : the heritage of his reason will live on , are alive , and work successfully as no one , nowhere , in the world ever worked . '
The brain itself spent two years in formaldehyde .
No one dared to discard it .
But no one knew what to do with it .
Vogt , the German professor , offered a solution .
He helped to set up a small laboratory in 1926 , and two years later was given a spacious brick building confiscated from an American business to establish the Brain Institute .
Lenin 's brain was chopped into four parts and each of these sliced into 7,500 sections .
Vogt returned to Germany in the Thirties and research continued under two star pupils , Ivan Filimonov and Semen Sassikov .
Scores of other brains were brought in for study and comparison with Lenin's .
The original theory behind Vogt 's work - a belief in direct links between brain structure and intelligence - has since been discredited .
' You can not tell from a dead brain whether it belong to a man or woman , or even a chimpanzee or human , ' says Stephen Rose , director of the brain and behaviour research group at the Open University .
But he pays tribute to other work done at the Institute by the Moscow scientists .
And unlike phrenology , the notorious pseudo - science based on skull measurements , brain research in Moscow did not , despite strong pressure , ally itself openly with racial or political purges .
Apart from a brief research note published by Vogt in 1929 in a German scientific journal , none of the work done on Lenin 's brain made it into print until Dr Adrianov 's essay , based largely on a secret 1967 paper .
There were repeated pleas for more openness - letters to the Communist Party in 1967 and 1969 and to then the Academy of Medical Sciences after 1980 .
All were rebuffed .
' I do not understand why my teachers could not publish , ' says Dr Adrianov .
' There are so many secrets in this country that make no sense . '
The biggest secret is that Lenin 's brain was , in the end , just a brain .
More than six decades of research at the Brain Institute have led to one firm conclusion : the dazzling indivividuality of every brain .
' Cognitive activity , even less behaviour , does not directly relate to brain morphology , ' says the director .
' This was a rude simplification . '
All the same , he objects to the suggestion that Lenin 's brain should perhaps follow what , in the next few months , is likely to be the fate of his body .
The brain slices should be preserved .
' They are in excellent condition .
They can be kept for ever . '
Particularly valuable , he says , are the slices not stained with dye .
' There is still much work to do .
They can be examined in the future when science discovers new methods .
I do n't think anyone wants to take them away from us . '
So Lenin , in this respect at least lives .
Does Dr Adrianov have any interest in studying the brains of , say , Gorbachev or Yeltsin ?
' None whatsoever .
We have done enough politicians .
They are not the most interesting brains . '

The offshore drilling moratorium that is falling apart in court already contains one major loophole -- and there 's little surprise which company is threading the needle .
BP plans to begin drilling two miles under the sea just miles away from a delicate wildlife reserve in Alaska .
The company will get around the deep - water moratorium by constructing an artificial island -- 31 acres of gravel -- and registering as an onshore rig .
Not exactly the safest operation , reports Rolling Stone :
Here 's what BP has in store for the Arctic : First , the company will drill two miles beneath its tiny island , which it has christened " Liberty . "
Then , in an ingenious twist , it will drill sideways for another six to eight miles , until it reaches an offshore reservoir estimated to hold 105 million barrels of oil .
This would be the longest " extended reach " well ever attempted , and the effort has required BP to push drilling technology beyond its proven limits .
As the most powerful " land - based " oil rig ever built , Liberty requires special pipe to withstand the 105,000 foot - pounds of torque — the equivalent of 50 Mack truck engines — needed to turn the drill .
" This is about as sexy as it gets , " a top BP official boasted to reporters in 2008 .
BP , a repeat felon subject to record fines for its willful safety violations , calls the project " one of its biggest challenges to date " — an engineering task made even more dangerous by plans to operate year - round in what the company itself admits is " some of the harshest weather on Earth . "
Do n't expect the White House to crack down on the loophole .
Just the opposite : Ken Salazar said yesterday he would issue a new version of the moratorium that could include provisions to allow drilling in areas where reserves and risks are known .
What ’s not to like , says the Catholic Church ’s semi-official newspaper about the cult comedy film The Blues Brothers .
With the movie ’s 30th anniversary coming up , L'Osservatore Romano decided to devote a full - page story endorsing The Blues Brothers and recommending it to Catholics everywhere .
The newspaper says the film has many redeeming qualities , such as the fact that Jake and Elwood Blues are on a mission from God to save a Catholic orphanage .
In addition , there ’s Jake ’s redemption storyline , the character Sister Mary Stigmata ( aka the Penguin ) , ” and the “ unbearable Nazis of Illinois . ”
Also Elwood “ shunned the attentions of a fascinating young lady on his mission for God . ”

Back in 2008 my opinion of FeedDemon and NewsGator lineup ( it belonged to ) was totally glowing .
Fast forward and that formula went through one of the most drastic changes in software development I know .
Online service ?
Gone . FeedDemon ?
Out of lineup , into the wild .
Google Reader ?
Suddenly Google Reader is what FeedDemon now works with .
Before I knew it I was staring at Google Reader – one of my least favorite online services at the time .
So how it all ended up ?
FeedDemon
This one got through more or less unscathed :
still highly robust desktop application ;
still requires occasional cleanup to keep performance fast ;
back in the hands of original developer and empowered with new functionality .
FeedDemon was so much of own brand that NewsGator backend poofing did n’t hurt it much .
Sync is still optional ( as it was ) and Google Reader for a back - end works as smooth – with same benefits of data in the of cloud and faster updates .
Google Reader
First time ( or ten ) I opened Google Reader I just closed it back .
As for me it is one of the typical examples of Google design paradigms pushed to the extreme .
How many buttons can we shove in their face while keeping average engagement level …
It was somewhat eye - opening to see that over 50 % of my subscribers use Google Reader .
Subjecting themselves to that willingly and every day .
It would have remained idle thought if not FeedDemon integration left me no choice but to try and make peace with its new online companion .
Several months ( and custom stylesheet to kill most of interface ) later I am quite content with Google Reader :
after all it is Google product for best as well as for worse ;
skin fluff away and at the core it is highly robust web app .
Common ground
Not a tautology at all that I referred to both as highly robust products .
Take two advanced application on desktop and in cloud , interconnect them …
There should be some serious sparks flying as result .
Core synchronized structure of subscription and folders between these two is bulletproof .
Use FeedDemon alone ?
FeedDemon on different computers ?
Mix of FeedDemon and Google Reader ?
In any case you benefit for synced experience and enormous speed gain for leveraging Google infrastructure instead of going after feeds one by one .
Weak points
On other hand feed synchronization is where synergy ends .
look , feel and layout – completely different ;
hotkeys – could n’t have less in common ;
powerful watch and filter functions in FeedDemon – nothing remotely like that in Google Reader ;
awesome and underappreciated recommendation engine in Google Reader – FeedDemon can only offer pale imitation , I am not sure is even related .
These two are not applications made for each other .
Or together .
Or on same principles .
Two totally different applications , someone thought would be good idea to link .
Good idea , but it is freezing in rift of differences now .
Overall
It is clear that neither FeedDemon or Google Reader were spoiled by being connected .
But I find it extremely disappointing that neither were improved by it either .
The thing I wonder about most – is Google even seriously interested in having API - linked desktop clients to Google Reader ?
Web apps is what they do after all .
Still – desktop software is not going away .
Is there app coming that will blow FeedDemon out of the water as far as integration with Google Reader goes ?
Wo n’t surprise me at all .

Janet Street - Porter caused controversy last week when she compared depression to a fashion accessory , telling people to ‘ get a grip ’ .
Here , Alastair Campbell hits back ...
Attention - seeking takes many forms , and a particularly virulent outbreak appeared under the name of Janet Street - Porter last week .
In a newspaper article she wrote about depression as some kind of trendy new illness , which many women now view as a must - have accessory , like the latest handbag .
I assume , from the unsympathetic tone , she has never experienced depression .
If she had , then even for the generous cheque she no doubt received , she would have thought twice before setting out an opinion as misguided as it is offensive to anyone who knows the reality of depression .
Much that appears in the media really does n’t matter .
But people who suffer from mental health problems will often say the stigma attached to them is worse than the symptoms .
Articles like hers reinforce that stigma and taboo , which in turn create shame and a sense that real problems cannot be addressed .
First , let me try to give her some insight into depression .
I had a pretty heavy nervous breakdown in 1986 , and I ’ve had depression on - and - off ever since .
With the help of friends and family , sympathetic bosses , a good GP , a psychiatrist , sometimes medication , I have learned to manage it better than I did once .
At its worst , it is like an invisible dark force that first approaches , then envelops , then appears to fill every waking thought .
You can escape via sleep , but you wake and find your eyes wo n’t open , you lack the energy to brush teeth , shave , speak , think anything other than thoughts of emptiness and despair .
When it ’s bad , my partner Fiona says it is like living with somebody from a different planet .
When you get into that mode it ’s very dangerous and corrosive .
People ask , “ what ’s wrong ? ” and you do n’t really know .
“ What triggered it ? ” and you ca n’t answer that either .
One thing you do know , there is no way you would wish to have it .
Once you ’ve had it , there are few worse experiences than knowing that dark cloud is coming back .
The cause of Janet Street Porter ’s ire – whether real or synthetic – is the fact that women like TV presenter and Mirror columnist Fiona Phillips , actress Emma Thompson and writer Marian Keyes have spoken out about their experiences .
Like them , I ’ve chosen to “ bare my soul ” , as Porter puts it , in print and on film because I feel that openness about psychosis and depression may help counteract the discrimination and stigma surrounding mental health .
When I had my breakdown , I took comfort from reading and hearing about others who had been through it and got out the other side .
So when Mind , and later the Time to Change campaign asked me to speak out , I was pleased to .
Mental health problems can happen to anyone just as cancer can or a broken limb when you fall down the stairs .
They do n’t respect status , wealth or profession .
And , hopefully , we can make it easier for others to feel they do n’t have to hide that they ’ve had mental health problems .
Men in particular find it tough to come forward .
Big boys do n’t cry , and all that .
It goes some way to explaining why men are just as likely to experience depression as women , but half as likely to seek support .
So when Janet Street - Porter says : “ The idea of feeling sorry for a bloke with low self - esteem is , frankly , risible , ” I wonder if the fact that out of every four suicides , three are men might cause her to reconsider .
Probably not .
But reasonable people might .
Frank Bruno , Marcus Trescothick and Ronnie O’Sullivan are all sportsmen who have reached the top of their chosen professions .
They ’ve also touched the depths of mental illness .
And in being open about it , they are helping to change the way people think about men and mental health and undo the damage done by the likes of Janet Street - Porter .
Far from jumping on a bandwagon or joining a trendy fad , people being open is essential to end a powerful and outdated taboo .
I know from my own recovery that it is possible to take strength and hope from the experience of others who ’ve gone to what feels like hell and back and lived to tell the tale .
My novel , All In The Mind , is based on my experiences of depression and psychosis .
I also made a BBC documentary called Cracking Up .
And I ’ve been really grateful for the response to both .
Barely a day has passed when someone has n’t said they related to something that happened to me or one of the characters in the book .
Depression is neither new nor trendy .
It just is .
Street - Porter ’s article is inconsistent , contradictory and very badly argued .
It is the kind of journalism that merely serves to strengthen the damaging stereotypes around mental health problems that stop people with very real illnesses seeking help .
Like the Daily Mirror , I ’ve been supporting the Time to Change campaign , which is working hard to put this right .
But ill - informed articles like Street - Porter ’s risk leaving people confused and misinformed .
Depression and stress are not the same , although it is true that sometimes one can lead to the other .
The truth is , anything more than mild to moderate depression can be seriously debilitating .
Time to Change says that one in four of us will directly experience a mental health problem .
What it means is that we all know someone who is affected but , as a society , we still tend to keep these things quiet .
If we could be more open , it would of course benefit people with mental health problems , but it would also benefit society and the economy .
Many talented people are kept out of the labour market because of employers ’ reluctance to hire someone who discloses they ’ve had a mental health problem : only four out of 10 employers say they would employ someone with a mental health history .
That means six out of 10 would n’t .
Some of the most important figures in history had mental health issues – Winston Churchill , Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin .
What would the world be like if they had been denied opportunities because they ’d had mental health problems ?
When Street - Porter argued there is “ virtually no stigma at all ” attached to mental health problems , she clearly had n’t done even the most basic research .
Nearly nine out of 10 people with mental health problems have been affected by stigma and discrimination .
Media coverage on mental illness is incredibly powerful .
At its best it can help challenge stigma and at its worst it can help reinforce it .
In a way , that has a direct impact upon the way people with mental health problems feel and are perceived .
The decision that people such as Marian Keyes and newspaper columnist Allison Pearson take when they speak out about it is a difficult one .
I had no choice , because when I jumped from journalism to politics , the press started writing about my past troubles anyway .
I have never regretted being open .
I hope that by speaking out about our experiences , anyone with a mental health problem can play
a role in educating and ­showing others in distress that they are not alone , help is out there and recovery possible .
Mental health problems can happen to any one of us and it ’s important people can speak out and seek help without fear of being criticised and ridiculed .
The volume of complaints about Street - Porter ’s article suggests the public realises it is indeed Time to Change .
● Alastair ’s fee for this article has been donated to mental health charities mind and rethink .
He is asking Janet Street - Porter to donate the fee for her article to the same cause .
www.time-to-change.org.uk.
The figures
● Mental health problems affect one in four .
● Nearly nine out of 10 people with mental health problems have been affected by stigma and discrimination .
● 92 % of the British public believe admitting to a mental illness would damage their career
● Stigma stops people with mental health problems from doing everyday things – even reporting a crime .

BP shares have now lost 47 pc of their value since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on April 20 .
Before the incident , BP was Britain 's biggest company , with a stock market value of £ 122bn .
Since then , more than £ 50bn has been wiped off its value .
A GREENPEACE activist trying to free tuna from a commercial fishing net in the Mediterranean was harpooned through the leg by fishermen on a French boat , the environmental group said .
" In a non-violent action , Greenpeace activists in zodiac boats attempted to lower the side of a purse seine net with sand bags to free the fish , " said Isabelle Philippe of Greenpeace France .
" At that moment , fishermen violently attacked the activists , harpooning one of them through the leg , " she said .
The injured man , a British national identified by the group as Frank Huston , was transferred to a hospital in Malta where he was to undergo surgery on Friday evening ( local time ) .
" His life is not threatened , but he is in serious condition , " Ms Philippe said .
The fishing ship , the Jean - Marie Christian VI , was one of several French tuna vessels in the area when the attack occurred in international waters near Malta , she added .
Several boats surrounded the zodiacs , threatening them with knives attached to long poles and some of the fishermen also fired flare guns at a Greenpeace helicopter hovering overhead to monitor , Greenpeace said in a statement .
A French navy vessel was seen arriving in the area after the clash had ended , the statement added .
Greenpeace said that it had stationed two ships in the Mediterranean , the Rainbow Warrior and Arctic Sunrise , to confront tuna fishing boats during the short tuna fishing season .
Pascal Husting , director of Greenpeace France , condemned the fishermen for their violent response .
" The tuna fishermen only know brutality : all our militants have are bags of sand to weigh down the nets and free the fish , " he said .
Bertrand Wendling , head of Sathoan , which represents the owners of many of the French tuna fishing boat including the one whose nets were targeted by Greenpeace , accused the group of interfering with a legal business activity and jeopardising the livelihoods of ordinary fishermen .
" Red tuna fishing is a highly regulated , legal and permitted activity , " he said .
" It is out of the question that you go out on the high seas to stop people working when they have only 15 days in which to earn a living , because the season runs from May 15 to June 15 and until now the boats have been completely stuck . "
About 100 fishing vessels navigate the Mediterranean during the short tuna fishing season .
Many of the boats carry net cages used to encircle the tuna swarms , which are then towed offshore to be fattened and shipped in giant freezer ships to Japan , where it is a mainstay of sushi and sashimi .
Industrial - scale fishing and harvesting on the high seas has caused stocks to plunge by up to 80 per cent in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic , where they come to spawn in the warmer waters .
Earlier this year the European Union and the United States backed an international trade ban on tuna fished from these waters , but Japan lobbied successfully and the proposal was defeated .
In what most be the saddest / strangest story of the day , three people have been killed and six injured trying to defuse a World War II bomb in central Germany .
The 500 - kilogram ( 1,100 pound ) bomb was found late Tuesday in the town of Goettingen .
All the dead and injured were in the process of removing the explosive .
Police are examining how the bomb went off while experts were preparing to defuse it .
The men who died were specialists with vast experience in this field .
“ Suddenly there was a muffled blast , ” Goettingen fire department official Frank Gloth told broadcaster ZDF , adding that the bomb ( which exploded “ without warning ” ) was discovered at a sports - stadium construction site .
World War II era bombs are still routinely unearthed on German construction sites all these years after the end of the war .
In a bitter twist of fate , Goettingen police chief Robert Kruse told reporters that this team had found and deactivated a similar bomb last week at the same construction site .

In future , they will start to smell distinctively if they need to be replaced .
A new process causes odoriferous oils to exude from plastic materials if they are cracked .
Cycling crash helmets have just one purpose : to protect the cyclist ‘s head .
But only completely damage - free helmets do the job properly .
It is therefore recommendable to buy a new one every now and again , but nobody wants to throw away a perfectly good helmet .
It would be better to know for certain that this is really necessary .
A new process developed by German research scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM in Freiburg makes this possible .
The polymer materials or plastics produced by the process start to smell if they develop small cracks .
Large cracks really cause a stink .
The smell comes from odoriferous oils enclosed in microcapsules .
" Cyclists often replace their helmets unnecessarily after dropping them on the ground , because they cannot tell whether they are damaged or not .
The capsules eliminate this problem .
If cracks form , smelly substances are released , " explains Dr. - Ing .
Christof Koplin , research scientist at the IWM .
The capsules are added to a polypropylene mass which is injection - molded to form the final component .
In the case of the bicycle helmet , the microcapsules are inserted in a thick foil made of polypropylene , which is fastened to the head gear .
A layer of melamine formaldehyde resin encloses the capsules so that they are completely airtight and mechanically sealed .
It also protects the tiny pods , which are subjected to temperatures of 200 to 300 degrees during injection molding as well as static pressures of up to 100 bar .
" Melamine formaldehyde resin proved to be the most suitable encapsulation material in the comparison we conducted of the material systems , " explains Koplin .
" Inside the capsule there is a porous , hardly deformable silicon oxide core which absorbs the odoriferous substance .
This core produced the best results , " he adds .
To determine the loads at which the miniscule capsules measuring just 1 to 50 micrometers break open , the scientists test them at the IWM with a Vickers indenter .
The engineers calculate the number of capsules required by means of numerical computer simulation .
The finished component is then subjected to bending and drawing tests .
The tests are only deemed to be successfully completed if the capsules are found to open and exude the odoriferous substances just before the component fails .
Koplin : " Our method of detection by smell offers several advantages .
It not only indicates when safety - critical polymer components need to be replaced .
The exuding smells also enable damage outside the safety range to be detected . "
The process is therefore suitable for all products which are difficult to test for defects , such as cycle , motorbike and construction helmets .
But it can also be used to check pressure hoses , e.g. in washing machines , which are difficult to access .
Smell sensors could also monitor plastic water and gas supply pipes to detect any cracks , because the odoriferous substances emitted are noticeable over long distances .
" Smell detection is already in use for coated metal components .
We are applying the process for the first time to polymer materials .
The cycle helmet is being used as a demonstrator .
Work on the capsules has finished and we are now completing characterizing tests on individual configurations , " states Koplin .

Elevator Hours
History of the Oregon City Municipal Elevator
In Oregon City 's early years , most of the city was located on the “ first level ” along the Willamette River .
As the city grew , it became apparent that an easier way needed to be found to travel to the upper levels of the town .
By 1867 , steps were built up the bluff to supplement early Native American trails used by city residents .
More steps were constructed over the years , but the climb was still difficult because the preferred route had 722 steps from the base of the cliff to the top of the bluff .
On May 10 , 1912 , the City Commission decided to place before the voters a ballot measure asking if the City should be authorized to issue bonds for “ A Public Elevator at the Bluff . ”
The first vote on funding a public elevator was defeated on July 8 , 1912 .
Considered again on December 2 , 1912 , the voters authorized $ 12,000 in bonds “ to construct and operate an elevator from the lower to the upper town at some point to be selected . ”
A committee of City Commissioners was appointed to “ investigate the elevator proposition . ”
Most city residents thought an elevator was a great idea ; however , none of the wealthier residents who lived on the bluff wanted the elevator near their property .
By March , 1913 , negotiations had started to acquire access between 6th and 7th Streets for the upper portion of the elevator .
The owner of the property objected to locating the elevator in front of her residence and refused to sell access to the City .
The City took the matter to the State Supreme Court and the Court decided in the City 's favor .
The property owner remained opposed to the elevator and never did ride on it .
The City surveyed and platted the vertical “ Elevator Street ” and entered into a contract with Oregon Bridge and Construction Company to construct the elevator .
The elevator could be operated by either electricity or water power .
Water power was cheaper than electricity , but the City 's Water Board refused to allow the connection , fearing the elevator would diminish the integrity of the water system .
The City Commission resolved the matter by removing and appointing a new Water Board composed of City Commissioners .
The issue went to court and the elevator committee was instructed to procure water from the Water Board to operate the elevator .
After years of discussion and conflict , the elevator , constructed of steel and wood , was placed into service on November 27 , 1915 , a day on which almost the entire population of Oregon City ( 3,869 persons ) rode the elevator .
The 89 - foot ride to the top involved a wheezing , jerking three to five minutes .
Once at the top , it was necessary to cross a 35 - foot catwalk that bridged the two sides of the city high above the chasm .
When the elevator worked , it generally lowered the water pressure in the surrounding area .
When it did n't work , passengers had to wiggle out of a trap door and down a narrow ladder .
By 1924 , the hydraulic power was replaced by electricity and the ride was reduced to 30 seconds .
Dependability increased with the switchover and the elevator became the preferred method of pedestrian travel .
By the 1950's , breakdowns became much more frequent and it was determined that a new elevator was needed to replace the wooden structure .
The City Commission approved a resolution to study the feasibility and costs for a new elevator .
A total of $ 7,000 was spent planning the structure that , under City Commission direction , was to be “ as plain as possible without adornment . ”
A special election in May , 1952 authorized bonds for $ 175,000 to build a new elevator .
Bids were received in November , 1953 ; however , the low bid was over $ 200,000 so all bids were rejected .
In January , 1954 , the firm of Stevens and Thompson submitted a new design proposal that could be built within the bond amount .
The new design produced a low bid of $ 116,000 and a contract was awarded to James and Yost , Inc .
The new elevator was dedicated on May 5 , 1955 , and the City Commission accepted it on July 13 , 1955 .
At that time , 2,000 elevator passes were printed .
Even though the elevator ride has always been free , the distribution of these passes as a keepsake has continued as a City tradition .
The existing elevator took over 751 tons of concrete and steel to construct , is 130 feet high , and passengers can zip to the top in 15 seconds .
Additionally , passengers now walk through a 35 - foot long tunnel under the tracks rather than over the tracks .
The Oregon City Municipal Elevator continues to operate as one of only four municipal elevators in the world and “ Elevator Street ” remains the only “ vertical street ” in North America .
Brutal !
It is Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals and your Philadelphia Flyers are in a do - or - die situation , down 3 - 2 in the series and trailing by a goal in the third period .
You are already quite impatient and clinging to the edge of your seat when suddenly , and unexpectedly , the television turns off .
It just does n't make sense !
You did n't touch the converter and the television did n't unplug itself !
You turn it back on , but a few minutes later it shuts off again !
Could anything be more frustrating ?
How could this be happening ?
Is there anything that you have not yet accounted for ?
Yes !!!
Your inconsiderate jerk of a girlfriend who keeps on using the other converter to play a prank on you and shut off the television from another room !
Reason enough to dump the chick ?
Right ?
Well , maybe not .
She is drop dead gorgeous .
A game like that ( 3 - 3 tie in Game 6 that needed to be decided in overtime ) only comes around once a year ... if you are lucky !
I 'm sure if your boyfriend played such a cruel prank on you during the season finale of The Hills , you 'd ball your eyes out before calling everyone on your contact list , asking them if they know how to work a television .
Have some respect and let your man watch his game in peace !
Or not and put the footage on the web so we can all laugh ...
Yeah , that 's the ticket .

We are not simply intellectual creatures .
We wish to make love , to enjoy a gourmet dinner , to jog in the park , to cheer lustily at a ball game , to engage in spirited conversation with our friends , to play bridge or tennis , travel to exotic places , struggle with others to build a better world , and to enjoy the arts .
The arts are so vital because they help to make life worth living .
Music , poetry , literature , paintings , dance , and the theater are among our richest joys ... The fine arts contribute immeasurably to the good life and that is why we cherish them .

Wikipedia has become home base for a loose worldwide network of pedophiles who are campaigning to spin the popular online encyclopedia in their favor and are trying to lure more people into their world , an investigation by FoxNews.com confirms .
Chat room posts show a clear effort by pedophiles to use Wikipedia , which can be accessed unfiltered in public schools across the country , to further their agenda .
Message board posts often include links to specific Wikipedia articles that the participants say need to be edited to " normalize " pedophile behavior in the public eye and to recruit more pedophiles into their community .
“ Pedophiles have campaigned to push their point of view that ' pedophilia is OK and does n’t hurt children ' on Wikipedia , ” says Xavier Von Erck , director of the online pedophile watchdog organization Perverted Justice Foundation and Wikisposure.com , its offshoot project devoted to tracking pedophiles and pedophile activism on Wikipedia .
“ This has been a problem since Wikipedia started . ”
In response to a request for comment on this story , Sue Gardner , executive director of Wikimedia Foundation , Wikipedia 's parent organization , said in a statement :
" Wikipedia has a long - held , zero - tolerance policy towards pedophilia or pedophilia advocacy and child pornography .
The Wikimedia community is vigilant about identifying and deleting any such material .
Any allegations to the contrary are outrageous and false . "
On April 22 , a user with the screen name “ apple ” on the BoyChat message board posted a call for pedophiles around the world to start a Wikipedia article devoted to the author of a memoir described as “ the life history of a lover of boys ! ! ”
( BoyChat is a notorious , long - running online message board for adults who are attracted to underage boys . )
A user named “ Drowning , not waving ” replied in a post called “ apple get that Wikipedia entry written ” :
“ IMO still the best autobiography written by a bl [ boy lover ] .
A must read , despite ( or because of ) depicting a very different world to today's .
" And do n't forget his Some Boys for a fleshier look at his interaction with the world . ”
Three years ago , on Annabelleigh.net , an online message board for adults who are sexually attracted to prepubescent girls , a user named “ student ” outlined the campaign to use Wikipedia as a platform for activism and to recruit more pedophiles .
( Annabelleigh , also called GirlChat , is the sister site to BoyChat . )
The Annabelle post , titled “ Keep your eye on the prize , ” read :
“ The most important function Wikipedia serves is via the pedophilia articles themselves .
It is important that they remain fair and unbiased .
It is important that they continue to have external links to the support and activist community .
The user pages are much less important .
" It is of the utmost importance that pedophiles newly daring to google " pedophile " or " pedophilia , " or look them up directly in Wikipedia , in an effort to understand themselves better , are able to get unbiased information ….
Many of these men and women are in dire need of support .
" Secondly , nonpedophiles who recognize the increasingly sensationalistic media treatment , etc. , and turn to the Web to find the facts or people who use the Web as their primary source of information :
If they turn to Wikipedia , Wikipedia should give a fair and balanced view .
This community needs that to happen … .
" That should be the primary focus of our Wikipedia efforts .
If you have to ' lie and hide ' to keep our influence balanced against the bigots , then by all means lie and hide to do it .
By all means , do not give up the fight to self - identify on the user pages , but make sure you do not let it stop you from editing ! ”
Wikipedia 's critics point out that schools throughout the U.S. encourage students to do research on the online encyclopedia , which is free and available to anyone with an Internet connection .
This means that students who use Wikipedia to research the academic subject of pedophilia will immediately find a page on the topic that is being targeted by the pedophiles .
Wikipedia's " Pedophilia " page also is the first " hit " when you search the term in Google or Bing .
The article on pedophilia , in its suggestions for further reading , suggests other Wikipedia pages edited by pedophiles , including " Child Sexuality , " and " NAMBLA , " a page about the North American Man / Boy Love Association .
That page links directly to NAMBLA 's website , as do 25 other Wikipedia pages .
Wikipedia also has 32 external links to GirlChat , 14 to a Danish pro-pedophile website and 12 to BoyChat .
FoxNews.com also found hundreds of posts on BoyChat linking to Wikipedia pages , including " Child Sex Tourism , " which provides detailed information on the different laws regarding child prostitution in countries around the world , and which links to newspaper articles that highlight “ hotspots ” like a section of Mexico City where child exploitation is rampant and unchecked by law enforcement .
Other recent links were to Wikipedia pages named “ Sexual Objectification , " " Child Erotica " and “ Simulated Child Pornography . ”
These Wikipedia articles , edited and shared by pedophiles , are nothing but guideposts to get them aroused , says Hemanshu Nigam , who headed security divisions at Microsoft and MySpace and now runs SSP Blue , an online security consulting firm .
Posts on BoyChat also instruct participants to hide their identities and avoid being blocked by other users while editing pedophilia - related articles on Wikipedia .
Anyone can edit an article on Wikipedia as long as he follows Wikipedia ’s principles of having a neutral point of view , which means the articles are n’t supposed to take sides on any issue and they must cite “ verifiable , authoritative sources , ” according to Wikipedia .
Some pages are protected and can be edited only by volunteer administrators who have a certain number of edits and days editing under their belt , while other pages are fully protected and may be edited only by volunteer administrators or stewards voted on by the community .
If someone makes an edit that other members of the community do n’t approve , they can revert that edit or , in more drastic circumstances , nominate the entire page for deletion .
The deletion request is then commented on by other members of the community until a consensus is reached .
( Click here to see Wikipedia ’s policies and guidelines page and here for the fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates . ]
But an investigation by FoxNews.com shows that pedophiles are gaming this system , using their message boards to rally opposition and to sabotage attempts by other Wikipedia community members to rid the online encyclopedia of pro-pedophilia content .
For example a 2007 post on BoyChat calls on the pedophile community to vote against another user ’s request to delete a Wikipedia page called “ Marthijn Uittenbogaard , ” named for the leader of a defunct Dutch political party that had three members and advocated for the legalization of sex between adults and children .
After the page was nominated for deletion by multiple Wikipedia users , a BoyChat user named “ SqueakBox ” wrote on the blog :
“ Hysterical antiped lists Marthijn Uittenbogaard for wikipedia scrapheap !
" Get yer ' votes in -"
The blog post concludes with a link to the Wikipedia page where the proposed deletion was being voted on .
The site remains active today .
Wikisposure has identified hundreds of convicted pedophiles and well - known pedophilia activists who have been members of Wikipedia ’s community of volunteers who edit articles on the online encyclopedia .
Some pedophiles active on Wikipedia have been sent to prison on charges relating to child pornography , according to Wikisposure , which has assisted in some of the investigations .
Von Erck , who uses a pseudonym , said a number of pedophiles have been kicked off the site , but many of them have returned using different usernames .
“ The problem with it is you need to have a committed effort to deal with committed people who are devoted to pushing their propaganda online like pedophiles , ” he said .
But Nigam , who is co-chairman of President Obama 's Online Safety Technology Group and sits on the board of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , said it 's not that complicated .
" Almost every other social networking site has taken steps to clean up their sites , except for Wikipedia , " he said .
Nigam said Wikipedia is making a conscious choice to abandon its responsibility by hosting an online haven for pedophiles .
“ It ’s nothing more than a company that is choosing to ignore the worst kind of exploitation in the world , ” he said .
( Mashable ) -- According to documents leaked to Boy Genius Report , AppleCare representatives are being given a strong company line to deliver to unhappy iPhone 4 owners who complain about reception issues .
Employees are told to say that the device 's reception performance " is the best we have ever shipped " and that its critical antenna flaws are " a fact of life in the wireless world . "
They are told not to perform service on iPhones with these problems and instead to give customers a PR - driven recitative instead .
These statements are dead ringers for CEO Steve Jobs ' own assertions that the iPhone 4 antenna and reception issues do not , in fact , exist .
" There is no reception issue , " he told one user .
But the very fact that this document exists suggests that Apple execs know there is indeed a widespread hardware flaw , even if they 're unwilling to address it publicly at this time .
After users complained about iPhone 4 reception problems , Apple released a written statement last week saying , " Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance , with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas . "
An Apple spokesperson said Monday the company would have no further statements on the subject .
Apple did not immediately respond Thursday to an e-mail seeking comment on the leaked documents .
Outside the reality distortion field , on the other hand , Mashable and many other sites have been able to duplicate the issue being discussed :
When held by its sides , which are composed of a metal antenna band , the phone 's reception quality drops dramatically .
iPhone owners in our newsroom have seen reception decrease from five to two bars simply from holding the phone with two points of contact between the owner 's hand and the antenna band .
One law firm is even preparing for a class - action lawsuit against Apple and is soliciting iPhone 4 customers to contact them about reception issues .
Also , while some folks have reported that using a bumper case prevents contact with the antenna band and preserves reception quality , AppleCare reps are being told to not give bumper cases to disgruntled users .
Here 's the full text of the document as reported :
1. Keep all of the positioning statements in the BN handy -- your tone when delivering this information is important .
a . The iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped .
Our testing shows that iPhone 4's overall antenna performance is better than iPhone 3GS .
b. Gripping almost any mobile phone in certain places will reduce its reception .
This is true of the iPhone 4 , the iPhone 3GS , and many other phones we have tested .
It is a fact of life in the wireless world .
c. If you are experiencing this on your iPhone 3GS , avoid covering the bottom - right side with your hand .
d . If you are experiencing this on your iPhone 4 , avoid covering the black strip in the lower - left corner of the metal band .
e . The use of a case or Bumper that is made out of rubber or plastic may improve wireless performance by keeping your hand from directly covering these areas .
2 . Do not perform warranty service .
Use the positioning above for any customer questions or concerns .
3 . Do n't forget YOU STILL NEED to probe and troubleshoot .
If a customer calls about their reception while the phone is sitting on a table ( not being held ) it is not the metal band .
4. ONLY escalate if the issue exists when the phone is not held AND you cannot resolve it .
5 . We ARE NOT appeasing customers with free bumpers -- DON'T promise a free bumper to customers .

The scientist responsible for some of the Pentagon 's wildest research has devised a method that could one day save trauma patients , and even extend the shelf life of transplant organs .
Step one : Suffocate the wounded .
Step two :
Put 'em on ice .
Mark Roth , a biochemist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center , has been working on suspended animation – inspired by the processes of animal hibernation – for years now .
In 2005 , with funding from Pentagon far - out research arm Darpa , Roth managed to reanimate rats suffering from massive blood loss , using hydrogen sulfide to knock them out and curb their oxygen consumption .
Since then , Roth has made significant progress .
His hydrogen sulfide procedure has completed phase 1 of the three clinical trials required before FDA approval .
And he 's moved onto a new , related method that could boost trauma survival even more effectively .
" A lot of animals hibernate through the winter , and they share two key features :
They get really cold , and they use very little oxygen , " he tells Danger Room .
" So we wanted to know ' what 's the relationship between those two features ' " ?
By studying brewer 's yeast and nematode worm embryos , Roth and his team determined that " a coordination of life processes , " reacted in sync – and kept the organism alive – after oxygen was reduced and their temperatures were lowered .
In his tests , 66 percent of the yeast and 97 percent of the nematodes outlasted the cold exposure – and were good as new , once reheated and exposed to oxygen .
Though the precise mechanism by which the process works has n't been pinpointed , the team observed that " certain sub - cellular processes are going on , but really should n't be , " Roth says .
Roth 's Darpa - funded research might come in handy as he works out the kinks in this new procedure .
Since hydrogen sulfide reduces an organism 's consumption of oxygen , it might be just the compound to use prior to putting people , or organs , into the deep freeze .
Once mastered , the method would buy time for trauma patients , including heart attack victims and those suffering massive blood loss .
Of course , that 's where the Pentagon 's interest lies : keeping injured troops alive until they can get adequate medical treatment .
It could also help doctors make the most of therapeutic hypothermia , the process of cooling down patients with the intent of improving their odds of survival and preventing brain and organ damage .
Roth foresees a drug that could combine the right sequence of oxygen deprivation and hypothermia , without dangerous side effects that can accompany the procedure .
Not only could Roth 's research save lives and revolutionize organ transplant surgeries , but it also pares survival down to its smallest iota .
" The underlying relationship between living and dying , " Roth says , " really has to do with this proper order of these cellular relationships . "

Here ’s a video that ’ll disturb you .
It shows the Answers in Genesis folks trying to counter what small kids have been taught about Evolution :
I especially love the woman who talks about how most Christians are perceived as ignorant and then proceeds to demonstrate said ignorance by saying that she prefers the Biblical explanation for life because it ’s “ just easier to explain to your children . ”
It ’s clear most of these kids barely grasp the concept of Creationism , let alone Evolution , but that does n’t matter so long as these folks can convince them that the former is true and the latter is false .
Some of them will grow up and change their minds as they ’re better able to grasp the concepts and are exposed to the science , but for too many of them the nonsense they ’re being fed now will stick with them throughout their lives .
And , yes , the rest of us will consider them ignorant .
Bob Cleaves , president and CEO of Biomass Power Association ( BPA ) , via teleconference addressed a report released by the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) on biomass fuels that BPA described as misleading .
Contrary to the report , Cleaves emphasized that BPA and its members do not advocate harvesting trees for energy production and the vast majority of biomass facilities utilize wood waste material and industry byproducts to produce clean energy .
“ The study has no relevance to how biomass power is generated in this country today and no relevance to how it will be generated in the foreseeable future , ” said Cleaves .
EWG ’s report stated that a typical 50 MW biomass plant burns more than a ton of wood a minute .
Two wood - burning plants recently proposed in Massachusetts would generate a combined 97 MW and require the equivalent of cutting 12,000 acres of forest annually , more wood than is currently harvested in the entire state each year .
Permitting documents reveal that whole - tree harvesting would provide one - half to two - thirds of the fuel for at least one of the plants , the report stated .
But BPA said they are not aware of any facilities that use whole trees for energy and that it is not an economically sustainable approach to biomass as the cost of cutting down one tree outweighs the potential energy benefits .
Cleaves also disagreed with the EWG ’s allegation that biomass power would be unable to meet the 2025 renewable energy goals without harvesting trees .
The report from EWG stated that in order to reach the goal of 25 percent of U.S. electricity being generated from renewable sources , biomass plants would require the equivalent of clear - cutting between 18 and 30 million acres of forests over the next 15 years .
The analysis also found that under the American Clean Energy and Security Tax the treasury would forfeit about $ 10.5 billion in tax revenues over the next 15 years as taxpayers subsidize the construction of biomass power plants , most of which they said will be burning whole tress .
Cleaves challenged that notion saying that the tax credit and the investment tax credit passed by Congress last year are only available for waste wood products and other organic by - products and not merchantable timber .

, I am reminded of a photograph I once saw of a tourist getting sucker - punched by a kangaroo .
It captured the incredible moment wonderfully : the full - body whiplash , the misaligned jaw , the athletic twist of the kangaroo's follow - through — even the woman 's camera , suspended in flight , apparently bitch - slapped away from her eye .
I mention this punch because , as my hero Saul Bellow wrote , " Truth comes in blows . "
And as a man , there is absolutely no way I can talk about today 's coffee culture without throwing a few haymakers .
If you 're at all serious about drinking coffee , you already know the trend du jour : blind reverence for the " rock - star barista " and the " super - geek roaster . "
For men with normal estrogen levels , the resulting experience can be humiliating : standing in an unmoving line while those ahead patiently waiting for their coffee to be " siphoned " ( or similarly slow - brewed , one irritating cup at a freaking time ) , everything choreographed by a 22 - year - old faux - junkie explaining why he 's morally opposed to making your espresso the way you ordered it .
And then you pay him five bucks .
Listen , the espresso machine was invented for a reason : to be " espress , " a.k.a. fast ( and , ironically , to replace the siphon and slow - brew ) .
Listen up , geeks :
Drop the slow - brew renaissance and pick up the pace .
We have work to get to .
Here are a few warnings , my way of de - geek - ifying your coffee experience .
( This list is n't exhaustive . )
1. Beware the presence of the $ 17,000 coffee machine .
It 's a lot like the fad of the $ 100 hamburger :
The beef may be good and the press may love it ( at least for a day ) , but if you order it , someone in public relations will be laughing at you .
No one was actually supposed to buy it .
2. Beware bean propaganda .
Super - geeks love to claim their coffee hails from single - origin Valhalla , unapproachable for any other roaster .
Truth is , we live in the computer and commuter age ; the world is tiny and coffee only comes from the small band around the middle .
We all have access to the same beans .
3 . Beware the barista who looks like an angry bike messenger moving at lazy - eye speeds , yet when he touches the espresso grinder , he goes Eddie Van Halen on it .
( By the way , " barista " is Starbucks speak .
In Italy the word for " barista " is " barman . " )
4 . Beware the barista who goes techno - nerd on you when describing how he makes coffee : heat - surfing , pre-infusion profiling , tamp - dialing .
Seriously , and how would you describe the act of opening a beer , liquid - load pressure breaching ?
5 . Be wary of the barista bent on removing your tooth enamel by cranking the dose of ground bean from the recommended 7 grams to a heart - pounding 21 grams .
( This is called " overdosing , " meant to balance out the taste of a monster latte . )
You can always tell by how the espresso looks : less shiny terra cotta and more whipped crude oil .
6 . Beware the freak who can only get his coffee rocks off by caging a beautiful wild civet , feeding it coffee cherries and sifting through its poop for coffee beans .
Sick puppies like that should just be avoided , period .
7 . When the other patrons are taking pictures of their coffee with smart phones , run .
Actually , I have to give it to the geeks — they 're a creative bunch .
The Web is filled with their caffeinated ramblings and " reviews , " and for a long time , the culinary - minded neo- traditional roaster just shut up and took it like a man .
The idea was to let the coffee do the talking .
But I suppose it was only a matter of time before I snapped .
Once a name brand chef / owner told me he was a wave - surfer , meaning he surfed from trend to trend .
Today this guy no longer has restaurants of his own .
Instead , he hosts a cable cooking show .
I suppose he missed a wave at some point , failed to " drop in . "
You see , trends are like waves , and all waves eventually crash .
With this particular one , it is hard to say exactly where and when .
But when you 're standing in line waiting for the super - geek to slow - brew another cup , you can almost feel the water beginning to curl .

Continuing my series of micro-interviews with Clojure hackers I present Technomancy ( aka Phil Hagelberg ) .
Phil continues the theme of prolific coders having brought us a series of fantastic projects .
Most notable among his Clojure output is the ( increasingly ubiquitous ) Leiningen build tool .
However , the story of his mad output does not end there as the Emacs Starter Kit , clojure - http- client , and my personal favorite Robert Hooke attest .
Additionally , he is maintaining both clojure - mode.el and Swank / Slime for Clojure .
As if that were not enough , Phil is also a contributor to the Duby programming language and to Clojure itself — and all of this1 is without mentioning his Ruby contributions !
Finally , Phil works for Sonian , which is the Avengers2 of the Clojure community .
Q : What led you to Clojure ?
I started programming with QBasic in 7th grade , and I got into writing Zork - style text adventures .
Of course I did n’t understand data structures , so my games were very much copy / paste affairs .
I wanted to put together a tool that could create text adventures , but I ended up trying to do this by outputting the whole source ( with hard - coded rooms , gotos , etc ) to .BAS files on disk instead of separating out data and logic .
As you can imagine it did n’t work very well , but it got me thinking .
In college I realized I ’d have to make the choice at some point between Emacs and vi .
I gave them each a brief shot , but the default vi key bindings are designed to work with a QWERTY layout and are nonsense on Dvorak , ( yes , I realize now you can fix this ) so I ended up going with Emacs .
Once I got going with Elisp I realized it had the magic “ programs writing programs ” property that I ’d been looking for since 7th grade , and that sealed the deal for me .
Of course , you ca n’t do that much with Elisp , at least if you want to get paid , so I toyed around with Common Lisp .
My background was in web programming at that point , and so naturally I thought , “ I know , I ’ll port my blog to it ! ”
That lasted about a month — it was so awkward at the time just to find a decent HTTP server , so CL still has this aura of the 1980s associated with it in my head , complete with big hair and Tears For Fears playing in the background .
( Having VAX filesystem support included in the language spec certainly does n’t help with that image . )
I got into Ruby in 2005 since it felt “ close enough to lisp ” to keep my interest , and the money was certainly good .
But when I watched Rich ’s Clojure for Lisp Programmers videos one weekend in November of 2008 it became clear that you could really use it for everyday tasks .
So the pragmatic angle really pulled me in , though the immutability was what caught my eye to begin with .
Q : Are you planning on starting a line of keyboard pants ?
( please say yes )
I ’ll probably sell a kit , Altair - style and let hackers put them together themselves .
I would n’t want to deprive them of the hands - on fun of assembly .
I think they ’re great , but I fully acknowledge that I ’m on the lunatic fringe of input and interface mechanisms .
Q : As someone who seems to manage an astonishing number of projects simultaneously , how do you manage to avoid starving any given project ?
At first I misread this as “ how do you manage to avoid starting any given project ” .
My answer for that is more interesting , so I ’ll start there .
It used to be that I was limited by coming up with names ; naming projects is really hard .
But these days I ’ve decided on a policy of naming all my projects after literary characters , which has led me to the opposite problem — I need to make sure my projects are good enough for the names I ’ve got in mind .
I ’ve got this silly 25 - line test coverage hack that I want to release , but calling it “ Orestes ” seems like it does n’t do Æschylus ’s work justice .
So I ’m limited by the rate at which I read new fiction — I need to stumble across some minor characters with names that do a better job at reflecting my humbler hacks .
As for avoiding starving any given project — well , just ask anyone who ’s sent me patches : I simply do n’t .
It ’s disgraceful .
I really try to focus on one project at a time , but that means patches can wait for three months before getting applied if they ’re for a project I ’m not focusing on .
I try to improve this situation by giving more people commit access so I do n’t become a bottleneck , but this is tricky .
I guess people do n’t feel like they ’re qualified , which is totally bogus .
I ’m certainly not “ qualified ” to maintain Swank Clojure .
I got into it because of my background in Emacs , but it turns out you really need to understand its Common Lisp background .
I have only a superficial understanding of the codebase .
I like to think of myself more as the “ steward ” of that code rather than the “ maintainer ” .
But I get the patches applied , fix a few bugs , and get the releases pushed out .
It ’s something you can ease your way into , so I encourage readers to help out with projects they ’re interested in .
Do n’t be intimidated .
Q : What is your relationship to Bus Scheme ?
Well , I used to work in downtown Seattle , so I spent a lot of time on the bus .
I got a copy of The Little Schemer and wanted to play around with the ideas in it , so I started Bus Scheme ( in Ruby ) with the stipulation that all implementation must happen while riding the bus .
I had a lot of fun with that .
It never got continuations or hygienic macros , but I had the basics of the interpreter working fine and put together a simple CL - style macro system .
I recommend it as an exercise to folks interested in the nuts and bolts of language implementation .
It ’s much less work than it sounds for a language as small as Scheme , and to people who have n’t done their own implementation ( potential employers perhaps ? ) it sounds really impressive .
I certainly learned a lot about parsing and lexical scope as well .
One of these days I ’ll move on to Unicycle Java , but I ’ve got enough on my plate right now .
Q : What ’s your favorite code snippet ?
( any language )
I really like Camping because it showcases the playful spirit of Hackerdom .
I think that spirit is one of the most important things I picked up while doing Ruby .
If you ca n’t have a little fun with your code and put your best practices away for a quick hack then is your heart really in it ?
I think even in more serious projects there ’s room for easter eggs if they do n’t get in the way .
$ apt - get moo ( __ ) ( oo ) /------\/ / | || * /\---/\ ~~ ~~ .... " Have you mooed today ? " ...
In Clojure I ’d have to say I like the implementation of fixtures in clojure .
test :
( defn compose - fixtures " Composes two fixture functions , creating a new fixture function that combines their behavior . " { : added " 1.1 " } [ f1 f2 ] ( fn [ g ] ( f1 ( fn [ ] ( f2 g ) ) ) ) ) ( defn join - fixtures " Composes a collection of fixtures , in order .
Always returns a valid fixture function , even if the collection is empty . " { : added " 1.1 " } [ fixtures ] ( reduce compose - fixtures default - fixture fixtures ) )
There ’s not a lot to it , but this lets you compose a chain of fixture functions that gives you an immense level of flexibility over what goes on in your tests .
This is one of my favourite hacks in that it succinctly demonstrates the power of “ everything is a function ” .
I used this as the basis for Robert Hooke , a more generalized plugin mechanism .
Q : What is your favorite fiction book ?
Well , Dante ’s Comedy is almost certainly the best fiction Christendom has produced , but I do n’t read Italian , so I ’m going to go with G.K. Chesterton ’s The Man who was Thursday .
Everything I ’ve read of Chesterton ’s is brilliant , but Thursday stands out for its portrayal of courage as well as the way it addresses the Problem of Evil .
Some books reward repeat readings with new insights into corners of the story that you may have missed the first time around .
Thursday takes it to a whole new level — the first four times I read it I came away thinking the whole point of the book was something I had n’t seen before .
It ’s mind - boggling that a novel can be so light on the one hand as an adventure story yet still contain so much philosophical depth .
I ’ll consider my programming career to be a success if I ever work on a project that ’s good enough to merit being named after Gabriel Syme , aka Thursday , the book ’s poet - detective protagonist .
The book in the public domain and is not very long , so give it a read .
I ’m currently in the middle of Steven Levy ’s Hackers , which is probably my favourite non-fiction book right now .
It ’s exciting to read about the level of energy and awe in the early days of computing .
Seeing what people had to go through to get access to even the most primitive of machines gives you a great sense of perspective and helps you appreciate what we have today .
Q : Can you provide a picture summarizing your view on working for Sonian ?
Sure .
We have a distributed team that communicates through the Internet , so it ’s basically like this :
Distributed work involves some really weighty trade - offs .
On the one hand you can hire from anywhere in the US , which is absolutely fantastic .
It has allowed us to get an excellent team together ; you could n’t get this concentration of talent in any one city .
But on the other hand you ’re missing something by not being able to see co-workers face - to - face .
We work around this by relying heavily on VoIP and tmux ( a more modern implementation of the ideas in GNU Screen ) while pairing and also by having quarterly in - person “ summit ” meetings where we all live out of the same house for a week and participate in intensive hack sprints .
It ’s definitely a net win , but it has its challenges .
Q : What does a typical work day look like ?
I get up at 6:30 with my kids ( 9 months and 2½ years ) and play for a while .
At 9:00 I head out to the Code Lab , a converted shed in the back yard for our daily VoIP standup .
I described my setup there in a recent blog post ; it involves a standing desk , a Thinkpad , and a recliner .
Being at home means I get to take lunch with my family , which is great even though the food selection is n’t quite what it was in downtown Seattle .
Lately the weather ’s been warming up , so sometimes I ’ll work from the back porch or a nearby coffee shop .
Every so often I ’ll head out to a nearby park just to get a change of scenery .
The abandoned US Air Force ( USAF ) base in Tachikawa is a bramble - choked memento from the early days of Japanese / American war and peace .
It was annexed by the USA shortly after World War II , in co-operation with the still - active nearby Japan Army ( SDF ) Base , then abandoned in the 1970 ’s as the Vietnam war came to a close .
Its three huge chimneys are still visible from the exterior , brick - red and lined up like masts on a rudderless ship , slowly sinking deeper into the smothering sea of green jungle .
Its airstrip now swims with weeds , and bamboo forests have grown through the foundations where buildings once stood , patrolled by old men on bicycles keeping a watchful eye on the 10 - foot perimeter fence .
Storage bunker , one of the few remaining structures on base .
As with the Fuchu Air Base , I ’ve been here before .
The first time was some two years ago , in the early days of my haikyo exploration .
I must have walked the perimeter circle 4 or 5 times , as dusk fell around me , wondering if I had the chutzpah to scale the fence .
At no point was it easy to climb , and at no point in an isolated spot .
It got dark , and I became antsy .
The guard in the guard box out front did n’t leave , except to occasionally drive carefully around the interior , or cycle around the fence .
In the end , I gave up .
It did n’t seem worth it , so I backed off .
Map of the whole base .
The central part is now the huge Showa Kinen Park , site of Tokyo`s only full disc golf course .
The left oblong , 1 km long , is the abandoned base .
The right oblong is the still - active SDF base .
The second time , around a year later , I arrived with my chutzpah turned on , knowing what to expect .
After circling the base to my desired sport , I just went at it .
Over a fence , and in .
After that , my memory ’s a series of frantic snapshots as I ran around looking for things to shoot .
It started to rain , reducing visibility , and that just amped me up further .
Roads criss - crossed in every direction , and I knew that the old security guard could use any of them .
I did n’t doubt I could out - run him if it came to a chase - but I did n’t want it to come to a chase .
And so even with the sense of real risk pretty absent , I still ran from cover to shelter like a hunted animal .
When taking shelter in buildings , I became acutely aware of my heart thumping , and more worried every second about stepping back out of my new - found safety , and into the open .
Exciting .
This massive bunker hosted me for around 30 minutes , as I planned my next line of attack -
It is pretty huge , covered in ivy , and built to withstand serious punishment .
The walls and doors are several feet thick .
Covered in ivy .
The central part of the bunker had probably once been an office , with desks , machinery controls , and grilled windows looking into the hangar - like storage area alongside .
The two doors left and right lead to the hangars .
Filing cabinets belie it was an office .
Empty storage shelves in the bunker ’s back room
The hangars either side were filled with old equipment .
The southern wing ( below ) had what looks like a lot of air conditioning equipment .
The northern wing had chairs and assorted engine parts .
In the back was a staircase , going up to the roof .
Of course I clambered over everything to get to it .
and up - affording me the best view of the remains of the base anyone ’s had in years .
Elevator and lift gear in storage .
Looking back towards the entrance , the stairs to be climbed .
Up the stairs .
At the top of the stairs was a small room , smashed in rot and weather , then more stairs , then the roof .
Signalman`s room ?
Rickety stair - case .
One of the hazards of haikyo- stairways whose rungs have fallen away .
I walked with great care .
On the roof the view was excellent , dominated by the forest , and the three chimneys .
Roof and chimneys .
Roof ruins .
After leaving that sanctuary , again I was on the run , bobbing in and out of the overgrown forest and through clumps of bamboo , head ducking in search of the old dude on his bicycle .
I heard there were immense apocalypse - emergency tunnels underneath the old base , perhaps some kind fall - out shelter for Tokyo ’s elite .
I saw a few hatch - like structures emerging above ground , which had no doors of any kind .
Could those be the air circulators , for such a massive complex ?
This from Wikipedia .
Consolidation resulted in the establishment of the Tachikawa Disaster - Preparedness Base , involving hundreds of miles of tunnels designed to support 5,000 top government members for a year in the event of a catacylsmic disaster .
The bunker building is one of only a few remaining structures on the large base lot .
I did n’t linger around them .
After a while I got pretty turned around inside .
Even seeing the three massive chimneys , that I ’d seen clearly from outside , did n’t really help orient me .
The guards had buckled a ladder into the chimney flues , so it is possible to climb up inside them .
I climbed up inside one , and again briefly relaxed .
What were these chimneys for , remnants of some kind of power plant , or a waste incinerator ?
Did they cremate bodies here ?
Inside the flue .
Looking out .
Looking at the inside of the base of the chimney .
Looking down at the base of the chimney .
Dreaming of the past .
After the towers , dusk was falling and I really thought I was pushing my luck to stay any longer .
I was n’t sure any more which way I ’d come or which way was out - all the straight grid streets of the base looked equally overgrown , and I ’d zig - zagged through so much bamboo I had no idea where my entry climbing fence had been .
I got out my iPhone and pulled up the map feature .
Then , working myself up into a lather , I started to run .
Which way was I going ?
Where was the exit ?
Watching the little screen with me inching down an overgrown road , peeking up to check I was n’t slaloming into some obstacle , I felt weirdly like a World of Warcraft character running to his next battle .
I ran in a straight line for a few minutes , until at last one of the easiest fences - also closest to the guard ’s box - emerged , and I plunged for it .
At last I hit it , vaulted over the top , and landed on the legal side , out of breath .
An old lady looked at me confusedly .
I nodded , and went on my way .
So it goes .
History
The Tachikawa base started life as an Imperial Japanese Army airfield , though that role later morphed to also cater to civilians by the 1920’s .
In 1929 Japan`s first regularly scheduled commercial air service departed from this base to Osaka , a three hour commute that was in operation for 4 years , until the service was moved to Haneda airport on Tokyo Bay .
After 1933 the base returned to being an Army airfield , and remained so until the end of World War II .
During the war it was defended by the Shintentai , an anti-aircraft kamikaze group .
Near the end of the war Tachikawa was subjected to heavy bombing , and in the aftermath was occupied by the US .
From Wikipedia– Disaster struck Tachikawa on June 18 , 1953 when a U.S. Air Force C - 124 Globemaster
II transport experienced an engine failure on takeoff , crashing shortly after .
The accident claimed the lives of 129 people , and was the deadliest air disaster in history at the time .
With a runway only 1,500 m long , Tachikawa was not adequate for the largest aircraft , and the U.S. decided to extend the runway into the neighboring town of Sunagawa .
The July 8 , 1957 Sunagawa Riots resulted in cancellation of the plan .
The U.S. instead developed Tama Airfield ( the present - day Yokota Air Base ) and moved its operations there .
By 1969 , the U.S. had largely left Tachikawa , and in 1977 , after the end of the Vietnam War , it returned the base to Japanese control .
The Japanese government put the land to a variety of uses .
The Japan Ground Self - Defense Force established a base there , as did the Japan Coast Guard , the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo Fire Department .

Paul , the Republican nominee , has been paid $ 130,461 in Medicaid funds since 2006 , about one - third of the sum that he billed the program , according to the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services , which administers that program .
Doctors ' Medicaid billings often are disputed in part , leading to smaller payments than they requested .
... On the campaign trail , Paul calls for the abolition of entire agencies , such as the U.S. Department of Education , while complaining that Medicare payments to doctors have been cut too deeply , making it one of the few government expenses he consistently defends .
" Physicians should be allowed to make a comfortable living , " Paul told supporters in Louisville in May , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Paul 's campaign chairman , David Adams , said the candidate 's political and personal stances are not inconsistent .
Paul is sincerely critical of government spending , but being an eye surgeon essentially requires him to accept Medicare and Medicaid patients , Adams said .
" If you look at it from a medical perspective , who gets their eyes operated on ?
Usually , it 's older people , " Adams said .
" And in this country , you do n't have much choice after you turn 65 .
You 're usually on Medicare .
So I do n't know how you avoid Medicare . "
By contrast , Paul 's father , U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , also is a doctor who criticizes deficit spending .
But Ron Paul refuses to take Medicare and Medicaid funds , calling it " stolen money . "
Under federal rules , doctors can opt out of the programs , which serve the elderly and the poor , respectively .
Republican Rand Paul said Tuesday he differs with the Libertarian Party by opposing abortion and supporting judicious overseas troop deployment , distancing himself from the party his father once represented in a presidential election .
The U.S. Senate candidate from Kentucky told syndicated conservative talk show host Sean Hannity that he does n't fit the mold of a Libertarian .
Paul said his conservative social views and willingness to send troops abroad to protect the U.S. set him apart from the party some have tried to associate him with .
" Instead of maybe saying we 're never anywhere overseas , I say we need to be more judicious in where we are , in that I do n't think we can afford to be everywhere all the time , " Paul said .
" But it also does n't mean that we never intervene and that we can allow people to attack us . "
Paul , who practices in Bowling Green , says he is certified by the National Board of Ophthalmology , a group that he incorporated in 1999 and that he heads .
But that entity is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties , which works with the American Medical Association to approve such specialty boards ...
" He 's not board - certified , " [ a spokesperson for the American Board of Medical Specialties ] said of Paul .
click to enlarge and learn more about Rand Paul 's character
Rand Paul wants to cut government spending for education , farmers , children 's health programs and for just about every other program you can think of , but not for physicians .
As the Lexingtonpointed out today , he " built his medical practice on payments from Medicare and Medicaid , the massive government health care programs considered to be leading contributors to the national debt ... and roughly half of his medical income comes from the two programs .
" Rand and his pop seem to be at odds over several things .
Remember when he opposed Insiders and corporatists ?
Just kidding , everybody !
And although Rand apologists claim he 'll join his father in opposing foreign wars , he certainly is n't campaigning on that platform -- to put it mildly .
He told Sean Hannity that he would have certainly voted to attack Afghanistan , although he did n't talk about the attack on Iraq one way or the other .
And I 've also heard a couple of peeps and squawks from his devotees and followers that he 's for legalizing pot .
Maybe they 're channeling it ' cause he sure is n't campaigning on that issue .
He 's even given up on his crazy war against the imaginary Amero , an alternative currency he used to use to frighten the black helicopter crowd with .
In fact , he 's been busy distancing himself from both the teababggers who got him the GOP nomination ( and a reputation as a kook ) and from libertarianism itself -- and scrubbing his website to reflect his " evolving " set of " beliefs .
" Another way he 's different from Paul , Sr. is that the Texas congressman is licensed to practice medicine .
Rand ... not so much .
Hidden behind an online " subscribers ' only " wall , the Sundayboasts an exclusive story about Rand Paul 's medical accreditation -- or lack thereof .
Paul , Jr. has made a point of claiming to be a " board - certified " ophthalmologist but the " national clearinghouse for such certifications says he has n't been for the past five years .
" He used to be -- lied outright during the campaign and claimed he still is , in fact -- but then he started his own bogus board and now he 's refusing to comment on the whole thing .
In fact he told the state 's biggest newspaper that he will " never " comment on it and that it has nothing to do with the election .
Well , even apart from the character issue -- I mean who wants another liar in the Senate , let alone operating on your eyes ?-- it so happens that Paul , who 's been sued for malpractice a couple of times ( paying off one ex-patient $ 50,000 to get him to go away ) and that the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure has never sanctioned him !
So why did he start his new bogus board in 1999 ( and again in 2005 since it had lapsed in 2000 and he was about to lose his accreditation to practice at all that year ) , the one he owns and claims to be president of but that is n't recognized by anyone , anywhere as anything but another of his kooky delusions ?
( His wife is the vice - president of the thing but she wo n't comment either . )
Paul objected to the requirement that doctors be re-certified every decade proving that they 're keeping up with developments in their field .
Paul is no longer a certified ophthalmologist but continues to claim he is -- and , worse , continues to operate on patients .
At least this campaign thing is keeping him from doing that anymore !

An unscrupulous journalist and a pair of Danish comedians travel to North Korea with a mission to use humour to uncover the truth behind one of the world 's most notorious regimes .
A journalist with no scruples and a pair of Danish comedians travel to North Korea with a mission to use humour to uncover the truth behind one of the world 's most notorious regimes
On the pretext of being a small Danish theatre troupe on a cultural exchange , the filmmaker was granted permission by the North Korean government to stage a performance for a select audience in the capital .
In reality , the troupe was comprised of an unscrupulous journalist , Mads Brugger , and two Danish / Korean comedians , Jacob and Simon , of whom the former is handicapped .
Their goal is to use humour to expose the intricate effects of an oppressive regime .
The film follows the troupe as they are lovingly yet firmly escorted by a motherly government employee around the important historical sights , and as they ' collaborate ' with other government officials on their performance .
Their double life is wearing on Jacob who feels conflicting emotions of affection and hatred for his hosts .
With a sensibility similar to that of Lars Von Trier 's controversial film The Idiots , this documentary takes a darkly humorous look inside the North Korean dictatorship .
North Korea 's 23 million citizens are ruled by the iron hand of ' The Dear Leader ' , General Kim Jong -il .
The country has a history of starving its people , violating human rights and abusing and killing its handicapped citizens .
WASHINGTON -- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) today began reimbursing physicians 21 % less for treating Medicare patients after Congress failed to block the cut .
The lower reimbursement rate technically went into effect on June 1 , but CMS had announced that it would not process claims for medical services delivered after the deadline , giving Congress additional time to block the 21 % cut .
This most recent grace period -- CMS has issued four such reprieves this year -- expired on June 17 .
It takes 14 days to pay electronic claims , so in a few weeks , doctors will see reimbursements that are 21 % lower than they would normally receive , unless Congress takes action or CMS grants yet another extension .
" It is , frankly , inconceivable that Medicare is beginning to reimburse doctors at a 21 % cut over their already below - cost payment level , " the Alliance for Speciality Medicine said in a statement .
The group will be coming to Washington next week to discuss fixing the Medicare payment system .
The cut is mandated by the sustainable growth rate ( SGR ) formula , which links physician reimbursement rates to increases in the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Because spending on physician services has outpaced increases in the GDP , the formula has called for cuts in reimbursements each year over most of the past decade , and Congress has always voted to push those cuts down the road , granting small rate increases instead .
If Congress does pass a retroactive SGR fix , CMS will need to reprocess the claims it paid at the 21 % lower rate .
Neil Brooks , MD , a family physicians in Vernon Rockville , Conn. , said in an e-mail to MedPage Today and ABC News that he is disgusted by " a Congress that is so dysfunctional that it cannot make a rational decision .
I do n't fear the rate cut , " he said .
" I fear the consequences of the refusal to make a decision .
If this is happening now , just imagine what is going to happen when healthcare reform is implemented . "
John Messmer , MD , associate professor of Family and Community Medicine at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey , Pa. , expressed similar sentiments .
" There is no other way to describe Congress ' actions other than stupid and incompetent , " Messmer said in an e-mail .
No Will to Fix the Formula
Although members of Congress universally acknowledge that the SGR is a flawed formula and should be retooled , political will to totally overhaul the formula has been lacking .
And this year , short - term fixes have also been subject to major push - back .
In the current effort to delay the 21 % cut for six months , Republicans -- and a number of fiscally conservative Democrats -- are refusing to support the bill because it 's not paid for .
Democratic senators have been trying for a month to stall the 21 % cut by attempting to pass the so - called " doc fix " as part of a larger bill that would extend a number of expired federal programs and create a summer jobs program , among other things .
The doc fix portion has seen a number of iterations over the past month -- at times promising to stave off the cut for three years , then 19 - months , and now just six months .
But even the smaller and less expensive bill is not gaining the support of Republicans and some fiscally conservative Democrats .
A vote to limit debate on the measure failed to win the necessary 60 votes Thursday night .
That vote was considered a test of how many senators supported the bill , and Democrats found themselves four votes short .
Randy Wexler , MD , MPH , assistant professor of Clinical Family Medicine at Ohio State University in Columbus , said he 's frustrated with the " we all agree it is flawed but do not have the money to fix it " argument from Congress .
" It is not a new problem , and many other things have been funded in the interim , " he said in an e-mail .
" It would seem that there is always money to fund other things but not this . "
As more time passes without a repeal of the SGR , the cost to fix the problem just keeps growing , said Stuart Guterman , an economist at the Commonwealth Fund .
In 2009 , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a 10 - year pay freeze ( not a total fix to the SGR ) for physicians who treat Medicare patients would cost $ 318 billion .
But a bill that expensive is politically difficult , he noted , so instead Congress breaks it into chunks and passes temporary pay freezes or slight increases instead .
" The thing is , the extra spending happens , whether it's one year at a time or in 10 - year chunks , " Guterman said .
Fallout Expected to Hit Seniors
The American Medical Association ( AMA ) has lobbied Congress to pass a permanent overhaul to the SGR for years .
At its recent House of Delegates meeting in Chicago , AMA members signed white coats with messages pleading for an SGR fix and shipped them to Washington .
" Continued short - term actions are creating severe instability that harms seniors as physicians make decisions to protect their practices from Medicare 's volatility , " said AMA president Cecil Wilson , MD .
One of those decisions that physicians must make is whether to continue to accept Medicare patients .
Doctors have long threatened to stop seeing them if severe reductions in reimbursement go into effect .
Large group practices may be able to weather the cut in pay , but small group practices and solo physicians -- particularly those in primary care and in rural areas -- will have a tough time , Messmer said .
" It would be particularly difficult for some primary care practices which are already struggling and in some cases could push those doctors toward having to close the practice , " said J. Fred Ralston Jr. , MD , president of the American College of Physicians .
Isabel V. Hoverman , MD , an internist , has stopped accepting new Medicare patients at her Austin , Texas , practice , where about 30 % of her patients are on Medicare .
" We will have no option but to start asking our Medicare patients to find a new primary care physician which already is extremely difficult for patients to find , she wrote in an e-mail .
" I can think of no other professional group that has its pay treated in such a cavalier manner . "
If physicians stop treating their current Medicare patients , the situation will only get worse because it will be difficult for them to find a new doctor , said Peter Galier , MD , associate professor of medicine at UCLA .
Galier said he 'll keep seeing his own Medicare patients " as long as possible . "

Publisher 's summary
Sawyer reading the manuscript of Bad Twin .
" Sometimes evil has a familiar face ... "
Paul Artisan , P.I. is a new version of an old breed -- a righter of wrongs , someone driven to get to the bottom of things .
Too bad his usual cases are of the boring malpractice and fraud variety .
Until now .
His new gig turns on the disappearance of one of a pair of twins , adult scions of a rich but tragedy - prone family .
The missing twin -- a charismatic poster - boy for irresponsibility -- has spent his life daring people to hate him , punishing himself endlessly for his screw - ups and misdeeds .
The other twin -- Artisan 's client -- is dutiful and resentful in equal measure , bewildered that his " other half " could have turned out so badly , and wracked by guilt at his inability to reform him .
He has a more practical reason , as well , for wanting his brother found : their crazy father , in failing health and with guilty secrets of his own , will not divide the family fortune until both siblings are accounted for .
But it is n't just a fortune that 's at stake here .
Truth itself is up for grabs , as the detective 's discoveries seem to challenge everything we think we know about identity , and human nature , and family .

The P.I. may have his long - awaited chance to put his courage and ideals to the test , but if he does n't get to the bottom of this case soon , it could very well cost him his life .
" Troup 's long - awaited Bad Twin is a suspenseful novel that touches on many powerful themes , including the consequence of vengeance , the power of redemption , and where to turn when all seems lost . "
Detailed synopsis
Paul Artisan is a small - time NYC private investigator who is not confident if he has the talent and dedication to expand his professional aspirations beyond their current scope .
He gets a surprise visit one day from a well - dressed and aloof man he learns is Clifford Widmore , one of the heirs of the wealthy and influential Widmore dynasty .
His twin brother ( Alexander , nicknamed " Zander " ) has gone missing , and Cliff wishes to hire Paul to find him .
Zander is known for his passionate , maverick style , which at times brings him in contact with shady dealings , and everyone who knew him seems to believe this is what got him in trouble .
Though they are identical twins , they are as different as night and day , with Clifford known as the more straight - laced , responsible , and cold one .
He is also the CEO of Widmore Corp. , which his father , Arthur - - an eccentric and opinionated ( but benevolent ) elderly man --heads .
With such a high - profile potential client on the line , Paul begins to doubt himself and goes to his older best friend and mentor , Manny Weissman , for advice .
Manny is a philosophical intellectual , who frequently quotes literature and advises through metaphorical stories , while taking walks with Paul and Argos ( the dog that the two of them " share " ) .
Paul chases leads about Zander all over the world , from Cape Cod , to Key West , to Cuba , to Luna Valley ( Cal. ) , to the coast of Australia .
Along the way , he meets colorful characters , such as Zander 's pot-smoking friend " Moth " , a yoga instructor Zander was once involved with named Sky , a crusty boat captain named " Crunch " , Clifford 's pill - popping wife Shannon ( who also apparently loved Zander ) , and Elio , the founder of a cult - like nudist colony called the Helios Foundation .
Many give Paul hints on where to chase Zander 's trail next , but some are either killed or threatened with death along the way .
While flying to Australia via Oceanic Airlines , he sits next to a woman named " Pru " ( short for Prudence ) , and they instantly hit it off .
Paul and Pru end up having a fling once they get to the hotel , but upon wakening , Paul sees that she has a gun in her purse , and confronts her with her lies .
Pru then admits that she is also a P.I. for a large firm called Intercontinental , and that she was once hired to tail Vivian Widmore , the nymphomaniac , ambitious younger wife of the family patriarch ( she had even tried to seduce Paul on their first meeting ) .
Vivian was suspected of having an affair with a man nicknamed " Mr. Thursday " .
Pru relates that she was then hired to follow Paul and make sure he did n't come too close to finding Zander .
Paul then realizes he was set up by Clifford for failure , and hired simply because they had profiled him as someone who did n't have the gumption and commitment to succeed in his mission .
This angers and focuses Paul on the task of proving himself .
He and Pru agree to work together to find out the truth .
Lizard Island , Great Barrier Reef , Australia .
They follow Zander 's trail to Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef , where they learn Zander was pursuing a start - up business in black pearl farming when he was last heard from .
They masquerade as a honeymooning couple looking for real estate , and find Zander himself under the alias " Cameron Purdue " .
When they go out on his boat together , all three barely escape being killed by assassins .
Paul and Pru then reveal themselves to Zander , and tell him his life is in danger .
They convince Zander to fly back to NYC with them .
When they arrive back in the States , they learn Clifford has been recently killed during a ' robbery ' .
Zander is reunited with his aging father , and they go to Clifford 's funeral .
At the funeral , a car comes out of nowhere and starts shooting everyone .
Paul and Pru return fire and kill the shooter , who turns out to be Vivian 's first husband , a mafia boss named Monty Alban .
He was Mr. Thursday , the man Pru was sent to uncover .
He and Vivian had planned to kill off the Widmores one by one to get at their money .
It turns out that Zander was not such a " bad twin " after all , just misunderstood .
Manny suspected the elder Widmore had been planning to leave all his money to him ( as the eldest born twin , by a matter of minutes ) , according to Scottish tradition .
Manny was wrong , and the inheritance was to be split with the exception of a small portion going to Vivian .
However , Zander had planned to invest his money in the pearl farm with the profits going to the indigenous Australians who ran it and donate the rest of his inheritance to a Cuban medical relief aid .
By liquidating his stock in the family company , Zander would have left the Widmore family with not enough control of their company , and Cliff would have lost his position as CEO .
This had made him a target for his Cliff .
In the end , Vivian goes to jail for her plotting , and Paul and Pru end up together .

“ As with every island , there was something slippery and mysterious about Peconiquot .
It was connected to the larger world , but then again it was n't .
It had a logic of its own , a highly local mythology that made perfect sense within its confines yet fitted uneasily with the mind - habits of the world beyond its boundaries ... being an island , and a small one at that , it was also a place where people were easy to find . ”
A conversation on the plane back :
“ Zander :
There are certain things I believe in – like Good and Evil … the hard part is , you do n’t only choose just once … most of us have to keep choosing , day in , day out .
Year in , year out .
Good or bad , which way am I going to go …
Paul :
That ’s the idea of purgatory , right ?
Zander :
What if there is no purgatory …
What if there is no heaven ?
No hell either ?
No afterlife at all …
This is our chance to get it right .
First chance , last chance , only chance .
But that ’s exciting , beautiful , right ?…
Our work in this life is to choose good over evil .
To be fair .
To be kind .
And there is a payoff , though it does n’t have to do with harps and wings .
The payoff is peace of mind .
That ’s what redemption really is . ”

When Sawyer tried to postpone Jack 's demand for the stolen guns ( " Cool your damn jets and walk around the coconut trees ; I 've got , like , 10 pages left " ) , Jack burned the pages that would have revealed the ending ( " Two for the Road " ) .
Jack had no way of knowing whether the manuscript had been published or whether its author had been killed .
Apparent anachronism
The note from the editors indicated that the author was lost when Oceanic Flight 815 crashed in September 2004 .
However , page 204 of the book details the main character learning of the cessation of Scottish feudalism on 28 November 2004 ( the factual , real - world date ) .
This is however only an apparent anachronism , since the " appointed day " for the end of feudalism had been set well in advance , in 2002 ( see page 2 of linked PDF ) .

Newspaper Advert placed by the Hanso Foundation
“ A MESSAGE FROM HUGH MCINTYRE , DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AT THE HANSO FOUNDATION Don't Believe " Bad Twin "
For over thirty years , the Hanso Foundation has stood for compassion and innovation , but today , our reputation has been attacked in the novel " Bad Twin " , written by Gary Troup and published by Hyperion books .
Throughout the pages of " Bad Twin " , readers have found numerous passages featuring misinformation about the Hanso Foundation and its partners .
The Hanso Foundation strongly objects to the book " Bad Twin " , and encourages readers to make up their own minds .
The truth about the Hanso Foundation is available at www.TheHansoFoundation.org and not on the pages of Gary Troup 's " Bad Twin " .
Experience it for yourself .
Thank you , and namaste .

A letter later linked during the Lost Experience also implied that the Hanso Foundation were planning to sue Hyperion books for printing the novel .
The letter can be viewed here .
Coded correspondence
During the DJ Dan live broadcasts , Malik phoned in , leaving a coded message for protagonist Rachel Blake .
He quoted a series of numbers , which turned out to be page numbers from the Bad Twin novel .
For each number , the first letter on the page replaced the digits , creating the message " I know where he is , I can set it up ! "
There is some apparent friction between the Lost writers / producers and Shames ( either due to inconsistent inclusion of the plot as spin - off canon or writing style ) , as evidenced by comments made to Variety :
“ Insiders say writers on " Lost " were asked to provide a list of elements that Shames could incorporate into the novel .
But the author had his own vision and wound up including only a few of the elements . ”
“ Show staffers also were frustrated that the book referenced copyrighted elements for which the publisher had not sought clearances , saying it would make it difficult to use those elements on - air . ”
Additionally , the writers make occasional cracks about the novel , such as in this from the 10/30/06 podcast :
“ Carlton Cuse : OK .
So that was a very candid answer to number one , there 's just two more .
" Was the turbine man from the Pilot Gary Troup , author of Bad Twin ? " Damon Lindelof : Yes .
Carlton Cuse :
It was indeed .
Damon Lindelof :
And considering that I have now read Bad Twin , [ Laughs ] Gary Troup got exactly what he deserved .
[ Carlton laughs ]
Next ! ”
Finally , Carlton Cuse stated that the novel " had not met their bar " at the Lost panel during the Promax|BDA 2007 conference . [ 1 ]

Greek Parliament approves deep social cuts in face of mass opposition
Stock markets fall sharply on fears of unrest
By Joe Kishore and Alex Lantier
7 May 2010
The Greek Parliament voted to approve € 30 billion in cuts to jobs , wages , pensions , and social spending Thursday , the day after a general strike against the measures .
The cuts were agreed to by Prime Minister George Papandreou as part of a loan package from European governments and the International Monetary Fund .
Mass opposition to the measures panicked stock markets , expressing growing concern in ruling circles that global social unrest will disrupt plans to make the working class pay for government deficits .
Markets fell sharply in Asia , Europe , and the United States .
At one point on Thursday afternoon , US markets were in free fall , down almost 9 percent before finishing down 3.2 percent .
The mid-day fall was the largest since December 2008 , and revealed a level of market volatility not seen since February 2007 .
There were also reports that European banks are beginning to freeze interbank lending , as during the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis , for fear that banks holding Greek debt might go bankrupt .
The precipitous fall in US markets was later blamed on computer selling .
Regardless , the dominant sentiment on Wall Street was concern over the credit crisis in Greece .
Traders reportedly started selling after seeing television reports of clashes outside the Greek Parliament .
Several commentators warned of a possible sell - off on Friday .
There is overwhelming popular opposition in Greece to the austerity program , which includes deep cuts in pay and benefits for government workers , easing restrictions on mass firings , the elimination of the minimum wage , cuts in public education funding , the privatization of government services , and a sharp increase in the VAT tax .
Polls show that 61 percent of the population opposes the bailout and cuts .
In remarks before Parliament , Papandreou repeated his insistence that the cuts were necessary as part of a fundamental restructuring of the Greek economy .
“ The emergency measures are the condition for us to regain our credibility and win time , lost time , the time to make the big changes that were delayed for years , ” he declared .
The final vote in Parliament was 172 - 121 in favor of the bill .
Papandreou expelled three deputies of his own PASOK social - democratic party from the parliamentary majority group for abstaining in the vote .
The conservative New Democracy ( ND ) party , the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) , and the SYRIZA coalition voted against the bill .
The ADEDY public sector and GSEE private sector trade unions called a rally in front of the Greek Parliament yesterday evening .
Tens of thousands of protestors marched through the streets of Athens after the vote in protest , chanting , “ They declared war .
Now fight back . ”
The unions are calling protests in an attempt to control the workers , even though they themselves support the principle of carrying out cuts to balance Greece ’s books .
The unions met with Papandreou to discuss the cuts as the prime minister negotiated them with European governments and the IMF .
The union leadership consists largely of PASOK members .
Details continue to emerge of events during Wednesday ’s general strike .
There were reports that soldiers joined in the protests , after a number of air force pilots recently called in sick to protest .
On Tuesday , teachers forced their way into a state television ’s broadcast station as it was interviewing education officials , refusing to leave until they were allowed to read out a statement to the public on national television .
Before being escorted out of the building by police clad in riot gear , the teachers denounced plans to sack 17,000 part - time staff .
Media coverage has focused on the tragic death of three workers in the firebombing of the Marfin Egnatia Bank in Athens Wednesday .
The hooded attackers have yet to be identified .
Government officials have blamed the attack on protestors .
However , one cannot rule out a police provocation , which has a long tradition in Greece .
The Papandreou government responded to the deaths by pledging to continue the offensive for austerity measures .
Media commentators hoped that the tragedy could be used to demoralize working - class opposition and push through the cuts .
The New York Times explained : " Many observers here [ in Athens ] said that the violence probably would embolden the government not to back down , while spawning a backlash among Greeks against a growing number of extremists ” who were protesting state policies .
Bank workers , however , denounced the banks for preventing workers from participating in the strike .
Athens Indymedia posted a letter , signed “ An employee of Marfin Bank , ” which bitterly criticized the bank and its owner , Mr. Vgenopoulos , for neglecting fire and security arrangements , and forcing workers to work despite the strike .
It continued , “ For many days now there has been complete terrorization of the bank ’s employees in regard to the mobilizations of these days , with the verbal ‘ offer ’ : you either work , or you get fired . …
The two undercover police who are dispatched at the branch in question for robbery prevention did not show up today , even though the bank ’s management had verbally promised to the employees that they would be there . ”
The protests come amid further signs that the Greek government is collaborating with international financial institutions to impose the crisis on the backs of the working class .
Karel de Gucht , the European Commissioner for Commence , told El País .
“ We knew that Greece was tricking us .
One could already see when they entered the euro that there were problems ” with Greek debt and deficit figures .
He noted that the European Commission had tried to investigate Greek figures in 2003 - 2004 , but that other EU states had opposed this ; at the time , Germany and France were also running deficits in violation of Maastricht treaty criteria .
This is particularly significant because Papandreou — in deciding last autumn to abandon his election promises of increasing social spending — claimed that he had not known that Greece was in a desperate fiscal situation .
In fact , the ruling class in Greece and Europe hoped to use Papandreou ’s election to create a political atmosphere in which the cuts could pass .
Papandreou could use PASOK ’s connections with both the trade unions and the middle class parties such as SYRIZA to demobilize opposition .
Praising the massive austerity plan recently agreed to by Papandreou as “ very credible , ” De Gucht continued , “ The population would not have accepted it before .
One had to be careful not to provoke a revolution . ”
Such comments cannot hide a growing atmosphere of panic on financial markets , which fear that financial collapse and popular protest could rapidly spread throughout Europe and the world .
The Financial Times commented , “ Riots in Athens have illustrated how the severe austerity measures … have implications not just for economic growth but also for social cohesion . ”
Economists have also expressed concern that the budget cuts will lead to an unprecedented collapse in the Greek economy , which could be replicated throughout Europe .
The New York Times cited calculations of economist Daniel Gros : “ For each 1 percent of GDP decline in Greek government spending , total demand in the country falls by 2.5 percent of GDP . ”
This suggests that if Athens cuts state spending by 10 to 15 percent of GDP as planned , the economy would fall by roughly 30 percent .
There are also further signs of “ contagion ” to other countries .
On Thursday , Moody ’s Investor Service warned that the banking systems of Portugal , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the UK are “ increasingly moving into the focus of the markets . ”
“ The market is implying that the financial system is backed by the sovereigns , ” i.e. , governments , noted BNP analyst Rajeev Shah .
“ A lot of the risk has moved from the financial system to the sovereigns , but if the contagion keeps spreading it effectively moves back to the financial system . ”
In other words , the bailout of the financial system by states has temporarily stabilized the position of the banks , while guaranteeing the wealth of the financial elite .
However , this has not resolved the crisis that erupted in 2008 , but merely transferred it into a growing crisis over state debt .
The sovereign debt crisis and the demand that the working class pay for this debt through an unprecedented attack on living standards is creating the conditions for social revolution and renewed economic and financial collapse .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama named retired general James Clapper as his new director of national intelligence on Saturday , selecting a defense veteran to coordinate action between numerous U.S. intelligence agencies .

Obama , who announced the appointment at the White House , urged the Senate to confirm Clapper swiftly , a nod to resistance from some Democratic and Republican lawmakers who are worried about Clapper ’s close ties to the Pentagon .
Clapper , now undersecretary of defense for intelligence , would replace Dennis Blair , who was ousted last month amid mounting security concerns following a failed car bomb attempt in New York ’s Times Square on May 1 and the botched attempt to blow up a Detroit - bound U.S. airliner on Christmas Day .
The director of national intelligence oversees the agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community , including the CIA .
“ Our intelligence community needs to work as one integrated team that produces quality , timely and accurate intelligence .
And let ’s be honest : this is a tough task , ” Obama said .
“ But this will be Jim ’s core mission .
He is eminently qualified , and he has my complete confidence and support . ”
Clapper is a former Air Force general who retired from the military in 1995 after a 32 - year career .
He worked for Defense Secretary Robert Gates during the George W. Bush administration and remained at the Pentagon after Obama took office in 2009 .
The post Clapper is taking over was created by Bush in 2004 in a reorganization of the intelligence bureaucracy to address shortcomings in interagency collaboration exposed by the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Obama said U.S. intelligence had improved since 2001 but more needed to be done .
“ As we saw in the failed attack over Detroit , we need to do even better .
We need to constantly evolve and adapt and improve , ” he said .
OPPOSITION
Clapper ’s background has rattled rather than reassured some of the lawmakers whose support he will need for confirmation .
Republican Senator Kit Bond , vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said on Friday , ahead of the official announcement , that he was not inclined to support Clapper , who Bond said had blocked efforts to empower the position he is now being asked to fill .
Representative Pete Hoekstra , the top Republican on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , said Obama ’s nomination put “ yet another brick in the wall ” between Congress and the administration on national security .
“ Mr. Clapper has blocked my communications with elements of the intelligence community , and he has been evasive and slow to respond to questions and letters from members of the committee , ” Hoekstra said in a statement on Saturday .
“ It is unacceptable and makes America less safe . ”
Obama said he expected Clapper to be confirmed soon .
“ Not surprisingly , the Senate has voted to confirm Jim for senior positions on four separate occasions , and each time it has done so overwhelmingly , ” Obama said .
“ Given the importance of this position , the urgent threats to our nation and Jim ’s unique experience , I urge the Senate to do so again and as swiftly as possible . ”
Clapper said he would work for Obama ’s and lawmakers ’ support .
“ I am humbled , honored and daunted by the magnitude of the responsibilities of the position of the DNI , ” he said on Saturday , speaking after the president in the White House Rose Garden .
“ It ’s a job that can not be done without your support and that of the Congress , and I intend to earn that support from both . ”
Vandals Strike Godless Billy Graham Pkwy Billboard
Click HERE for a hi res image .
For Immediate Release ( North Carolina , June 28 , 2010 )
Over this past weekend , one or more vandals defaced with spray paint part of the " One Nation Indivisible " billboard on the Billy Graham Parkway .
The words " under God " were added below " One Nation Indivisible " with an arrow indicating their placement between " One Nation " and " Indivisible . "
The billboard had first appeared Monday , June 21 , and is near the Boyer intersection .
" This act shows just how needed our message is , " declared Joseph McDaniel Stewart , founder of the North Carolina Secular Association ( NCSecular.org ) , sponsor of the statewide campaign .
" Inserting ' under God ' on our billboard is like inserting it into the original pledge in 1954 : it divides us as a nation .
Our sign does n't say ' One nation under no God ' ; it is inclusive .
It says ' One Nation Indivisible . '
All we are asking for is a level playing field and the same consideration that any other citizen would expect for themselves .
We think everyone should do unto others as they would have others do unto them .
But some people seem to have missed that part of our message . "
The police were notified on Sunday and an effort is underway to review security video recordings from the nearby gas station .
Will Warren , spokesperson for the Charlotte Atheists and Agnostics , the local ad sponsor , added , " We intend to restore this sign just like we are attempting to restore the original words to the Pledge of Allegiance .
We 've asked the billboard company to repair or replace the billboard this week . "
Warren continued : " In our view , this as an isolated act by one or more misguided individuals that is n't representative of the larger religious community in Charlotte .
We 've received a lot of positive responses overall and have welcomed 58 new members to our group in the past week , many of them glad to find out they are n't alone . "

It was just a few weeks ago that we were noting that Mike Heath , formerly of the Maine Family Policy Council , had suddenly reappeared on the scene as the head of the American Family Association ’s affiliate in Maine .
During the fight over marriage in Maine , Heath had repeatedly embarrassed the right - wing effort by claiming that gay marriage leads to things like graffiti , vandalism , and crop failure and eventually found himself cast aside by the movement entirely .
As a result , he resigned his position as the head of the Maine Family Policy Council , announcing that it was time for him to do something else with his life and declaring that he was going to get involved in the manufacture and distribution of solar cookers in Africa .
Then he disappeared for several month , only to reemerge in March , leading the state ’s AFA affiliate .
And now , via Pam ’s House Blend , we see that Heath has even bigger plans :
Michael Heath , former executive director of the Christian Civic League of Maine , has registered with the state ethics commission as a gubernatorial candidate .
Heath , a resident of China , is listed as an unenrolled candidate , which means he has until June 1 to get at least 4,000 signatures to qualify for the November ballot .
Heath recently announced the formation of a group called the American Family Association of Maine .
At the time , he said he was “ re-entering public life to continue the fight against the gay - rights lobby . ”
Heath spent 15 years working for the Christian Civic League , and became its executive director in 1994 .
He twice led people ’s veto efforts to overturn gay - rights laws .
Heath was not a visible part of last year ’s fight over same - sex marriage , which ended with voters repealing a state law legalizing it .
He announced his resignation in September from the civic league , which is now called the Maine Family Policy Council .
There are now 24 people running for governor .
Of those , 12 are Democrats or Republicans who will compete in the June 8 primary for the right to represent their parties on the November ballot .
For the other 12 , June 1 is the deadline to determine who among them will qualify to compete in November .
AIRLINE staff amazingly failed to spot a snoozing passenger for more than three hours after a flight touched down at Philadelphia International Airport .
Ginger McGuire was fast asleep as her red-eye United Airways Express flight from Washington DC came in to land in yesterday , KYW reported .
But while her fellow passengers left the plane , staff reportedly failed to notice Ms McGuire still sleeping in her seat after it landed at 12.27 am local time .
She was finally roused by a cleaner at 3.50 am as the aircraft sat on the tarmac .
" I can't believe on a 50 - passenger plane that nobody would wake someone up like that , " Trevor Hirz , a fellow traveller , said .
" We are working closely with our partner Trans States to investigate the cause and remedy the situation with the customer , " a spokesperson for United Airlines said .
Trans States Airlines , which operates United Express flights , said it was standard protocol to make sure all passengers were safely off the plane at the end of every flight .
The gaffe remained under investigation today .

Two people were killed and one wounded Thursday in two separate robbery attempts at Los Angeles medical marijuana clinics .
An employee was slain Thursday night about 9:15 p.m. at the Hollywood Holistic store in the 1600 block of North El Centro Avenue , the Los Angeles Police Department said .
Earlier in the day , a worker at a medical marijuana dispensary in Echo Park was killed and another was wounded in an apparent robbery , police said .
In that incident , shots were fired after an unknown number of suspects stormed into the Higher Patch Holistic Care store at 1302 Sunset Blvd.
shortly before 4:15 p.m. , the Los Angeles Police Department said .
The shootings come as Los Angeles officials attempt to regulate hundreds of marijuana stores that have popped up amid California ’s dispensary boom .

Los Angeles became an epicenter of dispensary activity after the Obama administration announced in March 2009 that it would not prosecute medical marijuana stores that adhered to state law that allows selling and using medical marijuana in certain instances .
Although the city had a moratorium on new dispensaries , officials failed to enforce the ban .
In March , LAPD detectives served search warrants at East Hollywood and Mid-Wilshire clinics and arrested three people .
And in September , police arrested a suspect in connection with several robberies at marijuana dispensaries in the San Fernando Valley .
In the Echo Park shooting , LAPD Officer Rosario Herrera said investigators “ believe it ’s a robbery ” that led to the violence but had not determined what was taken .
The suspects fled and had not been apprehended as of Thursday night .

" ' Luddite ' at Computer Mag ' Network World ' Decries E- Voting in SC , Calls for Paper , Pencil Elections "

COMMENT # 1 [ Permalink ]
... Andreas Antonopoulos said on 6/16/2010 @ 1:10 pm PT ...
Brad ,
Thanks for your comments on my article .
The issue of unverifiable election machines is close to my heart , and to yours it seems .
Anyone calling those who expect their votes to be verified " Luddites " is missing the big picture .
The issue here is not ( just ) technology , but the rules and process wrapped around it .
Those criticizing the current generation of electronic voting machines ( like myself ) do so because of ample scientific evidence that both the process and the technology undermine trust in elections .
Several noted scientists and research groups have looked at the machines and * demonstrated * multiple ways in which a small number of people can infiltrate the electoral process in a few key districts of a few key states and swing entire elections .
We should all be worried about that .

Andreas -
Thanks for the quick thoughts .
As well as for your piece on the SC mess and the larger picture .
If you 're a Kossack , I hope you 'll be able to help knock some common sense into a lot of the heads over there , where they 've been ( self - defeatingly ) regarding these matters as " conspiracy theory " for years .
You 've got the concerns precisely right , though we 'll have to disagree on your still - optimistic solution .
Specifically , you wrote above : I call for paper + pencil elections not because machines cannot be built to do electronic voting .
Even Internet - based secure and voter - verifiable voting is possible .
But not with the current mish - mash of rules and lackadaisical attitudes towards security and auditability of elections .
I have , for years , been open to the notion that machines and / or processes could be created for exactly what you describe .
Having studied the issue for some 6 years ( virtually non-stop ) , I 've concluded that any form of concealed vote counting , no matter how secure and accurate , is ultimately a no - go when it comes to the unique issue of transparent democracy and the citizen oversight necessary for self - governance .
In short , even if an election is counted 100 % accurately and securely --- as even the SC primary might have been , as far as we know --- unless the citizenry can know that , for a fact , after an election , it 's a fail to the requirements of the type of democracy we ( theoretically ) have here .
With all due respect , of course , all the testimony from computer scientists and experts that an election was held " securely " does not meet the high bar we must hold for such things .
I remain open to persuasion on these matters , as always , but after this many years , and this much information , knowledge , scientific reports , real - world elections and on - the - ground case studies , interviews and discussions with scientists , security experts , elected officials , election officials and , most importantly , plain old citizen voters , I 've not found anything that meets the bar , other than 100 % transparent hand - marked paper ballots , hand - counted at the polling place after the close of polls , in front of the entire citizenry , with decentralized results posted at the polling place , before ballots ever move anywhere .
That system meets the high bar we have in our democracy , and is * exceedingly * difficult to game .
( And , if done correctly , should n't take much longer , if at all , than machine counting , in truth --- just to respond to one of the points you made in your piece , with which I gently take exception . )

There are a few possible solutions to voter - verifiable double - blind anonymous electronic elections based on the work of David Chaum .
These allow votes to be submitted and tallied electronically , yet provide each voter an anonymous " hash " that allows the voter to verify that their vote was part of the tally , all without revealing either the preference or the name of the voter .
( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum)
Now , do I think any of that applies to * real * elections anytime soon ?
Not really .
For now , I like the idea of a combination of paper ballots and optical scanners .
The scanners can offer a quick count for media purposes , but the verified and official result is hand - counted and tallied at the local level as you suggest .
Easy to use , transparent , voter verifiable , decentralized and very hard to subvert without massive collusion or intimidation .

Hi Brad ,
Thanks for all you do .
As you well know , but some people who come late to this issue may not , Stephen Spoonamore is anything but a luddite .
He is a Republican computer security expert who has worked in the financial industry , where all computer transactions have to be secure .
He makes the most compelling case that having computers involved in vote - counting is fundamentally asking for fraud and stealing of elections .
Anyone can watch him do his thing and get informed about the nature of the problems in just a few minutes , via YouTube .
btw , I think S.S. should get a Medal of Freedom award , as should you , Brad !
For what I think is the best interview , start here :
There are two series of interviews with him available on internet video .
The older one is with a woman - interviewer .
The later , and ( I think ) more telling interview can be found on youtube or google , and can be recognized because there is an ornate white stairway behind him , going up and to the right , and a male interviewer .
In very compelling terms , Spoonamore explains why it is fundamentally impossible to have secret ballots , and a secure voting system run on computers .
I do n't think anyone could possibly listen to either interview , ( they are both broken up into segments ) and still hold the position that touch - screen no - paper - trail voting is anything but a recipe for stealing elections .
Court documents are not becoming paperless any time soon , just because of these issues .
With paper ballots , votes have to be stolen one at a time , and it's hard to move thousands of ballots around without being seen , to stuff the ballot boxes .
And when votes are counted , it becomes obvious that there has been tampering if there are runs of hundreds of votes for one candidate , with no votes at all for the other candidate .
Germany is not a Luddite country by any means , and they do all of their voting on paper ballots , counted by hand .
So there .
So send the name callers to Stephen Spoonamore to get theyselves ejicated ( sic ) !

Andreas @ 3 : I know David and his suggested e-vote scheme , and find that it has a number of problems .
Among them , having a computer tell one that one 's vote has been counted , is no replacement for being able to verify that with ones own eyes .
Moreover , if you see what happened to me when I tried to e-vote in June of '08 myself ( and then again just two weeks ago ) out here in L.A. , my vote would have been recorded , but would have been recorded inaccurately .
Depending on how Chaum 's scheme is used , either I wo n't know it 's recorded inaccurately , OR , if able to find out how it recorded that vote ( and if I wish to trust the computer telling me how it recorded my vote ) , I 'd then be able to sell my vote .
FAIL and FAIL .
Unfortunately .
For the record , in NH they still count the ballots by hand , at the precinct , in some 40 % of jurisdictions .
In many of those jurisdictions , the hand - count is often done , signed , sealed and delivered before the machine tally has finished .
That 's why I say , " if it 's done right " it should n't take any longer than the machines .
If it takes too long , that means you need more people counting .
With all the money to be saved on the e-voting junk , we should have more than enough to cover the costs of paying people appropriately for this .

Consider experience in two Canadian cities : Calgary , population 1,000,000 , where ballots are counted by hand ; and Edmonton , population 700,000 , which uses opscan systems .
In two elections , Calgary totals came in earlier than Edmonton’s .
Costs : Calgary , $ 2/voter ; Edmondton : $ 7/ voter .

The SC " debacle " is JUST one MORE example of the " unreliability " of electronic voting apparatus .
The Nation MUST completely discard ALL of these despicable monsters of destruction from our political system .
Having contested " official " election results for Florida 's 5th congressional district in 2006 BECAUSE we identified firm evidence of vote flipping .
SC should not be allowed to be swept under the rug .
IT IS FIRM AND VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE OF WHOLESALE VOTE MANIPULATION / FRAUD ... and should provide the undeniable wakeup call to the voters that we are being SCREWED !
Please review my section on election reform from my campaign website .
I am not a candidate this cycle 2010 , however I am making revisions in order to keep information current .
SC evidence will be added soon to this page .

" Court documents are not becoming paperless any time soon , just because of these issues . "
Actually , that 's not true .
Many courts are moving to e-filing , based on pdf files .
Of course , I still agree with Brad that paper is the way to go .
However , it does n't help our cause to present false information in support of our arguments .

The heroic Andy Worthington — leading journalist on the Kafka - esque U.S. military prisons at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan ; the Bush - Obama Administrations ’ policy and standard operating procedures regarding kidnapping , rendition and torture ; and the ensuing legal processes — has outstandingly posted excerpts from the February report conducted by the U.N. Human Rights Council , “ Joint Study on Global Practices in Relation to Secret Detention in the Context of Counter - Terrorism ” [ .pdf ] .
Read the series at his blog :
( Ars Technica ) --
The industry - wide struggle over e-book formats continues , despite the fact that publishers are inundated with choices over how and where to distribute their e-books .
In fact , such a wide selection is part of the reason why publishers are up in arms over the lack of a good universal option : they do n't want to have to choose between Amazon , Apple , and Barnes and Noble ; nor do they want to spend the extra time and resources trying to do all three .
They want to choose one format and have it be available everywhere , but the industry may be standing in its own way before a widely accepted universal format becomes available .
There are already several open e-book formats out there -- ePub and MobiPocket are just a couple .
The major e-book devices even support them ; with a little bit of effort , you can get an ePub version of a book onto your Kindle or iPad in no time .
The problem is the " effort " part -- e-book sellers like Amazon , Barnes & Noble , and Apple heavily market their own stores and make it even easier for customers to simply buy the proprietary formats .
The downside , of course , is that customers are then locked into specific formats and devices .
As noted in a recent Reuters piece , a Kindle book may be readable on a Kindle app on the iPad , but it 's still limited to the Kindle " universe " -- other devices that lack Kindle apps wo n't be able to handle those formats , and vice versa .
" Our fondest wish is that all the devices become agnostic so that there is n't proprietary formats and you can read wherever you want to read , " Penguin Group CEO David Shanks told Reuters .
" First we have to get a standard that everybody embraces . "
Getting their collective act together
Some believe the industry itself needs to get its act together before pointing fingers at Amazon or Apple .
" Indeed , there are several open formats , but the problem is that they still need work , " self - published author Cesar Torres told Ars .
Torres believes that if publishers worked together to get behind a particular open format , the format would improve and device makers would be more motivated to offer wider support .
" The problem still lies with publishing houses and their inability to talk to one another .
Everyone is doing their own thing without any regard for readers or customers , " Torres said .
" Apple and Amazon would be toast if publishers really got their act together . "
There 's another element that 's holding back publishers from unifying on a more widely compatible , open format .
The old guard of publishers is at odds with the more progressive ones over how to handle e-books , adding to strife within the industry .
Brooklyn - based writer Edward Champion expressed frustration after attending this year 's BookExpo CEO panel , noting that moderator Jonathan Galassi " maintained the old warhorse position that hardcovers would still be desired by 100 percent of book purchasers , " and that Authors Guild president Scott Turow seemed to be completely oblivious to the fact that customers want e-books the same day hardcover versions are released .
Both Champion and Torres seem to agree certain publishers are simply scared of the dangers of the online world .
" Most publishers do n't want e-books at all , " Torres said .
They want to keep paper around as long as possible ( sound familiar ? ) and , in lieu of that , they insist on heavy DRM on their e-books as they are dragged kicking and screaming into the digital world .
That stance is clear when you read Penguin Group president Susan Peters Kennedy 's comments to Reuters .
She staunchly noted that publishers are n't keen on making the same " mistakes " as the music industry and falling into a battle over piracy .
" It 's always treated as if the publishers are the Luddites .
The devices have not caught up with the content .
Contrary to popular opinion , the book is actually so far more flexible , " Kennedy said .
With that kind of attitude , it 's no surprise that users are increasingly " pirating " e-books that they already own in paper format .
Traditional books are indeed more flexible , but that 's because of the industry 's own disagreement on how to handle e-books .
What 's worse : a PDF of a book floating around on BitTorrent because there are no other legal ways to acquire a digital copy , or an ePub version of the same book available for purchase on the major bookstores ' and publishers ' websites ?
Some cooperation from publishers could go a long way , but they apparently do n't yet realize that .

AOL bought the social networking site for $ 850 m in March 2008 but is reported to have sold it for $ 10 m .
CCP said it would take over Bebo's global operations immediately and retain a San Francisco - based headquarters .
It plans to make an offer of appointments to as many staff as it can , but Bebo's UK operation will cease to exist .
Adam Levin , managing partner at CCP , said : " [ Bebo's ] young , highly active user base , revenue history , presence in countries throughout the world and solid technical infrastructure make it an attractive media platform both as a standalone entity and in the context of our broader investment objectives . "
CCP said Bebo has a strong user base across the globe , including in the U.S. , the UK , Ireland , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Poland , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , India , Pakistan and the Netherlands .
In a note sent to all employees this morning AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong said : " In April we communicated the fact that Bebo was among the assets we would be not be keeping as part of our main portfolio of businesses .
" At that time , we indicated that we hoped to finish our strategic evaluation by the end of May , which we did .
Today we are announcing that we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bebo , Inc. to Criterion Capital Partners , LLC .
" For AOL , the transaction will also create a meaningful tax deduction , which should allow us to more effectively manage our tax strategy . "
The sale ends a strategic review begun in April this year when AOL announced it was either going to sell the site or close it down due to huge profit losses , saying it was not in a position to give Bebo the investment it required to compete in the social network space .
In its first year under AOL ownership Bebo's UK revenues dropped 29 % year on year to £ 6.25 m , according to its financial results for the 12 months to 31 May 2009 .
The site has also become less popular , with UK user figures dropping by 60 % between May 2009 and May 2010 from 3.9 million unique users to 1.5 million unique users , according to UKOM .
In January Bebo lost a third of its workforce in the UK having already lost its senior staff including president Joanna Shields and European managing director Kate Burns .
Shields left the social networking site in May last year after securing Bebo 's sale to AOL .
Burns was promoted to head of AOL UK and Europe in July last year .
" I REALLY need your help " , wrote Adelaide scientist Brad Page in an internet post , and thousands of crime buffs from around the world have responded .
Mr Page his car broken into by an opportunistic thief outside his West Beach office on June 7 — and a security camera captured the whole thing .
However , a cyclone fence — and the quality of the recording itself — meant police were unable to make out the registration on the thief 's Commodore .
So Mr Page put out the call for help on social news site Reddit , where users post up - to - date news and ask other readers for advice .
" My car got broken into and here is the surveillance film of the guy who did it ( and his car ) ! " Mr Page wrote .
" Can anyone do a Jack Bauer and ' enhance this image ' so I can read his plate ? "
Mr Page 's post drew instant interest from the online community , shooting to the most popular page on the site .
" We are our own personal army , " one user wrote .
Another said the huge response was incredible .
" We 're closing in on this guy — his days of freedom are numbered , " they wrote .
Mr Page said it was exciting to hear from experts in video and image enhancement .
" Some people have skills in Photoshop and other image editing programs , " he said .
" There is even a forensic software specialist trying to help . "
The online sleuths have agreed the plate is most likely Victorian , and several users have spent time trawling through websites to match potential numberplates with similar coloured Commodores .
Mr Page described the thief as a " skinny and ugly white guy " , 182 cm , with light brown hair , wearing fawn coloured clothing and a dark hat .

The rising cost of the Afghan and Iraq wars is always a serious concern , though it really only gets discussed when a major new spending bill is passed or a new milestone is hit .
Tonight it is the later , as Costofwar.com , the maker of a popular Javascript ticker that estimates the current costs of the war , has seen its estimate pass the $ 1 trillion mark earlier today .
Costofwar ’s estimate is based on the amount of money allocated to the war in the current and previous fiscal years , but other estimates suggest that the true cost runs into the several trillion dollar range .
The milestone is largely symbolic , however it is useful , to quote one activity , to “ make sure voters and constituents and people in general understand that when they ’re talking about adding billions , that ’s on top of $ 1 trillion that we ’ve spent on these two wars . ”
With America stumbling into the realm of record budget deficits on the back of record military expenditures and a floundering global economy , the sacred cow that is war spending is expected to become an issue going forward .
This is particularly true as after eight and a half years , there is still no end in sight to the wars .
Stuffed 8 - Ball Zucchini - Unique single serving size zucchini stuffed with bacon , tomato , onion , cheese , and seasoned bread crumbs .
Last weekend , BeeBop and I spent 3 wonderful , relaxing days in Beaufort on the South Carolina coast .
Neither of us had been there before but we have long loved the area .
Both Savannah and Charleston are favorites of ours .
The culture and charm of that whole region are very appealing to us .
Since Beaufort is located in between those two larger cities , we thought we'd give it a try at least once and we were not disappointed .
Beaufort has a long , complex history and the architecture is breathtaking .
If you 'd like to see some of what we saw take a look at these Beaufort photos I uploaded to Flickr .
One of the most interesting things we saw was the ruins of Old Sheldon Church , a spot we almost missed .
When we were on our way back Monday morning , we turned down a road we had not taken on the way over .
Not long after , I just happened to look to my right and saw an absolutely beautiful sight .
We quickly turned around and went back to investigate .
If you 're ever in the area of Beaufort , take time to find Old Sheldon Church .
It 's a hauntingly beautiful place .
Just a little further down the road , we spotted a produce stand and , of course , we pulled over to investigate .
Got fresh , local peaches and strawberries , but the star of that stand was these little 8 - Ball zucchini .
Have you seen these before ?
I had seen them on the internet , but never for sale .
Naturally , I grabbed several .
When we got back home I started looking for a recipe for these perfect , single - serving sized zucchini .
I found a great recipe on Soupbelly , a gorgeous blog with wonderful recipes and beautiful photography .
The combination of flavors in this is really delicious .
I mean , really , how could you go wrong when you start with three slices of bacon ?
Then add onion , tomato , cheese and bread crumbs .
Really .

Cut the bacon crosswise into 1/4 ” pieces .
Add it to the skillet over medium - high heat and cook until the bacon has browned and rendered most of its fat .
Add the reserved zucchini pulp , tomato , and onion and cook for 4 - 5 minutes .
Remove the pan from the heat and add bread crumbs and 2/3 of the cheese reserving some for topping .
Stir well to combine all ingredients .
Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper as desired .
Sprinkle each hollowed zucchini lightly with salt and pepper and stuff with the mixture .
Place stuffed zucchini in a shallow baking dish or pan and add chicken stock to a depth of about 1 /4 inch .

GREEN VALLEY - Don
Herk sees no problem with an interstate sign about 200 meters outside his Arizona Family Restaurant telling motorists that Continental Road is 2 kilometers south .
" The kilometers make it a little unique to this part of the country , " he said as cars whizzed by on Interstate 19 .
" It 's something that 's become part of my life . "
Carolyn Rose , a retiree who lunched at Herk 's restaurant on a recent weekday , said visitors from her native Wisconsin find the interstate 's metric signs fascinating .
" We like the uniqueness of it , " she said .
Decades after efforts stalled to convert the U.S. to centimeters , liters and celsius , signs lining the interstate 's 100 - odd kilometers are reminders of those days .
Built in the 1970s between Tucson and the border , I - 19 was the Federal Highway Administration 's testing ground for kilometer markings and remains the nation 's only highway marked completely in metric .
Not everyone views the metric signs fondly , however .
The Arizona Department of Transportation has proposed using $ 1.5 million in stimulus funds to replace the aging signs and , in the process , phase out kilometers .
But a backlash from residents and businesses along the interstate , especially those in Green Valley , has officials pumping the brakes .
In June 2009 , Gov. Jan Brewer put the project on hold while ADOT surveyed public opinion on the change , and a decision is expected later this month .
Herk said he and most of his customers consider the metric signs part of the area 's culture .
" I think most everybody has gotten used to it , " he said .
" I 've been driving up and down this highway for 33 years , and we 've got it figured out . "
In addition , his business advertises that it's off Exit 65 , as in 65 kilometers .
Changing to miles would cost him some money because the interstate 's exit numbers would change , Herk said .
Jim DiGiacomo , executive director of the Green Valley Chamber of Commerce , said it 's a tall order these days to force businesses to spend money changing advertising , letterhead and brochures .
He 'd rather see the state use the money elsewhere .
" They should leave the signs alone until the economy picks up again , " DiGiacomo said .
Based on complaints from businesses and residents in this unincorporated area , the Green Valley Community Coordinating Council raised concerns with the Pima County Board of Supervisors , which appealed to the governor .
" These are down times right now economically , " said Stan Riddle , the coordinating council 's president .
" Merchants are having enough trouble just trying to make ends meet . "
Linda Ritter , an ADOT spokeswoman , said the signs have to be replaced because they do n't meet federal standards for reflectivity .
If the project is n't done now with stimulus money , she said , Arizona will have to do it in the next few years with money from the state budget .
" We need to get the wheels moving on this project , " she said , adding that if the I - 19 signs are n't going in by March the stimulus money will be used for a different project .
The agency recently completed the assessment of opinions and will announce its recommendation soon , Ritter said .
The I - 19 project would have to be pushed back if the decision is to keep kilometers because ADOT would have to design new signs , she said .
ADOT has proposed that if the signs do change to miles , a small kilometer marking would remain in the corner for two years so that businesses and residents can have time to adjust .
Sahuarita Mayor Lynne Skelton said changing the signs to miles would be a symbol of progress , bringing the area in line with the rest of the country .
" We did n't develop the town around kilometers , " she said .
Skelton said switching to miles would n't as big a shock as some residents and businesses contend , noting that speed limit signs are in miles per hour and that I - 19 already has mile markers that face the road rather than oncoming drivers .
" I 've never heard anyone say they come down I - 19 just to see the kilometers , " she said .
" First time drivers say , Wow , this is different ' then go about their business . "
But Jim Green , owner of the Inn at San Ignacio in Green Valley , said the kilometer signs make tourists want to know more about the area 's history and other attributes .
" There 's something about it that makes us unique , " he said .
Bruce Pheneter , an architect and member of the Tubac Historical Society , said the signs have become part of the area 's character .
" I think the metric system along I - 19 is kind of a community identification , " he said .
" It 's worked its way into the culture and people have been able to assimilate it . "
Rare - earths combine particularly easily with other elements to form useful compounds and alloys , such as neodymium - iron - boron , the strongest , lightest magnet for motors .
" No other element can do that , " says Jack Lifton , an independent metals consultant .
" Once we 've used them up , the periodic table is closed for business . "
Similar stories are playing out across the table .
For many elements , we 'll eventually need to find more , recycle , or move on to another .

This picture of Jupiter was taken on June 7 , just a few days after the impact .
The image on the right is a closeup , and the circle represents where the impact took place , and there 's nothing there we can see .
In previous impacts -- most notably the one last year in July , and the Shoemaker - Levy 9 series of impacts in 1994 -- nasty black bruises appeared on the planet 's cloud tops .
Those were impact scars , plumes of material blasted up from deeper in Jupiter 's cloud , dredged up by the multi-megaton explosions .
You can see this by comparing an image of Jupiter taken last year after the July impact with what they got this year :
The 2009 impact scar can be seen in the left hand image near the bottom of Jupiter .
There is no such scar seen for the newer impact .
That means that whatever hit Jupiter did n't explode deep in the atmosphere .
The observations imply strongly that whatever hit burned up high in the atmosphere , more like a giant fireball than an impact and explosion .
Given how bright it was , I 'm personally of the opinion that this may not have been a giant solid asteroid , like a piece of rock or metal .
If it was that fragile , it may have been what 's called a rubble pile ; a loose conglomeration of rocks held together by their own gravity .
At the moment , because we did n't see anything it 's hard to say anything positive .
We can eliminate a few possibilities , but it 's hard to know exactly what happens .
These observations definitely help , but are also in their way a little maddening .
What the heck happened on Jupiter ?
As an added bonus , these observations also show ( OK , do n't show ) the missing southern equatorial belt ; a planet - wide storm wrapped around Jupiter .
In the older shot you can see it , but a few months ago it disappeared , and is missing in the newer shot .
This has happened before , but it 's unclear why .
In the new images you can see that the storms north and south of the missing belt look different now too , perhaps a clue as to what 's going on .
There is a series of brownish circular storms all lined up , more or less , and other odd features as well .
All in all , I think we can sum all this up by saying Jupiter is a weird place .
Mind you , it 's 140,000 kilometers across ( 86,000 miles ) , which is a heckuva lot of real estate to try to understand .
I expect the questions and answers will change , but I bet that in a hundred years , astronomers studying Jupiter will still have plenty of mysteries on their hands .

Are you suffering from a bitter taste in the back of your mouth every time you eat or drink ?
Has it lasted for more than a day ?
Are you starting to worry that perhaps there ’s something terribly wrong with you ?
Do n’t worry , it ’s probably not a brain tumor .
Perhaps pine nuts are the culprit !
So I woke up yesterday morning with a headache .
Nothing terrible , it happens .
Instead of taking ibuprofen on an empty stomach , I grabbed a Ritz cracker out of the pantry to eat before I took the pill .
I ate the cracker and noticed that it tasted terrible .
Now , it was from a sealed package , but those crackers have been sitting in there for months so I figured they were just stale .
Whatever .
I took my pill , then sat down with a cup of coffee .
The coffee tasted bad , too .
I just had this weird , bitter taste in the back of my mouth .
But , I figured maybe there was just something wrong with my throat .
Perhaps I was coming down with something , there are lots of nasty bugs floating around right now and I had woken up with a headache after all .
Later that morning I decided to try some of the chili ( breakfast of champions ! ) that my friend Amanda had dropped off on her way to work .
The chili had the same bitter aftertaste as everything else I had consumed up to that point .
Now I knew there was a problem .
Amanda does n’t make bad food !
Sure enough , every other thing I tried to eat yesterday tasted horrible , and it seemed to get worse as the day progressed .
There was definitely something going on with my tastebuds .
So I did what any red-blooded , internet - obsessed hypochondriac American would have done .
I googled my symptoms .
Well , it took all of about 2 seconds to find several accounts of people suffering the exact symptoms , and scanning the page , the words ‘ pine nuts ’ jumped out at me .
I had been eating a TON of pine nuts for the last few days .
So I refined my google search to include the phrases “ pine nuts ” and “ bitter taste . ”
With 30 seconds of my original search , I had the answer to the bitter taste mystery !
Apparently , if you are one of the lucky people who runs into a bad pine nut or two , you could develop the taste disturbance that I am experiencing right now .
There ’s a scientific article about it and it ’s even mentioned in the Wikipedia entry on Pine Nuts :
The eating of pine nuts can cause serious taste disturbances , developing 1 - 3 days after consumption and lasting for days or weeks .
A bitter , metallic taste is described .
In general , a minority of pine nuts on the market present this problem .
Though very unpleasant , there does not seem to be a real health concern .
— Wikipedia
Nobody seems to be able to explain exactly why it happens .
But after reading several accounts , I am satisfied that pine nuts are the culprit in my case .
It seems that this bitter taste can last anywhere from a couple of days to over a week .
Ugh , lucky me !
Now I am not writing this to start a pine nut panic !
Several blog posts are blaming this issue on pine nuts from China , but my pine nuts were n’t from China .
I bought them at Trader Joe ’s and the package states that they came from one of three places : Korea , Russia , or Vietnam .
I do n’t believe that this a case of China selling poisoned pine nuts to the United States , although the Chinese variety of pine nuts may be more susceptible to the problem .
I think that there are some bad nuts out there that appear to be coming from several undetermined sources and unfortunately at least one of them ended up in my mouth .
But since it seems that this is happening more with Chinese pine nuts than with Italian pine nuts , I think I ’ll stick to the Italian ones from here on out !
So , will this keep me from eating pine nuts in the future ?
Hell no !
I love them too much .
I will , however , be more careful about where I purchase them .
I will spend more money and make sure they are fresh and that I know exactly where they are coming from .
Sorry , Trader Joe’s !
Here are some general guidelines I suggest you follow when purchasing / storing pine nuts :
– Buy the more expensive Italian pine nuts and make sure it ’s from a store with a high turnover .
– Pine nuts turn rancid very quickly , so buy in small quantities and store them well - wrapped in the refrigerator for short periods of time , or in the freezer if you need to store them for an extended period of time .
Just make sure you keep those suckers cold !
Now I know that google is no substitute for a doctor , but after my research I ’m satisfied that my taste disturbance is indeed caused by pine nuts .
I ’m not sick , I have no symptoms other than the bitterness in my mouth ( I ’m positive that the headache I mentioned at the beginning of my story had more to do with the wine consumed the night before than with pine nut poisoning ) .
The bitter taste is annoying , but I do n’t feel that my health is in danger .
I eat a lot of pine nuts and have been doing so for years .
This is the first time I ’ve ever had a problem and I ’m confident that if I ’m careful with my pine nut purchases in the future , it wo n’t happen again .
So , has this happened to any of you ?
If so , where did your pine nuts come from ?

" Ladies and gentleman , put down your MiFis , and step away from your laptops , or there 's going to be trouble . "
Apple 's CEO did n't actually utter these words during his demonstration of the iPhone 4's higher - density screen at the Worldwide Developer 's Conference ( WWDC ) on Monday .
But the seeming failure of the iPhone 4 to access an Apple Wi-Fi network caused a stir .
Jobs said from stage , and an Apple engineer later told InfoWorld , that over 500 WiFi networks were in operation .
Not 500 WiFi adapters or connections — in an audience of 5,000 , there could have been thousands — but 500 distinct networks .
Most of these networks were apparently generated by people using a MiFi , a cellular gateway from Novatel Wireless , sold by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel , which relays 3G networks over WiFi .
However , after examining the video from the event and discussing it with two veteran WiFi gurus , it seems almost certain that the MiFi was only part of the problem .
A flaw in the pre-release iPhone 4 iOS was clearly another element .
Apple 's public relations confirmed receipt of a request for comment , but none was forthcoming .
That 's not to say that having hundreds of WiFi base stations does n't cause trouble .
In fact , the iPhone 4's putative driver problem likely arose from the multitude of network signals .
But neither the ocean of signals nor the iPhone 4's performance can be looked at entirely in isolation .
Checking the replay
Let 's take a close look at the video , which shows an iPhone 3GS on the left and an iPhone 4 on the right .
What 's confusing in watching the video at first is that Apple had a backup set of devices cued up and ready to go .
Steve Jobs ' backstage folks switch between the first set of phones and a second , and then back to the first during the first part of the referenced clip .
Here 's the replay in slow - motion :
0:06 : The iPhone 3GS has mostly loaded the New York Times , but the iPhone 4 displays just a title bar , and no content on the page .
A WiFi icon is in the iPhone 4's status bar at the top .
0:17 : Jobs brings up the backup set of devices , and the backup iPhone 4 is on 3G ( switch to 720 p in YouTube to see that more distinctly ) .
0:21 : You can see the 3G indicator clearly on screen here on the backup iPhone 4 .
0:28 : The iPhone 4 can't acquire a 3G connection , which is n't surprising given the indoor location and thousands of AT&T devices in the audience .
The audience laughs , and a wag suggests Jobs try Verizon .
0:47 : The demo screen fades subtly back to the original pair of devices , in which the WiFi icon is shown on the iPhone 4 , but it still has not retrieved the page .
0:59 : Jobs presses the Home button , then relaunches Safari , and a WiFi icon is clearly visible , but the page does n't load .
1:10 : The page finally starts to load , but Jobs gives up and moves on .
So what happened here ?
I spoke to two people with a long career in wireless networking : Phil Belanger and Phil Kearney .
Belanger 's name is on the 802.11 b spec and he helped pick the brand name WiFi , while Kearney headed up Apple 's networking group ( including AirPort ) from 2002 to late 2008 .
Neither was present at the keynote , but after seeing the video and discussing what appeared to happen , both agreed separately that the iPhone 4 was having trouble .
Belanger said , " It seems more like there 's something funky with the iPhone software . "
Kearney said , " My experience in the wireless space leads me to believe that there may be a bug in the firmware or the driver for the WiFi chip in the iPhone 4 . "
( Kearney and his group provided advice for the iPhone and iPod touch engineers , and he consulted with Apple 's WiFi chipmaker on the chip in question . )
Ten years of testing WiFi devices led me to the same conclusion .
I'm the tester companies both like and hate : I 've found hundreds of problems with adapters and drivers , which companies have ( usually ) fixed after I 've reported them .
This includes a number of issues uncovered with Apple 's AirPort products .
I 'm used to analyzing and diagnosing WiFi oddities .
How did the two Phils and I make this supposition ?
Let 's start with what seemed to be the problem initially , too many WiFi networks .
Mobile Hotspots Proliferate
There was a plethora of WiFi networks
available during the WWDC keynote
The MiFi was the first truly mobile and widespread deployment of a mobile hotspot .
It 's a battery - powered , shirt - pocket - sized device that picks up a 3G network and shares that access over WiFi with up to five other computers or gadgets .
While there were several similar gateways available before the MiFi , it was the first to combine portability with direct carrier resale to a mass audience .
The MiFi requires a two - year contract and is free from Sprint or $ 100 from Verizon , with a $ 60 - per- month contract plus five cents per MB for usage above 5 GB each month .
The MiFi defined the category of " mobile hotspot . "
Before the MiFi , 3G - based mobile hotspots were typically limited to either tethering ( using a cell phone as a kind of modem via a USB " tether " or through a Bluetooth modem profile ) , or using a 3G modem plugged into a laptop with Internet sharing enabled over the laptop 's WiFi card .
Tethering is fine , but limited ; 3G modem sharing is awkward .
A mobile hotspot creates an access point ( AP ) in precisely the same way as a dedicated WiFi router .
This includes having a unique BSSID ( Basic Service Set Identifier ) , which is like a MAC address for a base station , and an SSID ( Service Set Identifier ) , the human - readable name that 's presented by software that lets you connect .
Now , we 're going to see massive numbers of mobile hotspots in the near future as phones supplant and supplement MiFis .
The Palm Pre Plus and Pixi Plus offered the feature months ago , although Verizon is the only U.S. carrier to support it .
And the just - out Sprint HTC Evo 4G , also includes this service , although it 's only enabled over WiMax networks right now , and Sprint will charge $ 30 per month for use ( over 3G or 4G ) starting in July .
What will really open up the floodgates , though , is Android 2.2 , which includes a mobile hotspot feature in the basic operating system setup .
Carriers may choose to disable or charge for this option , but it will set up a very different expectation from phones .
Oddly enough , the iPhone 4 does n't include a mobile hotspot option .
i Phone OS 3 allowed tethering , which some carriers ( not AT&T ) enabled for a fee .
The iOS 4 release will bring with it AT&T tethered support , but not WiFi - based sharing of a connection .
Contention in the Air
What makes the MiFi and other mobile hotspots into a congestion problem ?
After all , thousands of base stations can also work in concert — as at colleges , corporations , and large outdoor deployments like that of Cablevision — where centralized management varies elements such as power output and channel choice .
That 's because a set of WiFi adapters connecting to a network of base stations that expose themselves as the same network ( or set of networks with virtual SSIDs ) do n't contend for access .
The adapters use a variety of techniques to share the available spectrum slice ( a channel ) allotted to their communications , with the base station acting as a mediator .
The problem with huge numbers of uncoordinated base stations is that each is trying to carve out its own use , and each ( along with associated devices ) has to be only mildly respectful of all other WiFi gear in the same and even adjacent channels .
Without base station coordination , each network takes a hit because it does n't know precisely when a device on another network will start broadcasting .
Get enough of those , and every device is backing off from talking , because it 's overlapping with someone else .
Phil Belanger explained , " Rather than interference , it 's just congestion .
It 's not a foreign signal , it 's well known ; all the clients can decode there 's something going on . "
As reported , Volition 's next outing in its Red Faction universe will be Red Faction : Armageddon .
Now , just about a week before E3 , we get our first look at the game .
The trailer paints the world as one where humans that have colonized Mars have been pushed underground , learning to survive in once uninhabitable mines .
As it turns out , humans are n't the only life on the Mars -- we see some Dead Space -y looking creatures rear their heads a few times in the trailer , which runs just over a minute .
Good thing you 'll have all of those mech suits to protect yourself with .
We see plenty of the series ' trademark destruction in this video , as well .
But if you look carefully , you 'll notice a new ability around 40 seconds in : some sort of glove that seemingly rebuilds pieces of the environment .
The teaser pegs the game for a March 2011 release ; we 'll have more for you come E3 .

Dick Cheney came out of hiding yesterday long enough to poke his head up in Erie , PA , and not take responsibility for the administration which he was a part of and their reckless deregulation of big oil , nope he popped up to criticize Obama .
He said that Obama lacks the , “ executive experience ” to deal with the spill .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
According to WICU12 in Erie , “ The media was only allowed to stay for the first 5 minutes of his speech .
Cheney told the audience he is currently writing his memoirs .
He also touched on President Obama ’s performance in office .
He pointed to the President ’s lack of action in the Gulf oil leak .
He said Obama does n’t have enough executive experience , or experience in Washington , to make things happen . ”
I guess Cheney is longing for the way that he and George W. Bush , “ made things happen , ” after Hurricane Katrina , or maybe he wants Obama to make things happen the way that he did with secret energy task force , which made this whole disaster possible ?
Perhaps he thinks BP should get tax break or more government contracts , because that is how his administration rewarded ineptitude .
As my colleague Sarah Jones pointed out in her piece about Cheney ’s responsibility for this disaster , “ Regulation and oversight were clearly MIA in this story .
Dick Cheney ’s secret energy meetings , the MMS suddenly deciding under Bush that they would not continue with the recommendations to update the regulations of the oil companies as began under Clinton ( it should be noted that the regulations have not been updated since 1996 – this is how deeply the oil companies have infiltrated our government ) , the government allowing the MMS to both collect royalties and police the off shore drilling ( which is akin to the rating agencies on Wall Street which take money from the companies they “ rate ” ) – all of this is both predictable and profoundly shocking at the same time . ”
No politician is more to blame than Dick Cheney for this incident , and his tired claim about Obama ’s executive experience wore thin a long time ago .
Obama has been in office for about a year and half , which is more political executive experience than Dick Cheney had when he became vice president .
Cheney has zero political executive experience .
He has never had to sit in the big chair and make decisions .
He knows nothing of what he speaks .
How many years does Obama have to be in office for before people like Dick Cheney and Sarah Palin stop knocking his executive experience ?
Cheney is so afraid to take responsibility for his actions as vice president that he is afraid to face the cameras , which should tell anyone all that they really need to know about the courage and leadership of Dick Cheney .
He was a coward who was Nixonian in his support of big oil as vice president , and he is still a coward today .
It is disgusting that Democrats once let Dick Cheney bully them with nationalistic patriotism .

That is how I look at these new sanctions against Iran and with these sanctions are so many promises not to do this and not to do that .
But these promises are not really that visible because backroom , under - table and slight of hand techniques were used to get the job done .
Nothing is as it seems and everything is what it seems …
{ The Obama administration fears tough U.S. sanctions against companies doing business in Iran would anger foreign allies .} ( Read More Here )
I will let the article above stand for what is happening in America .
I can tell you what is happening in Russia first hand though …
Russia has three or four articles on every subject to do with the Iran sanctions .
One minute they can sell defense missiles to Iran , the next minute they can not , the next minute Medvedev has to decide and then the next minute we start all over again .
This has been a pattern on all subjects associated with the sanctions , since the sanctions were voted on and that seems to be a quandary that will extend for a while …
( Guilty feelings anyone ? )
I see by the news from China that the same issues are happening and one minute this is the way it is and the next minute it has changed .
China also is “ Gung - Ho ” on staying buddies with Iran .
( Guilty feelings anyone ? )
Also to top this all off – Europe is wanting to run ahead faster and increase the sanctions on a sorta a personal level associated with Europe only … ( Read Here )
So here is what I see : America is fretting over what they have done will piss off the other half of the world that is not already pissed at them .
Russia is running around like a chicken with its head cut off and has no idea what the bottom line is .
China keeps saying , We are Iran ’s Friends and buddy .
The the “ icing on the cake ” is Europe who wants to beat the war drums and impose their own sanctions to the evil Iran .
( Which Russia has made clear – You better not do that and bother us … )
Then there is Iran ’s words of wisdom : “ These ( U.N. ) resolutions have no value … it is like a used handkerchief that should be thrown in the waste bin .
Sanctions are falling on us from the left and the right .
For us they are the same as pesky flies . “ ……
You gotta admit Ahmadinejad has a way with words …
Windows to Russia !
PS : My Grandma use to say , “ Do not do anything that you have to worry about after you do it , because it means it was not right in the first place ! ” Hummmm … ( Seems to be a whole lot of worrying going on … )
Israel Attacked a NATO Member 's Ship Editor ’s Note : A complication from Israel ’s attack on six boats trying to take relief supplies to Gaza is the fact that the killing of nine activists occurred on a Turkish - flagged ship , the Mavi Marmara , and Turkey is a NATO member with the same right to claim collective defense as the United States did after the 9/11 attacks .
In this guest essay , former British Ambassador Craig Murray , a Law of the Sea expert , recounts what he ’s hearing from other diplomats at NATO headquarters : NATO HQ in Brussels is a very unhappy place .
There is a strong understanding among the various national militaries that an attack by Israel on a NATO member flagged ship in international waters is an event to which NATO is obliged - legally obliged , as a matter of treaty - to react .
Email
Printer friendly I must be plain - nobody wants or expects military action against Israel .
But there is an uneasy recognition that in theory that ought to be on the table , and that NATO is obliged to do something robust to defend Turkey .
Mutual military support of each other is the entire raison d'etre of NATO .
You must also remember that to the NATO military the freedom of the high seas guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is a vital alliance interest which officers have been conditioned to uphold their whole career .
That is why Turkey was extremely shrewd in reacting immediately to the Israeli attack by calling an emergency NATO meeting .
It is why , after the appalling U.S. reaction to the attack with its refusal to name Israel , President Barack Obama has now made a point of phoning President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to condole .
But the unhappiness in NATO HQ runs much deeper than that , I spoke separately to two friends there , from two different nations .
One of them said NATO HQ was " a very unhappy place . "
The other described the situation as " tense - much more strained than at the invasion of Iraq . "
Why ?
There is a tendency of outsiders to regard the senior workings of governments and international organizations as monolithic .
In fact there are plenty of highly intelligent - and competitive - people and diverse interests involved .
There are already deep misgivings , especially amongst the military , over the Afghan mission .
There is no sign of a diminution in Afghan resistance attacks and no evidence of a clear game plan .
The military are not stupid and they can see that the Karzai government is deeply corrupt and the Afghan " national " army comprised almost exclusively of tribal enemies of the Pashtuns .
You might be surprised by just how high in NATO skepticism runs at the line that in some way occupying Afghanistan helps protect the west , as opposed to stoking dangerous Islamic anger worldwide .
So this is what is causing frost and stress inside NATO .
The organization is tied up in a massive , expensive and ill - defined mission in Afghanistan that many whisper is counter - productive in terms of the alliance aim of mutual defense .
Every European military is facing financial problems as a public deficit financing crisis sweeps the continent .
The only glue holding the Afghan mission together is loyalty to and support for the United States .
But what kind of mutual support organization is NATO when members must make decades - long commitments , at huge expense and some loss of life , to support the United States , but can not make even a gesture to support Turkey when Turkey is attacked by a non-member ?
Even the Eastern Europeans have not been backing the U.S. line on the Israeli attack .
The atmosphere in NATO on the issue has been very much the U.S. against the rest , with the U.S. attitude inside NATO described to me by a senior NATO officer as " amazingly arrogant - they do n't seem to think it matters what anybody else thinks . "
Therefore , what is troubling the hearts and souls of non-Americans in NATO HQ is this fundamental question :
Is NATO genuinely a mutual defense organization , or is it just an instrument to carry out U..S foreign policy ?
With its unthinking defense of Israel and military occupation of Afghanistan , is U.S. foreign policy really defending Europe , or is it making the world less safe by causing Islamic militancy ?
I leave the last word to one of the senior NATO officers - who incidentally is not British : " Nobody but the Americans doubts the U.S. position on the Gaza attack is wrong and insensitive .
But everyone already quietly thought the same about wider American policy .
This incident has allowed people to start saying that now privately to each other . "

Summer Solstice , also known as Litha , occurs as the sun moves out of the sign of Gemini into the Sign of Cancer around June 21st .
This is the longest day and shortest night of the solar year , and is directly opposite to Yule or Winter Solstice in the pagan eight - spoked wheel of the year .
Whatever crops are now showing above ground must be tended and supported , as we now have a sense of what we have the potential of reaping in the harvest to come .
Hydration becomes an issue , as the watery sign of Cancer reminds us to protect and maintain what we are growing so it does not perish through neglect or spiritual drought .
Whether we are growing a business , a family , a garden , or any other enterprise , the principals are the same .
What has been begun must be given the attention needed for it to thrive and come to fruition .
The sun is at its zenith and we now honour the Solar Deities such as Sol , Sulis , and Ra .
Their power to increase our abundance and help us grow is formidable , and acknowledging them now will ensure a bountiful harvest to come .
Solstice fires may be lit to represent the sun and if one has the permission to do so , it is a wonderful and sacred act to ignite an outdoor fire at sunset and keep it alive till sunrise , to celebrate the potency of solar fire , both externally and internally .
This is a time to celebrate our sovereignty and our personal power , vitality , and growth .
We are moved to acknowledge the strength , and the support that exists in community to bring light and love into the world .
This is often a very socially active time of the year , when outdoor activities and festivals prevail .
A time for weddings , graduation ceremonies , and summer fairs which bring us together in community celebration .
Gregarious energy , revelry , games and friendly rivalries are played out , and the opportunities for joyful , and eccentric interactions stimulate and enliven .
The Sun itself becomes a symbol of the spinning wheel of the year , and as we turn the wheel at Solstice we are energized by its momentum , and carried forward into a time of sustained growth and action .
This is a time to travel and reconnect with neighbors and friends , a time to explore and expand our horizons .
Like the story of the Sun which is pulled across the sky by a horse drawn chariot , we are moving forward with intention and integrity , and now is the time to check in with ourselves to make sure we are on the path that will lead us to our heart ’s desire .
A Simple Summer Solstice Ceremony
Have or imagine a crown , coronet , tiara , or other head dress of your choosing , and keep this image or item on hand .
This is a symbol of your divine sovereignty .
You can perform this as a kind of meditation , or print it out and use it as the basis for a group ceremony , adding your personal thoughts and any ‘ bells and whistles ’ you are inspired to include .
Speak the following aloud or read to yourself …
This is the turning of the year .
The Sun is at its zenith
and the season of growth is at its peak
We honor the culmination
of all that has come before ,
and acknowledge the growth within ,
that we may move forward
with the sure knowledge
of abundant harvest to come .
This is a time to celebrate the Self ;
and a time of joy and playful abandon ,
so let us make merry while the sun is full
and dance the dance of love and laughter ,
while we turn the wheel once more .
You may wish to dance or turn in a circle ( or close your eyes and imagine a circle dance ) to honor the turning of the wheel of the year .
Focus on the direction South as you read or speak …
At this southernmost point
on the wheel of the year
we accept the sovereignty of our power ,
in order to experience the full potency
of our divine selves :
We honour that which is the source
of all creation so that we may live in faith ,
empowerment , and magi .
And we maintain the integrity
of our bodies , minds and spirits ,
that we may always remember
and honour who we are .
This is our chance to acknowledge
our sovereign self , that part of us
which is indestructible , and inviolable ,
that to which we shall always return .
Close your eyes now and focus on the crown of your head , and imagine the sun ’s bright light streaming down as you open up to its divine message of power .
Feel your crown chakra drink in the light , and let it flow through your being , bringing with it the clear and full awareness of your unique and divine sovereignty .
Stay with this awareness as you place ( or imagine placing ) your crown on your head .
Repeat these words …
We are the Sun
and we are the moon
we are crowned with glory
We are the light
and we are the shadow
we are crowned with glory
We are the embrace
and we are the release
we are crowned with glory
we are the night
and we are the day
we are crowned with glory
we are the goddess
and we are the god
we are crowned with glory
we are body , mind and spirit
we are crowned with glory
we are fully present in our being
we are crowned with glory
we are sovereign unto ourselves
we are crowned with glory
and in all things we are trust , honour and grace
we are crowned with glory
Our crowning glory is our sovereignty ,
our spirit , our divine self ,
It is who we are in faith ,
in word , and in deed combined .
As you are crowned , I ask that you make a magical statement of acknowledgment of your power to bring the world into being , and state how and what you intend to express and create from your divine sovereign self .
You may use the following as a basis for this magical statement and add to it whatever specific declarations inspire you .
You may like to look into a mirror as you speak this powerful declaration .
The final paragraph concludes the ceremony and I invite you to notice how you feel after having this experience , no mater how you have chosen to undertake it .
I declare myself to be sovereign and divine in my being .
Through the fire of the sun ,
all that is newly born , and newly promised ,
will grow in strength this middle of the year .
Earth is earth , and fire is fire .
And we are crowned and bound
to live our lives in in love , and faith , and magic .
Blessed be .

A former Beaverton police officer was not arrested for more than a month after authorities learned he had abused his power of authority and solicited sex while on duty .
Washington County detectives interviewed Joshua Michael Jensen , 25 , of Canby , May 21 following a woman 's report that Jensen had met her through an online ad for escort services and coerced her to perform sexual acts while he was on duty .
Jensen resigned on May 28 .
Jensen was arraigned on and pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of prostitution , two counts of official misconduct and one count of coercion .
Judge Thomas Kohl sentenced Jensen in the same hearing to 30 months in prison , two years of post - prison supervision , counseling and a 12 - step program for sexual addiction .
Authorities did not consider Jensen a threat to the community for the month that he was not in custody because he was immediately placed on administrative leave without his uniform , badge and gun , said Beaverton Police Chief Geoff Spalding .
" This was making calls to escort services , " Spalding said .
" There was no concern ... about the officer making stops on unsuspecting women .
It 's different . "
An investigation yielded evidence of two incidents in which Jensen solicited sex while on duty through online ads for escort services .
In the first incident , which occurred in January , Jensen met a woman late at night in a parking lot and , while in uniform , paid her $ 40 to perform a sex act on him .
In the second incident , which occurred April 24 , he met another woman in the same parking lot , threatened arrest for prostitution and forced her to perform a sex act without pay .
That woman , while incarcerated in Clark County , reported Jensen to authorities on May 14 .
Beaverton police began the investigation , but when text messages on the woman 's phone linked the allegations to one of their own officers , they asked Washington County detectives to take over the investigation on May 18 .
The sheriff 's office took over the investigation the next day .
Jensen 's arraignment , plea entry and sentencing took less than an hour , but Spalding said the speed of the process had nothing to do with Jensen 's status as a police officer .
Spalding said the speedy court process worked " in getting the person off the streets and into custody as quickly as possible . "
Jensen 's defense attorney , Mike Staropoli , said Jensen served in the U.S. Marines for about four years and saw active duty and combat in Iraq .
" There 's a generation of soldiers who are experiencing things half a world away that are affecting them very deeply , " Staropoli said .
" ( Jensen 's experience ) manifested itself in a way that 's particularly troubling . "
Upon his return from Iraq , Jensen was hired by Beaverton police in June 2008 and certified by the state as an officer in November 2009 .
Spalding said Jensen 's behavior was isolated .
" Clearly this is very embarrassing , " he said .
" Clearly it 's an anomaly ; this is something that speaks to someone 's character . "
District Attorney Roger Hanlon said Jensen was cooperative during the investigation and offered the name of one of his victims .
Beaverton Mayor Denny Doyle said he learned of the allegations against Jensen at about the same time Jensen resigned on May 28 .
" I felt let down by the behavior of the officer .
The members of the police force , they work very hard , and to this point have displayed integrity and compassion throughout the community , and unfortunately this happened , " Doyle said .
" It 's extremely unacceptable . "
Doyle said Beaverton did not release information about Jensen during the past 30 days because the district attorney 's office asked that the case remain confidential .
Doyle said the city may review its handling of the Jensen case to determine if the public should be notified sooner , should another Beaverton employee resign amid a criminal investigation .
" We 're going to look to see when 's the earliest we can disclose information , " Doyle said .
" We have to rely on what the legal folks ask us to do .
Because I certainly do n't want to jeopardize the prosecution , because that would be the ultimate disservice to the public . "

AUSTRALIANS would be forced to install anti-virus and firewall software on their computers before being allowed to connect to the internet under a new plan to fight cyber crime .
And if their computer did get infected , internet service providers like Telstra and Optus could cut off their connection until the problem was resolved .
Those are two of the recommendations to come from a year - long inquiry into cyber crime by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications .
Results of the inquiry , titled Hackers , Fraudsters and Botnets : Tackling the Problem of Cyber Crime , were released last night in a 260 - page report .
In her foreword , committee chair Belinda Neal said cyber crime had turned into a " sophisticated underground economy " .
" In the past decade , cyber crime has grown from the nuisance of the cyber smart hacker into an organised transnational crime committed for vast profit and often with devastating consequences for its victims , " Ms Neal said .
During its inquiry the committee heard a growing number of Australians were being targeted by cyber criminals and that increasing internet speeds were likely to make the situation worse .
It also heard the problem was costing Australian businesses as much as $ 649 million a year .
The committee looked at several different examples of cyber crime , including hacking , phishing , malware and botnets .
Among its final 34 recommendations were :
— The creation of an around - the - clock cyber crime helpline .
— Changes to the law to make unauthorised installation of software illegal .
— Companies who release IT products with security vulnerabilities should be open to claims for compensation by consumers .
Another of its recommendations was to create a new " e- security code of practice " that would define the responsibilities of internet service providers and their customers .
The code of practice would see companies like Telstra give their customers security advice when they signed up and inform them if their computer ever appeared to be compromised .
For their part , customers would have to install anti-virus and firewall software before their connection was activated and endeavour to keep the software up - to - date .
If a customer 's computer was infected by malware , the service provider could introduce gradual restrictions and eventually cut off their internet connection entirely until the machine was " remediated " .
If there ’s one thing I ’m sure at least a few people wanted to know , it ’s how the Android mascot looks beneath all of its green - coated aluminum .
Garry Booth decided to take an Android and blow it up .
What he found were the innards that make our green friend “ tick ” and decided to share it with the world in the form of a t - shirt .
For those that are wondering : yes , robots do have brains .
They also have hearts and everything else you would expect to find inside of them .
For $ 19 you can buy this shirt – which is being called Exploded Andy – in any size you need .
The shirt is 100 % cotton by American Apparel .
You ’ll need either a Google Checkout Account ( US ) or Paypal ( Global ) to throw down your order .
If you do spring for one , expect to pay $ 6 for shipping and look out for the shirt to ship Friday , June 4th .

Alternatively , he may have been alluding to the wisdom of the Almighty or – more dangerously - hinting at his growing belief that ordinary Christians had the wit and intelligence to directly commune with God , rather than pray to Him indirectly through the Church .
Today post is a study of the Buddha ’s treatment of what the Buddha defined as the three major hindrances to happiness and freedom from suffering .
These three hindrances have been variously called the Three Poisons or Three Stains .
They are usually identified as greed ( or hungry grasping ) , aversion ( ill will or hatred ) , and delusion .
These unwholesome fabrications are poisonous — even murderous in their effects on us and others .
Below is a passage from the Itivuttaka , translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu , on the three hindrances .
In this version , the three hindrances are translated as “ stains , ” which I thinks add another dimension of insight into the problem .
Happily , these are stains that can be removed !
But first , we have to identify them , and see , as the Buddha says below , that they are an “ inside job . ”
After the Buddha ’s words is a very skillful discussion on transforming the Three Poisons from the Naljor Prison Dharma Service .
I ’ve shared their wonderful material before :
All - embracing Compassion — The Heart Practice of Tonglen
Christmas Metta 2009 — The Four Immeasurables
May these powerful yet compassionate teachings be an inspiration to all of us to free ourselves these stains — these hidden poisons , these enemies of our and other ’s humanity and happiness !
§ 88 . This was said by the Blessed One , said by the Arahant , so I have heard : “ There are these three inside stains , inside enemies , inside foes , inside murderers , inside adversaries .
Which three ?
Greed is an inside stain , inside enemy , inside foe , inside murderer , inside adversary .
Aversion is an inside stain ….
Delusion is an inside stain , inside enemy , inside foe , inside murderer , inside adversary .
These are the three inside stains , inside enemies , inside foes , inside murderers , inside adversaries . ”
Greed causes harm .
Greed provokes the mind .
People do n’t realize it
as a danger born from within .
A person , when greedy ,
does n’t know his own welfare ;
when greedy ,
does n’t see Dhamma .
Overcome with greed ,
he ’s in the dark , blind .
But when one , abandoning greed ,
feels no greed
for what would merit greed ,
greed gets shed from him —
like a drop of water
off a lotus leaf .
Aversion causes harm .
Aversion provokes the mind .
People do n’t realize it
as a danger born from within .
A person , when aversive ,
does n’t know his own welfare ;
when aversive ,
does n’t see Dhamma .
Overcome with aversion
he ’s in the dark , blind .
But when one , abandoning aversion ,
feels no aversion
for what would merit aversion ,
aversion drops away from him —
like a palm leaf from its stem .
Delusion causes harm .
Delusion provokes the mind .
People do n’t realize it
as a danger born from within .
A person , when deluded ,
does n’t know his own welfare ;
when deluded ,
does n’t see Dhamma .
Overcome with delusion
he ’s in the dark , blind .
But when one , abandoning delusion ,
feels no delusion for what would merit delusion ,
he disperses all delusion —
as the rising of the sun , the dark .
Transforming the Three Poisons : Greed , Hatred , and Delusion
In Buddhist teachings , greed , hatred , and delusion are known , for good reason , as the three poisons , the three unwholesome roots , and the three fires .
These metaphors suggest how dangerous afflictive thoughts and emotions can be if they are not understood and transformed .
Greed refers to our selfishness , misplaced desire , attachment , and grasping for happiness and satisfaction outside of ourselves .
Hatred refers to our anger , our aversion and repulsion toward unpleasant people , circumstances , and even toward our own uncomfortable feelings .
Delusion refers to our dullness , bewilderment , and misperception ; our wrong views of reality .
The poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion are a by - product of ignorance — ignorance of our true nature , the awakened heart of wisdom and compassion .
Arising out of our ignorance , these poisonous states of mind then motivate non virtuous and unskillful thoughts , speech , and actions , which cause all manner of suffering and unhappiness for ourselves and others .
Greed , hatred , and delusion are deeply embedded in the conditioning of our personalities .
Our behavior is habitually influenced and tainted by these three poisons , these unwholesome roots buried deep into our mind .
Burning within us as lust , craving , anger , resentment , and misunderstanding , these poisons lay to waste hearts , lives , hopes , and civilizations , driving us blind and thirsty through the seemingly endless round of birth and death ( samsara ) .
The Buddha describes these defilements as bonds , fetters , hindrances , and knots ; the actual root cause of unwholesome karma and the entire spectrum of human suffering .
Although this teaching may appear negative or unpleasant , indeed , a wise understanding of the three poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion is ultimately positive and empowering .
With this sublime understanding we can clearly see and feel the factors that are causing confusion , unhappiness , and suffering in our lives .
And with this clarity and insight , we can make the choice to eliminate those factors !
The teaching of The Four Noble Truths clearly explains that when we embrace and understand the exact causes of our suffering and dissatisfaction , we can then take the necessary steps to extinguish those causes and liberate ourselves .
This is certainly positive and empowering .
In addition , it is important for us to realize that the Dharma teachings regarding defilement and purification are not just rigid , restrictive , or authoritarian theories regarding morality , but are real and solid facts essential to our correct understanding of reality and eventual awakening .
GREED
Our greed is a burning desire , an unquenchable thirst ( tanha ) , craving , and lust ; we want the objects of our desire to provide us with lasting satisfaction so we feel fulfilled , whole , and complete .
The poison of greed creates an inner hunger so that we always seem to be striving towards an unattainable goal .
We mistakenly believe our happiness is dependent upon that goal , but once we attain it , we get no lasting satisfaction .
Then once again , our greed and desire will arise , looking outside of ourselves for the next thing that will hopefully bring satisfaction .
Influenced by greed , we are never content .
Another common face of our greed shows up as a lack of generosity and compassion toward others .
Even a moment of honest and mindful introspection will reveal how deeply - rooted our greed can be .
We can experience the symptoms of our greed appearing in even the most trivial instances , and of course , greed can manifest itself in even more compulsive and destructive ways as well .
We always seem to want more , we want bigger and better , we want to fulfill our insatiable inner hunger and thirst ( craving ) .
This type of greed affects our personal lives , our professional lives , and the domain of international business and politics .
Global conflict and warfare , as well as the destruction of our precious environment are obvious symptoms of our corporate and political greed .
Our greed , craving , and thirst affects each of us on a personal and global level .
Our greed is an endless and pernicious cycle that only brings suffering and unhappiness in its wake .
HATRED
The symptoms of hatred can show up as anger , hostility , dislike , aversion , or ill - will ; wishing harm or suffering upon another person .
With aversion , we habitually resist , deny , and avoid unpleasant feelings , circumstances , and people we do not like .
We want everything to be pleasant , comfortable , and satisfying all the time .
This behavior simply reinforces our perception of duality and separation .
Hatred or anger thrusts us into a vicious cycle of always finding conflict and enemies everywhere around us .
When there is conflict or perceived enemies around us , our mind is neurotic , never calm ; we are endlessly occupied with strategies of self - protection or revenge .
We can also create conflict within ourselves when we have an aversion to our own uncomfortable feelings .
With hatred and aversion , we deny , resist , and push away our own inner feelings of fear , hurt , loneliness , and so forth , treating these feelings like an internal enemy .
With the poison of hatred , we create conflict and enemies in the world around us and within our own being .
DELUSION
Delusion is our wrong understanding or wrong views of reality .
Delusion is our misperception of the way the world works ; our inability to understand the nature of things exactly as they are , free of perceptual distortions .
Influenced by delusion , we are not in harmony with ourselves , others , or with life ; we are not living in accordance with Dharma .
Affected by the poison of delusion , which arises from ignorance of our true nature , we do not understand the interdependent and impermanent nature of life .
Thus , we are constantly looking outside of ourselves for happiness , satisfaction , and solutions to our problems .
This outward searching creates even more frustration , anger , and delusion .
Because of our delusion , we also do not understand the virtuous , life - affirming actions that create happiness , nor do we understand the non virtuous , negative , and unwholesome actions that create suffering .
Again , our delusion binds us to a vicious cycle where there does not appear to be any way out .
TRANSFORMING THE THREE POISONS
For countless eons we have been influenced and motivated by our greed , hatred , and delusion .
Therefore , this work of purification and transformation cannot be effected hastily , in obedience to our impatient demand for quick results .
This work requires patience , care , persistence , and deep compassion for ourselves and others .
The Buddha taught us that the poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion , which cause so much suffering , can indeed be purified and transformed .
We can break the chain of suffering and negative karma and live a happy , fulfilling life .
The Buddha ’s excellent teachings tell us that enlightenment is our true nature , and will naturally shine forth through the purified mind and heart .
Therefore , the goal of our spiritual practice is to liberate ourselves from the defilements that obscure the natural clarity , radiance , and joy of our enlightenment .
So how do we encounter the three poisons and transform them in a way that leads to genuine liberation ?
We must begin this work of purification in the precise place where the poisons originate — in the mind itself ( the conditioned ego or personality ) .
This purification and transformation begins with the challenge of calming the mind and seeing deeply into ourselves .
In other words , to eliminate the poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion , we must first learn to recognize them when they first appear .
Being mindful and aware , we can then discern how these deep - seated poisons influence our everyday thoughts , feelings , speech , and actions .
This mindful awareness , this seeing deeply into ourselves , is the beginning of understanding ; the beginning of our ability to transform these defilements .
To accomplish this awareness , we train our mind through meditation .
We learn to concentrate on our breathing at the tip of the nose ( or the abdomen in Zen training ) , allowing all thoughts and feelings to arise and pass without reacting to them or evaluating them .
Through this practice , we become much more aware of ourselves in everyday situations .
We are able to notice when thoughts and emotions arise and begin to disturb us .
In this way , we can be conscious of these thoughts and emotions and work with them skillfully before they get out of control , causing harm to ourselves and others .
THE ANTIDOTES
In addition to meditation practice , there are also the antidotes or alternatives to the three poisons .
The Buddha has given us the antidote for every defilement ; the method whereby we eliminate unwholesome mental attitudes and replace them with virtuous , wholesome attitudes which benefit ourselves and others .
Therefore , the entire aim of spiritual practice is to gradually subdue the poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion by cultivating the alternative mental factors that are directly opposed to them .
These antidotes are called the three wholesome roots : non-greed , non-hatred , and non-delusion .
To antidote and overcome greed :
…we learn to cultivate selflessness , generosity , detachment , and contentment .
If we are experiencing greed , strong desire , or attachment and we want to let it go , we can contemplate the impermanence or the disadvantages of the objects of our desire .
We can practice giving away those things we would most like to hold onto .
We can also practice acts of selfless service and charity , offering care and assistance to others in any way we can , free of all desire for recognition or compensation .
In truth , there is no objection to enjoying and sharing the beauty , pleasures , and objects of this material world .
The problems associated with greed and attachment only arise when we mistakenly believe and act as if the source of our happiness is outside of us .
To antidote and overcome hatred :
…we learn to cultivate loving - kindness , compassion , patience , and forgiveness .
When we react to unpleasant feelings , circumstances , or people , with hatred , anger , or aversion , we can use these sublime antidotes to counteract the poisons .
Here we learn to openly embrace the entire spectrum of our experiences without hatred or aversion .
Just as we practice meeting unpleasant experiences in the outer world with patience , kindness , forgiveness , and compassion , we must also practice meeting our own unpleasant feelings in the same way .
Our feelings of loneliness , hurt , doubt , fear , insecurity , inadequacy , depression , and so forth , all require our openness and loving - kindness .
Our challenge in spiritual practice is to soften our habitual defenses , open our heart , and let go of hatred , aversion , and denial .
In this way , we can meet and embrace ourselves , others , and all inner and outer experiences with great compassion and wisdom .
To antidote and overcome delusion :
…we cultivate wisdom , insight , and right understanding .
Learning to experience reality exactly as it is , without the distortions of our self - centered desires , fears , and expectations , we free ourselves from delusion .
Deeply sensing and acting in harmony with the interdependent , impermanent , and ever - changing nature of this world — realizing that all living beings are inseparably related and that lasting happiness does not come from anything external — we free ourselves from delusion .
As we develop a clear understanding of karma , knowing the positive , wholesome actions that bring happiness and the negative , unwholesome actions that bring suffering , we cultivate the wisdom , insight , and right understanding that free us from delusion .
By studying the Dharma and applying the teachings properly in our lives , we will gradually wear away even the most stubborn habitual behaviors , fully liberating ourselves from stress , unhappiness , and suffering .
The Buddha calls this the “ taintless liberation of the mind . ”
When the three poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion have finally been extinguished , the sublime peace , wisdom , unity , and bliss of Nirvana shine forth as our essential nature .

Via : Cnet :
A federal judge has ruled that border agents cannot seize a traveler ’s laptop , keep it locked up for months , and examine it for contraband files without a warrant half a year later .
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey
White in the Northern District of California rejected the Obama administration ’s argument that no warrant was necessary to look through the electronic files of an American citizen who was returning home from a trip to South Korea .
“ The court concludes that June search required a warrant , ” White ruled on June 2 , referring to a search of Andrew Hanson ’s computer that took place a year ago .
Hanson arrived San Francisco International Airport in January 2009 .
The Justice Department invoked a novel argument –which White dubbed “ unpersuasive ” –claiming that while Hanson was able to enter the country , his laptop remained in a kind of legal limbo where the Bill of Rights did not apply .
( The Fourth Amendment generally requires a warrant for searches . )
“ Until merchandise has cleared customs , it may not enter the United States , ” assistant U.S. attorney Owen Martikan argued .
“ The laptop never cleared customs and was maintained in government custody until it was searched … ”
This is not exactly a new dispute : two years ago , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ’s Customs and Border Protection announced that it reserves the right to seize for an indefinite period of time any laptops that are taken across the border .
Last year , the department reiterated that claim , saying laptops and electronic gadgetry can still be seized and held indefinitely .
There ’s no requirement that they be returned to their owners after even six months or a year has passed , though supervisory approval is required if they ’re held for more than 15 days .
The complete contents of a hard drive or memory card can be perused at length for evidence of lawbreaking of any kind , even if it ’s underpaying taxes or not paying parking tickets .

This is a bit of a modified recipe .
Like you should do with any recipe , read it through before beginning ( I have made this mistake , people , and it has resulted in many nights of delivery ! ) because this one gets to adding ingredients quickly and you wo n’t have time to run back and forth and read what ’s supposed to happen next .
Since this is n’t a traditional Pad Thai , the ingredients list got pretty flexible .
I used what I had on hand , and it turned out really delicious !
I did n’t like the look of the bean sprouts , so they got left out of the recipe at the last minute .
I read several different recipes online and was aghast at how many ingredients I did n’t have ( and was n’t willing to drop a ton of money on – I do n’t eat Pad Thai * that * much ! ) – so I winged it ( as I tend to do when cooking anyways ) .
I used :
packaged Pad
Thai sauce ( see , I told you this would be easy ! )
thin rice noodles prepared according to package ( soaked in hot water for about 20 min )
one large boneless , skinless chicken breast , sliced into bite size pieces
( optional – a few small shrimp .
I do n’t use them because I ’m allergic , but it ’s traditional )
three organic carrots , peeled , julienned
half a crown of broccoli , cut into florets
two free range eggs
tiny bit of finely chopped garlic ( if desired )
olive oil
ground peanuts
squeeze of lime
You ’re supposed to use the wok for optimal temperature control for this dish .
Well , I do n’t have one , so …there .
I used my only large sautee pan , and I got the hell over it .
Heat the oil ( a couple of tablespoons ought to be fine ) over high heat for a minute .
Okay , here ’s where things go in pretty quick succession .
Add the chicken , and cook for about 1 - 2 minutes , stirring .
Add a pinch of chopped garlic if you ’re using it , and a couple tablespoons of the Pad Thai sauce .
Add carrots and broccoli , stirring .
Add your prepared , drained noodles and most of the rest of the sauce .
Stir well , making sure noodles are n’t clumping .
If they ’re taking too long to cook fully – add a bit of water .
If they ’re sticking to each other , add a little more oil ) .
When the noodles are done ( a couple of minutes , it ’s not an exact science ) , push them to the side of the wok and crack an egg into the middle .
Let set for 15 seconds , then stir everything together .
Add bean sprouts and ground peanuts ( and shrimp , if you ’re using them ) at this point , as well as the last couple tablespoons of your sauce .
Another couple minutes over the heat and it ’s done .
This recipe makes two really good size bowls of pad thai .
Serve with extra ground peanuts , chopped chives and squeezes of lime .
DELICIOUS , even if it ’s not true to the original Pad Thai .
I like more veggies than they do , I guess !
Enjoy !
I think most tea lovers ( at least the geeky ones ) will agree with me that restaurants , as a whole , are a terrible place to have tea .
The standard seems to be a thick mug with a teabag in it , too - cool water , and no idea how long it ’s been steeping when it comes to the table or where the teabag came from .
For the last several months , my partner and I have been “ eating down the street ” –that is , each Friday we go out to dinner at the next neighborhood , locally - owned restaurant down the street .
Not only is it a nice break from having to do the dishes but it also started as a way to help the local economy by spending money at places owned by our neighbors .
Last night , though , it struck me that I should talk about the tea service at these places–or , as my partner put it , “ a very highly specialized subset of restaurant reviews . ”
So I start with last night ’s experience at Carmelita , a trendy , high - end vegetarian restaurant .
The first thing I noticed ( about the tea , at least ) was the menu .
It was better than most in that it gave both the brand / vendor name –Barnes & Watson Fine Teas–and specifically which teas / flavors they carried as well as a brief description of each tea .
Full disclosure : I have a business relationship with Barnes & Watson , though I ’m not receiving anything for this mention of them , nor anything special from Carmelita .
I ordered the Genmaicha ( “ Japanese Sencha green tea and toasted rice ” ) and my partner ordered the Tahitian Blend Iced Tea ( “ black tea blend , tropical fruit flavor and citrus ” ) .
The hot tea came as loose tea leaf in a French press and our server informed me that it had been steeping for about one minute so that I could gauge how long to continue steeping .
( I got distracted with a discussion of the menu , though , so I let it steep too long anyway and did n’t really notice the water temperature … but the fact that I was given the time it had been in the water already without having to ask earns lots of points . )
The iced tea came as you might expect , in a tall glass with ice and a straw , a slice of lemon on the side .
In addition , in another nice touch , there was a small creamer - style pitcher of simple syrup rather than the usual box of sugar packets .
As my partner pointed out , it made it much easier to sweeten the iced tea without constant stirring to dissolve solid sugar .
As I said , I let my Genmaicha brew too long ( my own fault ) so that was n’t an ideal experience .
The refill on the iced tea must have been from the bottom of the batch or something because after the glass was topped off it was a little too … something slightly unpleasant .
Metallic - tasting , maybe ?
However , on the whole , Carmelita seemed to be getting it right in ways that most restaurants don’t–loose tea , important brewing information , simple syrup instead of dry sugar for an iced tea , and actually listing where the tea came from and the various flavors rather than just “ Tea ” on the menu .
Oh , and the tea , both hot and iced , was $ 2 each .
President Obama 's comments about the BP oil spill are not " anti-British " , the American ambassador to London has said .
Do you agree ?
Mr Obama 's blunt criticism of BP over the spill has prompted accusations of " anti-British " language .
He has often referred to BP as " British Petroleum " when discussing the disastrous oil leak , even though the company has not used this name since 1998 .
Although BP was founded as a British company and has a British boss in Tony Hayward , BP is very much a global company : it 's 44 % owned in the UK , split largely between 33 institutions and seven large individual investors .
US investors own 39 % of the company , including 25 institutional and 14 big individual investors .
Is the US using the British history of BP for political motives ?
Has the oil spill made you think differently about Britain ?
Does the history of a multi-national matter ?
How should Britain respond ?
This debate is now closed .
Thank you for your comments .
North Carolinians made their choice in the 13th Congressional District Republican runoff last night .
And most of them went with the guy whose take on the worst environmental disaster in the nation 's history makes Oliver Stone 's JFK look like a Ken Burns documentary .
Bill Randall , a tea partier who made headlines with his suggestion that BP and the federal government worked together to blow up the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in April , decisively won last night 's runoff , defeating magazine publisher ( and relatively more mainstream Republican ) Bernie Reeves by a margin of 59 % to 41 % .
Randall will now carry his party 's flag to the general election , where he 'll face incumbent Rep. Brad Miller ( D ) .
It 's a safe Democratic seat , not one that anyone really expects Miller to lose .
But Randall 's presence on the campaign trail could pose something of an embarrassing problem for Republicans in North Carolina .
Democrats in the state already plan to hit Republicans on oil drilling politics in the fall .
Randall 's take on the spill could bring up uncomfortable memories for Republicans of classic spill - related gaffes from former FEMA director Michael Brown and Rep. Joe Barton ( R - TX ) .
The man Randall defeated last night in the Republican primary has certainly suggested that Randall 's stances could be a problem for Republicans in the fall .
But he said that when it comes to Republicans in NC - 13 , the most important thing to remember is caveat emptor .
" " The people have spoken , " Reeves told the Raleigh , NC News & Observer .
" It 's sort of like anarchy out there , where qualifications and credentials do n't matter . "
Randall did not immediately respond to a request for comment this morning .
Image caption PM Netanyahu said the list of banned items would be published quickly
Israel has given details of its plan to ease the blockade of Gaza , with all civilian goods now expected to be let into the territory .
Israel will allow items into Gaza unless they feature on a new list which specifies banned goods .
The move will let in humanitarian aid , food and building supplies .
Israel tightened the Gaza blockade in 2007 , but has faced heavy criticism since the recent killing of nine people on an aid flotilla heading to Gaza .
In a statement , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a long list of previously banned items , which included some food , domestic equipment and building materials would be replaced by a shorter , specific list of " weapons and war materiel " .
Analysis
The US said today that it thinks Israel 's new policy should improve life for the people of Gaza .
Washington was among many of the country 's allies making clear it was time for change - that a flawed policy must be significantly modified , if not abandoned altogether .
No Israeli leader likes to back down or admit defeat in the face of international pressure .
Last week Benjamin Netanyahu said in a brief statement that the flow of civilian goods into Gaza was being " liberalised " .
It was n't enough for some .
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank said that the proposals were cosmetic and that the embargo must be lifted altogether .
Today's , more detailed , plans wo n't placate those who call for the totally free movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza .
Nonetheless , by abandoning the list of goods which are allowed in - to be replaced by a more specific list of proscribed items - Israel will gain the approval of many who saw it 's Gaza policy as counter - productive and amounting to collective punishment .
" From now on , there is a green light approval for all goods to enter Gaza except for military items and materials that can strengthen Hamas 's military machine , " Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the AFP news agency .
In Washington , a White House spokesman said the Israeli move " should improve life for the people of Gaza " , and urged all parties to avoid " unnecessary confrontation " going forward .
Security maintained
The changes to the terms of the blockade had been proposed by Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair .
Speaking after the deal was announced , Mr Blair said Hamas , which runs the Gaza Strip , could become part of a peace process by releasing captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and renouncing violence .
But he insisted that his main concern was about quality of life in the territory .
" My concern is if you improve the lives of people in Gaza ...
I think you have got a far better of chance of creating peace , " he told the BBC .
In its statement , Israel pledged to expand operations at land crossings into Gaza , increasing the capacity for inspecting and transferring goods into the territory .
Items classified as " dual-use " ( suitable for civilian or military use ) would be reassessed and goods destined for projects such as UN - backed housebuilding would be assured of entry , an Israeli government statement said .
There was also a promise to " streamline " the entry and exit of people for humanitarian and medical reasons .
Gazans have limited access to medical facilities and seriously ill Palestinians often require urgent medical attention inside Israel .
Israel said it would maintain its naval blockade of Gaza .
Mr Blair added that all goods destined for Gaza and sent by sea would be diverted via the Israeli port of Ashdod .
But Israel also insisted that it would maintain its current " security regime " for Gaza , and said its troops would continue to work to stop the smuggling of weapons into and out of the territory .
The decision to ease the blockade was made last week after two days of discussion by the country 's security cabinet .
There was no immediate reaction from Palestinians to Israel 's decision , but the plan was dismissed by Palestinian groups last week as a " pointless gesture " .
They called for the blockade to be lifted completely .
KEY ENTRY POINTS INTO GAZA
The mature human brain is organized into a collection of specialized functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions .
Studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks .
In this report , we combine resting state functional connectivity MRI ( rs - fcMRI ) , graph analysis , community detection , and spring - embedding visualization techniques to analyze four separate networks defined in earlier studies .
As we have previously reported , we find , across development , a trend toward ‘ segregation ’ ( a general decrease in correlation strength ) between regions close in anatomical space and ‘ integration ’ ( an increased correlation strength ) between selected regions distant in space .
The generalization of these earlier trends across multiple networks suggests that this is a general developmental principle for changes in functional connectivity that would extend to large - scale graph theoretic analyses of large - scale brain networks .
Communities in children are predominantly arranged by anatomical proximity , while communities in adults predominantly reflect functional relationships , as defined from adult fMRI studies .
In sum , over development , the organization of multiple functional networks shifts from a local anatomical emphasis in children to a more “ distributed ” architecture in young adults .
We argue that this “ local to distributed ” developmental characterization has important implications for understanding the development of neural systems underlying cognition .
Further , graph metrics ( e.g. , clustering coefficients and average path lengths ) are similar in child and adult graphs , with both showing “ small - world ” - like properties , while community detection by modularity optimization reveals stable communities within the graphs that are clearly different between young children and young adults .
These observations suggest that early school age children and adults both have relatively efficient systems that may solve similar information processing problems in divergent ways .
The first two decades of life represent a period of extraordinary developmental change in sensory , motor , and cognitive abilities .
One of the ultimate goals of developmental cognitive neuroscience is to link the complex behavioral milestones that occur throughout this time period with the equally intricate functional and structural changes of the underlying neural substrate .
Achieving this goal would not only give us a deeper understanding of normal development but also a richer insight into the nature of developmental disorders .
In this report , we use computational analyses , in combination with a recently developed MRI technique that measures spontaneous brain activity , to help us to understand the principles that guide the maturation of the human brain .
We find that brain regions in children communicate with other regions more locally but that over age communication becomes more distributed .
Interestingly , the efficiency of communication in children ( measured as a ‘ small world ’ network ) is comparable to that of the adult .
We argue that these findings have important implications for understanding both the maturation and the function of neural systems in typical and atypical development .

Because of the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent use of terminology between neuroscience and the computational sciences , we will briefly define two terms for the purposes of this paper .
The term “ networks ” will be used in the typical cognitive neuroscience formulation : a group of functionally related brain regions ( as described above ) .
The overall collection of regions ( encompassing all four “ networks ” ) will be referred to as the “ graph . ”
The observation that different analyses suggested different developmental features suggests a need for a more nuanced and integrated characterization of the development of functional networks .
The goal of this manuscript is to employ several different network analysis tools to provide such a characterization .
Visualization techniques such as spring embedding , and quantitative measures , including ‘ small world ’ metrics and community detection algorithms , will be applied to these networks in an attempt to identify principles for the changes observed across development .
The development of the default mode network was independently examined in a separate analysis [ 32 ] .
In children , the default mode network was only sparsely functionally connected .
Many regions were relatively isolated with few or no functional connections to other default mode regions .
Over age , correlations within the default mode network increased and by adulthood it had matured into a fully integrated system .
Interestingly , as opposed to the task - control and cerebellar networks , very few short - range functional connections involving the default mode network regions existed in children .
Hence the numerous strong short - range functional connections that decreased with age when investigating the dual control networks were not seen within the default network .
In fact , some connections such as the functional connection between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ; −3 , 39 , − 2 ) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex ( amPFC ; 1 , 54 , 21 ) regions , which are fairly close in space ( i.e. , short - range at ∼ 2.7 cm ) , had a substantial increase in correlation strength over development [ 32 ] .
In two prior developmental studies , we used rs -fcMRI to examine the development of the task control and cerebellar functional networks [ 22 ] and , separately , the default mode network [ 32 ] .
The first study , addressing functional connectivity changes within and between the two task control networks and the cerebellar network [ 22 ] , showed that the structure of these networks differed between children and adults in several ways ( see [ 22 ] ) .
In general , many of the specific changes showed trends of decreases in short - range functional connections ( i.e. , correlations between regions close in space ) and increases in long - range functional connections ( i.e. , correlations between regions more distant in space ) .
We suggested that these global developmental processes support the maturation of a dual - control system and its functional connections with the cerebellar network [ 22 ] .
These results have now been replicated in a developmental resting connectivity study targeting sub-regions of the anterior cingulate [ 34 ] .
Another functional network , and one of the most prominent sets of regions to be examined with rs -fcMRI , is the “ default mode network ” .
The default mode network ( frequently described as being composed of the bilateral posterior cingulate / precuneus , inferior parietal cortex , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex ) was first characterized by a consistent decrease in activity during goal - directed tasks compared to baseline [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
Resting - state fcMRI analyses have repeatedly shown that these regions , along with associated medial temporal regions , are correlated at rest in adults [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 40 ] .
While the distinct function of the default mode network is often linked to internally directed mental activity [ 39 ] , this notion continues to be debated [ 25 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 41 ] – [ 44 ] .
In previous work regarding task - level control in adults , we applied rs -fcMRI to a set of regions derived from an fMRI meta - analysis that included studies of control - demanding tasks .
This analysis revealed that brain regions exhibiting different combinations of control signals across many tasks are grouped into distinct “ fronto - parietal ” and “ cingulo - opercular ” functional networks [ 21 ] , [ 36 ] ( see Table 1 and Figure 1 ) .
Based on functional activation profiles of these regions characterized in the previous fMRI study , the fronto - parietal network appears to act on a shorter timescale , initiating and adjusting top - down control .
In contrast , the cingulo - opercular network operates on a longer timescale providing “ set- initiation ” and stable “ set- maintenance ” for the duration of task blocks [ 37 ] .
In addition to fMRI activation studies , the relatively new and increasingly utilized method of resting state functional connectivity MRI ( rs - fcMRI ) allows for a complementary examination of the functional relationships between regions across development .
Resting state fcMRI is based on the discovery that spontaneous low - frequency ( < ∼0.1 Hz ) blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signal fluctuations in sometimes distant , but functionally - related grey matter regions , show strong correlations at rest [ 11 ] .
These low frequency BOLD fluctuations appear to relate to spontaneous neural activity [ 11 ] – [ 13 ] .
In effect , rs -fcMRI evaluates regional interactions that occur when a subject is not performing an explicit task ( i.e. , subjects are “ at rest ” ) [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] – [ 23 ] .
To date , rs -fcMRI has been used in several domains to examine systems - level organization of motor [ 11 ] , memory [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , attention [ 26 ] , and task control systems [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] .
A major portion of the work investigating the nature of functional human brain development is based on results from functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) studies .
By examining the differences in the fMRI activation profile of a particular brain region between children , adolescents , and adults , the developmental trajectory of that region 's involvement in a cognitive task can be outlined [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] – [ 10 ] .
These experiments have been crucial to our current understanding of typical and atypical brain development .
The mature human brain is both structurally and functionally specialized , such that discrete areas of the cerebral cortex perform distinct types of information processing .
These areas are organized into functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions .
Studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks . [ 1 ] – [ 6 ] .
As previously reported [ 21 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] , relative to comparable lattice and completely random graphs , the adult graph architecture showed high clustering coefficients and short path lengths , consistent with the ‘ small world ’ architecture ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
Interestingly for these networks , in children ( i.e. , as early as age 8 ) , these metrics were quite similar to adults ( Figure 3B and 3C ) , and over age there was very little change in path lengths and clustering coefficients relative to comparable random and lattice graphs .
It was originally anticipated that path lengths would decrease over age as long - range anatomical connections were added .
Yet even at the youngest ages examined , path length was already quite short , near those of random graphs .
Importantly , these results were not dependent on any particular threshold ( Figure S5 ) .
We note that while the results shown here are largely descriptive , the error bars provided in Figure 3B and 3C constructed from random graphs underscores the difference between random configurations and the observed trends .
Watts and Strogatz , and others , often describe “ small world ” properties with two metrics : the average clustering coefficient and average path length of a graph .
The clustering coefficient measures how well connected the neighbors of a node are to one another .
The average path length measures the average minimum number of steps needed to go between any two nodes .
Lattices , optimized for local processes , have high average clustering coefficients but long average path lengths .
Conversely , random graphs , which have no preference for short - range connections , have low average clustering coefficients and short average path lengths , making them well suited for communication between distant nodes .
One of Watts & Strogatz 's key insights was that by randomly rewiring a relatively small number of connections in a lattice graph ( i.e. , introducing a few long - range connections ) , a graph could retain its high average clustering coefficient , but dramatically reduce its average path length , thereby enabling efficient short - and long - range processes .
It is this hybrid graph topology ( i.e. , high clustering coefficients and short path lengths ) that matches the observed “ small world ” networks in many complex systems [ 47 ] .
In a seminal 1998 paper , Watts and Strogatz noted that the topology of many complex systems can be described as “ small world ” , a type of graph architecture that efficiently permits both local and distributed processing .
Graphs with a regular , lattice - like structure have abundant short - range connections , but no long - range connections .
Local interactions are thus efficient , but distributed processes involving distant nodes require the traversal of many intermediate connections .
Conversely , completely randomly connected graphs are fairly efficient at transferring distant or long - range signals across a network , but they are poor at local , short - range information transfer .
In this figure , functional connections are divided based on distance .
Short - range functional connections are in ( A , B ) , long - range functional connections ( C, D ) ( y - axis , adult r-values ; x- axis child r-values ) .
Warm colors represent functional connections that are significantly greater in adults than children .
Cool colors represent functional connections that are significantly greater in children than adults .
Functional connections that do not significantly change with age are plotted in grey .
As can be seen in ( A , B ) , the majority of short - range functional connections that significantly change with age tend to decrease .
The majority of long - range functional connections ( C, D ) that significantly change with age increase over time .
However , many long and short - range functional connections do not significantly change over age ( grey ) .
In addition , while few , some long and short - range functional connections go against the general trend of short - range connections “ growing down ” and long - range functional connections “ growing up . ”
See Figure S2 for an extended version of this figure , which includes a visualization of these functional connections on a semi- transparent brain .
As in Figure 3 , a modularity algorithm was applied to each matrix of the sliding boxcar across age ( A ) and with varying thresholds ( B , C ) .
Region legends are color coded by anatomy on the left and by adult functional network on the right ( colors match Figure 2 ) .
( A ) The left side of the box represents the community assignments for the youngest subjects ( i.e. , subjects 1–60 ) , and the right side of the box represents the community assignments for the oldest subjects ( i.e. , subjects 151 –210 ) - an age scale is presented at the top .
As can be seen in the left of panel A , the modularity algorithm divided regions into communities arranged by anatomical proximity .
Over age this organization transitions into modules arranged by adult functional properties .
For this central panel a threshold of r≥0.1 was used to denote connected versus non-connected region pairs .
( B ) Community assignments of the youngest boxcar ( subjects 1–60 ) , at thresholds ranging from 0 to 0.20 .
Regardless of threshold regions are largely organized by anatomical proximity in this youngest age group .
( C ) Community assignments of the oldest boxcar ( subjects 151–210 ) , at thresholds ranging from 0 to 0.20 .
Regardless of threshold regions are largely organized by adult function in this oldest group .
In this figure a modularity optimization algorithm is applied , and average clustering coefficients and average path lengths are calculated for each average matrix of the ‘ sliding boxcar ’ across age ( see Materials and Methods ) .
A threshold of r≥0.1 was applied to the matrices before calculations were performed and denotes connected versus non-connected region pairs ( see Materials and Methods ) .
( A ) From childhood through adulthood modularity ( Q ) remains high and constant .
This result is not dependent on a specific threshold as shown in Figure S1 .
( Note : All age graphs to the right the asterisk show 100 % graph connectedness , meaning there is a path between every node in the network .
Graphs to the left of the asterisk are 78 % graph connected , on average .
For details see Materials and Methods and Figure S1 ) .
( B ) Relative to equivalent lattice and random networks , average clustering coefficients remain high across age and do not appear to be different between children and adults .
( C ) Relative to equivalent lattice and random networks , average path lengths remain low across age and do not appear to be different between children and adults .
High clustering coefficients and short path lengths suggest a ‘ small world ’ organization that does not change across the age range studied here .
95 % confidence intervals are also plotted for clustering coefficients and path lengths for the generated random graphs .
Measures of modularity ( Q ) were high , and did not show large changes across the age range ( Figure 3A and Figure S1 and Figure S2 ) .
This result was not dependent on any particular threshold ( Figure S1 ) .
Although comparable community structure was detected at all ages examined , the components of the communities varied by age .
As per our qualitative approach described above , in children , region clusters were largely arranged by cerebral lobe ; while in adults , regions were largely clustered by their adult functional properties ( Figure 4A ) .
Again , this result was not unique to any particular threshold ( Figure 4B and 4C ) or size of boxcar ( Figure S3 ) .
We do note , however , that limited data points ( i.e. , subjects ) are available between the ages of 16 and 19 years ( see Materials and Methods ) and that our estimate of the specific transitions within this period should be interpreted with care .
Among the many methods used to detect communities in graphs , the modularity optimization algorithm of Newman is one of the most efficient and accurate to date [ 46 ] .
This method uses modularity , a quantitative measure of the observed versus expected intra-community connections , as a means to guide assignments of nodes into communities .
We applied the modularity optimization algorithm to the group connectivity matrices derived from the sliding boxcars described above .
“ A good division of a graph into communities is not merely one in which there are few edges between communities ; it is one in which there are fewer than expected edges between communities .
If the number of edges between two groups is only what one would expect on the basis of random chance , then few thoughtful observers would claim this constitutes evidence of meaningful community structure .
On the other hand , if the number of edges between groups is significantly less than we expect by chance , or equivalently if the number within groups is significantly more , then it is reasonable to conclude that something interesting is going on [ 46 ] . ”
The qualitative observations noted above can be quantified using community structure detection tools .
Using such an approach is particularly important because of the bias inherent in relying on qualitative methods for deciding whether groups of regions that appear to be clustered are indeed clustered , and because of the a priori definitions of each network .
As stated by Newman :
Accompanying this segregation is strong integration within the functional networks .
The default mode network provides the clearest example .
As illustrated in Figure 2B ( and in Video S1 ) , correlations between regions of the default mode network are weak ( or absent ) in children ( red cloud , Figure 2B ) .
Just as functional connections between the set of frontal regions are related to their anatomical proximity in children , the regions of the default mode network are each functionally connected to anatomical neighbors , and not to other members of the anatomically dispersed default mode network .
Over age , however , the functional connections between default mode network regions mature and the network integrates into a highly correlated system in adults ( Figure 2B and Video S1 ) ( also see [ 32 ] ) .
We note that these results were not specific to the 60 - subject boxcar , and persist with smaller subject boxcars as well ( see Video S2 ) .
A group of regions in the frontal cortex provides a particularly salient example of segregation .
Frontal cortex contains regions that , in adults , are members of each of the task - control networks ( e.g. , dlPFC , frontal , dACC / msFC ) and the default network ( e.g. , vmPFC , amPFC ) .
As can be seen in Figure 2A ( and Video S1 ) , extensive correlations exist between most of these frontal regions in childhood ( see blue cloud Figure 2A ) .
Over the developmental window afforded by the current dataset , some of these strong “ frontal - frontal ” correlations begin to weaken .
With increasing age , regions in the frontal cluster segregate into 3 separate functional networks .
One of the primary observations from the movie relates to this anatomical - functional distinction .
In children , regions appear to be largely arranged by anatomical proximity .
This arrangement can be seen in Figure 2 and Video S1 where , in children , regions can be readily grouped by cerebral lobe ( outline colors of spheres in Figure 2 and Video S1 ) .
Over age , as functional connections mature , the node arrangements change such that anatomically close regions are now largely distributed across the graph layout , in a pattern more aligned with the mature networks ' functional properties ( core colors of spheres in Figure 2 ) [ 21 ] , [ 36 ] – [ 39 ] .
Thus , across development , local clusters of regions “ segregate ” from one another and “ integrate ” into more distributed adult functional relationships with more distant regions .
By creating spring embedded graphs for each of the sliding boxcar groups in age - order , a movie representation can be made that shows the development of the network relationships ( from average age 8.48 to 25.48 years ) ( Video S1 ) .
The panels in Figure 2 provide snapshots from child , adolescent , and adult average ages in this movie .
In both Figure 2 and Video S1 , each node is color - coded in two ways : the outer border represents the general anatomical location ( i.e. , cerebral lobe ) of the node ; the inner core color represents the coding by “ function ” as defined by a large number of fMRI studies .
In this figure we show the dynamic development and interaction of positive correlations between the two task control networks , the default network , and cerebellar network using spring embedding .
The figure highlights the segregation of local , anatomically clustered regions and the integration of functional networks over development .
A and B represent individual screen shots ( at average ages 8.48 , 13.21 , and 25.48 years ) of dynamic movies ( Video S1 ) of the transition in the network architecture from child to adult ages .
Nodes are color coded by their adult network profile ( core of the nodes ) and also by their anatomical location ( node outlines ) .
Black – cingulo - opercular network ;
Yellow – fronto - parietal network ;
Red – default network ;
Blue – cerebellar network ;
Light blue – frontal cortex ; Grey – parietal cortex ; Green - temporal cortex , Pink – cerebellum , Light pink – thalamus .
Connections with r≥0.1 were considered connected .
( A ) In children regions are largely organized by their anatomical location , but over age anatomically clustered regions segregate .
The cluster of frontal regions ( highlighted in light blue ) best demonstrates this segregation .
( B ) In children the more distributed adult functional networks are in many ways disconnected .
Over development the functional networks integrate .
The isolated regions of the default mode network in childhood ( highlighted in light red ) that coalesce into a highly correlated network best illustrate this integration .
Over age node organization shifts from the “ local ” arrangement in children to the “ distributed ” organization commonly observed in adults .
In a first analysis , we used a visualization algorithm commonly used in graph theoretic analyses known as spring embedding that aids in the qualitative interpretation of graphs ( Figure 2 and Video S1 ) [ 45 ] .
In spring embedding , the positions of the nodes ( i.e. , regions ) in a graph are based solely on the strength and pattern of functional connections instead of their anatomical locations .
In this procedure , each functional connection between a pair of nodes is treated as a spring with a spring constant related to the strength of the specific correlation .
The entire system of pair - wise regional functional connections is then iteratively allowed to relax to the lowest global energetic state , i.e. , groups of nodes that are strongly interconnected will be placed close together even if anatomically distant .
Graph theory analyses were applied to 210 subjects , aged 7 – 31 , to investigate the emergence of temporal correlations in spontaneous BOLD activity between regions of the default mode , cerebellar , and two task - control networks .
For this initial analysis , average age - group matrices were created using a sliding boxcar grouping of subjects in age - order ( i.e. , group1 : subjects 1 –60 , group2 : subjects 2 –61 , group3 : subjects 3 – 62 , etc. ) .
This generated a series of groups with average ages ranging from 8.48 years to 25.58 years .
Each of the groups ' average correlation matrices was converted into a graph , with correlations between regions greater than or equal to 0.1 considered as functionally connected .
Nonetheless , the general results presented here represent a strong set of hypotheses to be tested in broader domains and larger - scale brain graphs .
First , that by age 8 years , regional relationships , as defined by rs-fcMRI , are organized as small - world - like networks , which , relative to adults , emphasize local connections .
Second , that for the same regions , adult networks show similar network metrics but with regional relationships that have a longer - range , more distributed structure reflecting adult functional histories .
In other words , the modular structure of large - scale brain networks will change with age , but even school age children will show relatively efficient processing architecture .
A limitation of rs -fcMRI in general is the restricted frequency distribution that can be examined .
rs-fcMRI is used to measure correlations in a very low frequency range , typically below 0.1 Hz.
Dynamic changes in correlations in other frequency distributions could exist ( for example see [ 89 ] ) .
It is also possible that there are undetected developmental changes in power across frequency bands orthogonal to the changes visualized here .
The combination of other imaging and psychometric techniques with rs -fcMRI will likely help address these considerations .
Characterizing additional networks and how these changes map onto behavior will also help further characterize functional brain development .
Specifically , future work that demonstrates a direct relationship between behavior and the developmental trajectory seen here with rs -fcMRI , is presently needed to confirm ( or reject ) many of the theories presented here and elsewhere .
Importantly , consideration of these issues need not be limited to developmental studies , but should be considered whenever investigators compare groups with rs -fcMRI .
Of note , resting - state functional connectivity has been reported to be constrained by anatomical distance ( i.e. , correlations between regions decrease as a function of distance following an inverse square law ) [ 85 ] .
Thus , if a shift in this general bias occurred with development , then it is feasible that some of the changes seen here could be related to such a shift .
With this said , the specificity of the connection changes observed over age , the number of connections that run opposite to the general trends , and the similarity of the distance relationship in connectivity between children and adults when plotting all possible connections ( see Figure S6 ) , all suggest that the majority of changes observed here are not related to changes in this bias .
In addition , while there are now reports suggesting that changes observed over development with blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI are not the product of changes in hemodynamic response mechanisms over age [ 86 ] , [ 87 ] , differences in the hemodynamic response function between children and adults could conceivably affect our results [ 88 ] .
The regions used in the present analyses were all derived from adult imaging studies .
It seems likely that additional regions may be included in one or more of these networks in childhood .
In addition , individual differences with regards to the regions and networks chosen likely exist .
Future work that includes regions derived from studies using a child population and obtaining the functional connections within subjects from individually defined functional areas may refine the networks and developmental timecourses presented here [ 84 ] .
While we identified small world properties in both child and adult graphs , the size of the graph is relatively small with only 34 nodes .
Therefore , it is possible that with an increased number of nodes the specific results identified here will change , a possibility that will be addressed in further studies .
This result can be explained in the context of the re-wiring procedure discussed by Watts and Strogatz [ 47 ] .
Randomly rewiring a small percentage of local connections in a lattice has a mild linear effect on clustering coefficients , but a highly non -linear effect on path lengths .
This is to say , that by rewiring a small fraction of a lattice 's connections , substantial drops in path lengths can be seen , with almost no change in the clustering coefficient .
In late childhood , as shown in Figure 5 and Figure S2 , there are already a significant number of long - range short cuts present .
These long - range functional connections are likely responsible for the relatively short path lengths in the child group .
We anticipate that if the developmental trajectory of short and long - range functional connections were extended to younger ages , fewer long - range ‘ short - cut ’ functional connections would be present , and more short - range functional connections would exist .
Hence , the path lengths at these younger ages ( < 7 years old ) would likely be longer .
Nevertheless , by 8 years old , the networks already display ‘ small world ’ properties similar to those of adult networks , indicating that efficient graph structures are already in place for both local and distant processing , though they are organized differently than in later development .
The “ local to distributed ” developmental trajectory , discussed above , seems to be driven by an abundance of local , short range connections that generally decrease in strength over age as well as distant , long range connections that generally increase in strength over age .
Given the more prevalent short - range connections in children , we expected a more lattice - like structure , with high clustering coefficients and relatively high path lengths .
The results , however , clearly indicated that path lengths were near those of equivalent random graphs , and that the child functional networks are already organized as small world networks .
Interactive specialization predicts that shortly after birth , large sets of regions and pathways will be partially active during specific task conditions , However , as these pathways interact and compete with each other throughout development , selected regions will come online , be maintained , or become selectively activated or “ tuned ” as particular pathways dominate for specific task demands .
Thus , regional specialization relies on the evolving and continuous interactions with other brain regions over development .
If one extends this framework to the network level , the increases , decreases , and maintenance of correlation strengths seen between regions may reflect “ specialization ” of specific neural pathways to form the functional networks seen in adults .
The “ local to distributed ” organizing principle resonates with recent suggestions that perceptual and cognitive development involve the simultaneous segregation and integration of information processing streams [ 1 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 76 ] , [ 79 ] , [ 80 ] .
For instance , the “ interactive specialization ” hypothesis advanced by Johnson and colleagues , is consistent with these findings [ 1 ] , [ 81 ] – [ 83 ] .
Johnson points out that cortical regions and pathways have biased information processing properties at birth due to anatomic connectivity , yet they are much less selective than in adults ( i.e. , they are “ broadly tuned ” ) .
We note that recent results in the aging literature suggest that many of the trajectories observed in the current manuscript continue inversely with advancing age [ 24 ] , [ 78 ] .
That is , with aging , the functional organization , revealed via rs-fcMRI , becomes less distributed and more local .
Thus the dynamic interactions we describe here likely continue as part of normal senescence [ 78 ] .
Along the same lines , as Fuster [ 77 ] has pointed out , we note that myelination is not an indispensable property of utilized axons .
Unmyelinated axonal connections are still quite capable of transmitting information .
For this reason , the first 7 years of experience dependent statistical learning may indeed result in increases in long distance functional connections well before mature myelination is in place , an idea consistent with the short average path lengths found in even the youngest networks we examined ( Figure 3 ) .
Thus , it is not surprising that some long - distant functional connections are present in children and do not statistically change with age ( Figure 5 and Figure S2 ) .
It is important to note , however , that improved communication between distant regions ( via myelination ) would not necessarily cause a wholesale decrease in connections that were originally organized locally .
Many of these local connections likely continue to contribute to the most efficient “ solution ” for any particular task and remain in use .
In fact , the change in dynamics may actually contribute to distinct local connections increasing with time .
This possibility may underlie the increases in strength of specific short - range connections seen in Figure 5 and Figure S2 .
In other words , as myelination continues through development and allows for more effective long - distance neural pathways , repeated co-activation becomes more prevalent between many distant regions , and less so between many locally aligned regions , thus changing synaptic efficiencies .
The statistical histories of such interactions , stored as relative synaptic weights , are then revealed via rs-fcMRI , and would lead to the “ local to distributed ” organization principle seen here .
Considering the continually changing nature of the neural substrate over development , a context for changes in rs-fcMRI can be created .
For instance , as previously mentioned , increased signal propagation through the addition of a myelin sheath likely allows for more efficient communication between distant regions [ 22 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 76 ] .
Such facilitated communication may promote interactions between brain regions that , previously , had substantially less efficient communication , allowing for a more effective “ solution ” to any particular set of processing demands .
In addition , as new , more efficient , pathways become prominent , older inefficient connections likely decrease in use , leading to experience / activity - dependent decreases of specific area - area connection strengths .
Another commonly referenced postnatal event is myelination .
As with synaptic pruning , myelination continues to occur through young adulthood .
Increased myelination is thought to proceed from primary sensory and motor regions to association areas [ 68 ] – [ 71 ] , roughly following the hierarchical organization introduced by Felleman and Van Essen [ 72 ]
( Note that while the most frequently referenced neuroanatomical changes that occur throughout development have been highlighted here , there are several others that deserve consideration [ 62 ] , [ 73 ] – [ 75 ] ) .
By approximately 9 months of age the elaboration of most , if not all , short and long - range axonal connections between brain regions is thought to be complete [ 61 ] .
However , synapse formation , the tuning of synaptic weights , synaptic pruning , and myelination all have unique developmental timecourses that extend further into development .
For instance , from approximately 30 weeks gestation through the first two postnatal years there is substantial growth in the number of synaptic contacts throughout the cortex [ 62 ] .
This growth is followed by a protracted period of synaptic pruning that reaches adult levels in the late second decade of life [ 63 ] – [ 65 ] .
Importantly , pruning is selective , not random .
Pruning is also largely activity dependent , and is considered critical in the differentiation of distinct functional areas [ 56 ] , [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] .
If the correlations we find in children already represent 7 years of experience - driven tuning , why should additional experience lead to a distributed solution ?
Under the current proposal , it is not clear then why resting state functional connectivity would change so dramatically over the reported age range .
One could argue that the general experiential environment and processing demands systematically change to encourage increasing use of long - range , distributed processing relationships .
We believe , however , that at least part of the explanation lies in the interaction of these “ environmental demands ” with maturational changes of the neural substrate .
If we consider the previously mentioned postulates , our results suggest that , typically , the most efficient way for children to respond to processing demands is to utilize more “ local ” level interactions as compared to adulthood .
That is , in childhood there is , relatively greater co-activation of anatomically proximal regions than for adults with similar processing demands .
A clear example of this is seen in Brown et al . [ 3 ] , where identical task performance on lexical processing tests strongly activates a large set of visual regions in children , but strong visual activation is much more restricted in adults .
These relationships may be reflected in correlated spontaneous activity measured via rs-fcMRI .
The correlations in our youngest children would then represent the anatomical and spontaneous activity - defined initial regional relationships plus 7 years of experience - dependent Hebbian processes tuning these developing connections .
As early as 1875 spontaneous synchronized neural activity has been used to study various aspects of adult brain organization [ 50 ] – [ 53 ] .
However , despite the passing of over 130 years since its initial use , there remains uncertainty as to the role of intrinsic spontaneous brain activity in brain function .
In adults , spontaneous correlated activity has been suggested to be important for gating information flow [ 54 ] , building internal representations [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 54 ] , and maintaining mature network relationships [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 54 ] .
Much less work has been done in regards to development , but there are suggestions that spontaneous activity is important for the establishment of early cortical patterns ( e.g. , ocular dominance columns ) [ 55 ] – [ 58 ] and may over time represent ( in a Hebbian sense ) a history of repeated co-activation between regions [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] .
Within this framework , the changes in the correlation structure of spontaneous activity over development seen in this report may provide insight regarding the arrangement by which brain regions are communicating in children compared to adults .
In the following section , these results are discussed considering two postulates : ( 1 ) the temporal pattern of spontaneous activity measured by rs-fcMRI represents a history of repeated co-activation between regions , and ( 2 ) the brain attempts to use the most efficient processing pathways available when faced with specific processing demands .
The combination of graph theoretic analyses and rs-fcMRI allowed for the examination of the dynamic relationships between multiple networks over development .
In the current manuscript , we examined four networks - the cingulo - opercular , fronto - parietal , cerebellar , and default mode networks .
As illustrated by qualitative observations in Figure 2 ( and Video S1 ) and modularity analysis in Figure 4 , locally organized groups of regions “ segregate ” over development into multiple distributed adult functional networks , while the functional networks themselves “ integrate . ”
These results support the hypothesis that functional brain development proceeds from a “ local ” to “ distributed ” organization .
However , despite the “ local to distributed ” developmental trend , ‘ small world ’ organizational properties are present in both 7 – 9 year old child and adult graph architecture .
Materials and Methods
Subjects Subjects were recruited from Washington University and the local community .
Participants were screened with a questionnaire to ensure that they had no history of neurological / psychiatric diagnoses or drug abuse .
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Washington University Human Studies Committee .
Data acquisition and pre-processing fMRI data were acquired on a Siemens 1.5 Tesla MAGNETOM Vision system ( Erlangen , Germany ) .
Structural images were obtained using a sagittal magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo ( MP - RAGE ) three - dimensional T1 - weighted sequence ( TE = 4 ms , TR = 9.7 ms , TI = 300 ms , flip angle = 12 deg , 128 slices with 1.25 ×1×1 mm voxels ) .
Functional images were obtained using an asymmetric spin echo echo - planar sequence sensitive to blood oxygen level - dependent ( BOLD ) contrast ( volume TR = 2.5 sec , T2 * evolution time = 50 ms , α = 90° , in - plane resolution 3.75×3.75 mm ) .
Whole brain coverage was obtained with 16 contiguous interleaved 8 mm axial slices acquired parallel to the plane transecting the anterior and posterior commissure ( AC - PC plane ) .
Steady state magnetization was assumed after 4 frames ( ∼10 s ) .
Functional images were first processed to reduce artifacts [ 23 ] , [ 90 ] .
These steps included : ( i ) removal of a central spike caused by MR signal offset , ( ii ) correction of odd vs. even slice intensity differences attributable to interleaved acquisition without gaps , ( iii ) correction for head movement within and across runs and ( iv ) within run intensity normalization to a whole brain mode value of 1000 .
Atlas transformation of the functional data was computed for each individual via the MP - RAGE scan .
Each run then was resampled in atlas space ( Talairach and Tournoux , 1988 ) on an isotropic 3 mm grid combining movement correction and atlas transformation in one interpolation [ 91 ] , [ 92 ] .
All subsequent operations were performed on the atlas - transformed volumetric timeseries .
rs-fcMRI pre-processing
For rs-fcMRI analyses as previously described [ 16 ] , [ 23 ] , several additional preprocessing steps were used to reduce spurious variance unlikely to reflect neuronal activity ( e.g. , heart rate and respiration ) .
These steps included : ( 1 ) a temporal band - pass filter ( 0.009 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz ) and spatial smoothing ( 6 mm full width at half maximum ) , ( 2 ) regression of six parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction , ( 3 ) regression of the whole brain signal averaged over the whole brain , ( 4 ) regression of ventricular signal averaged from ventricular regions of interest ( ROIs ) , and ( 5 ) regression of white matter signal averaged from white matter ROIs .
Regression of first order derivative terms for the whole brain , ventricular , and white matter signals were also included in the correlation preprocessing .
These pre-processing steps likely decrease or remove developmental changes in correlations driven by changes in respiration and heart rate over age .
Extraction of resting state timeseries Resting state ( fixation ) data from 210 subjects ( 66 aged 7–9 ; 53 aged 10 – 15 ; 91 aged 19 –31 ) were included in the analyses .
For each subject at least 555 seconds ( 9.25 minutes ) of resting state BOLD data were collected .
34 previously published regions comprising 4 functional networks ( i.e. , cingulo - opercular , fronto - parietal , cerebellar , and default networks ; see Table 1 and Figure 1 ) were used in this analysis [ 16 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 37 ] .
For each region , a resting state timeseries was extracted separately for each individual .
For 10 adult subjects , resting data was continuous .
For the remaining 200 subjects , resting periods were extracted from between task periods in blocked or mixed blocked / event - related design studies [ 22 ] .
These concatenated - extracted rest periods were shown to be equivalent to continuous resting data in a recent study describing this method [ 23 ] .
In addition , several previous findings using this technique [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 32 ] have now been replicated using continuous resting blocks [ 27 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] and other continuous resting data [ 89 ] .
Generation of average group correlation matrices across development
To examine the functional connections within and between the large set of regions used in this manuscript we chose to use graph theory .
Graph theory is particularly well suited to study large - scale systems organization across development , but requires the data be organized into specific correlation matrices .
To do this , for each of the 210 subjects , the resting state BOLD timeseries from each region was correlated with the timeseries from every other region , creating 210 square correlation matrices ( 34×34 ) .
Average group matrices were then created using a sliding boxcar grouping of subjects in age - order ( i.e. , group1 : subjects 1 –60 , group2 : subjects 2 –61 , group3 : subjects 3 – 62 , … group151 : subjects 151–210 ) , thus generating a series of groups with average ages ranging from 8.48 years old to 25.48 years old with each group composed of 60 subjects .
Average correlation coefficients ( r ) for each group were generated from the subjects ' individual matrices using the Schmidt - Hunter method for meta- analyses of r-values [ 21 ] , [ 85 ] , [ 93 ] .
In cases when the terms “ child ” or “ adult ” are used , the matrices or results referred to are the first and last of the sliding boxcar groups respectively , i.e. , the child group is the youngest 60 subjects , with an average age of 8.48 years old , and the adult group is the oldest 60 subjects , with an average age of 25.48 years old .
Spring - embedded graph theoretic layout and visualization
To generate a dynamic representation of the functional connections between regions across development , each of the groups ' correlation matrices was converted into a thresholded graph , such that correlations higher than r≥0.1 were considered connections , while correlations lower than the threshold were not connections .
For our initial analyses [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 32 ] graphs in child and adult groups were presented in either a pseudo - anatomical fashion or in their actual 3D positions ( in Talairach space ) .
Here we add another representation often used in graph theory - spring embedding .
In this procedure , a spring constant is added to all of the connections in the network allowing for the pairwise regional connections to relax to their lowest energetic state .
The algorithm applied in the present analysis is known as Kamada - Kawai [ 45 ] - one of the most commonly used strategies for displaying graph network data .
In brief , each functional connection between a pair of nodes is treated as a spring with a spring constant related to the strength of the specific correlation .
The nodes are then randomly placed in a plane , which places high strain on the “ spring - loaded ” connections .
The algorithm then iteratively adjusts the positions of each node to reduce the total energy of the system to a minimum .
As the pair - wise connections relax to their lowest energetic states the “ natural ” configuration of the network is revealed .
By observing multiple “ spring embedded ” graphs across the subjects in age - order , approximately representing a 6 month temporal sliding box car ( i.e. , group1 : subjects 1 –60 , group2 : subjects 2 –61 , etc. ) , a movie representation can be made that shows the development of the full system ( see Video S1 ) .
The interpolations , algorithm application , and movie production were performed using MATLAB ( The Mathworks , Natick , MA ) and SoNIA ( Social Network Image Animator ) [ 94 ] .
Modularity analysis Communities for our graph were detected with the modularity optimization method of Newman [ 46 ] .
The modularity , or Q , of a graph is a quantitative measure of the number of edges found within communities versus the number predicted in a random graph with equivalent degree distribution .
A positive Q indicates that the number of intra-community edges exceeds those predicted statistically .
A wide range of Q may be found for a graph , depending on how nodes are assigned to communities .
The set of node assignments that returns the highest Q is the optimal community structure sought by the modularity optimization algorithm , which follows a recursive two - step process .
First , a modularity matrix similar to a Laplacian is constructed from the nodes in question , comparing observed versus expected edges .
If this matrix has a positive eigenvalue , the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue is used to split the nodes into two subgraphs , and Q is calculated .
Second , nodes are swapped individually between the two subgraphs to see if an increase in Q can be found .
Once a maximal Q is found from these swaps , the process is repeated on the subgraphs .
At any point in this process , if the matrix has no positive eigenvalues , or if a proposed split does not increase Q , the subgraph is set aside , and defines a community .
To detect communities in our networks over a range of ages , we used the sliding boxcar group average correlation matrices described above in “ Generation of average group correlation matrices across development . ”
With weights retained , the modularity optimization algorithm was applied to each matrix along the sliding boxcar .
A range of thresholds was explored to define connections for these calculations ( see Figure 4 and Figure S1 ) .
Any particular threshold did not change the conclusions presented in the main manuscript .
A threshold of 0.10 was chosen to display in the main manuscript because it balances two principles : ( 1 ) eliminating a multitude of weak correlations , which may obscure more physiologically relevant correlations , and ( 2 ) retaining high graph connectedness , so that communities arise from partitioning and not thresholding .
Graph connectedness captures the extent of nodes fragmented from the main graph due to increasing thresholds .
It is defined for a graph of N nodes as the mean of an NxN matrix , where cell i , j is 1 if a path exists between node i and node j ( self - connections are allowed ) , and is 0 otherwise .
A graph in which all nodes can reach each other has 100 % graph connectedness , whereas a fragmented network in which some nodes cannot reach the rest has a lower connectedness .
The modularity optimization analysis returned a set of community assignments for the nodes , as well as the Q of the graph with those assignments .
The group assignments for the nodes were converted to colors and are displayed in Figure 4 .
The robustness of the community assignments was also tested using a different information theoretic procedure implemented by Meila , [ 95 ] , which utilizes the measure ‘ variation of information ( VOI ) ’ ( see Figure S7 and also [ 96 ] ) .
All calculations were performed in MATLAB ( The Mathworks , Inc. , Natick , MA ) .
Characterization of connection length versus the change in correlation strength over development
To characterize the relationship between connection length and the change in correlation strength over development , we split all 561 possible connections into 4 groups based on vector distance .
Since using vector distance as an approximate for connectional distance is much more inconsistent when comparing ROIs across the midline , only intrahemispheric connections or connections to midline structures ( i.e. , within 5 mm of the midline ) were examined .
These connections were then sorted by connection length and plotted on a graph where the x-axis corresponds to the child correlation strengths and the y - axis corresponds to the adult correlation strengths ( Figure 5 and Figure S2 ) .
On both the graphs ( Figure 5 ) and the cortical surfaces ( Figure S2 ) , the color of the lines denotes the strength of correlation .
Significant differences seen in Figure 5 and Figure S2 were obtained via direct comparison between children ( the youngest 60 children out of 210 total subjects ; age 7.01 –9.67 ; average age 8.48 ) and adults ( the oldest 60 adults out of 210 total subjects ; age 22.47–31.39 ; average age 25.48 ) .
Two - sample two - tailed t- tests ( assuming unequal variance ; p≤0.05 ) were performed on all potential connections that passed the above criteria .
Fischer z transformation was applied to the correlation coefficients to improve normality for the random effects analysis .
To account for multiple comparisons the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate [ 97 ] was applied .
Connections that were significantly different between groups , but r<0.1 in both groups , were not displayed .
A few days ago I came across an interesting article , Where the printf ( ) Rubber Meets the Road , describing how the printf function ‘ works ’ on the low level .
Commonly asked by Java beginners is the question , “ How does System.out. println ( ) work ? ” ; the above blog post inspired me to do some research into this question .
In this blog post I ’ll attempt to provide an explanation of what System.out. println ( ) does behind the scenes .
Most of the relevant code can be found on OpenJDK , which is the primary implementation of Java itself .
System.out.println ( ) may be implemented completely differently on other Java platforms .
I will warn you now that this article is very long and not for the easily bored .
First steps
Our first step in figuring out how System.out .
println works is by first understanding what System .
out is and how it came to be .
Let ’s take a look through the OpenJDK ’s Mercurial online repository .
Digging around a bit , we find System .
java .
In this file System . out is declared :
public final static PrintStream out = nullPrintStream ( ) ;
But when we find the code for nullPrintStream ( ) :
private static PrintStream nullPrintStream ( ) throws NullPointerException { if ( currentTimeMillis ( ) >
0 ) { return null ; } throw new NullPointerException ( ) ; }
So nullPrintStream ( ) simply returns null or throws an exception .
This ca n’t be it .
What ’s going on here ?
The answer can be found in the function initializeSystemClass ( ) , also in System .
java :
FileOutputStream fdOut = new FileOutputStream( FileDescriptor.out ) ; setOut0 ( new PrintStream ( new BufferedOutputStream( fdOut , 128 ) , true ) ) ;
There ’s a lot of stuff going on in this code .
I ’m going to refer back to this two lines of code later , but setOut0 ( ) is what actually initializes System.out .
The function setOut0 ( ) is a native function .
We can find its implementation in System.c :
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_java_lang_System_setOut0 ( JNIEnv *env , jclass cla , jobject stream ) { jfieldID fid = ( * env ) ->GetStaticFieldID( env, cla , " out " , " Ljava / io / PrintStream ; " ) ; if ( fid == 0 ) return ; ( * env ) ->SetStaticObject
Field( env, cla , fid , stream ) ; }
This is pretty standard JNI code that sets System . out to the argument passed to it .
At first all this deal with setting System. out to nullPrintStream ( ) and later setting it with JNI seems entirely unnecessary .
But this is actually justified .
In Java , static fields are initialized first , and everything else comes after .
So even before the JVM and the System class is fully initialized , the JVM tries to initialize System.out .
Unfortunately at this point the rest of the JVM is n’t properly initialized so it ’s impossible to reasonably set System .
out at this point .
The best that could be done would be to set it to null .
The System class , along with System. out is properly initialized in initializeSystemClass ( ) which is called by the JVM after static and thread initialization .
There is a problem , however .
System.out is final , meaning we cannot simply set it to something else in initializeSystemClass ( ) .
There ’s a way around that , however .
Using native code , it is possible to modify a final variable .
Wait , what ’s a FileDescriptor ?
Notice this line of code :
FileOutputStream fdOut = new FileOutputStream( FileDescriptor.out ) ;
A FileOutputStream object is created from something referred to as FileDescriptor .out .
The FileDescriptor class , though part of java.io , is rather elusive .
It ca n’t be found in the java .
io directory in OpenJDK .
This is because FileDescriptor is much lower level than most of the Java standard library .
While most . java files are platform independent , there are actually different implementations of FileDescriptor for different platforms .
We ’ll be using the Linux / Solaris version of FileDescriptor .
java .
A FileDescriptor object is very simple .
Essentially all it really holds is an integer .
It holds some other data too , which are n’t really important .
The constructor of FileDescriptor takes an integer and creates a FileDescriptor containing that integer .
The only use of a FileDescriptor object is to initialize a FileOutputStream object .
Let ’s see how FileDescriptor .
out is defined :
public static final FileDescriptor out = new FileDescriptor ( 1 ) ;
FileDescriptor.out is defined as 1 , in as 0 , and err as 2 .
The basis of these definitions are from a very low level somewhere in Unix .
We now know how System . out is initialized .
For now , we ’re going to leave behind the FileDescriptor ; we only need to know what it does .
A tour through java.io
Now we redirect our attentions to the println ( ) function of PrintStream .
PrintStream is a comparably higher level class , capable of writing many different kinds of data , flushing and handling errors for you without much effort .
Let ’s see how println ( ) is defined in PrintStream .
java :
public void println ( String x ) { synchronized ( this ) { print ( x ) ; newLine ( ) ; } }
Following the call stack to print ( ) :
public void print ( String s ) { if ( s == null ) { s = " null " ; } write(s ) ; }
Going deeper , and looking at write ( ) :
private void write ( String s ) { try { synchronized ( this ) { ensureOpen ( ) ; textOut.write(s ) ; textOut.flushBuffer ( ) ; charOut.flushBuffer ( ) ; if ( autoFlush && ( s.indexOf ( '
') >= 0 ) ) out .
flush ( ) ; } } catch ( InterruptedIOException x ) { Thread.currentThread ( ).interrupt( ) ; } catch ( IOException x ) { trouble = true ; } }
Internally , the PrintStream object ( System.out ) contains three different objects to do its work :
The OutputStreamWriter object ( charOut ) , writing character arrays into a stream
The BufferedWriter object ( textOut ) , writing not only character arrays but also strings and text
A BufferedOutputStream object ( out ) , passed all the way down the call stack and used much lower then at the PrintStream level
We can see that PrintStream.write ( ) calls BufferedWriter.write ( ) and flushes both buffers .
I ’m not sure why it ’s necessary to flush the charOut buffer , so I ’m going to ignore that .
Delving deeper , let ’s find the implementation of write ( ) in BufferedWriter.java .. wait it ’s not here .
The function write ( String ) is actually defined in the abstract class Writer .
java :
public void write ( String str ) throws IOException { write ( str , 0 , str.length ( ) ) ; }
Moving back to BufferedWriter :
public void write ( String s , int off , int len ) throws IOException { synchronized ( lock ) { ensureOpen ( ) ; int b = off , t = off + len ; while ( b < t ) { int d = min( nChars - next Char , t - b ) ; s.getChars ( b , b + d , cb , nextChar ) ; b += d ; nextChar += d ; if ( nextChar >= n Chars ) flushBuffer ( ) ; } } }
As its name suggests , Buffered Writer is buffered .
Data is stored in a data buffer until it ’s written all at once , or flushed .
Buffered IO is much faster than simply writing to the hardware one byte at a time .
The function BufferedWriter.write ( ) does n’t actually write anything .
It only stores something in an internal buffer .
The flushing is not done here , but back at PrintStream. write ( ) .
Let ’s go to flushBuffer ( ) , in the same file :
void flushBuffer ( ) throws IOException { synchronized ( lock ) { ensureOpen ( ) ; if ( nextChar == 0 ) return ; out .
write ( cb , 0 , nextChar ) ; nextChar = 0 ; } }
We find yet another write ( ) call , on a Writer object ( out ) .
The out object here is the charOut object of PrintStream , and has the type OutputStreamWriter .
This object is also the same object as charOut in PrintStream .
Let ’s look at OutputStreamWriter.write ( ) in OutputStreamWriter.java :
public void write ( char cbuf [ ] , int off , int len ) throws IOException { se.write ( cbuf , off , len ) ; }
This now transfers the job to another object , se .
This object is of type sun.nio.cs .
StreamEncoder .
We ’re going to leave the java .
io directory for a while .
Let ’s see the implementation of StreamEncoder.write ( ) in StreamEncoder.
java :
public void write ( char cbuf [ ] , int off , int len ) throws IOException { synchronized ( lock ) { ensureOpen ( ) ; if ( ( off < 0 ) || ( off > cbuf.length ) || ( len < 0 ) || ( ( off + len ) > cbuf.length ) || ( ( off + len ) > 0 ) ) { throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException ( ) ; } else if ( len == 0 ) { return ; } implWrite ( cbuf , off , len ) ; } }
Moving on to StreamEncoder.implWrite ( ) :
void implWrite ( char cbuf [ ] , int off , int len ) throws IOException { CharBuffer cb = CharBuffer.wrap( cbuf , off , len ) ; if ( haveLeftoverChar ) flushLeftoverChar ( cb , false ) ; while ( cb.hasRemaining ( ) ) { CoderResult cr = encoder.encode ( cb , bb , false ) ; if ( cr.isUnderflow ( ) ) { assert ( cb.remaining ( ) <= 1 ) : cb.remaining ( ) ; if ( cb.remaining ( ) == 1 ) { haveLeftoverChar = true ; leftoverChar = cb.get ( ) ; } break ; } if ( cr.isOverflow ( ) ) { assert bb.position ( ) > 0 ; writeBytes ( ) ; continue ; } cr.throwException ( ) ; } }
Again this calls another function , writeBytes ( ) .
Here ’s the implementation :
private void writeBytes ( ) throws IOException { bb.flip ( ) ; int lim = bb.limit ( ) ; int pos = bb.position ( ) ; assert ( pos <= lim ) ; int rem = ( pos <= lim ?
lim - pos : 0 ) ; if ( rem > 0 ) { if ( ch != null ) { if ( ch.write ( bb ) != rem ) assert false : rem ; } else { out.write ( bb.array ( ) , bb.arrayOffset ( ) + pos , rem ) ; } } bb.clear ( ) ; }
We ’re done with StreamEncoder .
This class essentially processes or encodes character streams , but ultimately delegates the task of writing the bytes back to BufferedOutputStream .
Let ’s take a look at the code for write ( ) in BufferedOutputStream .
java :
public synchronized void write ( byte b[ ] , int off , int len ) throws IOException { if ( len >= buf.length ) { /*
If the request length exceeds the size of the output buffer , flush the output buffer and then write the data directly .
In this way buffered streams will cascade harmlessly . */ flushBuffer ( ) ; out . write ( b , off , len ) ; return ; } if ( len > buf.length - count ) { flushBuffer ( ) ; } System.arraycopy( b , off , buf , count , len ) ; count += len ; }
And BufferedOutputStream passes the baton again , this time to FileOutputStream .
Remember when we instantiated fdOut as a FileOutputStream ?
Well , this is it , passed down through dozens of system calls .
Believe it or not , FileOutputStream is the final layer before JNI .
We see the function write ( ) in FileOutputStream .
java :
public void write ( byte b[ ] , int off , int len ) throws IOException { writeBytes ( b , off , len ) ; }
And writeBytes ( ) :
private native void writeBytes ( byte b[ ] , int off , int len ) throws IOException ;
We ’ve reached the end of the Java part .
But we ’re not quite finished .
A Review of the java . io call stack
This is a ‘ contains ’ chart :
Also here ’s the entire call stack :
Stepping into the JNI
After FileOutputStream , the writing of bytes to the console is handled natively .
Much of this native code is platform dependent : there are different versions of the code for Windows and Linux .
We ’re going to deal with the Linux versions first .
The native implementation of writeBytes ( ) is defined in FileOutputStream_md.c.
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_java_io_FileOutputStream_writeBytes ( JNIEnv
*env , jobject this , jbyteArray bytes , jint off , jint len ) { writeBytes ( env , this , bytes , off , len , fos_fd ) ; }
The field fos_fd is the integer stored in the FileDescriptor object that we ’ve visited so long ago .
So for the out stream , fos_fd should be 1 .
We ’re just calling a method , writeBytes , with the additional argument of fos_id .
The implementation of writeBytes ( ) is defined in io_util .c :
void writeBytes ( JNIEnv *env , jobject this , jbyteArray bytes , jint off , jint len , jfieldID fid ) { jint n ; char stack Buf [ BUF_SIZE ] ; char * buf = NULL ; FD fd ; if ( IS_NULL ( bytes ) ) { JNU_ThrowNullPointerException ( env , NULL ) ; return ; } if ( outOfBounds ( env , off , len , bytes ) ) { JNU_ThrowByName(env , " java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException " , NULL ) ; return ; } if ( len == 0 ) { return ; } else if ( len > BUF_SIZE ) { buf = malloc ( len ) ; if ( buf == NULL ) { JNU_ThrowOutOfMemoryError(env , NULL ) ; return ; } } else { buf = stack Buf ; } ( * env ) - > GetByteArrayRegion(env , bytes , off , len , ( jbyte *) buf ) ; if (!(* env ) ->ExceptionOccurred ( env ) ) { off = 0 ; while ( len > 0 ) { fd = GET_FD ( this , fid ) ; if ( fd == - 1 ) { JNU_ThrowIOException ( env , " Stream Closed " ) ; break ; } n = IO_Write ( fd , buf+off , len ) ; if ( n == JVM_IO_ERR ) { JNU_ThrowIOExceptionWithLastError(env , " Write error " ) ; break ; } else if ( n == JVM_IO_INTR ) { JNU_ThrowByName(env , " java/io/InterruptedIOException " , NULL ) ; break ; } off += n ; len -= n ; } } if ( buf != stackBuf ) { free ( buf ) ; } }
The writing here is done by a method called IO_Write .
At this point , what happens next becomes platform dependent , as IO_Write is defined differently for Windows and Linux .
The Linux Way
The linux way of handling IO uses the HPI ( Hardware Platform Interface ) .
Thus , the method is defined as JVM_Write in io_util_md.h :
#define IO_Write JVM_Write
The code form JVM_Write is defined in the JVM itself .
The code is not Java , nor C , but it ’s C ++.
The method can be found in jvm.cpp :
JVM_LEAF ( jint , JVM_Write ( jint fd , char * buf , jint nbytes ) ) JVMWrapper2 ( " JVM_Write ( 0x %x ) " , fd ) ; //%note jvm_r6 return ( jint ) os : : write ( fd , buf , nbytes ) ; JVM_END
The writing is now done by various HPI methods .
Although you could go further , I ’m going to stop here , since we ’re now so far from where we started .
The Way of Windows
In Windows , the method IO_Write is routed away from the HPI layer .
Instead , it ’s redefined as handleWrite in io_util_md .h.
The implementation for handleWrite ( ) is defined in io_util_md .c :
JNIEXPORT size_t handleWrite ( jlong fd , const void * buf , jint len ) { BOOL result = 0 ; DWORD written = 0 ; HANDLE h = ( HANDLE ) fd ; if ( h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE ) { result = WriteFile(h , /* File handle to write */ buf , /* pointers to the buffers */ len , /* number of bytes to write */ & written , /* receives number of bytes written */ NULL ) ; /* no overlapped struct */ } if ( ( h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE ) || ( result == 0 ) ) { return - 1 ; } return written ; }
The WriteFile function is in the Windows API .
The Windows API is not open source , so we would have to stop here .
Conclusion
We ’ve taken a tour through the entire call stack of System.out. println ( ) , from the instantiation of System . out to the path through java.io , all the way down to JNI and HPI level IO handling .
We have n’t even reached the end .
No doubt there ’s dozens more levels underneath the HPI layer and the WriteFile API call .
Perhaps the better answer to the question , “ how does System.out. println ( ) work ” would be “ it ’s magic ” .
The other day I was trying to style CSS3 border - radius to image element and I realized that Firefox does n’t display border - radius on images .
Then I figured a way to work around it — wrap a span tag around with the original image as a background - image .
Thanks to Darcy Clarke for the jQuery code which does the magic tag wrapping automatically .
View Demo Rounded Images
Goal
My goal to use the CSS3 border - radius and box - shadow feature to make the image element look like the screenshot below .
Problem
The problem is none of the modern browsers display rounded corners image the way I want it .
Webkit does display the rounded corners , but the inset box shadow is not supported .
In Firefox , the border - radius does n’t even display at all .
The CSS Trick
The trick is very simple : wrap a span tag around the image element .
Specify the original image as background - image .
To hide the original image , specify opacity : 0 or display : none .
I find using the opacity method is a better approach because the image will remain available for copy or download .
Final Solution With jQuery
To make things easier , we can use jQuery to automatically wrap a span tag around the image .
The jQuery code below will find any element with " .rounded -img " or " rounded - img2 " ( in my case , it is the image element ) and wrap it with a span tag .
The script finds the src , width , height , and CSS class attribute of the original image and apply them as inline styling in the span tag .
Then it specifies the opacity of the image to 0 to hide it .
It works with any image dimension ( with or without the width and height attribute ) .
It can also be combined with other CSS classes .
No additional markup is required .
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " jquery - 1.4.2.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
$ ( " .rounded-img , .rounded-img2 " ) .load ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .wrap( function ( ) { return '< span class= " ' + $ ( this ) .attr( ' class ' ) + '" style= " background:url ( ' + $ ( this ) .attr ( ' src ' ) + ') no -repeat center center ; width : ' + $ ( this ) . width ( ) + ' px ; height : ' + $ ( this ) . height ( ) + ' px ; " />' ; } ) ; $ ( this ) .css ( " opacity " , " 0 " ) ; } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Sample Usage
I hope you will find this trick useful .
For example , you can use it to style your blog ’s avatar or profile photos .

Japanese prosecutors have asked for two years in prison for New Zealand anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune .
Bethune is on trial in Tokyo for assault and charges relating to his boarding of a Japanese harpoon ship in Antarctic waters .
Prosecutors say rancid butter stink bombs fired by the activist caused chemical burns to the face of a 24 - year - old whaler .
Mr Bethune has pleaded guilty to four charges including trespassing , vandalism and holding a knife , but he has denied the assault charge .
Earlier this week the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society cut its links with Mr Bethune after he carried a bow and arrows during confrontations with Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean .
The group said his decision to take the weapons on board his ship , the Ady Gil , was unacceptable .
The Ady Gil was sunk after a collision with a Japanese whaling ship .
Mr Bethune 's estranged wife , Sharyn , has questioned his expulsion from future protests even though the group maintains it has done so to his assist his court case .
Image caption President Sarkozy has dismissed allegations of illegal party funding
French opposition MPs have called on President Nicolas Sarkozy to give details of any links to suspected commissions on arms deals allegedly used to fund political campaigns .
The calls follow a report from Luxembourg police alleging Mr Sarkozy approved the creation of firms which received money from the commissions .
They allegedly financed then PM Edouard Balladur 's 1995 presidential campaign .
The two men have repeatedly dismissed allegations of illegal party funding .
French news website Mediapart quoted the Luxembourg police report as saying : " The agreements on the creation of the two companies appear to have come directly from Prime Minister Balladur and Finance [ Budget ] Minister Nicolas Sarkozy .
" Part of the funds that passed through Luxembourg [ companies ] came back to France to finance political campaigns " in 1995 , added the police report , according to Mediapart .
Government spokesman Luc Chatel dismissed the recurring allegations as " a serial fairytale " and said the government was co-operating with an investigation by a French judge .
One of the MPs who asked for information , Socialist Party deputy leader Harlem Desir , called for French judges to obtain the Luxembourg police documents .
" The officials at the time , namely Edouard Balladur and Nicolas Sarkozy , the budget minister who was in charge of the sale and the commissions , must be asked to provide all the information that the French are waiting for , " Mr Desir said .
Since 2008 , French investigators have been looking at allegations that the cancellation of commissions for one of the arms deals prompted an attack that killed 11 French naval engineers in Pakistan in 2002 .
In May 2002 , a bomb in Karachi killed the engineers who were in Pakistan to build the submarines .

Ever wondered how car companies make money fast ?
Sexy electric sports car creators Tesla motors have figured it out : sell off its excess zero-emission vehicle credits for much - needed hard cash to Honda , the only mainstream automaker to not yet fully commit to making an EV .
In 2008 , a revised version of the Californian zero-emissions mandate came into force , requiring any major auto manufacturer wishing to sell vehicles within the state to make some form of plug - in vehicle , or face strict penalties .
While Toyota , GM , Nissan and Ford have all worked to some extent on plug in hybrid and pure electric vehicles , Honda has turned its attention to hydrogen fuel cell technology , leasing its FCX Clarity in select locations in California .
Honda has illustrated time and time again that it does not see electric vehicles as a viable alternative to the gasoline car at this time .
While the FCX Clarity satisfies zero tailpipe emissions , it does not satisfy the necessary portions of the Californian Air Resources Board ( CARB ) legislature .
However , Honda are able to purchase credits for making plug - in cars they did n't actually make .
How ?
Under the zero-emission vehicle credit scheme , carmakers who do build zero-emission and plug - in vehicles receive credits for doing so .
Only a certain threshold of vehicles from any manufacturer need be plug - in , but Californian startup Tesla only make electric vehicles and can sell any spare credits on .
Enter Honda , keen to buy up enough credits to satisfy Californian law .
In court papers released as part of Tesla 's up - coming IPO , Honda are the only named automaker buying zero-emission vehicle credits from Tesla , but Tesla have sold zero-emission vehicle credits to at least one other non-disclosed automaker .
So far , Honda has purchased enough zero-emissions credits equivalent to the credits awarded for the manufacture of 655 zero-emissions EVs .
2009 Tesla Roadstser
Many activists argue that the zero-emission vehicle credit trading scheme is an automotive equivalent of cap and trade and does not encourage the lowering of carbon emissions or the building of zero emissions vehicles , since those with enough money can buy credits in in order to escape hefty fines for non-compliance .
For Tesla however , the importance of the trade is a little extra cash to help steady the company coffers -- which continue to haemorrhage cash in preparation for the company 's $ 100 million IPO .

In breach of calls for openness and transparency in climate science , the University of East Anglia , together with Eugene Wahl and Caspar Amman , have refused to provide documents critical to the inquiry that Muir Russell should be undertaking .
One of the most notorious Climategate emails was Jones ’ request to Mann , Briffa , Ammann and Wahl that they delete correspondence pertaining to AR4 review , which included correspondence carried out between Eugene Wahl and Keith Briffa in violation of IPCC procedures .
Jones even told FOI Briffa that Briffa “ should say ” that no such correspondence existed .
The Climategate letters contain references to attachments to Wahl ’s surreptitious correspondence with Briffa , but the attachments themselves were not included in the Climategate documents .
On April 5 , 2010 , I sent an EIR ( FOI ) request to the University of East Anglia for the attachments ( as well as an attachment of the Wahl and Ammann version used in the First Order Draft , sent to Briffa directly and not now available at IPCC . )
My request was as follows :
Pursuant to the Environmental Impact Regulations , I request copies of the following documents ( reference is attached to Keith Briffa letter ) : Wahl_MBH_Recreation_JClimLett_Nov22.pdf ( attachment mentioned in Jan 4 , 2005 458 .

Thank you for your consideration ,
Regards , Steve McIntyre
On May 5 , 2010 , I received a response from UEA extending the response time
Further to your request for information received 5 April 2010 , I am writing to advise you that we are , pursuant to Regulation 7 ( 1 ) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 , extending the statutory deadline for our response to your request from the 20 working days set out in Regulation 5 ( 2 ) to the 40 working days allowed by Regulation 7 ( 1 ) .
This will alter the deadline from 5 May 2010 to 2 June 2010 .
I apologise for the late notification of this extension but it was only this week that it became clear that we would require the extension .
This extension is claimed because of the age and relative obscure provenance of the information requested , we quite simply are having difficulty identifying and locating some of it .
An initial search indicates that some of the information is not held but I wish to ensure that we have not overlooked any possible location prior to making that formal assertion .
It is my opinion that , at this particular time , it is impracticable to either comply with the request or to formulate any other response within the statutory period as set out in Regulation 5 ( 2 )
We are addressing your request currently and I expect that we will be able to provide a substantive response in advance of the revised deadline .
Today , on the last day of the extension period , they refused virtually everything that I had requested .
Your request for information received on 5 April 2010 for a series of documents relating to the work of Professors Wahl and Amman has now been considered and some of the information requested is enclosed herewith .
However , it is not possible to satisfy all elements of your request directly .
In accordance with Regulation 14 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 this letter acts as a Refusal Notice , and I am not obliged to supply this information and the reasons for exemption are as stated below :
Exemption Reason Reg. 6 ( 1 ) ( b ) , Information available
Some information is available elsewhere Reg. 12( 4 ) ( d ) , Unfinished documents
Draft documents are unfinished documents Reg. 12( 5 ) ( f ) , Adverse effects on person providing information
Release of the requested information , would have an adverse effect on the interests of third parties Regulation 6 ( 1 ) is cited because much of the information requested within several of the draft documents , particularly that pertaining to results , findings and interpretations is available within the final published version of the document and is therefore publicly available and easily accessible to you in another form .
In regards Regulation 12 ( 4 ) ( d ) , both ICO and DEFRA guidance indicates that a draft document is to be considered as an ‘ unfinished document ’ and this position has been upheld by a recent information Tribunal decision which stated that “ However , the opinion of the majority and , ultimately our unanimous conclusion , is that the Draft Report is , by its very name and giving the words their logical meaning , an unfinished document .
[ 1 – The Secretary of State for Transport v the Information Commissioner ( EA/2008/0052 , 5 May 2009 ) , p.24 , para .
82 ]
We also cite Regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( f ) as Professors Wahl and Amman have indicated , and we are minded to agree , that several documents were provided to this University on the understanding that they were not public documents and that release would have an adverse effect on future sharing of scientific information between researchers and would limit their ability to openly explore ideas and approaches in draft formats .
They made it clear that they felt that the proper fora to access this information was by way of the completed version .
Pursuant to Regulation 12 ( 1 ) ( b ) , we must also apply a public interest test to any and all information excepted under Regulation 12 and this test must be applied as a whole to the entire request rather than exception by exception .
It is our opinion that , in relation to the excepted material , the public interest lies in non-disclosure .
Much of the requested information exists in the public domain in a finished format and no gain is to be obtained by the release of earlier , unapproved versions of the same material .
Further , there is a public interest in providing a space in which researchers can exchange ideas , theories and alternatives without fear that information or a position never intended for public release would be disclosed .
There is also a public interest in ensuring that the information available to the public has been properly reviewed and assessed as takes place in the academic publication process .
This lessens confusion the possibility that the public could be mislead or confused by earlier , less well - examined versions of the information .
Additionally , the intellectual property rights of the copyright holder in the final version are protected by ensuring that earlier , non-published versions of copyrighted work are not made available ‘ in competition ’ with the copyrighted version that the copyright holder has an expectation of making a profit from .
I would also add that any material released over which UEA has copyright is released subject to the understanding that you will comply with all relevant copyright rules regarding reproduction and / or transmission of the information released .
I ’ll post up a longer chronology showing precisely where the Wahl correspondence fits into Climategate – Mosher and Fuller and touch on it in CRUtape but additional context has emerged over time .
The Wahl correspondence was undertaken in direct contravention of IPCC rules and procedures .
Briffa knew that the correspondence violated IPCC rules – the correspondence is marked burn - after - reading .
It ’s quite natural that Wahl and Ammann ( and CRU ) want to keep these violations secret .
I ’m sure that Muir Russell panelist David Eyton of BP understands .
In a delightful development , Sharron “ obtuse ” Angle demonstrated that she can fit her whole foot in her mouth , right up to the ankle .
… When Angle returned from Washington and held an event to greet supporters yesterday in Las Vegas , she was approached by reporter Nathan Baca of CBS affiliate 8 News Now .
When Baca , citing Angle ’s website , asked why she wants " to eliminate ( Social Security ) for younger folks , because your plan calls for transitioning out , " she accused him of believing " the Harry Reid lie " and said she wants to shift the program to personalized Social Security accounts that the government can’t touch .
Then things started to get pretty tense .
Baca said the 2008 stock market crash would have meant millions of seniors having their savings wiped out under Angle ’s plan ; she replied that he is " putting words into my mouth from Harry Reid " and that she is trying to save Social Security .
When he asked why she wants to eliminate the EPA despite the Gulf oil leak , she said , " Where are you getting these questions ?
The issues are not about the EPA …
The issues are homes here in Nevada …
He is trying to make this a campaign about me .
But , where ’s Harry ?
Go ask Harry …
Please go ask Harry about the EPA , and why they have failed . "
She went on to say the EPA has " failed to do what they needed to do in the Gulf . "
Angle then ignored a question about her website once advocating U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations and refused to look at Baca as he asked her repeatedly about her " Second Amendment remedies " comment as she walked in the parking lot after the event .
The video is above .
According to Baca , Angle ’s campaign responded to the exchange by calling him " an idiot " as well as another term that ca n’t be repeated on television .

Once my sister came home from college and sneaked into my room to surprise me as I was fapping to a solo Abby Winters scene and I heard her go " ooh she 's cute ! "
As she placed her hand on my cock which immediately came from the shock / fight or flight response to being caught .
She laughed so hard she had to chew on her t- shirt to avoid mom and dad coming in the room to see what was going on , then she put it in her hair and went " I'm Cameron Diaz ! " .

LOS ANGELES -- Doc Rivers is bracing for the worst and hoping for the best .
He knows his big , physical , technical - foul prone center , Kendrick Perkins , is n't going to change .
Nor does Rivers want him to .
So the Boston Celtics coach said Tuesday that he 's beginning the Finals with the thought that he could lose Perkins at some point , as he did in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals , due to technical fouls .
" It 's going to happen .
I hope it does n't , but you know it 's going to happen , " Rivers said before the Celtics practiced on Tuesday at UCLA .
" Perk is physical ; the Lakers are saying they want to be physical now .
So the refs are going to react to that . "
At Monday 's Lakers practice , coach Phil Jackson had addressed the issue .
" Those things I think should be wiped out -- flagrant fouls , technical fouls , " Jackson said .
" It just means the longer you 've been in the playoffs , the more penalized you are .
It seems like that 's not a really good code right now . "
He added that the Lakers were n't as physical as the Celtics .
" I mean , that 's not our kind of team , " he said .
" We do n't go out there to smack people around .
We 're a more resilient ballclub .
We try to stay strong and play hard .
But we 're going to have to withstand some of that . "
" What 's going to happen is there 's going to be a double technical that Perk does n't deserve and we 're going to have to deal with it .
It 's unfair , but that 's the way it is , " Rivers said .
Rivers added that he does n't fault NBA officials for calling double technical fouls .
He just does n't think they should lead to suspensions in the same way flagrant fouls do .
" I do n't think you should be suspended for double technicals , " Rivers said .
" Obviously flagrants should absolutely .
If you get seven flagrants , if you cuss the refs out seven times , then maybe .
But double technicals , no .
Because when two guys get tangled up , they never know who started it so they just call it on both .
" If Perk is as physical as [ Lakers coach ]
Phil Jackson says he is , usually it 's Perk being physical and the other guy retaliating and the retaliation is the foul and unfortunately Perk gets the tech .
It 's just not right but it 's part of our league and we 'll deal with it , " said Rivers .
Perkins was ejected from Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals after he picked up two technical fouls , one of which was later rescinded .
Because he 's picked up six technicals during the playoffs , his next technical foul will force him out of the Celtics ' next game .
" I'm focused , " Perkins said .
" I 've got a lot of people reminding me to stay calm , so I 'm cool .
I do n't want to think about it [ getting suspended ] .
Hopefully I do n't . "

Under proposed changes to federal research ethics standards , the Environmental Protection Agency will no longer accept studies that use people as guinea pigs in chemical tests .
In 2006 , under chemical - industry pressure , and over arguments that the studies were scientifically and ethically bankrupt , the EPA declared such data acceptable .
On June 16 , the EPA reversed its decision .
" What we were really concerned about is toxicity studies , where they 're trying to do a study on humans to determine the dose response of a chemical , " said Jennifer Sass , a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council , a liberal nonprofit .
" If the EPA stops accepting them , there 's no motivation for companies to conduct them . "
Almost every standard code of medical ethics – including the Nuremberg Code , written in response to Nazi doctors ' nightmare studies – forbid human tests of drugs or chemicals that may cause harm , but can provide no direct benefit .
The chemical industry , however , has long argued that the EPA should accept data from tests in which healthy volunteers are paid for exposing themselves to pesticides and other known toxins .
The industry says such data provide a more accurate picture of chemical effects than animal studies .
Critics say the resulting science is worthless , with companies running tests on small , non-representative groups of people , such as healthy young men , in order to create a false impression of safety .
More importantly , the tests put people at potentially grave physical risk , with no benefit but a cash payment .
" These pesticides are intentionally designed to be toxic .
Their whole purpose is to kill insects and invasive plants , " wrote senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) and representative Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) in a 2005 report ( .pdf ) on the industry 's tests .
" Yet in the experiments , test subjects swallowed insecticide tablets , sat in chambers with pesticide vapors , had pesticides applied to their skin , had pesticides shot into their eyes and noses , and were even exposed in their homes for six months at a time . "
Continued Waxman and Boxer : " The subjects were not told of the dangers of exposure to the pesticides .
Sometimes , they were n't even told the substances being tested were pesticides .
They were misled into believing that they were participating in ' drug ' trials , not pesticide experiments . "
Nevertheless , the Bush - era EPA – led by Stephen Johnson , a former tobacco - industry scientist – said they 'd accept data from those studies .
The NRDC , along with liberal nonprofits Pesticide Action Network and Earthjustice , filed suit in federal court .
Proposed rule changes announced by the EPA on June 16 are the result of negotiations that accompanied the legal battle .
They extend protections from the Common Rule ( a widely accepted set of medical ethics that forbid intentional - dosing studies that have no benefit ) to all people involved in EPA - accepted studies .
Extra protections are given to children and pregnant women .
" EPA expects its tougher new rules will decrease the number of systemic intentional dosing toxicity studies conducted for pesticides , " reads the EPA website .
" We expect the number of systemic toxicity studies to drop to as few as zero or one per year . "
The rules will be opened to public comment in January of 2011 , and will need court approval to finally become law .
The American Chemistry Council , the major chemical industry trade group and an advocate of expanded human testing , did not respond to requests for comment .
According to Sass , Some data on human exposures to chemicals may still be used .
Reports from accidental poisonings , worker exposures and other unintentional dosing exist , and " EPA could incorporate a lot of that unfortunate , real - world data , " she said .
" Pesticide companies should not be allowed to take advantage of vulnerable populations by enticing people to serve as human laboratory rats , " said Pesticide Action Network senior scientist Margaret Reeves in a press release .

‘ Substance is good , timing is wrong , ’ Kerry ’s office tells Raw Story
WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The two chief authors of the Senate energy and climate bill joined 20 other Democrats Tuesday evening to help defeat a motion that would have stripped $ 35 billion in special tax breaks for big oil companies .
Sens . John Kerry ( D - MA ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) cast their votes against the amendment introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) to H.R. 4213 , the “ American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act . ”
It failed 35 - 61 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Kerry , the Democrats ’ designated crusader for clean energy reform and tough emissions regulations , said through a spokesman he was not opposed to the substance of the amendment , but rather the timing at which it was introduced .
“ Senator Kerry supports closing tax loopholes for the oil and gas industry , ” Kerry ’s chief of staff David Wade e-mailed Raw Story , in response to a query .
“ However , the tax extenders bill is not the right vehicle for this reform because we need it included in comprehensive energy and climate legislation so they can help pay for the new tax incentives and investments for clean energy we are proposing . ”
“ He has introduced legislation to do so and has already succeeded in scaling back some of the loopholes including the manufacturing deduction for the oil and gas industry , ” Wade said .
“ This was a simple case of needing this revenue for that fight in July . ”
The Sanders amendment would have used the funds for debt reduction and efficiency programs .
No Republicans voted for it .
Lieberman ’s office did not return a request for comment .

In his Oval Office address Tuesday night , President Obama called on the Senate to pass an energy bill .
“ The time to embrace a clean energy future is now , ” he said , invoking the calamities in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
Absent from Obama ’s speech was discussion of strong climate change provisions such as carbon caps or emissions taxes .
It ’s unclear whether the measure will include any such components .
The House passed its energy bill last summer , and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) has said he intends to move on it in the upper chamber next month .

With Republicans absent from the negotiations and pledging to filibuster any legislation with carbon taxes or limits , Democrats are aiming lower and pushing primarily for strong clean energy investments .

The Dutch woke up Thursday morning to a striking new right - leaning political reality after Wednesday ’s national elections ratified both a conservative emphasis on austerity and a populist push against immigration and Islam .
It was the first European elections since the Greek debt crisis put the euro in a funk – and results proved so fragmented that forming a ruling Dutch coalition will be difficult and may take months .
The budget - cutting center - right Liberals ( conservatives in US parlance ) under Mark Rutte gained the most seats , 31 .
But the center - left Labor Party took 30 , led by former Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen , who ran on a “ bridge - building , hate - busting ” campaign .
Mr. Rutte ran on cutting spending by more than $ 50 billion in coming years .
Should the telegenic and youthful politician cobble together a like - minded coalition , it would mark the first conservative Dutch government in a century .
He told reporters Thursday that " I would like to see a new cabinet put together as soon as possible because of the seriousness of the economic crisis . "
If Mr. Cohen should prevail , he would be the Netherlands ' first Jewish prime minister – and would represent a formidable bully pulpit against a growing chauvinist feeling in the country .
Cohen is known for bringing calm to Amsterdam after the assassinations of anti-immigrant figure Pim Fortuyn and Theo Van Gogh , whose anti-Muslim film caused a furor , and brought fear and anger to the usually mild city several years ago .
The biggest winner , however , is the flamboyant and extremist politician Geert Wilders , whose Freedom Party platform to ban the Koran and mosque - building defied election polling data and jacked him from 9 to 23 seats .
Mr. Wilders ’s rise as leader of what is now the No. 3 party in the Netherlands is considered a bellwether of a surlier sentiment in a country traditionally tolerant but now anxious over Muslim minorities .
A straw poll of Dutch junior high and high school students prior to the election showed Wilders actually winning the election among Dutch youths , as reported by DutchNews .
" The Netherlands chose more security , less crime , less immigration , and less Islam , " a delighted Wilders told Dutch TV viewers last night .
In a post - election rally , he was more colorful : “ I say to all the newly elected Freedom Party MPs of our beautiful party , bring battering rams with you , because starting tomorrow , we 're going to give them hell ! ”
Current government 's free fall
The biggest loser is Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende .
After a bumpy eight - year rule from the center - left , Mr. Balkenende ’s Christian Democrats went into free fall , from 41 to 21 seats .
The prime minister said he will resign pending a new government .
The Dutch government broke up in February partly over its participation in the Afghan war , but election campaigning was dominated by the economy .
The Netherlands is in far better financial shape than most eurozone states , but voters in the fiscally conservative nation are concerned about negative forecasts as well as higher borrowing costs and bank debt .
A 2008 government takeover of the Netherlands ' flagship bank , ABN AMRO , cost $ 35 billion , and is well - remembered .
June 24 , 2010  --
A federal jury has ruled that Philadelphia cannot evict a Boy Scout chapter from city - owned property because the scouts ban gays , but the city is reviewing further legal challenges to the group 's anti-gay ban .
The jury found the city 's demand that the scouts end its ban on gays in order to use city property violated the scout council 's First Amendment rights .
Even as Boy Scout officials declared victory Wednesday night , city officials said they were reviewing their plans .
City Solicitor Shelley Smith said , " The potential exists that the verdict is flawed .
We will be exploring our options . "
In a statement , the city said : " While the good work of the Boy Scouts can not be disputed , the city remains steadfast in its commitment to prevent its facilities from being used to disadvantage certain groups . "
In the lawsuit , the scouts had sought an injunction barring the city from evicting them , or charging $ 200,000 a year in rent , on their stately headquarters building near Logan Square .
While the verdict seemed to strengthen the scouts ' position in negotiations with the city , U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter did not immediately issue an injunction barring their eviction because of the national organization 's policy that homosexuals cannot be scouts or troop leaders .
Buckwalter told jurors the city 's anti-discrimination policy is " principled " and said he hoped the two " honorable institutions " could come to an agreement .
The city still could terminate the lease under the 1928 agreement , which was designed to give nonprofits free rent if they maintained the sites .
The city must terminate the lease for a legally permissible reason , the judge said , not because of an organization 's views .
Boy Scouts Claim Victory in Fight to Ban Gays
Jason Gosselin , who represented the scouts , said the verdict strengthened their negotiating position .
" The city can't come in and impose its views on what the scouts ought to do , " he said .
" We can't be kicked out of the building or evicted , and we do n't have to pay any rent , " another attorney for the scouts , William M. McSwain , said after the unanimous verdict by a jury of six women and two men .
One of the jurors , foreman Merrill Arbogast , 40 , a trucker and former Eagle Scout , said : " We do hope that eventually national ( Boy Scouts of America ) will change its minds .
But at this point , the Cradle of Liberty ( Council ) is still obligated to follow its policy . "
Greg Lattera , now 18 , testified that he was kicked out of the scouts in 2003 after he appeared in uniform on TV to declare he that he was gay .
The Cradle of Liberty Council sued the city over an ultimatum to either renounce a national scouting policy against gays or be evicted from the city building it has been renting for $ 1 a year since 1928 .
In testimony last week , the council 's retired chief executive , Bill Dwyer , said the city ultimatum not only violates the council 's First Amendment rights but also " would put us out of business . "
A lawyer for the city , David Smith , told the jury that the local scout leaders were " speaking out of both sides of their mouths " when they initially agreed with the city 's anti-discrimination policy but then continued to use the national group 's employment application , which stated that homosexuals , atheists , and agnostics would not be hired .
Soon after Lattera was kicked out the Boy Scouts , the city began pressuring the Cradle of Liberty Council to renounce the national scouting policy which discriminates against homosexuals .
That national policy was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2000 .
The Cradle of Liberty Council agreed in 2004 to a statement that it would oppose all " unlawful discrimination " but the city later insisted it go even further and disown the national policy .
The Federal Government has struck an $ 11 billion deal with Telstra over the national broadband network .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the deal at a joint press conference with Telstra chief David Thodey .
The Government will pay $ 9 billion to access Telstra infrastructure - including pits and ducts - to avoid duplication .
A further $ 2 billion will go towards dealing with structural separation issues , including setting up a new company , USO Co , to meet Telstra 's universal service obligation for the delivery of standard telephone services , payphones and emergency call handling from July 1 , 2012 .
The Government will also provide $ 100 million to Telstra to assist in the retraining and redeployment of staff affected by the changes .
It will also pay compensation to Telstra to phase out its copper network and cable broadband internet service .
Instead , Telstra is likely to become the NBN 's largest customer by transferring its customers onto the new fibre optic infrastructure .
NBN
Co will become the wholesale supplier of last resort for fibre connections in greenfield developments from January 1 , 2011 .
The deal still needs the approval of Telstra shareholders and the competition regulator .
Mr Rudd says the agreement with Telstra will help the Government provide a new super fast internet system .
" This has been a very difficult , tough , hard negotiation ; but it has also been an honest set of negotiations , " he said .
" It demonstrates what can be yielded through a process of negotiation where the end point is to deliver better services for all Australians and a better outcome for our nation 's economy . "
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy described talks between the Government and Telstra as " tough negotiations " .
" Today 's agreement between Telstra and NBN is significant it will be remembered as the moment the Australian Government and the industry joined together to revolutionise the telecommunications sector in this country , " he said .
" The agreement means that NBN can be rolled out quicker , cheaper , more efficiently and with faster take up rates , " he said .
Telstra chairwoman Catherine Livingstone says there is still a significant amount of work to do before final aspects of the deal are sorted out .
" The agreement certainly takes us a step closer to achieving that mutually beneficial outcome which , as you know , has always been Telstra 's objective , " she said .
" That outcome will be in the best interests of Telstra shareholders .
" We 're very encouraged by the heads of agreement , but there is a great deal of work to do to achieve the definitive agreements . "
The Government has been in negotiations with the telecommunications company since late last year .

For the past 10 years , colonies of bees have decreased at an alarming rate .
A phenomenon called colony collapse disorder has been killing them off en masse , and beekeepers have been quick to alert the public about their high hive mortality .
The bees are threatened by new and intensive farming practices ( heavy usage of technologies such as pesticides and chemical fertilisers , plant growth regulators , and methods such as mono - cropping and organised irrigation ) , climate change and the arrival of the Asian hornet .
In recent years , the mortality rate of bees has quadrupled .
The disappearance of bees endangers the beekeeping profession and threatens agriculture and the food supply ( according to French scientists from INRA and the CNRS , 35 % of world production of fruits , vegetables and oilseeds depends on the activities of the pollinators ) .
Environmentalists and beekeepers , using data gathered by many toxological studies , are fighting against big chemical companies in order to prohibit the use of some products that can be lethal for bees , such as Gaucho and Regent TS .
But surprisingly , the industry has discovered that bees kept in urban areas are healthier and produce better honey .
In rural areas , bees are victims of the disappearance of wild flowers , caused by excessive monoculture and the misuse of pesticides .
As a consequence , it is more and more common to see wild swarms finding refuge in cities , and beekeepers are regularly deciding to move their hives to city gardens and parks .
Fewer pesticides and a greater biodiversity are helping bee colonies to thrive here .
Today , beehives are quietly buzzing in cities all over the globe : Chicago , Toronto , Paris , London and New York are cities where thousands of different species of plants are blossoming in the gardens and parks .
Honey produced in the cities is of a better quality than that from the countryside .
The cities are becoming a haven ; they do not protect the bees from everything , but they offer them a break .
This year is the International Year of Biodiversity and cities are being encouraged to reintroduce a bit of nature on to the streets .
Actions range from the creation of gardens and the arrangement of rooftops for bees , to the reduction of pesticides .
Bees can only benefit from this kind of initiative .
In the UK , Natural England , an agency that advises the government on environmental issues , has launched a plastic beehive to install at home .
In the US , Chicago was the first city to act on behalf of bees : the city hall hosts a hive on its planted roof , thanks to the program Green Roofs .
In New York , in 2010 , beekeepers finally got the right to own hives in the city .
In France , they are found both at the top of the Paris and Lille operas , above the rooftops of theatres , in parks , like in Luxembourg park , as well as in the courtyards of ordinary citizens , or on their balconies .
Everyone can now take part in a course about beekeeping and learn how to become a perfect urban beekeeper .
Like Jacqueline and Michel , both retired , from Paris , a lot of people have started owning their own hives .
" At first I was preparing my retirement and I wanted to find a hobby , but now we visit schools , we want people from the cities to get to know this fantastic animal , without which we can not live .
The purpose is that everyone leaves being aware of the precariousness of the situation . "
Beyond the protection of bees , it was discovered that the insects can reinforce the social bond in cities .
That is why some beekeepers organise meetings where fellow beekeepers , artists , the public and tourists are invited and are in constant interaction .
In this same spirit , the Parisian graphic beekeeper , Olivier Darné , installed in 2008 what he says is " an unusual refuge for two earthlings and 100,000 bees " .
His art project , The Mooner , contains several hives with movable frames , which can accommodate up to 100,000 bees .
" The aim was to multiply the human senses , sounds , smells , images and to discover proximity with the bees , in order to get to know them , " explains the artist .
The space is designed " like a decompression airlock from the urban living that gives time to contemplate urban , human and animal , between anxiety , fear and fascination " .
In front of an intensive agriculture , which exploits the bees , and facing the danger of their disappearance , a global bee - friendly movement is growing .
This movement agrees with Albert Einstein , who supposedly once said : " No more bees , no more pollination … no more men . "
GENEVA , Switzerland —
A global day of action demanding an end to human rights abuses in Iran has been called for Saturday , 12 June .
The initiative – coordinated by human rights group United4Iran – is being cosponsored by numerous organizations including Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , the Nobel Women 's Initiative , the Baha'i International Community , the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies , FIDH ( Federation Internationale des ligues des Droits de l'Homme ) , and Pen International .
" In our support for this nonpartisan initiative , we are standing together with ordinary citizens throughout the world to draw attention to the continuing and widespread abuse of human rights in Iran , " said Diane Ala'i , representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations in Geneva .
The prominent nongovernmental organizations are joining with a wide range of local , student and Internet - based groups to host simultaneous events in cities and on campuses around the globe .
Online initiatives include sending messages to specific recipients in support of individual prisoners of conscience .
The campaign website can be visited here .
An " overwhelming " response
Earlier this month , United4 Iran marked the second anniversary – on 14 May – of the jailing of seven Baha 'i leaders in Tehran 's Evin prison , calling for individuals to show support by replicating the size of the small jail cells and taking a photograph .
" The response was overwhelming , " reported the United4 Iran website .
" Notes , emails , video , old photographs of the leaders , former students , ( and ) community representatives from all the world participated . "
As a gesture of solidarity , supporters were asked to mark off the size of the cells shared by the Baha 'i prisoners then occupy the space , so as to better appreciate their suffering .
The cells of the Baha 'is in Evin prison do not have beds , forcing the prisoners to sleep on the concrete floor .
A video was posted online to show some of the photos the organization received .
View the video here .
United4Iran also published an old photograph of one of the jailed Baha'is , Fariba Kamalabadi , with one of her former students .
The student sent the picture to United4 Iran along with words from a letter she wrote to her teacher : " Now that you are in prison ... for making the world a better place , ... it brings tears to my eyes .
And all I can do is pray .
The things you taught me I will always know . "
" We are grateful for this outpouring of sympathy being offered to the people of Iran who are subject to oppression , " said Ms. Ala'i .
The website of United4 Iran can be viewed here .
Other initiatives
Several other organizations have recently launched campaigns in support of Iran 's oppressed Baha 'i community .
The latest newsletter of the French branch of the organization Christians for the Abolition of Torture ( ACAT - France ) includes a call for action in support of the seven imprisoned Baha 'i leaders , as well as 12 other Baha 'is who have been recently detained .
On 14 March , Amnesty International requested messages of goodwill be sent to prisoners of conscience in Iran in order to mark the traditional Persian new year holiday .
The detained leaders of Iran 's Baha 'i community were included among seven cases selected by Amnesty International .
To date , almost 600 messages have been received for the Baha 'i prisoners – both individually and collectively – from as far afield as Japan , New Zealand , the Netherlands , and the United States .
More details of Amnesty International 's campaign can be found here .
The seven Baha 'i leaders jailed in Tehran for the past two years are among about 36 Baha 'is currently imprisoned in Iran because of their religion .
Framing the Arizona immigration situation as a “ moral crisis , ” a group of seven Arizona religious leaders , including Catholic and Methodist bishops , descended Thursday on Capitol Hill in an “ emergency ” visit to lobby for comprehensive immigration reform .
“ Our role here is to invite dialogue … on this complex issue with many dimensions , ” said Bishop Gerald Frederick Kicanas of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson after a morning meeting with Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
“ The church believes there ’s a need for respect and dignity , and we speak up for people who have their dignity violated .
“ We agree there ’s a criminal network that has developed and that needs to be addressed , ” Kicanas said .
“ But border security alone has its limits on what can be accomplished . ”
Kicanas spoke before moving on to meetings with officials from the White House and the Justice and Homeland Security departments .
The group planned to ask Justice Department officials to , at the very least , try to delay the July implementation of the Arizona immigration law to give Congress more time to act on comprehensive changes .
Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said Sunday that the department was considering a lawsuit to stall the law , among other options .
The law allows police to demand citizenship papers from suspected illegal immigrants and to detain them if they can’t produce proof .
“ We are here … not in political capacities but as religious leaders , ” Kicanas said , “ to prod , encourage and advocate comprehensive immigration reform . ”
Kicanas said in a memo to his parishioners last month that the Catholic Church should join lawsuits challenging the Arizona immigration legislation .
Kicanas said the leaders were focusing on McCain because they believe he “ has been and continues to be an important voice . ”
McCain , however , has dropped his longtime support for comprehensive immigration reform as he faces a strong Republican primary challenge from former Rep. J.D. Hayworth , who is attacking McCain ’s failed 2007 attempt to pass an immigration bill .
The leaders ’ visit came as polls were released showing the extent of American support for the Arizona law .
In a Wall Street Journal / NBC poll released Thursday , 46 % of respondents said they strongly supported the measure , and 24 % were strongly opposed .
Ten percent of Americans polled called immigration the nation ’s most important problem in a Gallup survey released Wednesday .
It was the highest percentage with that opinion that Gallup had recorded in more than two years .

The world of iPad apps just got a whole lot more metal with the launch of Slayer : Pinball Rocks , a new game featuring an animated skull that eats your ball and spits it out through its eye hole
" As a life - size pinball player , this looks so awesome , " said Slayer 's Kerry King in a press release announcing the app , available for iPad , iPhone and iPod Touch .
" It looks really fun and entertaining , with a shot of evil , and it could definitely keep me up all night with a few shots for myself . "
The $ 3 Slayer : Pinball Rocks app ( iTunes link ) comes steeped in metal imagery like guitars , amps and razor blades .
It features music from Slayer 's latest record , World Painted Blood , as well as voiceovers by band members .
A Pinball Rocks promo video on the Slayer site shows the game 's " realistic gaming experience , " although if you 're twitching like the game 's jittercam when you play that silver ball , you should probably seek medical attention .

The 2010 NHL Entry Draft is quickly approaching , and , thus far , the Flames ' first pick will be in the third round , 64th overall .
I 've decided to profile a few players whom the Flames could potentially select come June 25th - 26th .
Today 's player is Avon Old Farms / UMass winger Mike Pereira .
Ranked 63rd by Central Scouting in their final rankings , he moved up 14 spots from his mid-term ranking of 77th overall .
Team : Avon Old Farms School ( Connecticut )
Position : LW
Height : 5 '11 "
Weight : 170 lbs .
In his second and final season of high school hockey , Mike Pereira led the underdog Winged Beavers in scoring with 28 goals and 64 points en route to their eighth New England Prep School Ice Hockey Association championship .
His performance in the playoffs , where he out - played fellow draft prospect Kevin Hayes ( ranked 26th overall by CSS ) , is what drew the attention of NHL scouts , including regional scout Gary Eggleston , who had this to say about Pereira in the New England Hockey Journal :
" His skating ability ( is his best attribute ) .
First of all , he has that speed that allows him to see a hole and get through it .
He ’s very dangerous with the puck down low ; he ’s a good stick - handler who ’s very patient and sees the ice so well .
He ’s also got a very accurate wrist shot that he uses effectively . "
In an interview with McKeen 's , Pereira assessed his strengths and weaknesses from his own point of view :
I think I play a fast - paced , high - tempo game .
I consider myself a playmaker .
I make plays and open up time and space for myself with my speed .
My strengths are my speed , my vision , and my positioning in the offensive zone .
I believe that I need to get stronger and support the puck better .
I think I have to work on my strength and conditioning to play at the next level .
I believe that my shot is the most underrated facet to my game .
It has improved in the past couple years and I have put a lot of time into it .
It might not be the hardest shot in the game , but it gets where it needs to be .
I think I work hard as well .
I 'm not the biggest guy on the ice by any means , but I still go in the corners and work against kids a lot bigger than me .
I enjoy it .
Pereira attended the recent NHL draft combine , where he placed within the top ten in four tests indicating speed and fitness .
This fall , he will attend UMass - Amherst , where he will enter the ranks of NCAA hockey .
Here 's what UMass blog Fear the Triangle had to say in their scouting report of Pereira :
He had very good vision of the ice on both offense and defense .
I was happy to see him on the first penalty killing unit which hopefully means he could be an asset on defense .
I did n’t see too much physical play from him , but there was an instance early on where he completely levelled a Deerfield player along the boards to keep the puck in the offensive zone .
UMass lost two forwards to the NHL this past season , as Casey Wellman ( Minnesota Wild ) and James Marcou ( San Jose Sharks ) both signed on as unrestricted free agents , so Pereira should see a decent amount of ice time in his first season of college hockey .
Much like the majority of potential Flames draftees I 've evaluated so far , Pereira is a good skater who is skilled offensively but is somewhat lacking in size and strength ; however that does n't appear to be a huge impediment to his overall game , and is something that will likely improve as he progresses in his college hockey career .
Although the Flames have largely avoided drafting college players after what looks to be a few failed experiments , Pereira is a guy I would n't be adverse to them selecting , should he be available .
Fifa has ordered an investigation into security at Ellis Park in Johannesburg after a green laser pen was shone at players during yesterday 's match between Argentina and Nigeria .
A green beam could be seen being shone at various players , and in the direction of the Argentina coach Diego Maradona , during the match and raises questions over how such an item was able to be smuggled through the security checkpoints .
Fifa said in a statement : " We noticed this incident once and immediately asked the stadium security to look into the matter .
According to the information that we have at this time , the incident only occurred once .
Also at the time of writing , we have not received any comment from any of the teams . "
Nicolas Maingot , the head of Fifa 's media department , added : " I do n't have reports that the security perimeters are not working .
Security perimeters are essential for any big competition and are important for the smooth process of security .
That is functioning well .
" The laser was stopped immediately , it was used once during the game and we did n't see it any longer .
We informed the relevant people in charge at the game and it was very quickly stopped . "
It is not the first time a laser pen has been used at a high - profile match , with Cristiano Ronaldo being targeted during a game for Manchester United against Lyon in the Champions League in February 2008 .
Flash may suck — but I miss it anyway
Also , say what you will about Flash being a battery hog and all , but using Flash - based navigation on the iPad is clunky , and surfing to , say , Hulu , only to be told that you 're a second - class netizen , is dispiriting .
But Flash aside , the couch scenario is hailed as one of the iPad 's selling points .
Browsing , watching videos , fiddling about with photos , playing games — the iPad is designed to allow you to consume and enjoy while kicking back .
Too bad it 's uncomfortable to do so .
If only the iPad 's edges were more rounded to make it more comfortable to hold .
If only its glossy display did n't so distractingly reflect overhead lights , windows , and the like .
If only it weighed less .
Yes , 1.5 pounds ( 0.68 kg ) may not sound like much , but — and you simply have to take my word for this , or you stud - muffins may simply disagree — holding the iPad for any amount of time gets uncomfortable .
And do n't try to prop it up on your thigh , since its back surface is too slippery — another argument for that nifty Apple iPad Case .
Then there 's reading — the activity for which I 've used my iPad more than anything else .
Personally , I prefer using Amazon 's Kindle app on my iPad because it 's less distractingly tricked - out than Apple 's own pseudo book - like iBooks app ( but do download the handy 280 - page iPad User Guide from the iBook Store ) .
Due to the iPad 's less - than - comfortable couch usage , I 've used it mostly to read during my daily commute , as has Michael Miller over at PC Mag , who found the iPad to be a great commuting partner .
Miller , however , apparently gets to sit down during his trip to his New York office , while I 'm jammed in a San Francisco subway , jostling for space with other vertical wage slaves .
Those of you who commute by Ryanair , well , knock yourselves out .
After a few weeks of using my iPad as an e-reader on crowded trains , I went back to using my iPhone , which is lighter , smaller , and far easier to use with one hand — and it fits in my pocket .
Although some of my acquaintances think I 'm crazy to use an iPhone as an e-reader , it 's wonderfully convenient and perfectly legible .
So much so that I read all of War and Peace on my iPhone during my daily commute .
Seriously .
No joke .
Games ?
I 'm not the guy to ask .
I 've dabbled with Fieldrunners for iPad , Labyrinth 2 HD , and Real Racing HD , and , yes , more pixels do make for a more - involving gaming experience than with equivalent games on the iPhone or iPod touch .
Duh .
Personally , though , I prefer to waste my time and brain cells reading some pointless Stieg Larsson silliness or another magnum Russian opus , thankyouverymuch .
Finally , digital morality enters the evaluative picture : the entire convoluted matter of how the iPad / Pod / Phone 's application ecosystem is a walled garden and whether we , as consumers , should acquiesce to it or rebel against it .
Seasoned Reg readers will know that I 've weighed in on this matter ad nauseam , and that I'm of the belief that Apple 's control - freakiness is good for neither the company , its developers , nor its users .
That said , no one is forcing you , dear Reg reader , to buy an iPad / Pod / Phone — you know what you 're getting into when you ship your dinero a Cupertino .
You pays your money and you makes your choice .
The red pill or the blue pill — you 're a grown - up .
It 's your call .
It 's not the draconian App Store police who are causing me to use my iPad less and less since the day I bought it .
It 's not Steve Jobs ' arrogance that keeps me from leisurely surfin ' and readin ' and watchin ' from the comfort of my couch .
It 's not the unfairness of Apple 's developers agreement that has stopped me from taking my iPad with me on my daily commute .
The reason that I rarely pick up my iPad after that first blush of fanboi fascination is that I have little use for it .
The iPad is a replacement for neither a netbook nor a notebook .
It 's a different category of device entirely .
However , in its current incarnation — although I do get some utility and entertainment out of it in specific usage scenarios — it 's in a category that is yet of little value to me .
Perhaps not to you , either .
To turn that collegiate break - up line on its head , " No , iPad , it 's not me .
It 's you . " ®
Newswise —
The University of Illinois at Chicago has received a $ 2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to investigate sexual assault victims ' recovery .
The five - year study will examine how support received by female victims of sexual assault aids their coping and post - assault adjustment -- particularly as it relates to post - traumatic stress disorder , problem drinking and positive adaptation .
" Sexual assault is a serious public health issue that affects approximately 25 percent of American women , " says Sarah Ullman , UIC professor of criminology , law , and justice and the study 's principal investigator .
" Earlier studies have shown that post - traumatic stress disorder and problem drinking are common after - effects experienced by women victims of sexual assault , yet the role of the social support in understanding these outcomes is still unclear . "
Ullman and her colleagues will recruit more than 1,800 women who as adults experienced either attempted or completed rape and who disclosed their incident to at least one informal source .
Participants will respond to a series of mail surveys conducted over several years .
To gain greater insight into the relations between social support and post - assault adjustment , the researchers will also examine the influence of support on survivors ' risk for experiencing another sexual assault .
A segment of the study will test whether post - assault adjustment varies depending on whether the assault was alcohol - related and whether the victim disclosed the involvement of alcohol .
Finally , researchers will interview victims to learn more about their experiences disclosing the assault to their social networks .
An informal social - network member selected by each victim will be interviewed about their experience of hearing about the assault and supporting the victim .
" We anticipate this will yield better understanding of how social support influences post - assault adjustment and whether there are differences depending on whether the victim is a problem drinker or experienced an alcohol - related assault , " said Ullman , author of a new book " Talking About Sexual Assault : Society 's Response to Survivors . "
" It is important to look at different assault dynamics and both sides of the disclosure process in order to effectively address victims ' needs . "
Ullman said the results of the study could be used to develop specialized interventions to improve recovery ; to tailor programs for alcohol - related and non-alcohol related assaults ; and to design prevention programs aimed at reducing the recurrence of assault .
Co-investigators include Stephanie Riger , UIC professor of psychology and gender and women 's studies , and Richard Campbell , UIC professor of biostatistics .
UIC ranks among the nation 's leading research universities and is Chicago 's largest university with 26,000 students , 12,000 faculty and staff , 15 colleges and the state 's major public medical center .
A hallmark of the campus is the Great Cities Commitment , through which UIC faculty , students and staff engage with community , corporate , foundation and government partners in hundreds of programs to improve the quality of life in metropolitan areas around the world .

What , no U.S. Coast Guard threatening the news crew with arrest on behalf of BP ?
Via : Technofascism Blog :
According to a recent NPR article , Steve Wereley , engineering professor at Purdue University , estimates the oil spill as “ now approaching 100,000 barrels a day .
And , there ’s another leak he has yet to analyze . ”
That ’s 4.2 million gallons per day .
By his estimate , 124 million gallons have spilled so far .
If Prof Wereley is correct , it ’s only been a month and the amount of oil spilled has already topped the second largest oil spill in history : the Ixtoc 1 Mexico Oil Spill of 1980 .
By coincidence , that spill was also in the Gulf of Mexico .
Like the BP oil spill , the Ixtoc spill was due to an explosion in an offshore oil rig that caused a leak that could n’t be capped for a entire year despite attempts to shoot material into the well pipe and drilling nearby relief wells .
During that year , the Ixtoc spill continuously leaked 30,000 gallons per day .
If it also takes a year to cap the BP spill , by that time , over a billion gallons of oil will have spilled into US coastal waters making it the worst oil spill in history .
With that much oil carried by the currents of the Gulf Stream , the entire Eastern seaboard of the US and even Europe could be affected .

NEW YORK -- Umpire Joe West , White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen and pitcher Mark Buehrle were fined by Major League Baseball on Friday in the wake of their balk flap .
A person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press there were n't any suspensions .
The amount of the fines was not known .
Guillen and Buehrle were ejected by West on Wednesday for arguing a pair of balk calls in Chicago 's 5 - 4 win over Cleveland .
Guillen was tossed for arguing the first balk .
An inning later , Buehrle threw his glove to the ground after another balk call and had to be restrained .
" I did n't say anything .
I did n't touch anybody .
I did n't do anything to cause anything , " Buehrle said before Friday night 's game at Tampa Bay .
" I figured there was going to be a fine because no matter what , you get tossed from a game no matter what it is , there 's always a fine .
That 's what I assumed I was getting .
If I was getting suspended , I think I would have been surprised , yeah . "
West is the head of the umpires ' union .
He was penalized after his publicist revealed West 's schedule and told the media the veteran umpire was available to revisit April comments about the New York Yankees and Boston playing so slowly .
Asked about the fine before Friday night 's game between Kansas City and Red Sox at Fenway Park , he said : " I will say that 's none of your business . "
Guillen was away from the White Sox for a day to attend his son's high school graduation in Miami Gardens , Fla .
Guillen unleashed a profanity - filled tirade about West after the ejections , saying , " sometimes he thinks people pay to watch him umpire . "
The manager said he argued because he thought West was showing up Buehrle .
" He 's the type of guy that wants to control the game , and to me is one of the best umpires in the game , no doubt , " Guillen added .
After the White Sox -Indians game , West disputed Guillen 's version of the events .
" I do n't know what he 's talking about .
Ozzie came out because Buehrle was making gestures on the mound that could have got him kicked out so he was protecting Buehrle , that 's all he was doing .
I do n't have a problem with that , " West said .

Our society makes it difficult to go through an entire day without hearing about someone 's medical suffering .
I shall not contest the fact that millions of American 's are suffering with diseases , routine sicknesses , and pharmaceutically - induced side effects .
However , it must be stated that virtually all of our illnesses are needless , and even self - inflicted .
We have been so brainwashed into believing that routine illnesses are normal that anyone disputing this dogma has become a politically incorrect fool .
This may seem harsh to some readers initially , but it is absolutely true .
Most people are negligent about their health most of the time , and utterly suckered by the establishment .
They eat genetically engineered , radioactive , and processed foods every day having little regard for the eventual consequences .
Sooner or later , they find themselves being chemically treated for relatively non-existent diseases , such as " high cholesterol " , and such " conditions " eventually become heart disease to everyone 's surprise , diabetes , and perhaps the random symptoms of fibromyalgia .
This cascading collapse of health is never blamed on the pharmaceuticals that were initially given , despite these problems being clearly cited in studies .
Instead , patients are interrogated about the dangerous alternatives that might compete with the drugs , as if data actually existed to support such hysteria .
The facts and the science must never be allowed to cause deviations from the business agenda of keeping us as perpetually addicted customers .
It is never mentioned that most pharmaceuticals directly , or indirectly act as immuno - suppressants , or that they cause varying degrees of malnutrition by impeding a body 's ability to absorb nutrients .
These factors are , in large part , the real reasons why we are seeing so many epidemics of supposedly " incurable " chronic diseases .
You can be assured that it is not the herbs and vitamins .
Remember this as you funnel more money to these crooks by " walking for the cure " .
Believe me , they do not really wish to find a cure .
That would mean finding real jobs , which might cause a callous on their baby - soft hands .
It reminds me of something Thomas told me about computer programming .
In the realm of professional programming , there is an old concept known as " FIFO " .
The acronym " FIFO " represents " first in is first out " , and means that data is handled in the same order that it was received , on a first - come , first - serve basis .
In time , as Microsoft software became more popular , some programmers began using the acronym " CICO " too .
This new one is short for " crap input equals crap output " .
The implication is that if you fill a computer with garbage software and input bad data , then the finished result is garbage too .
This principle is exactly why only Microsoft software has viruses .
Their marketers have spent millions convincing us that computer viruses are normal .
They 're not .
The Health Wyze Report uses Linux based software , so we are not using a CICO system .
We are immune to all computer viruses , and about 99 % of the " hacker " attacks because of this .
In other words , our computers get sick about as often as we do .
You probably thought computer viruses were " normal " , just like " routine " human viruses , right ?
Diseases are not uncommon , and it is truly sad when people get to that stage without ever realizing the cause and effect relationships .
What is even worse is that many of the diseased people who surround us have moved past this stage , actually knowing the cause of their sicknesses , and yet they continue to contribute to their own diseases by searching for more chemical warfare based solutions to their problems .
It was the poisonings that got them into these situations in the first place .
These people obediently ignore alternative options .
They are advised by friends and family to eat a better diet , and incorporate exercise into their lifestyle , but they only provide excuses for why this cannot be accomplished .
A colleague of mine from Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth is the perfect example of this phenomena .
For the sake of his privacy , he will be renamed to ' Philip ' for this article .
Philip has diabetes , and multiple other conditions that could easily be described as ' uncontrolled ' .
He rarely attends our site meetings , because of his persistent hospital visits , which range from surgeries to new prescriptions for experimental FDA - approved medications .
Philip is n't getting any better , in case you did n't already guess .
When he does manage to attend meetings , he is asked about his health by concerned individuals .
On each occasion , it becomes blatantly obvious that despite all of the doctor visits and expensive new drugs , his conditions are forever tail - spinning .
We are still waiting for him to notice the pattern .
Faced with his dire situation , Philip nevertheless steadfastly refuses any alternative help .
I personally sent him information about curing diabetes , along with an offer to speak with him about his other health problems , to no avail .
Others who care deeply for him have tried to encourage drug - free options , such as diet and exercise .
He claims that his condition is too severe for this to work , and he knows that this is the case because his doctor has told him that diabetes is irreversible .
As a child , I always pondered why the Jewish , disabled , and gypsies who were held in concentration camps had willingly walked to their own executions ; seemingly without fighting .
Footage from the period shows people being shot into graves that they had dug for themselves .
I can think of no better analogy for the current health care system .
People who enter the system rarely turn back until it is already too late for anyone to really help them .
They are frequently missing multiple organs by the time that they turn to alternative medicine for help .
Of course , the quick demise of these people is then blamed on their alternative treatments , instead of the treatments that had already placed them with one foot inside the grave .
We have seen this pattern with almost every case whereby a death was blamed on " alternative medicine " .
In the case of those held at NAZI concentration camps , the fluoride experiments that first began at these places was one reason for the pacifism , particularly when it was combined with several years of living in harsh conditions with sparse food .
The fluoride and chemical - numbing of our present society is partially the reason for our modern day complicity , but there are more reasons behind our madness .
Being a diabetic or cancer patient is so common that it has almost become popular .
The phrase , " are you type 1 or type 2 " is bound to become a popular pick - up line in bars .
Sympathy pours in from all directions .
There are hundreds of groups that exist to funnel more money into " helping find the cure " ( into the same chemical industry that caused it ) .
We can take walks with other sufferers , and we feel relieved to be finally unburdened of our personal responsibility .
Being diseased is like joining a club that everybody recognizes , and you will be given special treatment by all who are aware of your membership .
It is a position of privilege , and thus being healthy is not always desired .
It gives people a reason to stay sick , and to revel in their disabilities , in exactly the same way that A.D.D. is being used as a V.I.P. pass in the public schools .
Disease has been mainstreamed .
It 's cool .
These days , a large portion of the walking - dying do not actually want to recover from their conditions .
I became most aware of this phenomenon when I read comments on an article about cancer treatments .
People anonymously admitted that being cured of cancer is emotionally difficult for them ; not because of legitimate health considerations , but because their peers respond to them differently .
They will no longer be victims who deserve to be showered with constant sympathy , but people who are expected to move on with their lives .
They have become semi-dependent on the attention that is provided to them by the collective society .
In a similar vein , taking an alternative treatment option means stepping away from a supportive herd , who will remain perpetually sick .
It sometimes means stepping into an unknown area , and this seems frightening , even when it is more logical .
After all , the failure rates of modern medicine surround us , and it is the reason why we are still walking for the cure , and buying pink Tic Tacs .
Seeking alternative options would seem to be human nature , and we would expect to find it incorporated into the survival instinct .
However , society actually discourages recovery through its treatment of sufferers .
When we provide limitless sympathy to those who are perpetually sick by choice , then we remove their incentive to get well .
We would be helping those people much more by providing them encouragement to take responsibility for their health , and avoiding the temptation to provide sympathy .
Obese people and smokers who suffer from disease are frowned upon by society , because it has become politically correct to blame these people for their conditions .
Ironically , their diseases are just as often not their fault , but that is a lengthy topic for another time .
The reaction by society against these groups seems harsh , so we ponder why this same attitude is not directed onto those with other conditions , such as cancer and heart disease .
The mainstream media is not willing to report the studies which prove that exercise and improved diet remedy all of the conditions that plague our modern society .
The highest paying sponsors for most media sources are the pharmaceutical companies , followed by junk food companies .
This hinders their ability to engage in honest journalism , because money is vital for their survival .
Thus , they avoid topics which would cause them to have reduced incomes .
Take for example how the media 's tobacco pile - on happened just after it became illegal for the tobacco companies to pay them for advertising .
It was as if the mafia don's had to exert pay - back because they were no longer getting their protection money .
Take as another example , how many times have we heard , " when diet and exercise fail ... " ?
Just look at what they managed to plant into our unconscious psyches !
A good diet and moderate exercise are always enough .
Encouraging people to become self - reliant is bad for the pharmaceutical , medical , insurance , and processed foods industries .
Let 's face it people : they practically own us .
They control everything we see and hear in the Big Media .
Thus , dependence upon the disease and sickness industry is tacitly integrated into society by the media , who treats its victims with mocking pity and privilege , instead of motivating them to take responsibility for themselves , eat well , and regain control of their lives .
It 's time that those who are on the medical treadmill stopped listening to others who are sick .
Should you be getting your health advice from a sick person ?
Seriously : is n't that patently stupid ?
Would you hire a carpenter whose own house was condemned ?
It 's like getting computer security advice from a Microsoft employee , who thinks that a ' hack ' is a slicing movement with a sword .
In reality , groups of cancer victims meeting together is actually a bad thing , because none of them have been truly cured .
Instead , they encourage each other to continue with treatments that they would have otherwise reconsidered , due to their unnecessary suffering , and their inherent survival instincts .
In fact , this is why hospitals form and encourage such groups .
It 's incredibly sick on so many levels .
Recovery does not come from group meetings , pink Tic Tacs , or sympathy baskets .
It comes with personal responsibility ; because the willingness to achieve optimal health is the duty of every human being : to themselves , and to their loved ones .

n a small room within a large house its construction nearly complete with a breathtaking view of a valley of argan trees , a Moroccan carpenter planes doors made of local cedar wood .
It seems unlikely that he knows exactly what he is making .
In fact , for the past few weeks he has been building the holy ark for the synagogue of the Moroccan community of Kfar Sava .
When the ark is ready , the owner of the house , Claude Senouf , a Jewish painter and journalist , will ship it to the central Israeli city , where it will be dedicated in honor of his grandfather , Raoul , who was one of Morocco ’s moneyed elite .
By then , too , the construction of Senouf ’s magnificent home in western Morocco , not far from the town of Essaouira on the Atlantic coast , will be finished .
You may not have heard of Essaouira , but it was the birthplace of A.B. Yehoshua ’s mother .
The future writer was sent there in 1950 , during the period of the austerity regime in Israel , to cavort for three months with his cousins .
He has not been back since .
Yehoshua told me that it was in Essaouira that the seeds of his 1997 novel “ Voyage to the End of the Millennium ” began to germinate .
This week , an herbs and spices stall in the local market still had signs in Hebrew , such as : “ Heightens desire for men and women , ” and “ Operates against kidney stones . ”
Also born in this colorful town , the only place in the Arab world that had a Jewish majority , were Andre Azoulay and his wife , Katia .
I have met few people as impressive as Azoulay , the long - time chief adviser to the king of Morocco .
His deportment , together with the tone and content of his speech , bespeak nobility and sagacity .
More than 25 years ago , when I first met him , I called the hotel in Jerusalem where he was staying and asked to speak with Mr. Azoulay .
“ Does he work in the hotel ? ” the operator asked me , obviously thinking that Azoulay could not be the name of a guest .
Azoulay still likes to recall that incident .
Katia Azoulay also has an unfortunate recollection from Israel , where someone once remarked to her , “ You do n’t look in the least Moroccan . ”
Azoulay was somewhat dispirited and disturbed when I met him late last month .
For the first time in his impressive career as senior adviser to King Hassan II and to his son , the present monarch , King Mohammed VI , Azoulay was accused by a local attorney , Khalid Soufiani , a pro-Palestinian activist of being a Zionist agent in the employ of the Mossad .
Azoulay has an impressive background .
He established the Identity and Dialogue group , one of the first forums to call for negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians , back in the 1970s .
He has devoted much of his career to working for peace between Jews and Arabs and always took pride in his Jewish identity while remaining a Moroccan patriot .
He is responsible in no small measure for the relative democratization his country has undergone and for its comparative economic prosperity .
He lived for about a quarter of a century in France and became an important economic figure there , but returned to his native land .
Yet he finds himself suddenly under a cloud .
It ’s hard to believe that this never happened before after all , he is a top Jewish adviser to the king of an Arab country , and with a home in Caesarea , too ( until he sold it because of the frequent break - ins ) .
But that says something about the openness in Morocco , where everyone is meticulous about calling the king “ his majesty . ”
The headlines of the kingdom ’s newspapers immediately came to Azoulay ’s defense , and Azoulay himself did not hesitate to take part at the end of April in the annual gathering of the Mimouna Club an organization that seeks to preserve the Jewish cultural heritage in Morocco held at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane .
Mimouna , the traditional Moroccan festival marking the end of Passover , is held in Morocco ’s answer to Switzerland .
Ifrane is an elegant ski resort in the Atlas Mountains that seems to have been cloned from the Alps , with a university in which the language of instruction is English .
Yet the university , which was established with Saudi funds as compensation for the pollution of the Moroccan coastline by a Saudi oil tanker , hosts the Mimouna Club meeting every year , with a large sign in Hebrew at the entrance to the resplendent auditorium .
There is an exhibition of photographs of Jews , the president of the university opens the gathering and the Secretary of State to the minister of tourism , Anis Birou , is present .
I could hardly believe my eyes .
Well , I could hardly believe my eyes altogether on this , my first visit to Morocco .
The first preconception was proved wrong even before we landed : it was clear through the window of the plane that Morocco is green .
In the days to come , many similar preconceived notions would have to be discarded .
Morocco is not what I thought , and maybe not what my readers think , either .
For Avraham Sabag , a ritual slaughterer , it was a particularly busy day , and he still had two more chickens to slaughter .
Nevertheless , Sabag , who also does ritual circumcision when needed , found time to show us around the mellah , the former Jewish ghetto of Fez .
Indifferently dressed and speaking an archaic Hebrew , Sabag doled out charity to the many local beggars with his left hand , because that is what Jewish law prescribes .
The left hand is used for giving to Arabs , he explained , just as one differentiates between sacred and profane , between the homes of the Jews and the homes of the Arabs .
“ There is no hatred here , ” Sabag said , after all his supercilious mannerisms toward the mendicant Arabs , some of whom kissed his hand .
Armenian music was playing in Senouf ’s Honda , followed by songs of Shlomo Bar , the Israeli musician , as we approached the House of the Living cemetery in the heart of Fez .
The Jewish - owned Apollo cinema used to be here on the left , while on the right are the plastered headstones , inscribed in beautiful Hebrew : “ A place of shrouding for a mortal ’s body , a concealment to preserve the body for when the dead shall return to life . ”
The cemetery was established hastily by the Jews when they were compelled to move it from a nearby site , but today it is better kept than any of the old Muslim cemeteries in Israel .
Here is the grave of the rabbi whose son is a bank clerk in Netanya , here the last resting place of a girl who died for her faith .
The former Azoulay Street in the mellah now has an Arab name , like all the other streets that once bore Jewish names , but the synagogue in the heart of the quarter has been superbly restored at the initiative of Andre Azoulay , of course .
There are only about 60 Jews left in Fez ; our slaughterer , who is well into his sixties , is one of the youngest .
Sabag is considering immigration to Israel : his son has arranged a job for him as a kashrut supervisor in an Eilat hotel .
Some of the Jews we met , notably our escort , Senouf , dream of applying the Moroccan model to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
A colorful , charming figure , Senouf is now planning a project in which Israelis and Palestinians will come to Morocco to study the nitty - gritty of coexistence together with Moroccans .
But in Morocco , as elsewhere , the Jewish community , which numbers only about 3,000 souls , does not speak in one voice .
At the Ifrane conference , for example , Simon Levy , a communist and the director of the Museum of Moroccan Judaism in Casablanca , likened the Israeli occupation in the territories to Nazism .
He also reminded the audience that the greatest massacre of Jews in history was perpetrated by Europeans , not by Arabs .
Andre Azoulay told the gathering : “ I have been a Moroccan for 3,000 years .
I am a Moroccan and a Jew .
Here in this country Jews and Muslims are brothers .
We are the only ones who can say this . ”
Morocco is a wonderful country , a land of contradictions and contrasts : the explicit and the mysterious , the overt and the veiled .
There is much less interest in the Palestinian issue than one might expect domestic issues are more acute : democratization , the economic situation , the faltering education and health systems , the Moroccan diaspora and the disputed Western Sahara , which no one dares mention .
The economic and social situation is a faithful reflection of the kingdom ’s geographic location between Europe and Africa .
There are apparently far fewer political prisoners nowadays , and people no longer disappear without a trace .
Kamal Lahbib , who spent five years in prison for communist activity , met with us at a trendy cafe in Casablanca and spoke freely .
Two hours from here , in a prestigious suburb of Marrakech , lunch is served at the home of Liz Lalanne and her partner , Jean - Pierre Benoliel .
The meal is taken next to the pool of their spacious estate , designed in ornate Moroccan style , which seems to have leaped from the pages of a fashionable interior design magazine .
The maid , signaled by an electric buzzer that keeps her moving between the guests and the kitchen , serves couscous , while the three house gardeners toil to level the grass in the sprawling five - dunam ( 1.25 acre ) garden .
At the home of a former health minister , Dr. Abd Al - Rahim Haroushi , located in an affluent suburb of Casablanca , the host proudly shows off the many modern Moroccan works of art that adorn the walls .
His wife , Claude , speaks knowledgeably about Amos Oz ’s “ A Tale of Love and Darkness , ” which she recently read and greatly admired .
Her husband sneaks a cigarette by the pool , out of sight of his wife .
A local Italian restaurant in the city serves prosciutto and Black Label on the rocks is offered at receptions , while outside many women wear the veil .
“ If not for the corruption , this place could be paradise , ” sighs one of my escorts .
Morocco , he means .
The fish market in Essaouira offers sardines and also sole and turbot , and then you move to the teeming workers ’ restaurant , meager in the extreme , where the fish is fried and served with tomato salad and French fries .
I have never eaten tastier seafood .
At the inn on the main road between Essaouira and Agadir , mutton is ordered in advance ; travelers delight in the stew , cooked on a low fire for three hours in an earthenware pot .
A bigger fire rises not far from there , at Had - Dra , site of the annual Fantasia .
For two weeks , tens of thousands of Moroccans stream here from all parts of the kingdom to view the great horse - riding spectacle .
Astride stylized saddles and holding colorful reins , the riders spur the animals on at frightening speed directly toward the audience .
At the last minute the last second they bring the purebred Arabian steeds to a halt and in unison fire rifles into the air , generating an earsplitting noise and enveloping the crowd in columns of smoke .
No doubt about it : the Moroccan rider is a man ’s man .
Through the smoke and the dust kicked up by the charging horses , against the backdrop of the looming Moroccan sunset , are the furrowed faces of the thousands who flock here by roads and trails , dozens of them standing in the back of every pickup , for what is sometimes a brutal trip of several days .
Many of them are illiterate some 45 percent of Morocco ’s rural population and 20 percent of its townsfolk cannot read or write and this is their premier event of the year .
The Fantasia festival was held in the third week of April , and in the following week a chamber music festival , of which the honorary president is Andre Azoulay , took place in Essaouira .
Azoulay beams with pleasure whenever anyone says something good about his hometown .
Snakes writhing to the tune of the flutes in the Marrakech market ; a tapestry of straw rugs in the market of Casablanca ; snow on the peaks of the Atlas Mountains in April ; dozens of police along the road leading to Mohammed V Airport , perhaps because Mohammed VI is about to pass that way ; traffic cops who waive your ticket in return for baksheesh , a small tip ; and many checkpoints whose meaning became clear only afterward : a large Al - Qaida underground cell was uncovered here .
A little Third World and a little First , Arabia and Africa with a touch of France , a land of almost limitless possibilities .
In a word , Morocco .

Marc Lemay Bloc Abitibi — Témiscamingue , QC
Madam Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise on this very important Bill C - 23 .
In the few minutes that are mine , I will try to describe the Criminal Records Act and what they are trying to do with Bill C - 23 .
I want to start by saying that the Bloc Québécois and I feel that this bill is probably not necessary to protect victims , because they are already adequately protected by the Criminal Records Act .
There was an incident , and we all know how today 's fine government reacts .
A hockey coach , Graham James , committed some really terrible acts , for which he was sentenced .
He served a prison term for sexual assault on two well - known hockey players , Sheldon Kennedy and Theoren Fleury .
He served his time , was released , and now lives in Mexico .
He got a pardon and the government blew a fuse because it thinks he should never have been able to do this .
I will define what a criminal record is for the benefit of the people listening to us .
It is created after someone commits a crime .
I should say right away that someone who commits a traffic offence or a hunting or fishing offence does not get a criminal record .
Those are offences against provincial laws , or even some federal laws , such as the Migratory Birds Convention Act .
There is no criminal record in those cases .
A record is created when someone commits a criminal offence and pleads guilty after having seen the evidence or is found guilty after a trial .
I will give an example to explain .
Someone is sentenced to five years in prison and three years of probation for armed robbery of a bank .
As soon as the sentence is spoken , he automatically gets a criminal record for the rest of his days .
Theoretically , he will be stained for life , but the stain can be removed .
I will get back to that in a moment .
What is important to emphasize is that a person who has been sentenced will have a criminal record that will follow him for the rest of his days , unless he gets a pardon .
It is called a pardon , but actually it is more like a suspended criminal record .
A person who was pardoned , in everyday legal jargon , if asked about any prior convictions , does not have to say he has a record .
The government wants to change this system by introducing a bill to suspend criminal records .
Why ?
A person who is sentenced to five years in prison plus three years of probation has a criminal record .
The government says not enough concern is shown for the victims , but that is not true .
The Criminal Records
Act gives the National Parole Board all the power it needs to ensure that people who get pardons are entitled to them and have earned them .
In the case we are concerned with , it is not true that anyone can get a pardon quickly and automatically .
That is not how things work in real life .
An individual is sentenced to imprisonment for five years with three years ’ probation , which makes a total of eight years .
That is easy to count .
The individual has to wait five more years before being able to make an application for a pardon , or , as we are calling it here , an application for a record suspension .
How does it work in real life ?
The individual serves their sentence , and then they are paroled , subject to conditions , and are still supervised until the end of the five - year sentence .
The three years ’ probation that the judge ordered when they were sentenced is added .
So after serving the five - year sentence , three years are added , during which the individual must keep the peace , be of good behaviour and report to an officer , as the law provides and as the court may direct .
The conditions of probation are set by the court .
Let us assume that all goes well , the individual serves his sentence , is released , is a good person , is reintegrated into society , and after three years ’ probation has committed no offences and has not breached parole in any way .
The individual will then have to wait five years , because that is what the law provides .
For a crime committed by an individual at the age of 18 or 19 or 20 , which unfortunately happens all too often , that individual will be under judicial oversight for the next 13 years , at least : a five - year sentence and three years ’ probation , plus five more years , because he has to wait five years before applying for a pardon .
All of that absolutely does not happen automatically .
The opposite is true .
In my former life , when I practised criminal law , I represented people like that , and we filled out the forms .
An individual can apply for a pardon on his own , but he can also have a lawyer to help .
Generally , the individual gets assistance because the procedure is very lengthy .
When I say very lengthy , that is a minimum , and it varies considerably based on the crime committed .
I will come back to the example of armed robbery that I gave at the beginning of my speech , for which the offender was sentenced to five years with three years ’ probation .
Generally , the National Parole Board will examine the individual ’s case very carefully before granting a record suspension , to use the term in the bill .
Even in sexual assault cases , the board that grants the suspension does a lot of checking .
The individual must first apply , fill out a form and send his criminal record , fingerprints and recent photos to the nearest RCMP office , which forwards it to the board .
At that time , an investigation is carried out .
This investigation is not necessarily public because it is the individual who has applied .
All police forces in Canada , Quebec and all other provinces are contacted to verify whether this individual may , by chance , be hiding offences to which he has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty of .
Naturally , if this is the case , this individual 's application for pardon or record suspension will be rejected .
He will then have to wait a long time to be pardoned .
Thus , the individual files an application , which is forwarded and then studied .
All police forces are contacted to determine whether or not the individual has other offences that he has not disclosed .
If there are none , it can take between six and eighteen months .
In my experience , it takes a minimum of one year before the individual is notified that his pardon , or record suspension , has been granted .
Thus , this is a very long process .
The Bloc Québécois will agree to study Bill C - 23 in committee because we must carefully examine how to proceed .
I have to say one thing .
Unfortunately , someone with a criminal record is marked .
This is what generally , and unfortunately quite often , happens .
Take the example of an individual who , at the age of 18 , commits a break and enter and is sentenced to a few weeks or months in jail , plus one year of probation .
Everyone in this House knows that we have a propensity to forget .
The individual is sentenced and then later forgets about it .
A few years later , he applies for a job .
Therein lies the problem with not obtaining a record suspension or pardon .
Some jobs are not open to those with a criminal record .
They can not be a member of the bar , and therefore a lawyer or notary , nor can they be a doctor or surgeon .
Some universities ask if applicants have a criminal record .
Those who have forgotten to declare it will be automatically rejected .
This is something we want to check when this bill goes to committee .
We should not do anything to hurt someone who is rehabilitated .
We are going to agree on that .
I just said that big , important word , “ rehabilitated ” .
The Conservatives always say we are more concerned about offenders than victims .
Individuals who are entitled to a record suspension are those who have truly been rehabilitated .
They have recognized their problems , dealt with them , served their sentence and been pardoned ; they have paid their debt to society .
We need to stop getting carried away .
Obviously , someone who has been charged with and convicted of murder may have a great deal of difficulty getting a record suspension .
The offender is convicted and serves a 25 - year sentence .
This bill does not target these people .
It is aimed much more at petty criminals .
I am in no way suggesting we should pardon every crime without checking .
With respect , I believe a person can be rehabilitated .
We all know people who have made foolish mistakes in their youth , and I can give some examples .
In my former life as a criminal lawyer , I had clients who had driven while impaired and unfortunately had been in an accident .
I can tell you that this is traumatic , but on top of the crime he has committed and the wrong he has done to a victim , the offender receives a sentence .
However , he will likely be able to obtain a pardon for this sentence once he is completely rehabilitated .
We need to be careful not to deprive individuals of the right to a record suspension if they have made every effort to rehabilitate themselves .
This is what worries me about this bill , and we will have to look at it very carefully in committee .
I agree that we need to be tough on criminals , but do we need to be as tough on someone who is completely rehabilitated ?
I have an example .
I represented someone who was sentenced to 36 months in prison for eight break and enters .
This person has been completely rehabilitated since then and today works as an expert mechanic .
If he had not been pardoned , he never would have been able to get this job .
That is the problem with this bill .
We must not deny a rehabilitated individual a decent job if he has served his prison term and successfully completed his probation under supervision .
Such a person is completely rehabilitated and after spending some time in society , is entitled to have his youthful mistakes erased .
Some people will point out that there are mature individuals , 40 or 50 years old , who commit sexual assault .
With all due respect to my opponents , this bill is not intended for those individuals .
A criminal who commits offence after offence is not the focus of this bill .
I have some examples .
A repeat offender will never receive a pardon .
His criminal record will never be suspended .
This bill is for individuals who have made a mistake or two over an extended period .
Unfortunately in our society , many people make mistakes and keep making mistakes .
Many university applications and job applications ask the applicant if they have ever been convicted of a criminal offence .
Having successfully applied for a pardon — or a record suspension — the individual is not required to answer that question .
He can say he has never been convicted .
By virtue of serving his sentence , resolving his problems with society and receiving a pardon from the governor in council , the individual 's record is suspended .
That is what we will be looking at in this bill in the coming weeks and months , if we are given the opportunity to do so .
Another aspect of this bill causes me great concern .
Someone who is pulled over and suspected of driving while impaired would be taken to the station and asked to do a breathalyzer test .
He gets a result of 0.7 , which is not so bad , but he would be charged with impaired driving .
His fingerprints would be taken and so would his photo .
That is what could happen under this bill .
This is completely unacceptable and goes against the charter , under which a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty .
This aspect of the bill should be withdrawn .
A person 's fingerprints and photo cannot be taken if they have not been found guilty or if they have not pleaded guilty .
This bill would change that process and that is unacceptable .
We think this is very dangerous .
This aspect will have to be explored further .
For now , we are voting in favour of this bill so that it can be studied in committee .
" The new plan for Silwan allows for the addition of thousands of housing units for the Arab sector and the resolution of hundreds of construction violations .
Barak should be one of the primary supporters of the plan , " the statement continued .
Rio Ferdinand 's elevation to England captain may have been a surprise to many pundits but it was written in the stars .
To be precise , in the star charts of Raymond Domenech .
The French coach , probably uniquely , and definitely bizarrely , admits that his team selection is influenced by astrology .
Shortly before the last World Cup Domenech ( Aquarius with Virgo rising ) claimed he had problems with Robert Pires because Pires was a Scorpio , who always worked against Domenech 's interests .
Domenech denied he selected teams on the basis of the zodiac but added , " all parameters have to be considered and I have added one by saying there is astrology involved " .

Pires was soon out of favour and has remained so , despite being a key figure in Villarreal 's progress in La Liga .
It may be a complete coincidence , but Bruno Pedretti , another Scorpio , was also quickly discarded while none of the original 39 players Domenech called up this week , for last night 's B international against Mali , and tonight 's senior game with England in Paris , is a Scorpio .
He has since summoned Anthony Réveillère , but the Lyons full - back , like fellow Scorpio Charles Itandje , the Liverpool goalkeeper , cannot be optimistic about his chances .
So imagine Domenech 's horror when he discovers that not only is Wayne Rooney a Scorpio , so is the new England captain .
Maybe Fabio Capello is even more cunning and devious than England fans had hoped .
Domenech also said he believed Leos made bad defenders , adding , " When I have got a Leo in defence , I 've always got my gun ready .
I know he 's going to want to show off at one moment or another and cost us . "
French defenders born under Leo include William Gallas , Gaël Clichy , Julien Escudé and Sébastien Squillaci , all of whom are in the squad , and the injured Mikaël Silvestre .
Perhaps Capello should prepare Rooney to be ready for the moment one of them shows off .
As was noted at the time of Domenech 's startling revelation , imagine how Glenn Hoddle would have been chewed up by the English media if he had made such an admission .
However , as Chelsea 's oscillating faith in Avram Grant indicates , football is a results business .
Hoddle made his comments about disabled people before the 1998 World Cup , when England were on a high , and nobody commented .
When he did so as the team appeared to be faltering , the pack pounced .
Domenech has survived the astrological confession , the banishment of popular veterans like Pires , and even the suspicion that his authority has limited reach , because the team have kept winning .
He took over from the Spurs - bound Jacques Santini after France 's shock defeat to Greece in the quarter - finals of Euro 2004 .
Domenech , a technocrat who had previously coached the Under - 21s , arrived with little support or fanfare .
Yet he has overseen two shaky , but successful tournament qualifications , and a World Cup campaign which ended in defeat only on penalties .
Bravo , n'est - ce pas ?
It is argued by his relatively small band of critics that any manager could match these achievements with the resources Domenech can draw on .
Despite losing seven players from his original squad , including players of the calibre of Thierry Henry , Patrick Vieira and Karim Benzema , he will be able to name two strong sides this week .
Such is the strength in depth of the French game neither Patrice Evra , nor Clichy , for example , are likely to win selection at left - back .
Barcelona 's Eric Abidal usually has that slot .
Capello's third - choice left - back is Nicky Shorey , but before English supporters become envious there are a few aspects of French football worth considering .
France produces more quality players than any country outside South America , but the best ply their trade elsewhere , many in the Premier League .
Les Bleus have reached two of the last three World Cup finals , winning in 1998 , and won the 2000 European Championship .
Unlike England they are at Euro 2008 .
Yet they have no representative in the last eight of the Champions League or Uefa Cup .
France 's only European club triumph in 52 years of competition was Marseilles ' 1993 European Cup success , of which they were subsequently stripped because of the club 's bribery scandal .
It is not as if the club game is , like the Championship here , thrilling in its mediocrity .
Le Championnat is already destined for Lyons , for a seventh successive season .
French attention is thus turning to the summer .
Tonight 's match , said Domenech , will be treated as a dress rehearsal for France 's ties with Italy , the Netherlands and Romania in the " group of death " .
The team 's other friendlies , against Ecuador , Paraguay and Colombia in May , are for fine - tuning .
Domenech says he has already selected , in his mind , 20 of his 23 - man squad .
It looks like being a powerful blend of youth and experience , but not everyone is sure he knows how to blend his promising ingredients .
The old guard are represented by the likes of 35 - year - old Lilian Thuram , who will be winning his 138th cap if he plays tonight , Gallas , Claude Makelele and , when fit , Henry and Vieira .
The young guns are led by Lyons ' Benzema ( 20 ) and Hatem Ben Arfa ( 21 ) and Marseilles ' Samir Nasri ( 21 ) .
The trio are , respectively , of Algerian , Tunisian and Berber origin , and are the first players of north African descent to emerge since Zinedine Zidane .
As usual , the clamour is to bring in the new and discard the old .
Thuram and Henry have both been out of sorts at Barcelona while Vieira has not played well for France recently .
Henry , however , has 17 goals in 35 games under Domenech while Vieira has tended to carry injuries into internationals this season – to Internazionale 's fury .
Thuram stewarded a defence that conceded three goals in nine " live " qualifiers .
All , it may be recalled , came good when it mattered in Germany .
What intrigues the French is the nature of these senior players ' relationship with Domenech .
No one has quite worked out whether France reached the 2006 World Cup final because of Domenech or despite him .
Several of the old guard had retired before being led back by Zidane , who was rumoured to have a strong influence in both team selection and strategy .
Zidane has gone , but many of his lieutenants remain .
Is their influence cramping the development of the younger players , who also include the less heralded Jérémy Toulalan and François Clerc , both of Lyons ?
The issue is made more pertinent by recent comments from Domenech which appeared to suggest he was thinking not of the Euros , but the 2010 World Cup .
If so the temptation must be to build the team around Franck Ribéry , who emerged during the World Cup , and has this season been wowing the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich .
Tonight 's team selection will provide a clue .
David Trezeguet , scorer of 34 goals in 69 internationals , has been recalled in the wake of the withdrawals , just weeks after the Juventus striker , long overlooked , said , " I 'm seriously considering quitting international football .
The way [ Domenech ] has treated me is frankly unacceptable . "
Trezeguet will be encouraged by the fact that Nicolas Anelka was equally dismissive of the coach in the past , but is now back in the fold .
Others , however , have not been forgiven .
Ludovic Giuly , dropped before the World Cup , said he " deserved more respect " .
Like Pires , he has not been recalled .
Domenech tips Italy and Germany for Euro 2008 as " their teams are not in a complicated situation " .
As for who will wins tonight 's game , better turn to the horoscope page and see what is in store for Aquarians , Scorpios and Geminis such as Capello .
The best league in the world is back .

The last time we took a look at a pair of Gunnar glasses , ones designed to ease eye strain when playing games or looking at a computer screen for long periods of time , the results were somewhat controversial in the comments .
The company has just sent us another set of glasses to review , and this time the product is even more niche : higher quality 3D glasses .
These are passive 3D glasses , compatible with the RealD technology used in theme parks and movie theaters , so if you 're in the market for a TV that uses active glasses technology , you 're out of luck here .
Like all 3D glasses , they 're not cheap , costing between $ 100 and $ 200 depending on style and options .
That being said , I carried my pair around E3 — which is a 3D - rich environment — and have used them extensively in the past few weeks .
They 're easy to fall in love with .
You do n't realize just how terrible the disposable 3D glasses you 're used to in movie theaters truly are until you wear a pair that actually fit a human head and do n't make you look silly .
These are pure luxury , and it's hard to find anyone who spends so much time looking at 3D content that this seems like a good deal .
Still , these glasses , quite simply , are awesome .
They look good , they feel great , and I noticed far less eye strain when wearing these compared to the bulky and uncomfortable stock glasses .
Gunnar is a company that seems to invite scorn with its techno - speak and high claims to go with their high prices , but every time I 've used one of their products I 've come away very happy with that 's being offered , even at the price being asked .
I still have my original set of glasses , and I 'm thinking these would be a great addition to our Child 's Play drive this coming holiday season ; who does n't want a super - comfortable pair of 3D glasses when watching a movie ?
CHARTER CHARGE : Shane Jones admitted that he had once chartered a plane and put it on his credit card but said he did so only after bad weather forced him to change his plans for getting from Kaitaia to Tauranga for a speaking engagement .
The rules on the use of ministerial credit cards are so lax that an $ 800 lunch for two would not even be queried by officials .
Credit card receipts released yesterday tell a story of government ministers thinking nothing of racking up bills for hundreds of dollars worth at a time of alcohol , food and other expenses on the taxpayer – including personal items such as golf clubs , new clothes , movies and massages .
The political future of rising Labour star Shane Jones is in tatters , with ministerial credit card receipts showing he billed pornographic movies to the taxpayer .
Often tipped as a future Labour leader , Mr Jones refused to resign over the scandal but appeared to leave the door open , saying he did not want to make any decisions in the heat of moment .
He publicly confessed to the spending after telling his wife early yesterday .
She was " injured and enraged " but he believed the family would pull through .
Mr Jones made no excuses for watching porn : " I 'm a red - blooded robust dude . "
There appeared to be no limits on what ministers believed they were entitled to charge – in one case more than $ 800 from a bike shop – some apparently thumbing their noses at warnings from officials not to use their cards for personal expenses , regardless of whether they intended repaying the money later .
Prime Minister John Key said there was always degree of subjectivity but much of what was being discussed was within the rules .
" The question is whether the rules are set appropriately , " he told Radio New Zealand .
" There 's nothing like the glare of the media , I think , to sharpen the minds of those who are guardians of taxpayers money . "
Ministers have a " very unusual job " which required travelling a lot and spending time away from home , Mr Key said .
However , there was increasing transparency on their expenses now internationally and the current situation did not reflect well on politics in general , he said .
" It 's the sort of thing that can undermine confidence in politicians . "
A spokesman for Ministerial Services , which oversees ministerial credit card spending , said ministers were trusted to spend what was " actual and reasonable " .
" They are still required to submit a statement and receipt but that is what they are required to do and we would accept that , " Allen Walley said .
" They are ministers of the Crown , do n't forget . "
Prime Minister John Key had requested a review by the auditor - general 's office of the systems , rules and protocols around ministerial credit cards , which was under way , Mr Walley said .
" When it comes back it will inform any changes to the rules . "
Spending rules are included in a handbook given to all ministers .
A spokeswoman for the auditor - general 's office said the review was " several months away " from completion and refused to say what it had so far revealed .
The review 's terms of reference include looking at how appropriate and effective the system is .
The spotlight on ministerial spending has come through information obtained under the Official Information Act .
Despite this , Mr Walley believes there is transparency in the existing system .
" Do n't forget that for quite a long time those [ kinds ] of Official Information
Act requests were turned down on the basis they were too intrusive to do . "
Collating the more than 7000 pages of credit card transactions and receipts was likely to cost more than $ 50,000 , Mr Walley said .
While Mr Jones was the worst offender , repaying more than $ 6000 on personal items , the receipts also showed Labour MP Chris Carter repeatedly using his card for personal expenses that were later reimbursed – including massages for himself and partner Peter Kaiser .
Mr Carter has previously been in the gun over more than $ 100,000 in travel racked up while he was a minister , usually taking Mr Kaiser with him .
It appears all the money Labour ministers charged was repaid well before the party lost office .
The credit card receipts arrived at newspaper offices in boxes yesterday morning and by late afternoon Dominion Post journalists had still managed to read through only a fraction of them .
There are still boxes of receipts for credit cards used by other Labour ministers and most National ministers to go through .
But among the National ministers whose receipts have so far been checked , spending by Trade Minister Tim Groser has already raised eyebrows – including a $ 460 minibar bill run up in a week in Copenhagen .
He also bought a $ 958 jacket and $ 439 walking boots when his luggage was lost – something that appeared to happen regularly to ministers , with several of them clocking up bills for new suits and other clothes while overseas .
Mr Key insisted there was nothing out of the ordinary about Mr Groser 's spending and it added up to only about one drink a day because alcohol in Denmark was expensive .
Former prime minister Helen Clark was responsible for Ministerial Services during the period covered by the released papers .
Her former deputy , Michael Cullen , said she could not be blamed for inappropriate spending .
" The last thing you want is the prime minister going through every receipt coming into the ministerial office .
The prime minister has more important things to do and it is the Ministerial Services ' job . "
But taxpayers should be concerned with some of the spending , Dr Cullen said .
" I do n't want to get into individual cases but clearly people were using the card for things that it was not meant to be used for .
In those cases it is appropriate that money is paid back and people who did it express their regrets . "
Former Labour MP John
Tamihere also believes some ministers are misusing the system .
" You have to make an assertive mental effort to use the ministerial card as opposed to your own .
Even if a minister lost their luggage while travelling it would be a long stretch to believe they did n't have their personal credit card in their wallet . "
MPs can lose their jobs if convicted of a criminal offence that attracts a prison sentence of three months or more .
" The question is has any of these [ credit card spending ] acts come within the purview of the Crimes Act ? "
Mr Tamihere said .
Former prime minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer said it would not be appropriate to comment .
" In my day ministers did n't have credit cards . "

Hopes that foreign - born partners of gay and lesbian Americans could follow the same path to citizenship as heterosexual spouses got a boost Thursday when U.S. Rep.
Luis Gutierrez of Chicago said he would fight to include such a proposal in the campaign for comprehensive immigration reform .
Six months ago , when Gutierrez first laid out plans to introduce an immigration reform bill in the U.S.
House , the inclusion of same - sex partner rights seemed too politically risky .
But the Democrat now says he believes the coalition in favor of immigration reform is strong enough to make the bill " truly inclusive . "
" The underlying part of any comprehensive immigration bill is family unity , " Gutierrez said in an interview with the Tribune .
" We need to speak more clearly and more articulately and more frequently that the ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community , and same - sex couples and their binational relationships , are part of families . "
The 2000 U.S. census estimated that there were more than 35,000 binational same - sex couples in the country .
At this point , same - sex binational couples who want to remain together in the United States have to rely on work or student visas , or seek other legal loopholes .
" This has a terrible impact on couples , " said Eric Berndt , supervising attorney for the National Asylum Partnership on Sexual Minorities at the National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago .
" It can tear apart their lives , it can tear apart their relationships and it can force them to choose between their countries and the person they love . "
Kevin Goodman and Anton Pulung met more than a decade ago in a coffee shop in Orlando , Fla .
They hit it off and have been together ever since .
Without the immigration benefit of marriage , Goodman and Pulung have relied on student visas and now a petition for asylum to stay together .
" You ca n't imagine the stress we live under daily , " said Goodman , an Episcopal priest and associate dean of St. James Cathedral in Chicago .
" To wake up every morning and think this could be the day that we no longer have the resources or support to be together . "
Advocates have sought immigration rights for same - sex partners through legislation separate from Gutierrez 's — the Uniting American Families Act , which has more than 100 sponsors in the U.S. House and more than 20 in the U.S. Senate .
The congressman is now proposing that the language of that act be woven into the comprehensive immigration reform bill he and other lawmakers introduced in December .
" We need to build bridges between the LGBT community and the larger immigrant community , " Gutierrez said .
" In the end , the bigger the tent we build , the more successful we 'll be . "
The prospects for immigration reform passing Congress this year are uncertain .
The Obama administration has expressed support , but many believe that Congress lacks the appetite to tackle such a controversial issue in an election year .
The Gutierrez bill , which has 97 co-sponsors , is the only comprehensive reform legislation currently on the table in Congress .
The congressman has planned a meeting with immigrant and LGBT community leaders at noon Monday at the Center on Halsted in Chicago .
He will be joined by U.S. Reps .
Mike Quigley of Chicago and Jared Polis of Colorado , both Democrats .
Invariably the addition of language to benefit same - sex couples will rile some who oppose extending marriage rights to gays and lesbians .
But advocates say the immigration rights in question have nothing to do with marriage .
" It is n't predicated on recognition of a marriage and it does n't give any benefits besides allowing couples to stay together , " said Berndt , of the National Immigrant Justice Center .
For Josh Lampinen , a 30 - year - old Chicago Web designer , a change in the law could n't come soon enough .
His fiance , Jerome Lienard , lives in France , and the couple are struggling to find a way to be together .
Lampinen and Lienard are weighing a variety of options : Lampinen could move to France with a visa that might last up to three years ; they could both move to Canada or Belgium , countries same - sex couples can immigrate to ; Lienard could receive a U.S. green card through the federal government 's yearly " diversity lottery , " an unlikely possibility .
Lampinen said the distance between them is always a strain , particularly in times of crisis .
A year and a half ago , Lampinen 's grandmother died , and Lienard could n't be by his side .
" That 's when you want your partner there , " Lampinen said .
" And he was n't .
It just was n't possible .
It 's instances like that that just make it evident how unfair this situation is . "

A Toronto woman says the billing practices of Rogers Wireless Inc. led to her husband discovering her extramarital affair .
Now the woman , whose husband walked out , is suing the communications giant for $ 600,000 for alleged invasion of privacy and breach of contract , the results of which she says have ruined her life .
In 2007 , Gabriella Nagy had a cellphone account with Rogers which sent the monthly bill to her home address in her maiden name .
Her husband was the account holder for the family 's cable TV service at the same address .
Around June 4 , 2007 , he called Rogers to add internet and home phone .
The following month , Rogers mailed a “ global ” invoice for all of its services to the matrimonial home that included an itemized bill for Nagy 's cellular service , according to the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court of Justice .
When Nagy ’s husband opened the Rogers invoice , he saw several hour - long phone calls to a single phone number .
“ Nobody does business this way and he's not stupid , ” says Nagy , who is in her 30s .
He called the number , spoke to the “ third party ” who confirmed the affair , which had lasted only a few weeks , Nagy told the Star .
“ My husband did n't tell me that 's how he found out , he just left . ”
“ The husband used the previously private and confidential information that the defendant unilaterally disclosed to the husband to inquire about the people that the plaintiff was telephoning and the nature of such calls , ” the statement of claim says .
The statement alleges Rogers “ unilaterally terminated its cellular contract with the plaintiff that had been in her maiden name and included it in the husband ’s account that was under his surname .
“ The plaintiff ’s maiden name and the husband 's surname were different .
Such unilateral action by the defendant was done without the knowledge , information , belief , acquiescence or approval of the plaintiff . ”
In a statement of defence , Rogers denies it terminated the contract and says the company " cannot be held responsible for the condition of the marriage , for the plaintiff 's affair and consequential marriage break - up , nor the effects the break - up has had on her .
“ Rogers is not the cause of these .
The marriage break - up and its effects happened , or alternatively would in any event have happened , regardless of the form in which the plaintiff and her husband received their invoices for Rogers services in July 2007 . ”
Rogers acknowledges it “ consolidated the invoicing of the various services being provided to the plaintiff and her husband ” so that one monthly invoice would be sent to their home .
“ Apart from administrative efficiency , doing so would result in savings to the plaintiff and her husband for the services . ”
Nagy is deeply embarrassed and ashamed about what happened .
“ It was a mistake , ” she said of the affair .
“ But I did n’t deserve to lose my life over it . ”
After her husband left her and their two children , ages 6 and 7 , she was so distraught her work performance suffered and she lost her job as an apartment rental agent that had paid her almost $ 100,000 until she was let go in Oct. 10 , 2007 .
“ The plaintiff wept uncontrollably at her workplace . . . and became incapable of performing her employment duties , ” reads the statement of claim .
Nagy says the employer was aware of the situation and that she was receiving medical attention .
Nagy ’s lawyer , Edward Tonello , says this case is unprecedented in Canada .
“ In Ontario , we do n’t have a privacy act , unlike British Columbia and other provinces . ”
Nagy discovered how her husband found out after Rogers left her a voicemail , in late August 2007 , advising that it was about to terminate her cellular services because of unpaid invoices .
That ’s when she learned Rogers had terminated her account in her maiden name and included it in the global account .
Rogers says the invoice was sent to “ Ms. ” and her husband ’s surname .
When she confronted her husband , he said , “ Thank god for the Rogers bill .
Had it not come bundled in my cable service I would never known .
That ’s the only way , ” Nagy says .
She asked that his name not be included in the story to spare him further embarrassment .
His name does not appear in the court filing .
“ I lost everything , ” she says .
“ I want others to know what a big corporation has done .
I trusted Rogers with my personal information .
We had a contract — and agreement that put my life right in their hands . ”

After she terminated her relationship with the “ third party ” in August 2007 , the jilted lover , himself a married father of three , called Rogers and obtained her secret password to her voicemail and used it to access it to harass her and taunt the husband , the statement of claim alleges .
As well , she alleges Rogers disconnected her cellular service in January 2009 and said her cellular phone was being invoiced to her husband 's account .
The wrongdoing that occurred in 2007 reoccurred , the statement says noting she subsequently switched to another cellular service provider .
Rogers denies those claims .
This week , the annual Bilderberg conference in kicking off in Spain and it's bringing together some of the world 's most noteworthy individuals for a little strategy session .
Some prefer to see it as the grand center of a global conspiracy theory ready to remake the world in their design .
We prefer to think of it as the coolest party we were n't invited to this year .
The Bilderberg Group has a single annual meeting , of which few records are kept of what is discussed .
Its attendees represent different interests from around the world , but are all top influencers in global policy .
We 've got 20 of the best participants , according to a leaked document which reads a lot like last year 's list .
You can be certain that when this year 's list goes public we 'll have it here .
John Cornyn believes the killed pro-Palestinian activists that were killed in a clash with Israeli defense forces were asking for it .
ABC 's Jake Tapper asked Cornyn how the U.S. should react after Israeli commandos killed , Furkan Dogan , a U.S. citizen in the process of raiding an aid flotilla bound for Gaza .
" We do n't know all the circumstances yet .
But
It appears to be a premeditated provocation of Israel and an attempt to run the blockade that 's existed since Hamas took over Gaza , " Cornyn said Sunday .
" They are entitled , as matter of their self - defense to look to see if weapons or other items are being smuggled in , " Cornyn continued .
" This was pretty clearly a premeditated provocation and it's unfortunate that lives were lost .
I think it should have been a situation like it had been before if the people organizing this flotilla had been committed to peaceful activity , as opposed to provocation , this would not have occurred and Israel would have been able to examine the contents of the flotilla and they would have been delivered to the people of Gaza who needed help , " said Cornyn .
The scene is a sheriff ’s office near a mountain lake , where a hunter and his dog have been found dead .
The sheriff sets a bright orange hunting vest on his desk in front of an anxious woman .
She nods , identifying it as her husband’s .
“ He loved that dog , ” she says , crying .
“ Listen , Norma , ” the sheriff says .
“ If there ’s anything at all that I can do , you tell me . ”
“ You can find the animal that did this and send it straight to hell .
You can do that . ”
The culprit in the Sci Fi Channel ’s made - for - TV movie Snakehead Terror turns out to be a lakeful of monster fish .
This star turn is fitting for the toothy “ Frankenfish ” that has generated many hair - raising newspaper and television news stories — the northern snakehead .
In addition to inspiring filmmakers , the snakehead ’s appearance in North American waters in the past few years has worried wildlife biologists and commercial and sport fishermen .
They fear that it will invade new rivers , multiply rampantly and edge out other species .
The northern snakehead is native to Asia and is one of 29 snakehead species .
It made its national news debut in 2002 , after an angler at a pond behind a strip mall in Crofton , Maryland , caught a long , skinny fish , about 18 inches from end to end , that neither he nor his fishing buddy recognized .
They photographed the fish before throwing it back ; a month later , one of them took the picture to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) .
An agency biologist e-mailed the picture to fish experts , who told Maryland it had a snakehead on its hands .
It was after another angler caught a snakehead in the same pond and netted some babies that all hell broke loose .
National newspaper and TV news reports described snakeheads as vicious predators that would eat every fish in a pond , then waddle across land to another body of water and clean it out .
A reporter from the Baltimore Sun called it “ a companion for the Creature from the Black Lagoon . ”
The scariest reports , fortunately , turned out to be mistaken .
While some species of snakeheads can indeed wriggle long distances across the ground , the northern snakehead — the only species found in the Crofton pond — appears not to be one of them .
But northern snakeheads do like to eat other fish , and a heavy rain could conceivably wash one or more from the pond into a nearby river that runs through a National Wildlife Refuge and into the Chesapeake Bay , the largest estuary in North America .
To eliminate the snakehead menace , Maryland wildlife officials dumped the pesticide rotenone into the Crofton pond , killing all of its fish .
Six adult snakeheads went belly up — as did more than 1,000 juveniles .
Problem solved .
Or so it appeared .
Two years later , northern snakeheads fulfilled biologists ’ worst fear and showed up in the Potomac River .
Experts worried that snakeheads in the Potomac , by eating other fish or out - competing them for food , could drive down numbers of more desirable species , such as shad or largemouth bass .
You can dump poison in a little , enclosed pond , but you ca n’t poison the Potomac .
It ’s a wide , shallow river that originates in West Virginia and runs 380 miles before emptying into the Chesapeake .
The bay fuels the region ’s economy through recreation and fishing .
Snakeheads could n’t survive in the mildly salty water of the bay , but they could scarf down shad , fish that spawn in the Potomac and other freshwater tributaries .
Millions of dollars have already been spent on fish stocking , dam modifications and other projects to help the shad , which used to be plentiful enough to support a commercial fishery in the bay .
Besides Crofton and the Potomac , the fish have popped up in several other places in the United States .
In 1997 , one was caught in a Southern California lake .
A couple more appeared in Florida waters in 2000 .
In Massachusetts , one was caught in 2001 and a second in 2004 .
And in July 2004 , an angler caught two in a lake in a Philadelphia park .
Like the Crofton fish , the Philadelphia ones had settled in and started reproducing .
But unlike the Crofton fish , they had access to a river — the Schuylkill , which feeds into the Delaware .
Moreover , tidal gates that normally keep fish in the park had been stuck open for two years .
Philadelphia fisheries managers decided that poisoning or draining the park ’s interconnected ponds would cause more harm to resident fish than the snakeheads would , and have resigned themselves to snakeheads becoming a new member of the park ’s ecosystem .
The most recent surprise appearance was this past October when a northern snakehead was pulled out of Lake Michigan .
The catch has raised fears that the voracious predator might take over the Great Lakes .
The northern snakehead , which is native to parts of China , far eastern Russia and the Korean peninsula , may seem plug - ugly to the undiscerning eye — it has big , pointy teeth and , given its particularly heavy mucus covering , a slime problem .
It can grow up to five feet long .
Like its reptilian namesake , it ’s long and slender and can sport blotchy snakelike patterns on its skin .
Unlike most fish , the northern snakehead has little sacs above its gills that function almost like lungs ; the fish can surface and suck air into the sacs , then draw oxygen from the stored air as it swims .
The air sacs are handy for surviving in waters that are low in oxygen , and even allow the fish to survive out of water for a couple of days , as long as it does n’t dry out .
A female lays thousands of eggs at a time , and both parents guard their offspring in a large nest they make in a clearing of aquatic plants .
Northern snakeheads are a popular food in their native range ; they ’re said to be good eating , particularly in watercress soup , if a bit bony .
They ’re fished commercially and raised in fish farms in Asia .
They ’ve also been sold live in markets in the United States .
The Crofton snakeheads were eventually traced to a Maryland man who ’d bought two of the fish in New York City for his sister to eat .
When she demurred , he kept them in his aquarium and later released them .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service soon banned the importation and interstate transport of snakeheads , a plan that had already been in the works precisely because of fears that some snakehead species could thrive in parks , rivers and lakes if they got loose .
The ban made it illegal to import all live snakehead species , including the colorful tropical species that populate the odd aquarium .
Virginia has outlawed the possession of all snakeheads .
But the bans have n’t stopped everyone .
A Los Angeles grocer was arrested this past May for allegedly smuggling live northern snakeheads into the country from Korea and selling them in his store ; he pleaded guilty to importing an injurious species .
U.S. fans of snakehead soup and other delicacies , however , may still legally obtain killed , frozen snakeheads , which are available in many of the Asian markets that once sold them live .
One day this past April , an angler caught a feisty northern snakehead in Pine Lake , in Wheaton , Maryland , outside Washington , D.C. Local officials drained the lake but found no more snakeheads .
Then , like an ecological game of Whac - a - Mole , another northern snakehead reared its toothy head the very next week when a professional bass fisherman pulled a 12 1/2 - incher from Little Hunting Creek , a Potomac tributary in Virginia about 15 miles south of the nation ’s capital .
Biologists tried using nets to capture snakeheads in the river , but eventually decided that a better way would be to let anglers go at the fish with plain old hooks and lines — which led to one of the odder fishing tournaments in recent memory .
On an overcast Friday morning in July , I joined a few dozen anglers at Columbia Island Marina in Arlington , Virginia , across a narrow channel from the Pentagon .
The 2004 Snakehead Roundup was about to get under way .
The roundup was sponsored by the Marina Operators Association of America to remind boat owners to take care not to transport unwanted species from one place to another — as hitchhikers on their boats or trailers , for example — and to let them know what northern snakeheads look like .
Although 16 adult snakeheads had been caught in the Potomac by that time , no one knew whether they ’d been born there or whether someone had just tossed them in — or even how common they were .
I tagged along in a 19 - foot white - and - blue ski boat with three managers from a family - owned company whose boss did n’t seem to mind that the information technology division was running itself that day .
“ We ’re conducting an offsite meeting , ” software designer Brian Turnbull explained .
Turnbull ’s father - in - law , who is Vietnamese , asked him to bring a snakehead home .
“ He says if you catch one , you do n’t have to hand it over to the state .
It ’s a delicacy . ”
Fortunately , Turnbull was n’t required to choose between duty to family or to society because he did n’t catch a snakehead .
Neither did anyone else on the boat , and neither , we found out when we later pulled up at the marina , did anyone else in the roundup .
A few weeks later , John Odenkirk , a biologist from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries , seemed to be imitating the sheriff in Snakehead Terror , who kills his murderous lakeful of snakeheads by electrocuting them with a downed power line .
Odenkirk , driving an aluminum boat through Dogue Creek , a Potomac tributary , was “ electrofishing , ” which involved running about 1,000 volts through a boom that protruded from the bow and trailed wires in the water like tentacles .
“ High voltage . . .
The next best thing to explosives , ” read the small print on the back of Odenkirk ’s green “ Snakehead Task Force ” T - shirt , which he designed to sell to colleagues for $ 12 apiece .
Electrofishing , a common sampling method in fisheries research , is n’t meant to kill fish .
But it may knock them out for a while .
( It ’s not considered sporting and requires a special permit . )
Odenkirk nosed the boat in and out of the empty slips at the Mount Vernon Yacht Club a couple of miles downriver from Little Hunting Creek .
Tiny fish leapt out of the water as others lolled gracelessly on their backs , stunned , just below the surface .
Biologist Steve Owens and technician Scott Herrmann leaned over the bow clutching long - handled nets .
Afish ’s response to the electrical current depends on its skeletal structure , scales , size and how close it is to the wires .
“ Snakeheads are — they ’re kind of bad - asses , ” Odenkirk said .
“ They do n’t like the juice and they try to avoid it . ”
Still , a snakehead that got close to the trailing wires would be stunned and surface , for Herrmann or Owens to snag .
At least , that was the theory .
We sped back up the Potomac past Mount Vernon to Little Hunting Creek , where the first Potomac snakehead was caught by a fisherman back in May .
At the end of an hour and a half of electrofishing , the catch included many carp , several species of catfish , a bunch of goldfish , a long - nosed gar , a turtle — and zero snakeheads .
Odenkirk said he ’s always conflicted after an unsuccessful day of snakehead fishing .
On the one hand , he said , he was disappointed he ’d failed to catch one .
On the other , “ you ’d be happy if you never saw one again . ”
Though we did n’t see any snakeheads that day , Odenkirk says he ’s sure the fish is established in the Potomac or soon will be .
“ It ’s just not even an option that we ’ve caught them all . ”
He says the fish probably nest in wide , shallow expanses of lily pads and wetlands .
“ We just ca n’t get back in those areas . ”
But other officials say they ’re not convinced the fish are here to stay .
Steve Early , assistant director in the fisheries service at the DNR , worked on the Crofton pond in 2002 and has handled some of the Potomac snakeheads .
He thinks the fish were only very recently dumped in the river , perhaps after Virginia ’s 2002 ban on snakehead ownership .
He points out that most of the snakeheads caught this year have been 2 to 6 years old , and that if they ’d been living in the Potomac for years , surely someone would have caught one before .
Early remained unpersuaded even after a baby snakehead was found in a Potomac tributary this past September .
It was the 20th northern snakehead caught in the Potomac watershed , and the first juvenile .
“ Well , it ’s not good news , ” he says of the discovery , but points out that if some snakeheads do manage to reproduce , they may never thrive in the big river .
Their future also depends on whether other fish in the Potomac develop a taste for snakehead fry .
For now , scientists are working on figuring out how the adults got there .
It ’s a critical question — if the fish were just recently dumped in the river , there ’s a chance they ’ll die without having generated a self - sustaining population — but it will require more than a rod and reel or a stun gun to answer .
Behind a door at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. rest specimens from the world ’s largest fish collection .
Smithsonian ichthyologist Thomas Orrell walked down an aisle between rows of gray metal shelves containing jars with labels such as “ China 1924 . ”
Orrell held up a jar marked Channa argus , the northern snakehead .
“ They ’re really beautiful fish , ” he said .
Orrell is trying to learn if the northern snakeheads caught this past summer in the Potomac were born there .
He ’s analyzing DNA from 16 fish ; if some of the Potomac specimens are closely related , it ’s likely that the fish bred in the river .
If they ’re not kin , they were likely dumped in the river .
Orrell is also comparing the DNA of Potomac fish with that of those caught in the Crofton pond , testing the idea that someone might have captured juveniles before the pond was poisoned and released them in the Potomac .
Orrell led me down a bare stairwell into the museum ’s basement , past sandbags piled near an entrance in case of heavy rain and a walk - in freezer that smelled of long - dead fish , containing , among other things , an enormous tuna frozen since the 1960s .
He lifted the top of a nearby freezer chest , rooted around and pulled out a long , black lump .
“ Watch out for flying debris , ” he said , unwrapping a black garbage bag and scattering pieces of frozen blood .
Inside was one of the most recent Potomac catches : a dark , diamond - patterned snakehead more than a foot long , now solid as a rock .
After showing it off , Orrell shrugged , wrapped it up , laid it back in the freezer and washed his hands .
He already knows whether the snakeheads are reproducing in the Potomac , but he is n’t telling ; adhering to scientific protocol , Orrell declines to share his data until they ’ve been reviewed by other experts and published in a scientific journal .
If northern snakeheads do have some ecological impact in the Potomac , largemouth bass are likely to suffer , says U.S. Geological Survey fishery biologist Walter Courtenay , who in 2002 wrote a snakehead risk assessment for the agency .
The two species have similar habitats and would probably eat each other ’s young .
Capt .
Steve Chaconas , one of only a few full - time fishing guides on the Potomac , does not like snakeheads one bit .
“ Of course , I ’m worried about what potential it could have to impact the fishery , ” he says .
“ Also because I ’m a businessperson and my business relies entirely on people coming here to fish . ”
Even now , he says , customers ask how much the snakeheads have hurt fishing .
It ’s hard to estimate the extent of the snakehead ’s impact on largemouth bass and other Potomac species .
The northern snakehead was introduced to rivers in Japan in the early 20th century , but there has been little study of its ecological effects there .
( The largemouth bass , native to North America , was introduced to Japanese waters in 1925 and is reportedly terrorizing native fish and snakeheads alike . )
In southern Florida , a close relative of the northern snakehead , the bullseye or cobra snakehead , has been living for a few years in the canals of BrowardCounty .
The fish , which is native to rivers in South Asia and Southeast Asia , can grow to four feet or longer , but there are not yet enough data to know what effect the bullseye snakehead has had or will have on Florida ecology .
Courtenay says the fish probably first got into Florida waters through ritual animal release , a common practice in East Asia that some immigrants have continued in their new land .
( A study conducted in Taiwan in the 1990s , for instance , found that 30 percent of Taipei citizens — most of them Buddhists — had released animals as part of a prayer . )
Florida is home to dozens of introduced fish .
Paul Shafland , a fisheries scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission , has worked with invasive fish for 30 years , but he is n’t as troubled by them as most biologists .
“ We have philosophically , largely determined that exotics are inherently bad , and that ’s fine , ” he says .
But , he adds , some introduced fish might fill up some part of the food web that was previously unoccupied .
In fact , introduced fish are just about everywhere .
Rainbow trout , native to the western United States , have been transplanted into cold waters all over the Midwest and East .
In the Great Smoky MountainsNational Park , on the border between Tennessee and North Carolina , rainbows have taken over at least 70 percent of the native brook trout ’s territory since the 1930s .
In the late 1960s , the walking catfish , an Asian species that really can move over land , escaped into the Florida wild .
They ’ve walked their way into warm waters throughout the southern half of the state , without causing major damage so far , Shafland says .
Lake Michigan , says Philip Willink , an ichthyologist at Chicago ’s FieldMuseum , is also infested with nonnative fish .
“ Out of eight species of salmon here , six are introduced , ” Willink says .
But , as in the Potomac , some native fish still hang on in the lake , and he says it ’s worth fighting new invasions .
“ We ’re just trying to preserve what is left , because once it ’s gone , it ’s gone . ”
Since the Lake Michigan snakehead was found in a fairly deep harbor with little vegetation — an unlikely snakehead habitat — Willink surmises that the fish was probably just tossed into the water .
Scientists did some electrofishing in the harbor to look for more snakeheads but did n’t turn up any .
The Potomac is not the river it was when George Washington looked upon it from Mount Vernon and made good money selling native shad .
Goldfish , carp , channel catfish — none is native to the river .
The now - widespread common carp , brought over from Europe , was put in the river in the late 1800s .
Carp stir up a riverbed and make the water too cloudy for some other fish .
The largemouth bass , native to other U.S. rivers , was introduced into the Potomac in the 1800s .
And the blue catfish , a sharp - spined transplant from the Mississippi River basin that arrived in the Potomac late in the 20th century , is a headache for fishery managers now , who fear it could interfere with the commercial fishing of channel catfish — which were introduced from the Mississippi basin decades earlier .
Descendants of released pet goldfish flourish in the Potomac , as they do virtually all over the world .
But the other introduced species are n’t the point ; the native fish are , says Dan Simberloff , an ecologist at the University of Tennessee , Knoxville .
If the snakehead is different enough from the predators that natives have evolved with , it might drive some natives to extinction .
It ’s hard to predict what will happen , though .
“ Most invasive species do n’t cause a huge amount of trouble , but some fraction of them do , and we have n’t been too good at predicting that , ” he says .
About the snakehead , he says , “ I ’m not optimistic . ”
Cliff Magnus is a semiprofessional fisherman ( he says he ’s been sponsored for the past ten years by “ Team Spouse , ” a.k.a. his wife , a lawyer ) , but the attention he got from catching a snakehead last June in a Potomac tributary has brought him sponsors willing to pay his entry fees for bass tournaments .
Magnus may have witnessed a seminal moment .
He says he saw two northern snakeheads swimming around each other in Little Hunting Creek in late July .
The fish were chasing and nipping at each other .
The scene , which he described to some fisheries biologists , was n’t exactly the makings of a Snakehead Terror sequel , but it was definitely ominous .
The way the biologists see it , the fish were getting ready to spawn .
There Goes the Neighborhood
If the northern snakehead does establish itself in the United States , it ’ll join a rogue ’s gallery of introduced species that threaten native plants and animals in and around water .
Clockwise from top : A denizen of the East , the bullfrog now inhabits the West , where it eats more delicate local frogs .
Nutria , imported from South America as a source of fur , devour plant roots in marshes along the Gulf of Mexico and the Chesapeake .
Asian zebra mussels , accidentally carried into U.S. waters aboard ships , have caused more than $ 1 billion in damage to pipes in the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basin since 1988 .
Amazonian water hyacinths clog Southern waterways .
Aggressive mute swans from Eurasia take over native waterfowl ’s feeding and nesting territories on the East Coast and Great Lakes .
This tickles my design sensibilities : Fort Collins hometown hero New Belgium Brewing rolled out a new set of labels for their product line .
I ’m torn on the redesign overall , mainly because I ’m sentimental about the old artwork .
( Though I appreciate how the new ones verge on Dharma Project packaging ! )
But it took me longer to notice something more subtle about the redesign : at least with their Mothership
Wit organic wheat beer , the label color pretty much exactly matches the color of the brew itself !
( It probably took me so long to realize this because it took 90 degree heat to get me to buy yellow beer . )
A Father ’s Day Miracle : Family Speaks About 3 - Year Old ’s Near Drowning
In the heart of every little girl , her daddy is her hero .
For a 3 - year old Walnut Hill girl found floating lifeless face down in a pool , her daddy truly is her hero .
“ I can swim , ” Maggie Scott , 3 , proclaimed Saturday morning , as she showed off her new kittens Max and Ruby .
Like most adventurous children , Maggie thought she could swim , and she decided , when no one was looking , to try .
It was a mistake that would alter the lives of her family in a major way .
The afternoon of May 27 was to be a family time .
They were headed to a local creek to enjoy the water , but decided to stop at a someone ’s home in the Bay Springs community to use the pool instead .
Maggie had played in the pool with the rest of her family , wearing arm - floats .
When Maggie and her sisters — McKenzie , 13 ; Madison , 9 ; and Mary Paige , 7 ; were done in the pool , it was time for skateboards and Ripstiks .
The girls hit the boards , while the adults sat around talking .
Life would change in the blink of an eye .
“ Maggie ’s dead ! ”
Those were the heart - stopping words that older sister McKenzie screamed when she saw Maggie , floating face down in the pool .
Mom and dad , Blair and Chad Scott , raced for the pool .
Blair dove in and pulled Maggie out .
No one knew how long the little girl had been in the pool .
Chad started CPR .
“ My mind went where it did n’t need to go while I watched him do CPR , ’ Blair said , “ knowing what could be happening . ”
With every thrust on his daughter ’s chest , Chad said he just prayed .
“ I keep telling her to come back to us ; I kept telling her she was fine , ” Blair said .
“ I wanted the nightmare to end ; I wanted God to bring my little girl back to me . ”
Chad continued CPR .
One .
Two .
Three ..
“ Then I realized I had three little girls standing there , not knowing what was going on .
Hit your knees .
And pray , ” she told them .
“ They cried , they screamed , they prayed . ”
Chad continued the CPR .
Breathe .
Chest compressions .
One .
Two .
Three …
Then , there was a cough .
Volunteers from the Walnut Hill Station of Escambia Fire Rescue arrived .
Atmore Ambulance sped down the long driveway .
LifeFlight landed .
Maggie was quickly scooped up by a LifeFlight nurse who ran to the helicopter .
Within minutes , she was at Sacred Heart .
Blair and Scott were left behind in Bay Springs , not knowing what was happening with their little girl .
A family friend drove them to the hospital , where Maggie was still in the emergency room .
She was transferred to an intensive care room .
It was a serious situation .
A ventilator breathed for Maggie for 28 hours , doctors and nurses standing nearby at the ready .
It was a lot for a mom and dad to deal with .
Blair and Chad both knew at the time that Maggie could have permanent disabilities caused by the lack of oxygen to her brain .
“ We just gave it to God , ” Blair said .
Their family , their church family … they all prayed .
They were joined by perhaps thousands of people they will never know that prayed after reading Maggie ’s story .
Miracles do n’t just happen , Chad said .
“ God works miracles . ”
There ’s no doubt in Blair and Chad ’s minds that there lives were changed in a big way by the whole ordeal .
For Chad , it meant being saved and accepting his Savior all over again .
“ I thought I got saved before , but I realized , ” he said , “ and I made a promise to do what He needs me to do . ”
A few weeks after the accident , Maggie is a vibrant little girl , with no obvious lasting impact from her ordeal .
“ We have blueberries , ” she said Saturday morning as she walked through the family ’s backyard in search of a cool , shady place for the photos on this page .
“ They are purple , ” she observed .
“ They are not blue . ”
She smiles and grabs a dandelion , blowing it into the wind toward Chad , very much to her delight .
It was a prelude to her big Father ’s Day plans .
“ Guess what I am going to do to you for Father ’s Day ? ” she asked Chad .
Her grin grew bigger as she put her hands behind her back and twirled around .
“ I ’m going to throw a flower at you ! ”

Dear Jack ,
I recently got into a debate with a friend who insisted that quinoa , hemp , amaranth , buckwheat , and spirulina are all complete proteins .
When I told him soy is the only complete vegetarian protein , he told me he avoids all soy due to its negative effect on men ’s health .
I wondered where this guy learned this and a quick google search on vegetarian complete proteins got me here .
I checked out your page on protein .
That chart listing the essential amino acids in so many plant foods made me realize that in fact many plant foods do contain all the essential amino acids but at such low levels it ’s hard to list them as ‘ complete proteins ’ in the true meaning intended .
So my take is that the only vegetarian protein that comes close to really being a complete protein ( meaning it has essential amino acid levels similar to those of animal proteins ) is soy .
Would you agree ?
Answer :
[ As an aside , the research to date indicates that moderate amounts of soy do not harm men ’s health . ]
Because this question about complete proteins comes up on a regular basis , I decided to do some number crunching to get to the bottom of it .
Mind you , there are many more numbers to crunch if someone wanted to take the time , but I think I ’ve covered enough to draw some conclusions .
I see two ways of looking at the question of whether a food has complete protein :
– How much of the food is needed to meet the RDA for all the essential amino acids ( EAA ) ?
– How much variation is there in a food ’s ability to meet the RDA for each individual EAA ?
If you look at Table 3 of Where Do You Get Your Protein ? , you will see what it takes to meet the RDA for each EAA for a variety of foods .
I have taken some of the data from Table 3 and constructed the table below to look more closely at what foods might contain a “ complete protein ” .
In the table below , the numbers in the right - hand column represent the following equation :
A – B = R
Where :
A = servings required to meet the RDA for least plentiful EAA
B = servings required to meet the RDA for the most plentiful EAA
R = range
Food Range of Servings to
meet RDA for all EAA Tuna 1.7 – 1.3 = .4 Chicken leg 2.9 – 1.9 = 1.0 Ground beef 3.2 – 1.4 = 1.8 Edamame 3.3 – 1.8 = 1.5 Lentils 3.4 – 1.7 = 1.7 Pinto beans – refried 3.7 – 2.0 = 1.7 Tofu 3.8 – 1.1 = 2.7 Milk 5.6 – 2.9 = 2.7 Quinoa 6.1 – 3.6 = 2.5 Soy milk 6.2 – 3.3 = 2.9 Egg 6.6 – 3.9 = 2.7 Almonds 9.6 – 4.7 = 5.2 Corn 11.5 – 5.0 = 6.5 Spirulina 12.9 – 5.4 = 7.5
From the chart above , it appears that tuna is the most complete protein with a range of only .4 servings and only 1.7 servings required to meet the RDA for all the EAA .
Chicken , beef , edamame ( whole , cooked soybeans ) , lentils , and pinto beans all do quite well .
I think it ’s fair to consider all of them a “ complete protein ” .
Tofu , milk , quinoa , soy milk , and eggs do significantly better than most grains and nuts which have a much wider range .
As for spirulina … not so much .
One thing to note about this is that all the numbers depend on the serving size .
I tried to pick what I thought were reasonable ( or common ) serving sizes for each food ( you can see what they are in Table 3 ) .
The USDA database has a lot of specific entries for some of the food categories above ( like ground beef ) .
I chose what looked like a common version of the food , but I did not average the data across more than one version .
As for the remaining , supposed complete proteins mentioned in the original question above , here is what I found :
Amaranth
The USDA lists 9 g of protein per cup of cooked amaranth .
That ’s a good amount when compared to other grains , but I ’m not sure if it ’s as easy to eat a cup of amaranth as a cup of , say , rice or corn .
The USDA had no amino acid info .
Hemp
There was no info in the USDA database .
I found many sources saying that it is a complete protein but none that I know to be reliable .
Nutritional yeast
No info in the USDA database .
According to this site , it has 9 g of protein per 3 tbsp serving .
That ’s a decent amount , but I ’m not sure if we can trust that info .
In conclusion , edamame , lentils , and pinto beans fared pretty well with chicken and beef for being a complete protein .
Tofu , soymilk , and quinoa were on par with eggs and milk .
Image caption Pakistan says the main website will be unaffected
Pakistan will start monitoring seven major websites , including Google and Yahoo , for content it deems offensive to Muslims .
YouTube , Amazon , MSN , Hotmail and Bing will also come under scrutiny , while 17 less well - known sites will be blocked .
Officials will monitor the sites and block links deemed inappropriate .
In May , Pakistan banned access to Facebook after the social network hosted a " blasphemous " competition to draw the prophet Muhammad .
The new action will see Pakistani authorities monitor content published on the seven sites , blocking individual pages if content is judged to be offensive .
Telecoms official Khurram Mehran said links would be blocked without disturbing the main website .
Cartoon controversy
The ban on Facebook was lifted after about two weeks , when the site blocked access to the page , called Everybody Draw Muhammad .
Image caption The Draw Muhammad page on Facebook sparked protests in Pakistan
Facebook itself is not on the new list of websites to be monitored .
A number of links from YouTube will be blocked but not the main site itself .
Many Muslims regard depictions of Muhammad , even favourable ones , as blasphemous .
In 2007 , the government banned YouTube , allegedly to block material offensive to the government of Pervez Musharraf .
The action led to widespread disruption of access to the site for several hours .
The ban was later lifted .
The US Department of Justice has launched civil and criminal investigations into the events surrounding the BP oil spill .
Does that mean people who helped cause the spill will be going to jail ?
Yes , they might be .
Violations of some of the applicable environmental laws , such as the Clean Water Act , can result in severe repercussions .
“ Clearly , that ’s on the table , ” says William Snape , a professor at the American University school of law .
“ I ’d say the odds are greater than 50 - 50 that someone will get jail time or a probationary sentence . ”
In one sense , Tuesday ’s announcement of the Justice Department probe into the Deepwater Horizon disaster was a chronicle of a prosecution foretold .
Given that 11 people died in the explosion and fire that destroyed the Deepwater rig , and that the oil spill may be the worst environmental disaster in American history , federal law enforcement officials are virtually duty - bound to launch an investigation into what transpired in the Gulf of Mexico on that fateful April evening .
However , the manner in which the White House chose to make Tuesday ’s announcement – a televised public statement by Attorney General Eric Holder following a meeting with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors – was something of a surprise .
After all , it ’s BP that ’s in charge of stopping up the well that ’s currently pouring oil into the open ocean .
In that sense , the administration remains in a working relationship – albeit an uneasy one – with the very firm it ’s threatening to prosecute .
The laws at issue here include , among others , the Clean Water Act , which mandates both civil and criminal penalties for violations ; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ; and the Endangered Species Act , which penalizes those who injure or kill covered wildlife .
In terms of civil violations all these statutes have fairly strict liability standards .
For the Endangered Species Act , prosecutors must prove only that a particular action sickened or killed one endangered sea turtle , say .
Given that low bar , a successful civil prosecution in this case is almost inevitable .
“ It ’s almost certain that [ BP , Transocean , or other firms involved ] will be found guilty of something , ” says professor Snape , an expert in environmental law .
According to Snape , the more interesting question is whether Interior Department officials will also be prosecuted and found guilty of contributing to the BP disaster .
A number of internal reports have found egregious personal behavior and a too - cozy relationship with industry within the Interior Department ’s Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) .
If federal officials aided and abetted illegal acts on the part of BP , the Justice Department could pursue them , too .
“ There are definitely some government officials who are sweating a little bit right now , ” says Snape .
While prosecutors will be considering violations of a number of environmental statutes , the most important one in this case is the Clean Water Act , says James Tripp , a senior counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund .
It is a comprehensive law that sets both civil and criminal penalties for a wide range of acts resulting in water pollution .
To meet the standards of a civil prosecution , the government must show that a certain act occurred .
To meet the standards of a criminal prosecution , the government must show that someone knowingly and intentionally undertook an active malfeasance .
“ That ’s altogether different from a civil prosecution , and very serious , ” says Mr. Tripp .
But the consequences of the BP oil spill are themselves already serious , and getting worse .
“ This is a mind - blowing disaster of international magnitude , ” says Tripp .
“ Certainly the Department of Justice actions [ in beginning investigations ] are well - founded .

Should the travel ban to Cuba be lifted ?
This question is expected to come up for a vote in Congress early this month .
The legislation , HR 4645 , also promises to create an estimated 6,000 jobs in the U.S. by clearing away obstacles to making U.S. farm produce available to Cuban consumers .
Few governments impose such harsh travel restrictions on their citizens as the U.S.
For 50 years , travel by Americans to one of their closest neighboring nations , Cuba , has been prohibited .
This could be the first up - or - down vote in Congress to do away with the travel ban , according to Mavis Anderson of the Washington - based Latin American Working Group .
Free travel to Cuba is supported by a majority of Americans including 67 percent of Cuban - Americans , says the group .
Congress approved agricultural sales to Cuba 10 years ago , but that trade has been sabotaged by administrative restrictions imposed by the Bush administration and still in place .
For example , Cuban purchasers are required to make payments through a third country .
This adds not only extra time but also expense to the transaction .
HR 4645 would allow banks in Cuba to wire their payments for agricultural produce directly to the U.S. bank of the producer .
The law would also eliminate the current requirement that shipments be paid for while still in U.S. ports , making them vulnerable to expropriation .
The new legislation would allow the customary practice of payment upon arrival at their destination , Havana .
The bipartisan bill , the Travel Restriction Reform and Export Enhancement Act , is sponsored by Reps. Collin Peterson , D - Minn. , and Jerry Moran , R - Kan .
It is expected to be voted out of the House Agriculture Committee this week .
The sponsors say the bill will create jobs in the U.S. in agriculture , travel , hospitality and dairy industries , all hard hit by the recession .
The Witness for Peace website provides an easy way for the public to contact their members of Congress and urge support for the bill .

Today on Holla Back DC ! , a bystander witnessed a man harassing and stalking a woman on the street in Mount Pleasant , and decided to step in .
After a confrontation , the bystander walked away with bruises courtesy of the harasser ’s belt .
Here ’s the story :
I was walking off a late - night snack around 3:30 in the morning .
There was a woman walking with a man right behind her .
She kept turning around at him .
I could tell that she did n’t want his attention .
She was headed down Irving which is a very dimly lit street .
At one point the woman suddenly jumped back and began dialing on her cellphone .
I figured she was calling the police .
Being just across the street , I approached them and ask for the time .
The woman seemed startled .
The man just looked at me .
The woman then continued down Irving street .
The man began to follow her .
I yelled , ” You should n’t be doing that . ”
The guy stopped and turned around towards me .
I pulled out my pocket camera and took a quick picture .
That really got his attention .
The woman kept walking down Irving and the man ’s attention was now on me .
He mumbled something and then came towards me .
I crossed Mount Pleasant street and he followed me .
He began taking off his belt and then began swinging it at me in a zig - zag cross motion .
The belt buckle struck me several times .
I lifted my cane to stop the blows .
I began yelling .
There was a couple walking across the street and a guy yelled , “ We ’re calling the police . ”
I managed to strike the assailant with my cane on his head .
I had hit him so hard that my cane bent .
He ran across the street into an alley .
Another man was walking past me and I told him to watch out .
The assailant was now gathering beer bottles as the police approached .
He threw a bottle just as the first of 3 police cars stopped .
. . .
The assailant was arrested .
The woman was safe .
I am covered in bruises .
When the problems of street harassment and public sexual assault are raised on this blog , readers sometimes respond by placing the onus on ending harassment on the harassee .
This usually takes one of three forms :
( a) Do n’t overreact .
Just learn to take a compliment .
( b) Why did n’t you fight back ?
Kick him in the balls .
( c ) Street harassers are too dangerous for us to expect anyone else to intervene .
Of course , challenge ( c ) points out the problem with expecting victims of harassment to either ( a ) shake it off or ( b ) fight back .
It also shows how violent misogyny can transfer pretty easily from female targets to anyone who would defend them .
So — - beyond preventative measures — - how do we help minimize the risk of street harassment when we see it , while keeping ourselves safe ?
Last year , local self - defense expert Lauren Taylor gave Sexist readers some tips on being a pro-active bystander :
* Look out for number one .
“ Always think about your own safety first , ” Taylor says .
“ Look at who ’s around who could back you up if necessary .
If you ’re inside , say at a bar or social event , figure out where the doors are . ” * Speak to the victim .
“ When you ’re thinking about intervening , address the person you think is being targeted , ” Taylor says .
“ Say to her , ‘ Are you OK ? ’
Or , ‘ Can I do anything ? ’
Or , ‘ Do you want to come with me ? ’
This wo n’t necessarily solve the situation , but it will let her know that there are other options .
It will let her know that people are seeing what ’s happening , and it lets the harasser know the same thing .
There are witnesses , and it ’s not going to go unnoticed . ” * Make a scene .
“ For example , you could draw attention to it by saying something like , ‘ This guy is putting his hands all over her ! ’
Or , ‘ This guy is harassing her ! ’ and that could draw enough attention to the situation that the harasser would cut it out , ” Taylor says .
“ Airing any of these things , and making them more visible , will ultimately make them better . ”
“ Now , the harasser may respond by saying , ‘ Who are you ?
This has nothing to do with you !
She does n’t mind ! , ’ ” Taylor says .
“ But you still have transformed what ’s going on , and possibly made it safer .
The harasser talking back does n’t mean it did n’t work . ” *
Even if the victim does n’t ask for help , you can still do something .
“ Like with everything , it totally depends on the situation , ” Taylor says .
“ Especially if it ’s a partner thing , you may hear the victim respond , ‘ Oh , I ’m okay , go away . ’
But I still think it makes a difference that it was noticed and recognized . ”
The Holla Back DC !
witness looks to have followed Taylor ’s tips to a T .
Results were mixed :
While the initial harassee got away safely and an obviously dangerous person was arrested , the bystander paid the price with a painful and scary physical confrontation .

When reports first circulated on Twitter of a deadly attack by Israeli commandos on the Gaza flotilla , I did n't forward them because they seemed implausible .
I thought : " Israel would n't be so obtuse as to use lethal force on self - described peace activists in international waters with scores of reporters watching . "
Ah , but it turned out that Israel could be so obtuse after all .
It shot itself in the foot , blasting American toes as well , and undermined all of its longer - term strategic objectives .
Abba Eban , the former Israeli statesman , is famously reported to have said in 1973 : " The Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity . "
The quotation resonated because it was largely true .
Palestinians were locked for years into a self - defeating dynamic of violence and self - pity that led to terrorism and intransigence .
Feeling misunderstood , they shrugged at global opinion and lashed back wherever they could , undermining their own cause .
Yet now , as a rabbi noted on my Facebook page , it is Israel that never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity .
Israel under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems locked in a self - defeating dynamic in which it feels misunderstood and gives up on international opinion .
It lashes out with force in ways that undermine its own interests .
It is on a path that could eventually be catastrophic .
There 's no question that Israel faces existential threats .
That should make its leaders focused above all on two things : an Arab - Israeli treaty and pressure on Iran to drop its nuclear program .
These are n't easy , and a Palestinian - Israeli deal may be impossible for the time being .
But Israel could freeze all settlements and take other steps that would make a deal more likely .
We already know what the final deal would look like -- a two - state solution and terms resembling the " Clinton parameters " that Bill Clinton proposed in 2000 .
Israel could also cultivate Turkey , a central player in the effort to press Iran .
Instead , Israel 's storming of a Turkish - flagged vessel in international waters was a huge setback to efforts to win new sanctions on Iran .
One big winner in this week 's fiasco was the Iranian regime .
Israel is also antagonizing its support base in the United States , which is critical to protect it from those existential threats .
Peter Beinart wrote a powerful article in the most recent New York Review of Books exploring the way young Jews in the U.S. feel much less identification with Israel than their elders did .
Beinart noted that even the student senate at Brandeis University , which has strong Jewish ties , rejected a resolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of Israel .
One basic problem , Beinart said , is that the Zionist movement has become increasingly conservative politically .
" For several decades , " he writes , " the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism 's door , and now , to their horror , they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead . "
Israel 's hard - line policies are depleting America 's international political capital as well as its own .
Gen . David Petraeus noted two months ago that the perception that the United States favors Israel breeds anti-Americanism and bolsters al - Qaida .
The chief of Mossad , Meir Dagan , was quoted in the Israeli press as making the point more succinctly : " Israel is gradually turning from an asset to the United States to a burden . "
For many Israelis , all this seems profoundly unfair .
Israel is a thriving democracy that withdrew from Gaza but is still threatened by missiles from north and south alike .
So Israel and its hard - core supporters tend to dismiss outside criticism as inherently unfair and anti-Semitic , and embrace unilateral solutions based on force .
As the newspaper Haaretz suggested , Israel is now " lost at sea . "
How do we change this dynamic ?
One necessary step is a major investigation of what happened .
Another is a quick end to the blockade of Gaza , by Egypt as well as Israel .
The blockade has failed to topple Hamas , failed to recover the captured soldier Gilad Shalit , and failed to keep rockets out of Gaza .
When you visit Gaza , you see that the siege has accomplished nothing -- except to devastate the lives of 1.5 million ordinary Gazans .
Gisha , an Israeli human rights organization , has compiled a list of goods that Israel typically blocks from Gaza : notebooks , blank paper , writing utensils , coriander , chocolate , fishing rods and countless more .
That 's not security ; that 's a travesty .
President Barack Obama needs to find his voice and push hard for an end to the Gaza blockade .
He needs to talk sense to Israel and encourage it to back away from its plans to intercept other flotillas now headed for Gaza -- that would be a catastrophe for Israel and America alike .
Above all , he needs to nudge Israel away from its tendency to shoot itself in the foot , and us along with it .

Britain should keep asking how long it needs to remain in Afghanistan , Prime Minister David Cameron said today after the UK death toll hit 300 .
The sad landmark was reached when a Royal Marine from 40 Commando died from his wounds in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham yesterday morning .
He was injured in a blast in the Sangin district of Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan eight days earlier , the Ministry of Defence said .
Major Renny Bulmer , spokesman for 40 Commando , based in Taunton , Somerset , said : " Our thoughts are with his immediate family who were with him at the hospital .
" His courage and sacrifice will not be forgotten .
We will remember him . "
He was the 55th UK fatality this year and the seventh member of 40 Commando killed since the Royal Marines took command of the notoriously violent Sangin area in April .
Mr Cameron led tributes to the sacrifices made by the 300 British servicemen and women who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 .
He said : " It is desperately sad news .
Another family with such grief and pain and loss .
" Of course the 300th death is no more or less tragic than the 299 that came before .
" But it is a moment , I think , for the whole country to reflect on the incredible service and sacrifice and dedication that our armed services give on our behalf .
" We are paying a high price for keeping our country safe , for making our world a safer place , and we should keep asking why we are there and how long we must be there .
" The truth is that we are there because the Afghans are not yet ready to keep their own country safe and to keep terrorists and terrorist training camps out of their country .
That 's why we have to be there .
" But as soon as they are able to take care and take security for their own country , that is when we can leave . "
The UK currently has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan , of whom 8,000 are based in Helmand , the country 's most dangerous province .
Since becoming Prime Minister , Mr Cameron has stressed that British forces will not remain in Afghanistan " a day longer than is necessary " .
Senior military spokesman Major General Gordon Messenger said it was " entirely right " that people were asking why the UK was involved in the troubled country .
" I would think it wrong if we were not , given the sacrifices that the UK and many other nations are making , " he told Sky News .
Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said British forces in Afghanistan were protecting the UK 's national security .
" Their efforts will bring security and stability to Afghanistan and prevent it from once again becoming a base from which terrorists can attack the UK and our allies around the world , " he said .
" The last nine years have seen British forces at the forefront of the campaign , for the last five working hard in one of the most challenging areas of the country , building Afghan capacity to secure and govern their own country - a process which ultimately will allow us to bring our forces home .
" Our Armed Forces are the best in the world , operating daily in the most dangerous and demanding conditions .
Some have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure this essential mission succeeds .
" My thoughts and those of the nation 's are with the families and friends of all those servicemen and women who have fallen but our resolve and determination to see the mission through remains steadfast . "
The Chief of the Defence Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , said the Armed Forces took " enormous pride " in their role in the Nato - led mission .
" They put their lives on the line to make the progress we have seen , and will continue to see , in Helmand and across all of Afghanistan , " he said .
Shadow defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said Britain could not withdraw until it was sure Afghanistan would never again become a haven for terrorists .
There was further bad news for the Nato coalition today after a military helicopter crashed during an early morning operation in southern Afghanistan , killing three Australian troops and one American .
At least 59 members of international forces have already died in the conflict this month , including 11 Britons .
Video : Death toll reaches 300
Opponents of the war repeated calls for UK troops to be brought home .
Lindsey German , convenor of the Stop the War Coalition , said : " It is no surprise that there is an escalating death rate , among British and other Nato troops as well as Afghans , so this day should be one for reflection for our Government .
" Instead of intensifying the war , the Government should admit it cannot win .
This war is unpopular with Afghan people as well as the British public . "
The anti-war group will demand the withdrawal of UK forces from Afghanistan in a protest outside Downing Street tomorrow to coincide with Chancellor George Osborne 's emergency Budget .
Tom Cruise has always been one of my favorite actors , and I never really bought into the reasons why everyone began disliking him so much .
Bottom line is that this guy is a movie star , and he has charisma on screen .
‘ Knight and Day ’ reminds you that Cruise still has the ability to carry a big budget action flick , and without him the film would have probably fallen the way of ‘ The Bounty Hunter ’ , for instance .
His character , Roy Miller , is sort of a mix between Jerry Maguire and Ethan Hunt .
He ’s quick witted ( Maguire ) and can also kick some major ass ( Hunt ) .
Problem is that this film would have worked better about 15 years ago , about the time when the Hunt and Maguire characters made their debut .
The film has a rather simple story and it relies heavily on the chemistry between Cruise and Cameron Diaz , who plays June .
Diaz does a decent job here , but it ’s nothing like her performances in ‘ Charlie ’s Angels ’ or ‘ There ’s Something About Mary ’ .
When it ’s all said and done , she is just not that memorable .
Peter Sarsgaard , who plays Fitzgerald , seems a bit wasted because the character is underwritten .
He is an excellent actor , but anyone could have easily done this role .
I did enjoy some of the old school type action sequences that were directed by James Mangold ( ‘ 3:10 to Yuma ’ ) .
The bull run was a cool sequence , and the car chase scenes with Cruise on the hood of the car were exciting .
The visuals from all of the different places the film takes us were nicely shot .
Director Mangold is gifted at making some of the action better than what it could have been , and I give him credit for that .
‘ Knight and Day ’ plays like a 1990 ’s retro action comedy , and even though I personally do n’t mind that , today ’s audiences are probably going to leave the theater wanting something more .
I was n’t disappointed with ‘ Knight and Day ’ , but I did want the film to surprise me a little more than it did .
I had a feeling this could be a possible sleeper summer hit , but after watching it …probably not .
The film has a decent bit of comedy ( could have used a better script ) , some great action sequences ( that were too short ) , just ok chemistry between the two leads ( Cruise in on , but Diaz has been better ) , and characters that are interesting on paper ( but somehow feel like they get lost in the shuffle ) .
******** SPOILER ALERT ********
I found myself actually wanting Roy Miller to be the bad guy .
The film makes you believe that he has indeed lost his mind , but it cops out toward the end by making him out to be the good guy .
The reversal would have made the film more interesting , and it would have been a nice twist .
Miller ( Cruise ) is very likable throughout the picture , and you can almost feel the ‘ hero ’ thing coming .
If you are looking for an enjoyable , rather entertaining film to see this weekend , then I do recommend giving ‘ Knight and Day ’ a chance .
You might like it a little more than I did .
Make no mistake , Tom Cruise is still a ‘ movie star ’ .
He has on screen presence , and I am looking forward to ‘ Mission : Impossible 4 ′ ( if it gets made ) and the Les Grossman film .
Cameron Diaz needs to do a drama next , because I think it ’s time for her to do something completely different from this .
All in all …’ Knight and Day ’ is a mediocre film that could have been much better .

So , one more time : here ’s an attempt to put together some key arguments about why the rush to fiscal austerity is deeply misguided .
Let me start with the budget arithmetic , borrowing an approach from Brad DeLong .
Consider the long - run budget implications for the United States of spending $ 1 trillion on stimulus at a time when the economy is suffering from severe unemployment .
That sounds like a lot of money .
But the US Treasury can currently issue long - term inflation - protected securities at an interest rate of 1.75 % .
So the long - term cost of servicing an extra trillion dollars of borrowing is $ 17.5 billion , or around 0.13 percent of GDP .
And bear in mind that additional stimulus would lead to at least a somewhat stronger economy , and hence higher revenues .
Almost surely , the true budget cost of $ 1 trillion in stimulus would be less than one - tenth of one percent of GDP – not much cost to pay for generating jobs when they ’re badly needed and avoiding disastrous cuts in government services .
But we ca n’t afford it , say the advocates of austerity .
Why ?
Because we must impose pain to appease the markets .
There are three problems with this claim .
First , it assumes that markets are irrational – that they will be spooked by stimulus spending and / or encouraged by austerity even though the long - run budget implications of such spending and / or austerity are trivial .
Second , we ’re talking about punishing the real economy to satisfy demands that markets are not , in fact , making .
It ’s truly amazing to see so many people urging immediate infliction of pain when the US government remains able to borrow at remarkably low interest rates , simply because Very Serious People believe , in their wisdom , that the markets might change their mind any day now .
Third , all this presumes that if the markets were to lose faith in the US government , they would be reassured by short - term fiscal austerity .
The available facts suggest otherwise : markets continue to treat Ireland , which has accepted savage austerity with little resistance , as being somewhat riskier than Spain , which has accepted austerity slowly and reluctantly .
In short : the demand for immediate austerity is based on the assertion that markets will demand such austerity in the future , even though they should n’t , and show no sign of making any such demand now ; and that if markets do lose faith in us , self - flagellation would restore that faith , even though that has n’t actually worked anywhere else .
And this , ladies and gentlemen , is what passes for respectable policy analysis .

Drug Raids : Las Vegas Narc Serving Marijuana Search Warrant Kills Father - to - Be In His Own Bathroom A 21 - year - old father - to - be was killed last Friday night by a Las Vegas Police Department narcotics officer serving a search warrant for marijuana .
Trevon Cole was shot once in the bathroom of his apartment after he made what police described as " a furtive movement . "
Police have said Cole was not armed .
Police said Monday they recovered an unspecified amount of marijuana and a set of digital scales .
A person identifying herself as Cole 's fiancée , Sequoia Pearce , in the comments section in the article linked to above said no drugs were found .
Pearce , who is nine months pregnant , shared the apartment with Cole and was present during the raid .
" I was coming out , and they told me to get on the floor .
I heard a gunshot and was trying to see what was happening and where they had shot him , " Pearce told KTNV - TV .
According to police , they arrived at about 9 p.m. Friday evening at the Mirabella Apartments on East Bonanza Road , and detectives knocked and announced their presence .
Receiving no response , detectives knocked the door down and entered the apartment .
They found Pearce hiding in a bedroom closet and took her into custody .
They then tried to enter a bathroom where Cole was hiding .
He made " a furtive movement " toward a detective , who fired a single shot , killing Cole .
" It was during the course of a warrant and as you all know , narcotics warrants are all high - risk warrants , " Capt .
Patrick Neville of Metro's Robbery - Homicide Bureau said Friday night .
But a person identifying himself as Pearce 's brother , who said he had spoken with his sister , had a different version of events : " The police bust in the door , with guns drawn to my little sister and her now deceased boyfriend , " he wrote .
" My sister is 8 ½ months pregnant , two weeks until the due date .
But they bust in the door , irritated they did n't find any weapons or drugs , drag this young man into the restroom to interrogate him and two minutes later my sister hears a shot .
They shot him with a shotgun , no weapon .
For what ?
My sister is a baby , this young man is a baby , now my sister is at his house telling his mom her son is dead , and he is barely 21 . "
Pearce herself told the Las Vegas Review - Journal Monday that police forced her to kneel at gunpoint in the bedroom and that she could see Cole in the bathroom from the reflection of a mirror .
According to Cole , police ordered Cole to get on the ground , he raised his hands and said " Alright , alright , " and a shot rang out .
According to Pearce and family members , Cole had no criminal record , had achieved an Associate of Arts degree , and was working as an insurance adjustor while working on a political science degree at the University of Nevada - Las Vegas .
He was not a drug dealer , Pearce said .
" Trevon was a recreational smoker .
He smoked weed , marijuana .
That ’s what he did , " she told KTNV - TV .
" They did n't have to kill him .
We were supposed to get married next year , plan a black and white affair , ” she said .
" He was all I ever knew , we were gonna make it . "
LVPD Monday identified the police shooter as narcotics detective Bryan Yant , a 10 - year veteran of the force .
This is the third time
Yant has controversially used his police firearm .
In 2002 , he shot and killed a robbery suspect , claiming the suspect , who was on the ground , aimed a weapon at him .
But although the suspect 's gun was found 35 feet away , a jury took only half an hour to find the shooting justified .
The following year , he shot and wounded a man armed with a knife and a baseball ball who had been hired to kill a dog that had killed another neighborhood dog .
Yants claimed the man attacked him and that he mistook the bat for a shotgun , but the man said he was running away from Yants when Yants fired repeatedly , striking him once in the hip .
Because there was no death in that case , no inquest was held , but the department 's use of force board exonerated Yants .
Yants is on paid administrative leave while the department investigates .
The family has hired an attorney to pursue a civil action .
And another American has apparently been killed for no good reason in the name of the war on drugs .
" Narcotics warrants are high risk warrants , " said Capt .
Neville .
The question is for whom , and the answer is obvious :
The people on the receiving end of them .
The police ?
Not so much , as we have shown in our annual surveys of police casualties in the drug war .

Listen to Rand Paul talk and you will hear the unmistakable echoes of his father .
His voice , intonation , and gestures indicate that this is the son of Rep. Ron Paul .
But Tuesday night , the son pulled off a political feat that the father could never quite manage .
He captured the Republican nomination for statewide office , by an overwhelming margin .
In 1984 , Ron Paul tried for an open Senate seat but did n't get through the primary .
He lost to that Texas titan of charisma Phil Gramm and did n't reenter Congress again until 1997 .
Rand Paul will now have now have to appeal to a broader swath of voters than those who vote in Republican primaries .
He 'll have a real fight ahead of him but he has a good shot of winning his Kentucky Senate seat in November .
If he wins in November , will he follow in his father 's footsteps and run for president ?
For that matter , how will this affect Ron Paul 's decision about whether or not to run for president in 2012 ?
I put those question to a source close to the both the Rand Paul campaign and Ron Paul .
The source said this likely means Ron Paul wo n't run in 2012 and Rand Paul will run in 2016 .
The prediction makes sense , with the huge caveat that we 're dealing with the ever sifting sands of politics .
Certainly , Rand Paul has benefited greatly from loosely organized Tea Party support , but that 's not the whole picture .
Without that Tea Party enthusiasm ( whose top three issues , he explained , are " the debt , the debt , and the debt " ) , it would be impossible to imagine his victory Tuesday .
His vision of a smaller , constitutionally limited government that is less adventurous on the world stage is much easier to sell now that people are holding regular rallies against big government .
The Kentucky hopeful has also benefited from institutional support and from what D.C. Examiner columnist Gene Healy calls Ron Paul 's " cult of no personality . "
The institutional support : Ron Paul used some of the funds from his 2008 presidential election as seed money for two organizations to help advance his ideas in politics and academia , Campaign for Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty .
These organizations worked to hand him a victory in this year 's CPAC presidential straw poll and came only vote one short of winning a similar contest at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference .
Campaign for Liberty effectively endorsed Rand Paul , promoted him , and unofficially lent support for the primary ground game .
The Paulistas : Remember the " money bombs " of the 2008 Republican primaries ?
These spontaneous fundraisers by Ron Paul enthusiasts made his official organizations possible and many Ron Paul related websites and groups continue to be purely voluntary efforts .
The website RonPaul.com , for instance is maintained by " independent grassroots supporters of Ron Paul " and carries a disclaimer that the congressman does not endorse the website .
Though there was much debate about Rand Paul 's anti-war bona fides among Paulistas , many of them chipped in time and money that made his success possible .
With an infrastructure and a cult following , why would n't Ron Paul run for office in 2012 , I asked my source , or encourage his son to run for it instead ?
The second question was mostly rhetorical .
Rand Paul has never held elective office .
It would be hard to take him seriously and he'd have to start running for president as soon as he won the Senate seat and if he did n't get the GOP nomination for president - and he would n't - he 'd end up an unpopular , one term senator .
As for Ron Paul 's candidacy , my source pointed out that according to every public and private indication , he does n't want to run another presidential race .
The congressman told Reason magazine that he remains " firmly undecided " about another go - round , with good reason .
He is not a young man .
He is seen by too many people as a dangerous radical .
A sub -par performance in 2012 could damage the Paul brand and make it harder for his son to make a run at it .
The possibility that Ron Paul seems to be playing with , my source argued , goes like this :
Put up a candidate for the next Republican primary who credibly carry the banner , and then hand off his new political machine to his son for a run in 2016 .
Former two - term New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson has been making the rounds at many Campaign for Liberty events , and could make a credible candidate , provided he does n't begin every speech by talking about pot .
That would give the younger Paul enough time to find his political sea legs and to put a broad coalition of people who are weary of war and sick of big government .
The stunning maps that show the most photographed parts of every city ( and how to avoid tourists )
For London it 's Westminster and the London Eye. For New York , the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building .
Every world city has its must - see sights and every monument and skyscraper is photographed and documented by countless tourists .
Now a computer programmer has used photos that have been uploaded to the internet to create a fascinating record of the difference between the pictures taken by tourists and locals in the same city .
Eric
Fischer started his project by downloading as many locations and date - stamps of city locations using photos taken from photo - sharing websites such as Flickr and Picasa .
London shows a cluster of red around the Southbank and looking back at the bridges along the Thames
Paris shows a clear strip along the Champs Elysee
He then drilled down further into this information and sorted the pictures by photographer and city .
He then categorised the photographers into either ‘ locals ’ or ‘ tourists ’ .
‘ If a given photographer took pictures dated over a fairly continuous period of a month or more within one city , I considered them to be a local of that city , ’ he said .
‘ In any other city where they seemed to spend less than a month , I considered them a tourist . ’
Once he had categorised the two groups in this way he wrote a computer program which would plot all of the geo - tagged photos on the map and colour - code them according to their habits .
Tourists were red , locals were coloured blue while those which could fall into either camp were designated yellow .
New York shows most tourists have taken photos in North Manhattan but there is also a distinct area around the Statue of Liberty
The result is these incredible satellite images of familiar cities .
In New York a cluster of red forms around the Statue of Liberty at the foot of Manhattan .
And in London , the banks of the Thames are deep red as tourists take their obligatory shots of the London Eye and London Bridge .
Unsurprisingly the Eiffel Tower is one of the most - photographed areas in Paris while Tokyo's disparate centres show patches of red scattered throughout the city .
Mr Fischer does not believe that there is fundamental difference in where tourists and locals take their pictures .
He said : ‘ I think that tourists are mostly just limited in the information that they have and the time they have to spend exploring , so they do n't make it very far away from the places that the guidebooks recommend to them , while locals already saw those highlights long ago and do n't feel the need to take more pictures of them . ’
Sydney shows a clear blue line along to the south of the city and another cluster at the famous Bondi beach
Tokyo's lack of a defined city centre results in an interesting spread of clusters of shots taken across Shibuya , Shinjuku and other popular areas
Las Vegas is unusual in that nearly every photo is taken by a tourist
Koha community squares off against commercial fork
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
Koha is the world 's first open source system for managing libraries ( the books and periodical variety , that is ) , and one of the most successful .
In the ten years since its first release , Koha has expanded from serving as the integrated library system ( ILS ) at a single public library in New Zealand to more than 1000 academic , public , and private libraries across the globe .
But the past twelve months have been divisive for the Koha community , due to a familiar source of argument in open source : tensions between community developers , end users , and for - profit businesses seeking to monetize the code base .
As usual , copyrights and trademarks are the legal sticks , but the real issue is sharing code contributions .
Koha was originally written in 1999 by New Zealand 's Katipo Communications , spearheaded by developer Chris Cormack .
Katipo was contracted to build an ILS for the Horowhenua Library Trust ( HLT ) to replace its aging ( and Y2K - bug - vulnerable ) system , and to release the code under an open source license .
The name Koha is a Māori word for a reciprocal gift - giving custom .
The first public release was made in 2000 .
Over the years , Koha usage grew , and several businesses popped up to provide support and customization services for Koha-using libraries ; as with many infrastructure applications , the ongoing support of an ILS is the real expense .
An ILS not only serves as an electronic " card catalog " system for library patrons , but handles acquisitions , circulation tracking , patron account management , checkout , search , and integration with other cataloging systems for inter-library loan .
Libraries do not change ILS vendors quickly or lightly .
One of these support businesses was US - based LibLime , founded in 2005 by Koha developer Joshua Ferraro .
In 2007 , LibLime purchased Katipo Communications ' assets in Koha , including its copyright on the Koha source code , and took over maintenance of the koha.org web site .
For several years , life continued on as it had before ; koha.org was the home of the project , and LibLime participated in Koha 's ongoing development as did several other support - based businesses , many individuals , and many libraries .
The fork
The first signs of trouble began to appear in mid-2009 , when LibLime announced that it would be providing its customers with a version of Koha built from a private
Git repository , instead of the public source code maintained by the community as a whole .
Many in the community regarded this as an announcement that LibLime was forking the project , a claim that Ferraro denied .
The company cited several factors as its reasons for maintaining a separate code base , including the need to deliver on Koha contract work on its own deadlines , lack of quality control in community code contributions , and customer data it could not make public .
Ferraro stated that LibLime would publish its enhancements to Koha , that it was " 100 % committed to the open - source movement " , and that its integration with the main code repository would be " seamless . "
However , no such publication took place ; as of today , the most recent source code for LibLime 's products that is available on the web site are from June of 2009 , and the LibLime source code repository remains inaccessible to the public .
LibLime 's enhanced version of Koha is named LibLime Enterprise Koha ( LLEK ) , runs on Amazon 's EC2 cloud platform , and sports a list of features not present in the 3.0.2 " community " release .
Meanwhile , the community has continued to develop Koha , making point releases to the 3.0.x branch , and is readying a major update in version 3.2 .
Enough people in the Koha community were concerned about the project 's future and about practical matters like the web site and Git repository that they decided to migrate to a new domain , koha - community.org , to be managed by a committee and legally held by Koha 's original sponsors , HLT .
Those migrating included Cormack , many other core developers , and several of the other Koha support vendors .
2010 started off with a ray of hope for commercial and community reconciliation , when Progressive Technology Federal Systems , Inc. ( PTFS ) , another Koha support vendor , announced in January that it was acquiring LibLime .
PTFS was a relatively recent convert to the Koha community ; it started out as a proprietary - only ILS vendor catering to government and military institutions .
But it selected Koha as its open source product of choice in 2008 , in part for its ability to integrate with PTFS 's profitable digital content management products .
PTFS engineers had been active on the mailing list and IRC channel , and submitted patches back to the community , so the community was optimistic that they would continue to participate , and the LLEK fork would be merged back into the main branch .
In April , PTFS asked the community — developers , documentation and translation teams , release managers — to return to the koha.org domain , and set up a new repository with the intent of merging the code .
As community members explained in the thread , they did not like those terms and instead asked PTFS to either turn the koha.org domain over to the community or to bring its code and participants to the koha - community .org site .
Unfortunately , what could have been a simple disagreement over hosting and domain name relevance deteriorated further .
PTFS asked HLT 's Koha committee for a conference call under a non-disclosure agreement , but the committee asked for a public email or IRC discussion instead .
PTFS then responded with a press release ( copied to the Koha mailing list ) publicly criticizing the committee , calling it " new to business matters , " " one - sided , " and " inaccurate , " and touting its own version of Koha as superior .
Judging by the responses on the list , that action served only to further alienate the already - suspicious Koha community at large .
Code , Trademarks , Copyrights , and Names
Koha is far from the first project to go through such a divisive conflict .
In fact , forks of free software projects are not wrong in and of themselves , and can lead to improvements in the code .
What caused the major split between the Koha community and LibLime was the company 's decision to keep its fork private and not give back .
It promised to do so , but instead withdrew from the Koha community altogether .
Naturally there is no way to prevent individuals or companies from acting with hostility , but the Koha project was vulnerable to LibLime 's behavior on a couple of fronts .
First , as it recognized , LibLime controlled the ostensibly community - run koha.org site — prompting the community to re-launch the content in a new location .
What is more troubling is that , based on its actions , LibLime evidently believed that it had the right to create a closed - source fork of Koha due to its acquisition of Katipo Communications 's Koha assets , including the latter company 's copyrights .
But whether or not Katipo 's copyrights constituted the whole of Koha in 2009 when LibLime forked the project is questionable .
Cormack and other developers point to the Git repository 's commit statistics , which show the percentages by individual authors .
How to interpret those statistics is an open question , but there was no copyright assignment required to participate in Koha development .
In the absence of such an agreement , Koha contributors retain copyrights for their work ; as a result , taking the code proprietary is not an easy option for anybody .
It is still unclear whether or not LibLime provided the full source code to its LLEK product to its paying customers , as is required by the upstream Koha project 's GPLv2 + license .
Koha is written mostly in Perl , which is presumably distributed in source form , but the GPL source requirement does include all the source necessary to build the software , include supporting libraries and compilation scripts — a requirement that might affect support libraries needed to support LLEK 's EC2 environment .
Muddying the waters still further is the issue of who can legally call their code " Koha " at all .
LibLime filed for a registered US trademark on the name in October 2008 ; it was granted in May of 2009 .
European support vendor BibLibre filed for an EU trademark on " Koha " in December of 2008 ; it is still undergoing review .
Finally , LibLime filed for the Koha trademark in New Zealand itself in February of 2010 ; it too is still undergoing review .
Yet " Koha " has been used as the name of the open source project itself , not a vendor package or support product , since 2000 .
The Software Freedom Law Center 's Karen Sandler said that such trademark - based disputes are common , enough so that SFLC has published a primer on the subject for projects .
Without commenting on the specifics of the Koha situation , she noted that although registration constitutes " legal presumption of ownership , " if another party can prove it was using the mark first , it retains the right to use the mark .
In addition , she added ,
Others can use a mark in a manner that does not imply an official relationship or sponsorship so long as there 's no likelihood of confusion on the part of consumers .
Factually referring to unmodified software by a particular name , for example , is likely to be considered clearly within permitted usage .
This kind of use is called nominative use .
The community 's unstructured approach to the project in past years does not make up for PTFS 's very public missteps , however .
The company may indeed have meant to put the community back together into a functioning whole when it initiated talks about the web site , but it clearly underestimated the ire that LibLime had earned through its actions over the previous year , and the derisive press release would be considered a mistake under any circumstances .
If there was any hope of drawing the larger Koha community back to koha.org , it probably died when that message went out .
Cormack observed on his blog that any vendor has the right to try and turn its Koha offering into a superior product for customers in order to increase sales — the harm was inflicted because of the way LibLime chose to carry out that business decision ..
Whether you agree with that or not , however , it seems that the project would have been better equipped to cope with LibLime 's withdrawal from the community had the domain name , trademarks , and perhaps even copyrights been held by a trusted entity such as HLT .
Taking those legal steps is something few projects seem to consider when things are running smoothly .
They are no doubt time - consuming and tedious , perhaps even expensive .
But so is trying to do them in a hurry , ten years after the project launches , with hostile players going after your name .

The removal of the Labour Party from power in the United Kingdom last month has opened the best opportunity in a decade to repair Britain ’s relationship with Zimbabwe .
But Britain has to act fast .
Zimbabwe – once one of the most beautiful and bountiful lands in Africa – all but collapsed in the 2000s under the brutally repressive regime of President Robert Mugabe .
People lived in fear in a country where they once enjoyed political freedoms and decent public services and jobs .
Thousands died of malnutrition and starvation .
It was nearly another Darfur or Rwanda .
Today Zimbabwe is more stable than at any time since the 1990s .
It is not yet out of the woods , far from it .
But now may be the time for bold moves by the international community to help consolidate this progress and , hopefully , a final democratic transition .
The most constructive role Britain , the former colonial power , could play would be to encourage other major donors to Zimbabwe – namely the US , Canada , and leading European countries – to help lift sanctions against the country .
Such a step would go a long way to repairing the icy relationship between Zimbabwe and Britain .
International sanctions have become a sticking point in the normalization of relations , even though they were certainly just and appropriate when first applied against Mr. Mugabe ’s regime .
But they ’ve become more of a helpful tool for Mugabe and his ZANU - PF party than a hindrance .
And if Zimbabwe is to turn a corner , this issue must be revisited .
Mugabe claims that sanctions are the reason that Zimbabwe ’s economy has collapsed .
The real culprits are the policies aggressively pursued over the past decade by ZANU - PF , especially the redistribution of land seized from some 4,000 white farmers to give to their own political cronies .
ZANU -PF also uses the sanctions as an excuse not to carry out the gamut of reforms required to stabilize the economy and create the conditions conducive to free and fair elections .
Mugabe draws succor from the fact that some 60 percent of Zimbabweans polled today believe that sanctions are damaging their economy .
The sanctions are leaving the governments which apply them increasingly isolated within Africa .
They are finding it harder to defend the measures within African diplomatic circles , now that the situation in Zimbabwe has become more stable politically but the suffering of the poorest continues .
For their part , Western donor countries fear that without sanctions they will have no lever to ensure good – or at least better – behavior .
The West is n’t convinced it can sell the lifting of sanctions back home , especially if it is not linked to the removal of Mugabe .
But sanctions may be undermining the West ’s long - term partnerships on the continent , where China , Iran , and others could be maneuvering into a less conditional relationship with African governments .
That sanctions encourage recalcitrance rather than reform and hurt those they are supposed to help the most is an old argument , but valid in Zimbabwe ’s case .
So what are the options ?
Whether a change of policy on sanctions would have the desired effect will depend partly on whether they are permanently lifted or just suspended .
Lifting sanctions altogether is the most dramatic step but it leaves little room for review and reapplication , and could be too hard for Western countries to swallow .
Suspending sanctions until specific goals , such as the passing of the new Zimbabwe constitution or fresh elections , are met , is probably the better option , as it might allay the unease among donor countries ’ domestic constituents .
Conditional suspension would be all the more credible if it were underwritten by South Africa and other power brokers in the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , who could pledge to support the reinstitution of sanctions if the Zimbabwean government did n’t fulfil its side of the bargain .
Key to the success : depersonalization .
Donors now largely accept that the demonization of Mugabe , and calls for regime change , have gotten them nowhere .
Manichean rhetoric has been replaced by an emphasis on the gradual narrowing of differences between ZANU and officials of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
As a result of the Global Political Agreement signed in September 2008 , these two once - fierce enemies now share power in Zimbabwe ’s coalition government .
Until recently , it appeared that the MDC stood to gain the most from the seemingly open - ended and prolonged transition to democracy , as ZANU ’s ageing leaders would inevitably be supplanted by MDC ’s younger cadre of officials .
But with ZANU ’s coffers now being replenished through diamond sales from the Marange fields and the rich pickings in prospect via the mooted “ indigenization ” of Zimbabwean business ( shorthand for the partial seizure of principally white - owned assets ) , the political balance is shifting .
The bad blood between ZANU and Britain ’s Labour Party poisoned relations between Harare and its former colonial master , London .
On that score , the fact that the Labour Party is out is a good thing .
Gordon Brown ’s boycott of the European Union - Africa Summit in 2007 over Mugabe ’s attendance drew stinging criticism .
Former British Foreign Secretary David Milliband ’s remark earlier this year that sanctions against Zimbabwe should remain in place until MDC head Morgan Tsvangirai personally advocated for them to be lifted were described as “ unhelpful ” by Tsvangirai himself and were a gift to the ZANU leader .
The international community should use the changing of power in Britain as a way to change direction on sanctions against Zimbabwe .
Will the removal of sanctions help Zimbabweans and the major donors tackle the country ’s big economic problems , promote the rule of law and reform the security services ?
Will it attract investment and skills back to Zimbabwe , and help pave the way to free and fair elections ?
Of course there is no way to know for sure unless we try .
There will be challenges in the removal of sanctions .
But at no time since they were first imposed have sanctions seemed more counterproductive .
It ’s time to revisit their value .

Bacon , we all know , is the subject of rabid devotion among its fans , and a subculture known to incorporate the meat into marriage proposals will surely go nuts for a bacon camp in Ann Arbor .
Yes , a bacon camp .
While the word " camp " might be misleading -- it does n't appear as if attendees gathered around fires and sang songs , bacon - related or otherwise -- it definitely exists .
And , according to a feature in the Washington Post , which sent a reporter to the event over the weekend , people did indeed camp in tents , through which the smell of freshly cooked bacon no doubt wafted .
Other activities included bacon bingo and the reading of bacon - inspired poetry .
Oh , and the consumption of epic quantities of the meat .
Renowned bacon purveyors from across the country shared their delicacies .
One foodie described it as a " thinking person 's bacon camp , " raising the obvious question of what the alternative might look like .
The event was presented by Zingerman 's restaurant in Ann Arbor , whose owner published a bacon cookbook The Press featured last year .
To occupy yourself until the next Camp Bacon event rolls around , check out recipes for Dutch bacon and gouda potato salad and ( urp ) chocolate and bacon fat gravy .

Climategate Before Climategate
By Nicolas Loris
The Heartland Institute ’s International Climate Change Conference commenced in Chicago last night , bringing together some of the world ’s leading climatologists who offer dissenting views from the mainstream “ global warming is a serious , human - induced problem ” view .
This year 73 scientists , economists , and policy analysts from 23 countries will present to over 700 attendees .
Heartland ’s conference provides a valuable forum for accomplished scientists to showcase their work and offer different reasons as to why the planet is warming and cooling and how fast it is doing so .
Several of the panels will bring together analysts , including Heritage ’s Ben Lieberman , to look at the policy implications behind global warming legislation .
In a sense , Heartland ’s conference ( this being the fourth annual ) was Climategate before Climategate .
Before leaked emails and other documents from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia brought climate change skepticism to the headlines of papers , Heartland ’s conference showed their was another side to the story .
The purpose of the conference is not necessarily to expose flaws in the climate research used by our politicians to justify carbon dioxide regulations as Climategate did – although some panels have done so in the past – rather provide an opportunity for debate on climate science .
It was fitting that Sunday night ’s keynote speaker was climate expert Stephen McIntyre , a leader in exposing the data mismanagement in Climategate , most notably Michael Mann ’s hockey stick theory .
He is author of the blog Climate Audit and his presentation focused on the “ Nature trick ” to “ hide the decline . ”
This was the most notorious of the leaked emails where Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change author Mann “ chopped off the inconvenient portion of the tree ring data – the portion where it goes down – and tucked the end point under other data , giving a rhetorical impression of consistency . ”
Defenders of the leaked emails said the language was common practice but McIntyre ’s talk reveals otherwise .
McIntyre spent two years and $ 5,000 of his own money to uncover much of this information and his full presentation goes into much more detail .
You can find it at Heartland.org , and for those who could n’t attend , PajamasTV is covering the entire event .
This is Stephen McIntyre ’s speech from last year .
Nicolas Loris is a Research Assistant at The Heritage Foundation ’s Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies .
Loris studies energy , environment and regulation issues such as the economic impacts of climate change legislation , a free market approach to nuclear energy and the effects of environmental policy on energy prices and the economy .

The rise and fall of the gasometer August 2008
Hundreds of gas holders - also known as gasometers - once stood among the UK 's towns and cities .
William Murdoch , the inventor of gas lighting coined the term gasometer in the early 1800s .

> Hamburg guide
The disused gasometer , pictured above , was built in East Greenwich around 1887 .
At time of building its 225,000 cubic metre capacity made it the largest gas holder in the world
They are called gasometers because they rise to the occasion .
As gas is fed in from a pipeline it pushes up storage chambers one - by - one , to accommodate the exact amount .
The more gas , the bigger the holder becomes .
Gas holder - Greenwich , London
Are they still in use ?
A few still are in use in the UK - apparently there 's a working gas holder in the east of Oxford , yards from the Cowley plant .
But most have not been used for many years .
They became common in the last century because ' town ' gas for domestic use was locally manufactured from coal - it needed to be stored .
Gasometers were made obsolete by the high pressure underground pipelines that deliver natural gas - the National Transmission System .
Natural gas was discovered in the North Sea in the 1960s .
Transco plans to dismantle nearly all of its non-listed 550 gasometers by 2009 .
Gasometers require expensive maintenance - and the authorities are not keen on large containers of gas in urban areas , either .
" There are , on average , three or four large gas escapes every year from gasholders , which could lead to a major incident if the gas found an ignition source . " wrote Geoffrey Podger , Chief Executive , Health and Safety Executive , in November 2007 .
Gas holder detail - Greenwich , London
What now ?
Energy company E.ON UK is currently working on two major underground gas storage schemes .
The Holford Gas Storage facility in Cheshire is already under construction , and the Whitehill project in East Yorkshire is currently in planning .
They 're not planning on building any distinctive steel framed gasometers .
But we may not have smelt the last of ' town gas ' - Great Point Energy a Boston - area startup has come up with a low - cost process for converting coal into pipeline - grade natural gas .
" We can take coal out of the ground and put it in a natural - gas pipeline for less than the cost of new natural - gas drilling and exploration activities , " CEO Andrew Perlman told MIT 's Technology Review .

Over the last three years , Arctic Ice has gained significantly in thickness .
The graph above was generated by image processing and analysis of PIPS maps , and shows the thickness histogram for June 1 of each year since 2007 .
The blue line represents 2008 , and the most abundant ice that year was less than 1.5 metres thick .
That thin ice was famously described by NSIDC as “ rotten ice . ”
In 2009 ( red ) the most common ice had increased to more than 2.0 metres , and by 2010 ( orange ) the most common ice had increased to in excess of 2.75 metres thick .
We have seen a steady year over year thickening of the ice since the 2007 melt season .
Thinner ice is more likely to melt during the summer , so the prognosis for a big melt looks much less likely than either of the previous two summers .
More than 70 % of the ice this year is thicker than 2.25 metres thick .
By contrast , more than half of the ice was thinner than 2.0 metres in 2008 .
So why did 2008 start out with so little thick ice ?
Because during the summer of 2007 much of the ice melted or was compressed by the wind .
During the winter of 2007 - 2008 , much of the remaining thick ice blew out into the North Atlantic and melted .
So by the time that summer 2008 arrived , there was very little ice left besides rotten , thin ice .
Which led to Mark Serreze ’ famous “ ice free North Pole bet . ”
Can we find another year with similar ice distribution as 2010 ?
I can see Russian ice in my Windows .
Note in the graph below that 2010 is very similar to 2006 .
2006 on the left .
2010 on the right .
2006 had the highest minimum ( and smallest maximum ) in the DMI record .
Like 2010 , the ice was compressed and thick in 2006 .
http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/plots/icecover/icecover_2010.png
Conclusion :
Should we expect a nice recovery this summer due to the thicker ice ?
You bet ya .
Even if all the ice less than 2.5 metres thick melted this summer , we would still see a record high minimum in the DMI charts .
Mark Serreze has a different take for 2010 :
“ Could we break another record this year ?
I think it ’s quite possible , ” said Mark Serreze of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo .

==================================
Addendum By Steve Goddard 6/3/10 :
Anyone betting on the minimum extent needs to recognize that summer weather can dramatically effect the behaviour of the ice .
The fact that the ice is thicker now is no guarantee that it wo n’t shrink substantially if the summer turns out to be very warm , windy or sunny .
Joe Bastardi believes that it will be a warm summer in the Arctic .
I ’m not a weather forecaster and wo n’t make any weather predictions .

Republican senators and conservative jurists found themselves on the defensive after Sen. Al Franken Alan ( Al ) Stuart FrankenGOP
Senate candidate says Trump , Republicans will surprise in Minnesota Peterson faces fight of his career in deep - red Minnesota district Getting tight — the psychology of cancel culture MORE ( D - Minn . ) blasted " conservative activism " on federal courts .
Franken , in a major speech Thursday evening before the American Constitution Society , sought to set the stage for a summer confirmation battle in the Senate over President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE 's pick , Elena Kagan , to join the Supreme Court .

The first - term senator launched a full - throated attack on originalism , the judicial philosophy often upheld by conservatives as an example for model nominees for the federal courts .
" Originalism is n’t a pillar of our constitutional history .
It ’s a talking point , " Franken said , adding a jab at Chief Justice John Roberts for his famous comparison between judges and baseball umpires during Roberts 's confirmation hearings .
" How ridiculous , " Franken said .
" Judges are nothing like umpires .
" The Senate is set to take up the Kagan nomination in the Senate Judiciary Committee , on which Franken serves , later this month .
With the battle over Kagan and other judicial nominees having stalled in the Senate , Franken also took a moment to castigate GOP filibusters of Obama 's court picks .
" The Republican obstruction that is standing between you and the work you ’ve agreed to do for your country is unacceptable .
And we will continue to fight it , " Franken said , apologizing to Goodwin Liu and Dawn Johnsen , the president 's picks for a circuit court spot and director of the Office of Legal Counsel , respectively , who were both in the audience .
Practical Solutions to End the War on Drugs - Alex Wodak
HuffPo :
The Associated Press has just dropped a bombshell on America 's longest running war and the headline says it all : " The US Drug War has Met None of its Goals " .
The extensive piece reviews the last 40 years , starting with President Nixon 's official launch of the War on Drugs all the way to President Obama 's annual strategy released this week . [..]
The piece packs a punch from the start : " After 40 years , the United States ' War on Drugs has cost $ 1 trillion dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives , and for what ?
Drug use is rampant and violence more brutal and widespread . "
Contemplate that number for a minute : ONE TRILLION DOLLARS .
These costs are absurd :
In 40 years , taxpayers spent more than : _ $ 20 billion to fight the drug gangs in their home countries .
In Colombia , for example , the United States spent more than $ 6 billion , while coca cultivation increased and trafficking moved to Mexico — and the violence along with it .
_ $ 33 billion in marketing " Just Say No" - style messages to America 's youth and other prevention programs .
High school students report the same rates of illegal drug use as they did in 1970 , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says drug overdoses have " risen steadily " since the early 1970s to more than 20,000 last year .
_ $ 49 billion for law enforcement along America 's borders to cut off the flow of illegal drugs .
This year , 25 million Americans will snort , swallow , inject and smoke illicit drugs , about 10 million more than in 1970 , with the bulk of those drugs imported from Mexico .
_ $ 121 billion to arrest more than 37 million nonviolent drug offenders , about 10 million of them for possession of marijuana .
Studies show that jail time tends to increase drug abuse .
_ $ 450 billion to lock those people up in federal prisons alone .
Last year , half of all federal prisoners in the U.S. were serving sentences for drug offenses .
At the same time , drug abuse is costing the nation in other ways .
The Justice Department estimates the consequences of drug abuse — " an overburdened justice system , a strained health care system , lost productivity , and environmental destruction " — cost the United States $ 215 billion a year .
And for what ?
Drug use is no lower .
Violent crimes related to drugs are up .
And nearly half of our overly - crowded prisons are in there for drug offenses .
There is absolutely nothing constructive to show for this 40 year boondoggle .
Hell , we could have used that money to implement a Single Payer system , something we could see a very tangible benefit from in a short period of time .
Here in California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has introduced a budget with brutal cuts :
Schwarzenegger 's budget would eliminate CalWORKS , the state 's welfare - to - work program .
Families would lose both state grants ( of about $ 500 per month ) and state - subsidized day care .
The budget would slash 60 percent of the state 's spending for county mental health programs .
In - home health care programs for the elderly and the disabled would lose about a third of their funding .
And the state would grab about $ 880 million from state transportation projects in an attempt to balance the budget .
All state workers would face a wage cut of about 10 percent .
The state has no money and of course , raising taxes is unthinkable ( and the ridiculous California initiative system means that short - sighted Californian voters keep blocking bonds ) , so the least able among us -- the elderly , the disabled , families in poverty -- must lose the little pittance assistance they get .
Of course , there are those who can't see the forest for the trees and insist that we can't end this war we 've already lost :
( Former drug czar John P. )
Walters insists society would be far worse today if there had been no War on Drugs .
Drug abuse peaked nationally in 1979 and , despite fluctuations , remains below those levels , he says .
Judging the drug war is complicated : Records indicate marijuana and prescription drug abuse are climbing , while cocaine use is way down .
Seizures are up , but so is availability .
" To say that all the things that have been done in the war on drugs have n't made any difference is ridiculous , " Walters said .
" It destroys everything we 've done .
It 's saying all the people involved in law enforcement , treatment and prevention have been wasting their time .
It 's saying all these people 's work is misguided . "
I do n't know what to tell you , Mr. Walters .
When you find yourself in a hole , the smart choice is to stop digging .
Prohibition did n't work , why on earth do we think the equally misguided War on Drugs would be any different ?
Please , let 's just declare the war lost , and look to ways we can legalize drugs , regulate them , tax the hell out of them , and stop throwing little penny ante possession arrests in jail .
Anything else is to keep digging that hole in which we sit .
School Administrator Earns Pension of Over $ 26 Million
California and Illinois state budgets have been a mess for some time now , as you would expect when expenses are wildly in excess of revenues .
Here ’s the latest vivid example of how far off course they ’ve gotten in Illinois … the estimated pension liability for just the 100 top school administrators is now about $ 888 million .
That ’s right … nearly one billion dollars … or about $ 9 million per administrator .
Here are the numbers crunched by Bill Zettler , via The Daily Bail ( click to visit a bigger version ) : ﻿
As would be expected in a pension spread , the numbers are not evenly distributed .
One listed administrator in particular is expected to require a pension of over $ 26 million during his 29 years of retirement .
His student must have learned their curriculum especially well .
Thanks to his serving many noble years as a public “ servant ” it only makes sense to reward that effort , and sacrifice , with about $ 1 million per year of retirement .
Further , it ’s a good thing President Obama is now also allocating $ 50 billion to bailout states ’ teachers , police , and firefighters .
There ’s clearly a posh lifestyle for the top echelon that must be maintained at all costs .
In fact , the President ’s approach makes plenty of sense .
Why bother with a traditional method like trimming the fat from state budgets ?
It could turn out to be far more innovative and effective to just inject more fat into the original fat this time around .
We should definitely give this idea a shot as well … because you ca n’t knock it ‘ til you ’ve tried it .

In a nearby galaxy , huge stars 100 times bigger than the Sun and a million times brighter live out their lonely existences with no obvious explanation for how they came to be .
Now we know : they 're running away from home .

Located 160,000 light - years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud , the third nearest galaxy to the Milky Way , these massive stars represented a cosmic mystery for astronomers .
These stars , relatively young at only two million years old and occupied for most of their existence in furiously ejecting about half their mass as solar wind , would have required huge concentrations of stellar material to form in the first place .
This could n't have happened in their current location , which is an extremely barren area of their galaxy .
Vasilii Gvaramadze of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute at Moscow State University now has an answer , at least for one of these young massive stars .
He 's determined the star BI 237 is careening through the Large Magellanic Cloud at eighty miles per second on a more or less straight trajectory .
That means it 's possible to trace its path back to its birthplace , which turns out is precisely the sort of place astrophysicists would expect : the LH 82 star cluster .

Astronomers have long considered the possibility that these huge stars formed elsewhere and were then somehow sent off on a runaway course - something we 've observed in our own galaxy - but the Large Magellanic Cloud was thought to be too far away for the velocity of the stars to be measured .
Gvaramadze found a novel way around this problem , using a known characteristic of runaway stars in the Milky Way to identify similar ones in the distant galaxy .
Specifically , such stars produce bow shocks , which are parabolic formations created by the mixture of stellar wind emanating from the star with the interstellar gas up ahead .
He was able to find the infrared signature of just such a bow shock on star BI 237 , confirming its runaway status and providing a direction home to its origin point .

As star clusters form , the most gigantic stars tend to concentrate together in the center of the menagerie .
When such huge stars are brought in close proximity , they begin orbiting each other in extremely eccentric ways , and it 's possible for some of the stars to pick up enough additional speed to break free of the mutual orbits and shoot straight out of the cluster .
This is likely what happened with BI 237 .
The hope is that further analysis of other isolated massive stars will reveal similar bow shocks , providing a definitive answer to one of astrophysics 's most puzzling riddles .

We recently did a very cool interview with Star Wars artist Denise Vasquez .
In that interview , she mentioned she was taking part in the 501st Legion 's TK Project for charity .
The concept of the project is that talented Star Wars artists and celebs customize Stormtrooper helmets in unique and fun ways ... with all profits from an eventual auction heading to the Make - A - Wish Foundation .
We could n't get Denise to divulge any hints about her helmet , which was still in process due to an injury to her hand and wrist .
Well , we saw that her helmet was finally revealed , and it's a beauty .

Well , this is fun .
Minutes after I completed and published my post further detailing how to root your EVO , I catch a teaser for ‘ unrevoked ’ - a ‘ painless ’ EVO rooting method that ’s to be released tomorrow .
Unrevoked is the work of Matt Mastracci , who gave us our first sneak peek at a rooted EVO , and one of the developers who contributed to the hack .
As Matt details here , there are several critical security flaws present in the custom Sprint software included on the EVO , and these flaws were the driving force behind releasing an easy ‘ anyone can do it ’ rooting method for the EVO .
According to Matt , no EVO is actually safe unless it has been rooted , and he even recommends against purchasing the EVO and Sprint Hero altogether .
In fact , it ’s with the very exploits presented by the Sprint software that ’s present on both the Hero and the EVO 4G with which he is able to accomplish the ‘ painless ’ root .
He does n’t get into the technical details of the problems he found , but he does mention that there are several exploits , not just one , and that ‘ an Android application could get access to all of your data with very little work ’ .
He goes on to advocate that handset manufacturers and phone carriers take a more Google / Nexus
One like approach to phone hardware , rather than an Apple - esque approach :
To handset manufacturers and carriers : if you give users to freedom to customize their devices , we ’ll work with you directly to make sure those same users are n’t vulnerable out - of - the - box .
Be more like Google and less like Apple and you ’ll get an army of white - hats working to improve your product .
Ca n’t say I disagree with him there .
It took me all of 2 minutes to have my Nexus One ready to be rooted once I powered it up after unboxing it .
We ’ll keep an eye out for the release of Unrevoked tomorrow , but if you ’d like to get a head start , you can hit our guide here to get your root on .

A FATHER of six was jailed for nine years today for sexually abusing his intellectually disabled daughter and pimping her for money to his friends .
A judge told the man he treated the victim , now aged 24 , as a sex object and his offending constituted a gross breach of trust by a father towards his daughter .
“ You took advantage of a mildly intellectually - disabled child to sexually exploit her for your own gratification , '' said the County Court judge .
The sexual abuse began when the girl was 11 years old and continued for nine years , the Herald Sun reported .
Asked why he had prostituted her , the man replied : “ I was helping her and it was good money ' ' .
The father , who cannot be identified because it would reveal his victim 's identity , pleaded guilty to counts of maintaining a sexual relationship with a child under 16 who was his daughter , receiving payment for sexual services , inducing a child to take part in an act of prostitution , producing child pornography and two charges of incest .
The judge said that as a result of the abuse the victim suffered depression , was suicidal and had profound ongoing psychological problems .
“ All she wanted was to have a normal dad .
Someone to protect and look after her , '' the judge said .
She set a maximum term of 13 years and ordered that the father be placed on a sex offenders ' register for life .

Greg Zaffke II will spend Mother 's
Day the same way he did last year : privately , with his fiancee and his father , remembering his mother , who was killed on her motorcycle by a driver districted while painting her fingernails .
" We kind of laid low and stayed together as a family , " said Zaffke , 32 , of Wauconda , remembering the haunting day a year ago .
" It was days after the funeral , and we were recovering from that . "
On May 2 , 2009 , Lora Hunt 's Chevrolet Impala slammed into Anita Zaffke , as she sat on her motorcycle at a red light near Lake Zurich .
On Thursday , a Lake County jury found Hunt , 49 , of Morris , guilty of reckless homicide in Zaffke 's death .
Zaffke hopes that his mother will be remembered for being more than the victim of a distracted driver .
" It 's not about her death .
It 's more about her life and remembering how much she loved me , " he said .
Anita Zaffke was an administrative assistant when she decided to go to college to pursue a degree in liberal studies and political science , he said .
In 2005 , she received a bachelor 's degree from Roosevelt University .
" She was very intelligent , and she went to learn and to improve herself , " Zaffke said .
" She did n't go for a piece of paper , or a diploma , she just really wanted to learn .
She chose liberal studies and political science because she wanted a broad education , and she wanted to know as much as she could about the world . "
Zaffke said he is determined to make others aware of the dangers of distracted and reckless driving .
In January , he and his father started the Black Nail Brigade , a foundation that tries to increase awareness of such dangers .
Supporters have been painting the nails on one hand black in memory of Anita Zaffke and as a way to start conversations about distracted driving .
" Our story is bigger than my mom , " Zaffke said .
" I love my mom , but I understand that there are other loved ones out there dying . "
During the trial last week in Lake County Circuit Court , prosecutor Mike Mermel said it would be a mistake to compare painting nails while driving to using a cell phone or another distraction .
" She might as well have been in the back seat making a sandwich , " he said .
Hunt 's attorney , Jeff Tomczak , said Hunt , who is a nurse , has found support and solace from her family , friends and her faith .
" She is a Christian lady , and that 's carrying her through , " he said .
Tomczak said he will file a motion for a new trial — a prerequisite for an appeal — though he said there was no decision yet whether to pursue one .
He was preparing for Hunt 's sentencing , assembling statements from family , church members and people with whom she works , who will testify about her character .
Tomczak hopes that Hunt will receive probation , since she has no prior criminal history .
She could face up to five years in prison .
Hunt , he said , also hopes that the case will serve as a lesson to others about the hazards of distracted driving .
" I do really believe this will raise awareness , " Tomczak said .
" Lora does hope this will save lives . "
Hunt 's driver 's license will be revoked for at least one year , when she can reapply for one , he said .
Zaffke will push for a permanent revocation .
Because his mother will never drive again , " her killer should not be afforded that privilege , " he said , adding that no matter what sentence Hunt receives , he will never have a future with his mother .
" I will never get my mother back , so there 's no real reconciliation for my family , " he said .
" But the precedent has been set that our society is not going to sit back and let this happen to anyone .
There is a consequence to the action you take behind the wheel . "

The two heads of state and their spouses will sit at a head table set for twenty .
According to the White House , the decor will honor Calderon 's birthplace of Michoacán , Mexico .
Mayan blue striped tablecloths will be complemented by gilded baskets of fuschia , roses , orchids and prickly pear cactus .
The White House also said that guests , upon entering the dining room , would experience the feel of " Monarch butterflies in flight , " although they declined to explain how .

Mr Abbott used today 's Liberal Party federal council meeting in Canberra to outline the 12 - point " action contract " , aiming to offer voters a clear alternative to Labor .
He told delegates this week 's leadership change in the government showed its instability , and that the switch from Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard did not change its policies or past policy failures .
" She can execute a prime minister but she can't execute a government program , " Mr Abbott said .
Meanwhile , a coalition government would bring " the most experienced and accomplished ministerial team in a generation " , he said .

An FCC survey released on June 1 , 2010 found that four out of five broadband users do n't know the speed of their Internet connection .
The survey , based on phone interviews with more than 3,000 adults from April 19 to May 2 , also found that only 33 % of cell phone users are very satisfied with the speed of their mobile Internet connections .
" Speed matters , " FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski's aptly reported .
The more broadband subscribers know about what speeds they need and what speeds they get , the more they can make the market work and push faster speeds over broadband networks . "
The FCC has recently increased its focus on consumer protection issues including the speed and reliability of broadband connections .
The agency is looking for 10,000 volunteers to participate in a scientific study measuring home broadband speeds across America .

People applying for a particular benefit will , from 2013 , undergo tough new medical assessments to " reduce dependency and promote work " .
Sounds reasonable , you may think , but the benefit in question is disability living allowance ( DLA ) .
DLA is not an out - of - work benefit .
Nor is it means - tested .
This is because DLA contributes to the extra costs faced by disabled people , and the minimum wage does not rise just because everyday life is more expensive .
Nor do poverty thresholds or income - tax brackets .
This is where DLA comes in .
For example , one of the qualifying criteria for the lowest rate is if you cannot prepare a cooked main meal while alone .
This may be due to a mental health condition , or a physical disability .
Those of us in this category include epileptics and people with sleep disorders .
I can't cook hot food while alone in the house because I may fall asleep and burn it down .
Experience shows I can sleep through fire evacuations .
This is just one example of the many ways in which disabled people may qualify for DLA .
But as Richard Exell writes on the TUC 's informal public policy blog , George Osborne seems confused about DLA 's nature and purpose : " Making it harder for disabled people to qualify for it will do nothing to improve – or worsen – incentives to work … disabled people will be paying the price for deficit reduction . "
Claiming DLA is n't easy , whatever you may have read .
The initial form is 59 pages long .
Around half of all claims are refused .
In 2008 - 09 , 49 % of appeals were turned down , rising to 57 % for cases reaching an appeal hearing .
The initial application and reassessment procedures are already a bureaucratic struggle for many .
When you consider that current estimates put the number of disabled people in this country at around 11 million , while the labour force survey says 40 % of people with work - limiting disabilities are in paid employment , 2.9 million DLA claimants does n't sound quite so high .
But the same coalition that talked about disability and social care in terms of " dignity " and " respect " does n't see it that way .
The Treasury complains that DLA claimant numbers have tripled since 1992 .
If the total number of disabled people in the UK had risen at this rate , it would be a matter for more than just the budget .
But there are other reasons why claimant numbers are up , including increased awareness of DLA 's existence .
Disabled people are n't always told that they are eligible for help .
Often , we 're just told what we can't do .
If you want to be misled about the nature and purpose of DLA , look no further than the government 's state of the nation report on poverty , worklessness and welfare dependency in the UK , released on 3 June .
" There is a high degree of persistence among claimants of many low - income and out - of - work benefits " , it says .
" For example … around 2.2 million people , including 1.1 million people of working age , have been claiming disability living allowance for over five years " .
This statement completely ignores the fact that DLA is not , and has never been , a low - income or out - of - work benefit .
And if DLA claimants are " persistent " , it is because disability is , by its very nature , " persistent " , and citing the fact that people with " substantial and long - term " impairments still have them after five years as an example of persistent welfare dependency is disingenuous and spiteful .
As Rich Watts , director of the Essex Coalition of Disabled People , points out on his Arbitrary Constant blog , the report does n't bother to define what DLA is for , although it does say 20 % of DLA claimants are in the top 40 % of income distribution , when DLA is included as income and – here 's the really important bit – no account is taken of the extra costs of disability .
" DLA is designed precisely to take account of the extra costs of disability / impairment , " he writes .
But for how much longer ?
Just as in years past , we submit a distillation of the Big Three Briefings .
This E3 has been difficult to observe usefully from afar , because merely watching does n’t convey the data it used to : so much of the offering is directly experiential .
People are waving things , or they ’re waving their arms in front of things , or they ’re looking at magical screens that shit is popping right out of .
It would be like if a person came out and started talking about chocolate , and then ate some chocolate , and then walked off stage .
That is not data .
There ’s so much conjecture that whatever you come up with is almost hopelessly attenuated .
The Nintendo briefing did n’t have anything wrong with it , really , in terms of line - up .
They do n’t have anything to prove , they ’re on top of the heap in home and portable by a ridiculous margin , so they spun open the valve and drowned an exultant audience in product .
They had an array of targets before them - the dizzying breadth of the communities they serve - and they had offerings for each that thwunked in with elven precision .
There ’s almost nothing to discuss , unless you want to talk about the ability to take three dimensional pictures of your junk , a technology which will revolutionize Craigslist Personals overnight .
Speaking of 3D , but not of Junk , the 3D thread that ran through Sony ’s presentation was bizarre .
I need to emphasize that I do n’t have any particular problem with 3D .
I have every intention of importing a 3DS .
I like three dimensional images as much as the next organism with two functioning optic nerves .
But if you want to talk about real costs , Sony ’s consumer dialogue is n’t especially robust .
The Kinect is rumored to cost a hundred and fifty dollars , and this is considered to be the equivalent of a street mugging .
To contrast , a single pair of active shutter glasses costs the same amount - every picture of a deliriously happy family enjoying 3D content is predicated on a hardware investment north of four thousand dollars .
The Move message offers a similar pirouette : Joystiq happily tells us that one may secure Playstation Move for fifty dollars , which omits the cost of the Playstation Eye , the newly christened “ navigation controller , ” and the second Move controller so many demos seem to incorporate .
What is the true cost of the experience ?
No -one seems to care , least of all Sony , who is performing lip tricks off a wave of ambiguity .
Sony ’s most fascinating maneuver was the reveal that “ the best version ” of Portal 2 “ on any console ” would be coming to the Playstation 3 .
We have n’t heard rhetoric of this kind since Epic touted the platform ’s “ openness ” in 2007 .
For people who game primarily on consoles , you might not know what it means to have Steamworks integration .
It varies depending on the implementation , it ’s sort of a la carte , and the PSN itself delivers some features by default .
But you wont be paying for DLC on Valve games , ever .
That is not a thing that will happen .
And since Microsoft wo n’t allow you to charge for something that is free on another system ( recall R6 : Vegas , or Burnout Paradise ) it ’s an end run that ’s given Valve a lot of leverage .
To sum up , Portal 2 is n’t the surprise - Steamworks is the surprise .
The porous nature of the PSN ’s functionality is an amazing opportunity for a company whose platform practically defines “ platforms . ”
Plus , there ’s no license associated with its use .
Think about what this means for other developers , up to and including first parties .
Why Sony would cede this kind of power to a third party I could n’t say , and why they would undermine the Playstation Store as a venue for premium content I could n’t tell you .
This is important ; we should be paying attention .
I would n’t know what to tell you about Kinect , either .
The ideas are all there , but they are n’t crystallized into an wide array of strong products .
The most compelling uses they showed were in terms of the Dashboard - confident , novel interactions I ’d use on a daily basis .
I know where it fits in my home , though , and I suspect that ultimately it may ; but they ’ve made a product for every person in the house but me .
( CW ) TB out .
when all the cards were close
Actually making a playable guitar is hard enough , but making it using just popsicle sticks , some glues and basic house tools seems nearly impossible .
Still , someone managed to do it .
Instructables user busupholstery managed to leave everyone speechless when he uploaded photos of the guitar he made , using posicle sticks .
He bought 4,000 of them , worth $ 900 , and ended up using 2,000 to create his DIY masterpiece .
Using his own Gremlin parlor size guitar as a pattern , he spent 240 hours gluing and cutting popsicle sticks , until his unusual guitar was completed .
The most amazing thing about this man ’s achievement is that he managed to build a popsicle stick guitar , somewhere in Costa Rica , basically using just a handsaw , some clothespins , rubber bands and glue .
Let ’s face it , most of us would n’t be able to make something like this with the latest power tools available .
And though it may not sound as good as the best guitars on the market , the popsicle stick guitar is playable .
Before you even ask , it ’s not for sale .

On January 13 , 2009 , Carol Bartz became CEO of Yahoo !
One of her first acts was to inform her staff that she would " drop - kick to fucking Mars " anyone who leaked company secrets .
Since then she 's been trying to return Yahoo !
to dominance , deliberately destroying everyone 's impression of what it actually does .
After a deal with Microsoft , Yahoo !
is transforming from a search engine to a Web portal — one that , if Bartz is right , will attract new users ( and new revenue ) by trimming unwieldy Web searches down to personalized streams of information .
She has her skeptics .
But Bartz is right a lot , and most CEOs of her caliber do n't earn their pay by luck .
Neither do cocktail waitresses , and Bartz was once one of those , too .
She knows when to give someone a " bunny dip . "
And she knows when someone needs a good drop - kicking .
My mom died when I was eight .
My grandparents took my brother and me onto their farm when I was twelve .
So for four years , between eight and twelve , I was mom , housecleaner , cook — and guess what ?
The little shit does n't get to you anymore , it just does n't matter .
One day , my brother and I were in the machine shed when we heard a rattlesnake above us .
We did n't think about running for my grandfather — we ran for Grandma .
She came , grabbed a shovel , poked the snake off the rafter , and chopped its head off .
This was a big snake .
And she said , " You could 've done that . "
It was n't like she was trying to give us some big life lesson .
She just walked away , and that 's the way it was .
I was a damn good cocktail waitress .
I talked my way into the job and I had never been in the bar .
I did n't know there were costumes .
So they 'd say , " Okay , wear this . "
I went home and for the next three days , I did about fifty hours of Jane Fonda .
Honest to God , I probably did a thousand sit-ups .
I get into this outfit , I go out , the problem was , I did n't know the drinks .
So when somebody said , " I 'll have a brandy and Seven , " I did n't know what the hell they were talking about .
I can't believe they let me keep that job .
But I went on to make wicked tips .
It did n't take much to charm people and do a little bunny dip or some damn thing .
I made a lot of money .
One night I had a trayful of drinks , and I had on black fishnet stockings and a garter , and the next thing I know I 'm like getting air .
Somebody had lifted my little skirt up .
So I go to look over and it was my high school principal .
I can't remember his name now .
I said , " Mr. — ! " and he went , " Carol ! "
And you know I did n't tolerate any of that kind of stuff and that was n't the kind of place it was , but he 's coming from this shit - bum little town and he's in the big time , Madison [ Wisconsin ] , and here comes the cocktail waitress and he 's going to show off .
My first day as a manager was at Digital Equipment in Atlanta .
I was a sales rep .
I was promoted from among my peers , so one day I was a peer and the next day I was their boss .
That first day did n't go too well , and I 'll tell you why .
Do you know what plug compatible means ?
You have a receptor that receives the plug .
Well , one of my new sales reps / peers walked in and he said , " I have no intention of working for a plug - compatible boss . "
I said , " Well , I 'm not going anywhere . "
I 'd never been a boss before , and this was five minutes after I 'd been promoted .
Jesus , if it happened today , I 'd beat the shit out of him .
I mean :
Do n't let the door hit you in the ass .
My second day at Yahoo ! , a year ago , I had my first all - hands meeting , and they 're all sitting there looking at me .
So I do a Q&A , and a hand goes up .
" Have you ever used a mobile device ? "
Have I ever used a fucking mobile device ?!
I mean , God , I was sixty !
I said , " I left my walker over there on the side , and I think I can stand here just long enough to finish this meeting . "
Cursing is part of the job .
Everybody has this funny reaction to it .
I do n't know what the big deal is .
Yahoo !
had a huge problem of all kinds of internal documents getting out to the press .
Terrible timing .
And what I was trying to explain is , all we 're doing is hurting each other .
You know we can't have a family conversation without you running and telling the neighbors ?
So I was just explaining that it was a bad thing to do , and if I found them , that 's what would happen to them .
If I found out who was leaking this , I 'd just drop - kick you to Mars .
You have to have some passion .
What am I going to say ?
" Oh , please do n't ... " ?
You think my employees would remember it ?
No .
Did I do it because of that ?
No .
I did it because at the moment I got myself all riled up .
You know , everybody thinks I do it consciously .
People actually ask me : " When are you going to drop the f- bomb ? " I say , " What do you think , put a dime in my ear and then it comes out ?
No , but get me worked up about something and who knows what 'll come out . "
I hug employees all the time .
I 'm a huge contact person .
Touch is an extremely important part of the human condition .
I also have a big thing about eye contact .
I 'll never forget President Clinton 's economic summit in Little Rock .
This was back in 1992 , when I was a newly minted CEO .
I walk into this room , see every important person I 've ever read about in the business magazines , and think , Oh , God , can I disappear ?
But then I said to myself : I know how to play this .
What 's the best way to a man 's heart ?
Big compliments .
So I walk over to Bob Crandall , the CEO of American Airlines at the time .
I say : " I 've been an admirer of yours , and it 's amazing to meet you . "
I do this with three or four people .
All they do is shake my hand while their heads are swiveling to see who else is in the room .
That had a big impact .
I thought :
You do n't do that to people .
So I have a big thing about eye contact and touching .
When I 'm with you in the moment , I 'm with you , not over there .
What do I look for when hiring ?
Well , let 's get past the assumption that they can do the job .
There has to be a no - asshole rule .
We 'll go through the whole interview , and I 'll say , " I have one last question .
I do n't work with assholes .
Are you one ? "
Some say , " What a great question !
I want to work in a place that 's like that . "
But you'd be amazed at how many others hear that question and look like they 've just been caught .
Their expressions say : I guess I 'm an asshole .
I always do my firing in the morning because that 's when I 'm fresh .
I mean , why sit there all day thinking : I 'm going to fire Joe at 4:59 ?
The joke was never have breakfast with Carol , because it 's not a real safe thing to do .
Anybody who knows me knows I do n't do breakfast .
If I 'm going to get up early in the morning to meet with somebody , there 's a reason .
Listen , you do n't want to send somebody home .
But if something is n't working , it 's not working for either side .
If you do it right , when all 's said and done , there 's amazing relief .
" Here 's why it did n't work , and my advice for you as you 're going to another job is this is a characteristic that works or does n't work , why do n't you think about that ?
And by the way , do n't do this kind of work again because you 're really not suited to it . "
Are women better listeners than men ?
I do n't know .
I mean , I 've never been one of you , so I do n't have a clue .
I think we conveniently fall into these little traps .
My husband does n't listen because his mother did n't make him listen .
What am I going to do , beat him ?
I mean : firstborn of a southern family ?
Firstborn boy ?
Please .
I mean , I love him to death , but is he going to take the garbage out ?
No .
When Sarah Palin was nominated , I was initially impressed .
I thought that speech she gave at the convention was brilliant .
To be plucked out of the wilds of Alaska and show up on that stage is not an easy task .
She had something going for her , but it just kind of fell off from there , which is a shame .
A female president matters .
Of course it matters .
I do n't know if it 'll be long .
It 'll probably be a while .
It 's gonna probably be someone right now in their forties who 's doing a good job at the state level — someone we 've never heard of .
Because I do n't know that there 's anybody on the scene now who could get the job .
When you talk about the Internet growing to 225 million sites , you 've got to ask :
Who 's parsing all that ?
How do you make sense of all that stuff ?
I mean , who has time to wander all over the Internet ?
Tomorrow's Yahoo ! is going to be really tailored .
I 'm not talking about organization — organizing means that you already know what you want and somebody 's just putting it in shape for you .
I 'm talking about both smart science and people culling through masses of information on the fly and figuring out what people want to know .
We will be delivering your interests to you .
For instance , if you 're a sports fan but have no interest in tennis , we wo n't show you tennis .
We would know that you do things in a certain sequence , so we 'd say , " Here 's your portfolio .
Here 's some news you might like .
Oh , you went to this movie last week , here 's some other movies you might want to check out . "
I call it the Internet of One .
I want it to be mine , and I do n't want to work too hard to get what I need .
In a way , I want it to be HAL .
I want it to learn about me , to be me , and cull through the massive amount of information that 's out there to find exactly what I want .
Yahoo ! has been here for fifteen years .
We are the Internet .
Unfortunately , we sit in a paradigm that values the new shiny penny .
That said , we 're very successful .
A billion three cash flow a year , and six hundred million users .
But we can be so much more , and that 's why I came here .
Apple was down for the count before Steve Jobs returned .
I 'm not trying to compare myself to Steve Jobs in any way — for good reasons and for bad reasons — but think about it .
What was the name of that computer before the Macintosh ?
Apple II .
I mean , it was going nowhere .
Everyone likes to think about iPod days , but it took Steve a long time , even knowing the company , to get it turned around after he came back .
So of course it 's been done .
It 's not my job to convince people .
It 's my job to work with this team and execute .
Three years from now , Yahoo !
is going to be the shiny new penny .

Tomorrow is the second anniversary of President Obama ’s campaign speech in Zanesville , Ohio , in which he laid out his plan for an Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships .
The speech thrilled advocates of a government partnership with faith - based groups to dispense services to the needy , but it also allayed the concerns of church - state separation advocates who had been critics of the Bush administration ’s executive orders permitting religious - based discrimination in hiring and its lack of regulation of proselytization with taxpayer dollars .
In his speech , Obama said :
First , if you get a federal grant , you ca n’t use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you ca n’t discriminate against them – or against the people you hire – on the basis of their religion .
Second , federal dollars that go directly to churches , temples , and mosques can only be used on secular programs .
Although it was n’t well - known at the time , proponents of faith - based efforts were up in arms about this part of Obama ’s speech — the part delivered from the mouth of a constitutional lawyer .
The speech came at a time during the campaign when the Obama camp was intent on peeling away those difficult - to - capture ( for Democrats ) evangelicals and Catholics .
Some evangelicals said they could n’t support the initiative ( and presumably Obama ) unless they could engage in what they call “ co- religionist hiring ” and be free to proselytize to beneficiaries .
Now , two years on , church - state separation advocates are frustrated by the Obama administration ’s inaction on these core constitutional principles — promises made on the campaign trail , although apparently recanted privately for political expediency .
The Secular Coalition for America has released a video of its executive director , Sean Faircloth , decrying the “ injustice ” of the religious hiring discrimination .
In the video Faircloth describes how World Vision , which receives hundreds of millions in federal grants , fired three employees for “ not being the right kind of Christians ” and World Relief , an arm of the National Association of Evangelicals , fired a qualified Muslim because of his religion :
World Vision ’s president , Richard Stearns , was tapped by Obama to serve on the faith - based Advisory Council , and has been an outspoken proponent of taxpayer - funded hiring discrimination .
After the Supreme Court handed down its decision this week in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez , which held that a law school could require a Christian group to adhere to its non-discrimination policy in order to achieve official campus recognition , World Vision was quick to issue a press release expressing disappointment in the outcome , but asserting that the decision would not in any way erode its ability to discriminate for religious reasons .
World Vision vowed to “ continue to vigorously defend its constitutional and statutory freedom to remain faith - based through its staffing decisions , as do other religious organizations , whether Muslim , Buddhist , Jewish or Christian . ”
Under this scheme , a recipient of faith - based aid could discriminate against an LGBT applicant or employee , or a single mother , or any person it could claim somehow did not exemplify its religious mission .
What ’s obvious here is that Obama the constitutional lawyer knew what was right , but that Obama the candidate had other priorities .
Not much has changed in terms of the administration ’s perceived need to court evangelicals , whether for electoral reasons or to cobble together a coalition to push for immigration reform , as is happening this week .
Politico reported Monday that the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference — which opposes equality for gay and lesbian people in immigration reform — sees Obama as its strongest ally in light of Democratic timidity on and Republican hostility to immigration reform .
Rodriguez , who called Obama “ our senior ally , ” promised that “ we reaffirmed our commitment to supporting him , pushing back the Republican wall that has opposed immigration reform . ”
What will be the cost of this alliance , and does Obama really need the NHCLC ?
Data based on the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey , released by Trinity College , shows that Catholics still predominate among Latinos ( 60 % ) and that the fastest growing segment of Latinos is not evangelicals , but “ nones ” ( no religion ) .
The NCHLC claims to represent 16 million born - again Latinos and over 25,000 congregations in the United States .
But the ARIS data shows only 7 million non-Catholic Latinos , representing 22 % of all Latinos ( down from 25 % in 1990 ) , while “ nones ” were “ up from less than a million or 6 % of the population in 1990 to nearly 4 million and 12 % in 2008 . ”
Might the influence of Latino evangelicals who oppose LGBT rights be overplayed ?
Source : Hillary asking foreign leaders to `dial down ' criticism of Israel
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been privately asking foreign leaders to " dial down " criticism of Israel until all the facts of the flotilla attack are known , according to a source who personally discussed the matter with her .
" She says she 's been working the phones for last 24 hours trying to get people to cool off a little bit , to see what the facts are , " the source tells me , adding that she said she was trying to " dial down some of the rhetoric of the inernational community . "
" It 's difficult , " the source adds .
" She says people are furious . "
Such calls are not unexpected , but they provide a glimpse into how awkward a position the U.S. knows it's in now that global criticism of Israel 's attack is mounting , since it 's coming at a moment when the Obama administration was hoping to do a " kiss and make up " session with Netanyahu .
Also :
The calls are a sign that the administration may be directly helping Israel by trying to lend a hand damping down the global outcry .
UPDATE , 2:22 p.m. : State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley confirms that Secretary Clinton did meet this morning with the foreign minister of Turkey to discuss yesterday 's incident .
" We certainly support an impartial investiation of what happened , " Crowley tells me .
" The Secretary and others within the government are encouraging everyone to ascertain more facts first and then determine the appropriate course of action . "

comp.lang.c FAQ list · Question 11.16
Q : Is exit( status ) truly equivalent to returning the same status from main ?
A : Yes and no .
The Standard says that a return from the initial call to main is equivalent to calling exit .
However , a return from main cannot be expected to work if data local to main might be needed during cleanup ; see also question 16.4 .
A few very old , nonconforming systems may once have had problems with one or the other form .
( Finally , the two forms are obviously not equivalent in a recursive call to main . )

During their press conference today , Konami unveiled NeverDead , an upcoming action title for 360 and PS3 that looks crazy as all hell .
Developed by Rebellion , it features a man named Bryce that can be dismembered and decapitated without any real repercussions .
It looks like parts of the game will involve hopping around on one leg , reattaching body parts , and even doing some sort of crazy breakdance attack featuring gun-shoes a la Bayonetta .
Also , the enemies have dolls all over them for some godforsaken reason .
Check out the debut trailer below .
In the June issue of Famitsu , Level 5 made the surprise announcement that Ni no Kuni , their tag team production with Studio Ghibli , will not only be a DS game , but a PS3 version is in the works .
Any of you that have been following the DS production since it was announced in 2008 know that it looks amazing , but footage from the PS3 production looks simply stunning .
PS3 Footage
DS Footage
I think it ’s safe to expect a game that mirrors Ghibli ’s animated works in it ’s kid level accessibility and parent friendly depth of character and visuals .
Look for both versions of the game to be a different experience because they are being developed independently of each other at Level 5 .
The DS game is due out late 2010 with the PS3 version due out sometime 2011 .
Oh , and Pokemon - style creature collecting !

It speaks for itself .
Marietta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
" Uh oh , " grunts Karr Doth , the half - orc ranger , as he unsheathes his swords .
" We 've got company ! "
The party peers into the darkness as the ranger charges toward our unseen foe .
Suddenly , creatures of bone and rotting flesh rush towards us -- catching nearly all unaware while in the distance , a skeletal figure bursts into flames and advances towards the group .
Yes .
We are playing Dungeons & Dragons -- but it 's a different version that the makers hope will lure back old players and bring in new ones .
First published in 1974 , Dungeons & Dragons is described on the covers of the original rule books as a " Fantastic medieval war games campaigns playable with paper and pencil and miniature figures . "
In reality , it is a way for gamers to spend hours and days with friends in a role - playing game that , more often than not , encompasses a lot of time in preparation and play .
Many of those early gamers were younger with plenty of spare time to devote to building and exploring fantasy worlds populated by goblins , elves and the occasional dragon .
Even as the game evolved into Advanced Dungeons & Dragons , the fan base changed as players grew older and were replaced by younger players eager to go adventuring .
Wizards of the Coast , the current publishers of D&D , recognized that some of the 24 million people who used to play the game left , not because they did n't want to play , but because their lifestyles changed and they did n't have the time anymore -- so they have created a new rules system to address those concerns and bring back their former fans .
The new " D&D Encounters " provides all the materials needed to run a D&D game , but in a relatively short period of time .
The goal , said brand director Liz Schuh , is to get those former gamers rolling the dice again .
" We wanted to try and create experiences to fit in their current time frames , " Schuh said .
" It is also an opportunity to learn the new rules system . "
" Encounters " has premade characters and a premade adventure provided to the game 's referee and storyteller , the Dungeon Master .
Maps , tokens , game pieces and player aids , such as bonus cards , are all included .
The adventure is spread out over 12 weeks , but it only takes about two hours to play each week 's encounter .
Mark Watkins , a Dungeon Master for the " Encounters " game at Ravens Nest store in Marietta , Georgia , said the new version is simple and timely .
" It is very easy to DM .
They give you everything , " Watkins said .
" This is really good for people to drop in and play . "
Part of the appeal for " Encounters " was to give the busy gamer the chance to play D&D once a week as their schedules allow .
In the past , D&D games could take months , even years , and players generally had to attend every session so that the story flow was n't interrupted .
With " Encounters , " players can come and go as they choose and new players can easily be integrated into the story continuity .
During the 11th session in the first " season , " called " Under Mountain , " at the Ravens Nest game two weeks ago , there were two players who had been there since the first session , two that came in during the middle sessions , and three that were there for the first time .
The game is structured so that anyone can join up with little or no preparation -- just a willingness to roll dice and have fun .
Wizards of the Coast wants to remind players that using an active imagination can be very satisfying compared to simply being fed information from a computer screen .
" Encounters " showcases the best part of a paper - and - pencil role - playing game : interactions with others and imagining a rich , wonderful world in your mind that you can escape into for even a short time .
They hope it is nostalgic fun for a bunch of old - time gamers wanting to relive the thrilling but time - intensive games they used to play .
" We realize that our older players probably do n't live near their old group and have a hard time finding a D&D game , " Arron Goolsbey , director of Wizards of the Coast 's Organized Play Programs said .
" We want to connect gamers together in a way that fits their lifestyle and time challenges these days . "
It seems to be working .
At a recent " Encounters " game at Tower Games store in Lawrenceville , Georgia , the party was made up of three guys who had played in their youth and were intrigued about getting back into the game in a way that did n't interfere with family or work .
Store owner Andrew Phillips said the response has been overwhelming .
" There are a lot of people wanting to play , " Phillips said .
" We even have some father / son and father / daughter players who are coming in . "
The DM , who goes by " Augie , " has a son , Alex , who plays " Encounters " and a father and son team that also plays in his game .
He said it is good to see the kids learning the game and the new program makes it easy .
" The new version ( Fourth Edition Rules ) is about teamwork , " explained Augie , who said he has been playing D&D since 1979 .
" I can whip up an Encounter in no time and players can be playing in about five minutes .
In some ways , it plays out like a board game . "
The new rules make the game faster and easier to run , said Schuh .
She said it is also very flexible , so that players can use the premade characters or make up one of their own .
" We wanted to give them enough of a sandbox to play in , " she said .
" DMs and players can do whatever they want . "
The new rules also enable people who know nothing about the new rules -- or maybe nothing about D&D at all -- to play and learn from D&D veteran adventurers .
At a recent " Encounter " session , Watkins explained the new powers and effects to new players offered tips on game strategy .
" Combat is more fun and more dynamic , " Watkins said as he directed a flaming skeleton to throw fireballs at the party .
The excitement and gasps around the table is proof that players are quickly getting emotionally involved in the game .
And they 're just getting started .
While they did n't have hard numbers , Schuh and Goolsbey said they have had reports of tens of thousands of gamers around the world participating in " Encounters . "
And Wizards has made it easy to find a game near you .
Their website provides store locacations running the program , a character generator if you want to create your own , reviews of previous encounters so you can catch up on the story and even gaming podcasts from webcomic giant Penny Arcade and the writers of the Cartoon Network show " Robot Chicken . "
In an attempt to appeal to tech - savvy players , the game manufacturer offers bonuses via its Twitter account and an online subscription service to offer information on adventure building , character upgrades and more .
With a new season beginning on June 9 -- the " Dark Sun " adventures -- they have two words for anyone who is interested in D&D -- just go .
" You 'll be handed a character and you 'll get help , " Schuh said .
" There is a palpable , emotional response to playing the game with friends .
Even new friends . "

Another 3 Australian badged killers have died in Afghanistan .
That makes 5 in the last 2 weeks .
Why are we there ?
It ca n’t be to defend democracy .
Karzai rigged the Presidential vote .
It ca n’t be to stop the warlords .
They are the Government .
It ca n’t be to liberate women .
The current male power structures in Afghanistan , propped up by the US , imprison women as women – apart from a few female schools set up for western TV viewers .
It ca n’t be to fight terrorism .
We are the terrorists , invading their country , killing tens of thousands of civilians and creating millions of refugees .
We are exporting our terrorism to Pakistan .
It is for the Afghan people to decide their future , not foreign invaders .
In fact the brutal Western invasion has strengthened the Taliban who will regain control at some stage .
Everything you hear from our leaders about Afghanistan is a Vietnam lie .
We are not winning .
We are not bringing democracy , or liberating women or fighting terrorism .
Australia is in Afghanistan to support the United States , our imperialist protector .
This is not because our political and economic elite are toadies of the Americans .
It is in the interests of our capitalist class to have troops in Afghanistan to protect their interests .
Australian capitalism is expansionist .
It controls the Pacific and wants to expand that control into South East Asia .
It also fears that Chinese imperialism may eventually challenge its dominant position in the region .
So our ruling class aligns itself with the dominant economic and military power to protect its own interests .
Australia ’s history is the history of militarism – first against the indigenous population and then in conjunction with Britain and the US against indigenous peoples around the world .
We went into the two imperialist conflagrations last century as a consequence of a calculated analysis that concluded it was in the interests of the Australian capitalist class to do so .
The ANZUS treaty is our expansionist ticket and insurance policy .
Australia ’s trained killers are dying in Afghanistan for a piece of paper and the voracious appetite of Australian capitalism to expand beyond its borders under the protection of a great power .
The US is in Afghanistan to contain its main imperialist competitor , China .
As China ’s economic power grows and that of the US stabilises or falls , the Americans are relying more and more on their overwhelming military strength – their defence spending is as much as the next 16 countries combined – to protect and expand their economic interests , and that of their oligarchic multinational corporations .
This of necessity means constraining China .
The war in Iraq and the propping up of the expanding and genocidal American ally Israel , the threats to Iran , along with a range of pro-US dictators , make American control of the Middle East and future oil supplies to China a reality .
Our trained killers are dying in Afghanistan for a protection racket and insurance policy with the US .
Bring the troops home .
Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Steven Mosher has pointed out a Science Magazine article ( subscription only ) about Antarctica .
It is a discussion of the temperature changes in the West Antarctic Peninsula ( WAP ) .
And where might that be ?
Figure 1 . Location of the West Antarctic Peninsula .
Yellow push - pin markers show the location of temperature stations .
Yellow outline shows the enclosing area used for temperature calculations .
This is the smallest area using 5°x5° gridcells that contains all of the WAP temperature stations .
The Science Magazine article contains the following statement about the WAP , which set my bad number alarm bells ringing :
Physical Changes in the WAP Changes in the WAP are profound .
Mid -winter surface atmospheric temperatures have increased by 6 °C ( more than five times the global average ) in the past 50 years ( 14 , 15 ) .
I had never looked closely at the WAP temperatures .
However , that seemed way high for the changes in the WAP air temperature , no matter what month we are talking about .
The references for that statement are :
14 . P. Skvarca , W. Rack , H. Rott , T. I. Donángelo , Polar Res. 18 , 151 ( 1999 ) .
15 . D. G. Vaughan et al. , Clim . Change 60 , 243 ( 2003 ) .
I could n’t find a copy of either of those on the web … so I did what I always do .
I went to get the data , to see what is happening .
Initially , the situation looks good .
There are thirty stations on the peninsula .
Figure 2 shows the location of some of these stations :
Figure 2 . Location of the temperature stations in the WAP
So , what ’s the problem ?
As you might imagine , many of these stations are only occupied part of the year .
Others have been occupied intermittently , or have closed entirely .
As a result , we do n’t have anywhere near the coverage that thirty stations would imply .
Here ’s a graphic showing the dates of coverage for each of the thirty stations :
Figure 3 . Dates of coverage for each of the thirty stations in the WAP .
Only a half dozen or so show coverage over most of the last fifty years
Things are not as good as they seemed .
Some of the datasets ony cover a few years .
Others are longer , but very spotty .
However , as they say , “ Needs must when the devil drives ” .
Here is what all of the different stations look like :
Figure 4 . Plot of all stations on the West Antarctic Peninsula .
You can see the difficulty in determining an average temperature change over the area .
Some stations swing quite widely , while others show much less variation .
Are the winters warming ?
Well … obviously , it depends on exactly which datasets you use to create your area average .
Do we include the spotty orange dataset that starts about 1986 , or not ?
What about the blue datasets that only exist for the sixties and seventies ?
Based on these decisions , our answers will be different .
Next I looked at the major datasets .
As you know , there are several temperature datasets that cover the globe .
For the land alone , we have the CRUTEM3 , GISS 250 km , and GISS 1200 km land datasets .
The two GISS datasets use the same surface stations .
However , they differ in that they extrapolate the temperature of empty gridcells using all relevant stations within either a 250 km or a 1,200 km radius respectively .
All of these are available at KNMI , which is an outstanding resource .
Here are the month - by - month trends for each of those datasets :
Figure 5 . Month - by - month and annual ( “ Ann ” ) trends for the air temperatures ( land only ) for the area of the West Antarctic Peninsula outlined in yellow in Figure 1 .
There are several interesting things about this graph .
First , a simple average of all of the stations ( “ All Station Average ” ) gives results that are broadly similar to the CRUTEM results .
I assume that this is because of the general similarity in the climate zones of the 30 temperature stations around the peninsula , which allows for a direct average rather than the more sophisticated methods ( anomalies or first differences ) as used in the global datasets .
Next , in several months there is a difference of a full degree ( per fifty years ) in the trends of the CRUTEM and the GISS datasets .
The various datasets are often claimed to be in good agreement .
But this is only globally .
When we get down to a gridcell - by - gridcell and month - by - month comparison of the trends , they are often quite different .
Since they are ( presumably ) using the same basic data ( the 30 land stations ) , this is odd .
Note that the annual trends are in reasonable agreement , but the monthly trends differ … why should that be ?
The effects of the GISS algorithm for filling in the empty gridcells are also curious .
Depending on the extrapolation radius chosen ( 250 km or 1,200 km ) they differ by up to a half a degree in fifty years .
Finally , none of the datasets show a temperature rise of 6 °C in fifty years in any month , as the Science paper claims .
My bad number alarm was accurate .
So I ’m in mystery about where that claim might come from .
August has the highest trends , at three to four degrees depending on the dataset chosen .
But that ’s a long way from six degrees .
Now , it is often said that the warming of the Peninsula is due to warming of the surrounding ocean .
So I decided to take a look at that as well .
Here are the same datasets , showing both the land and the ocean :
Figure 6 . Land and ocean temperature trends for the area outlined in yellow in Fig.1
Here , the differences between the datasets are larger .
For the first five months of the year the CRUTEM +HADSST dataset shows a much smaller trend than GISS , up to a a degree and three quarters smaller .
The rest of the year , the datasets are much closer than in the first five months .
Why would they be different in part of the year , and not the rest of the year ?
In addition , this dataset makes it unlikely that the ocean is driving the warming .
The trends including the ocean are almost all either the same or smaller than the land - only trends .
This is particularly true of the CRUTEM vs CRUTEM +HADSST datasets .
Finally , I took a look at a shorter period , from 1979 to 2009 , so that I could compare trends from the ground - based datasets with the UAH MSU satellite based dataset .
Here is that data :
Figure 7 . Ground and satellite data compared for the area outlined in yellow in Fig.
1 . Note that these are thirty year trends rather than fifty year trends , as shown in the other figures .
Here , things get markedly odd .
The satellite data shows cooling in about half the months .
The overall annual satellite trend is … zero .
Go figure .
We see much greater differences between the ground based sets .
The GISS peak warming is no longer in August , but in May .
None of this makes a whole lot of sense … but there it is .
Final conclusions ?
First , once again some mainstream climate scientists are exaggerating .
There is no dataset in which we see a WAP air temperature rise of 6 °C in fifty years as claimed in the Science paper .
Second , although it is widely claimed that there is good agreement between the various ground based datasets , as well as between the ground and satellite data , in this case we see that they are all quite different .
Not only the amplitude , but in many cases the sign of the trend is different between ground and satellite data .
The CRU / Hadley dataset varies from the GISS datasets .
In all , there is not a whole lot of agreement between any pair of datasets .
All of which makes it very difficult to come to any conclusions at all … except one .
My only real conclusion is that it would be nice if we could get some agreement about one of the most basic data operations in the climate science field , the calculation of area averages of temperatures from the station data , before we start disputing about the larger issues .

They are supposed to help states and cities that are short of cash build roads , schools and bridges .
But Build America Bonds , part of President Obama ’s economic stimulus plan , are also building something else : controversy .
States and cities have embraced these taxable bonds to borrow money at what they assume are favorable interest rates .
The federal government pays 35 percent of the interest costs on the bonds , a huge potential saving .
But questions about this multibillion - dollar program are piling up .
For one , Wall Street banks are charging larger commissions for selling Build America Bonds than they do for normal municipal bonds , increasing the costs to the states and cities .
For another , the new bonds may be priced too cheaply , enabling quick - footed investors to turn a fast profit as the prices climb , but raising interest costs for taxpayers .
HUD Grantees Must Be LGBT Compliant
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Monday that it will now require grant applicants seeking HUD funding to comply with state and local antidiscrimination laws that protect lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender individuals .
" We 're using every avenue to shut the door against discrimination , " HUD secretary Shaun Donovan said in a statement .
" Today , we take an important step to insist that those who seek federal funding must demonstrate that they are meeting local and state civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity . "
An estimated 20 states and the District of Columbia currently prohibit discriminating against people in housing on the basis of their sexual orientation , and 12 states plus the District of Columbia have the same prohibition on gender identity discrimination , according to a release from HUD .
HUD spokesperson Brian Sullivan said the department had " limited authority " as it specifically relates to LGBT people since cities and states do not have uniformed policies and no federal law protects LGBT people against discriminatory housing
practices .
" We can't be making law , but we went as far as we could , " he said .
Sullivan added that the adjustment was not a regulatory change but instead an administrative requirement .
Traditionally , HUD has required all applicants for competitive grant funding to comply with all applicable federal fair housing and civil rights requirements including those expressed in Fair Housing Act ; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act .
The department has been taking a series of steps to make several aspects of housing fairer across the board for LGBT people .
In addition to the notice published today , HUD intends to propose new regulations that will clarify that the term " family , " as used to describe eligible beneficiaries of HUD 's programs , includes otherwise eligible LGBT individuals and couples .
Sullivan said HUD was " in the process of developing " this new rule but he declined to estimate when the change might be completed .
The department 's proposed regulations will clarify family status to ensure that its core housing programs are available to all families , regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity .
Authorities at the Federal Housing Administration also intend to instruct lenders that FHA - insured mortgage loans must be based on the creditworthiness of borrowers and not on unrelated factors or characteristics such as sexual orientation or gender identity .
Finally , HUD will commission the first national study of discrimination against LGBT people in the rental and sale of housing .
The department is currently seeking online public comment from interested parties in how it might design this new study .
Sullivan said the study itself would be " groundbreaking " but that they did not yet know how the information would be utilized once it 's collected .
" We are very intent on building a body of evidence and seeing where that leads us , " he said .

US commander recalled from Afghanistan after mocking Obama
By Bill Van Auken
23 June 2010
Following the appearance of an article in which he and his aides disparaged President Barack Obama and other top civilian officials , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the US commander in Afghanistan , has been ordered to return to Washington for a White House meeting with the Obama administration ’s security team .
According to administration and Pentagon sources , McChrystal will be asked to explain his remarks to Obama and other officials during the meeting , which convenes Wednesday in the White House situation room .
The controversy has erupted over an article , entitled “ Runaway General , ” which appears in an issue of Rolling Stone magazine that hits newsstands Friday .
Among the remarks attributed directly to McChrystal , perhaps the most damaging is his charge that Karl Eikenberry , the US ambassador to Afghanistan , who was himself previously the top American military commander in the country , had “ betrayed ” him .
Eikenberry had reportedly opposed the counterinsurgency strategy with which McChrystal is identified .
The US ambassador stressed in a cable to Washington last fall that the corrupt regime of President Hamid Karzai in Kabul was “ not an adequate strategic partner ” for a major US military escalation aimed at clearing the country of insurgents , securing the cities and countryside and turning the areas over to the existing government .
“ We will become more deeply engaged here with no way to extricate ourselves , ” Eikenberry warned .
In the interview with Rolling Stone , McChrystal is quoted as saying that Eikenberry ’s aim in sending the cable was to “ cover his flank for the history books , ” allowing him to say , “ I told you so ” after a defeat of the US military .
Other statements made by the US commander expressed the continuing tensions over the divisions that surfaced in the debate within the administration last fall over Afghan strategy .
Asked by Rolling Stone ’s reporter Michael Hastings for his opinion about the position taken by Vice President Joe Biden during that debate , McChrystal responded , “ Are you asking about Vice President Biden ?
Who ’s that ? ”
An aide sitting in on the interview piped in with , “ Did he say bite me ? ”
Biden had opposed the counterinsurgency strategy , proposing instead a counterterrorism approach that would include increased use of Predator drones and special forces killing squads to target insurgents on both sides of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , while training Afghan puppet forces to fight the Taliban .
In open contempt of civilian control of the military , a bedrock constitutional principle , McChrystal publicly opposed Biden ’s proposal and campaigned for his own plan for deploying tens of thousands more US soldiers and Marines in the country .
Speaking before an audience at a London think tank last fall , he derided Biden ’s strategy as “ short - sighted ” and a recipe for “ Chaos- istan . ”
While Obama formally upbraided the general for his remarks during a brief meeting aboard Air Force One , there were no consequences .
And his strategy carried the day , with Obama ’s decision last December to send another 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan .
The escalation was joined with a sharp increase in drone attacks on Pakistan and a meaningless pledge to begin withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan in July of next year .
Among the remarks attributed to McChrystal ’s aides was one open denunciation of Obama .
Commenting on the general ’s first meeting with the president , the aide said that Obama “ clearly did n’t know anything about him , who he was .
Here ’s the guy who ’s going to run his f--- ing war , but he did n’t seem very engaged .
The Boss was pretty disappointed . ”
Another aide quoted McChrystal as describing Obama ’s special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke as “ dangerous , ” like a “ wounded animal ” because of supposed rumors he may be fired .
In the presence of the reporter , the general made no attempt to conceal his contempt for the presidential envoy .
Receiving an email from him , McChrystal remarked , “ Oh , not another e-mail from Holbrooke .
I do n’t even want to open it . ”
Aides described White House National Security Adviser James Jones as “ a clown ” and derided leading US politicians , including Senators John Kerry ( Democrat , Massachusetts ) and John McCain ( Republican , Arizona ) .
While some media commentators initially tried to deflect criticism of McChrystal by suggesting he was misquoted or thought he was speaking on background or off the record , Rolling Stone ’s editor , Eric Bates , stated Tuesday that the general had been allowed to review the piece before it was published and voiced no objections to its content .
One telling comment that appeared in several articles covering the affair is the observation that the Rolling Stone freelance reporter was far more likely to accurately report McChrystal ’s disparaging remarks about civilian authority than someone assigned to cover the military in Afghanistan , who would be afraid of earning the general ’s wrath and being denied access .
The clear implication is that the remarks made in front of Hastings are likely mild by comparison with what the US commander and his aides say in front of those “ embedded ” members of the media they trust to withhold such information from the American people .
On Tuesday , when the uproar began after advance copies of articles were provided to the media , US - led forces suffered 10 fatalities , the second time that single - day casualties have risen to that level this month .
The total number of US troops killed since the beginning of the war has risen to 1128 , while the total number of fatalities for all US and NATO - led forces has hit 1854 , according to iCasualties.org , which compiles casualty reports .
Meanwhile , the US military command has been compelled to postpone the offensive against the city of Kandahar , Afghanistan ’s second largest city and a stronghold for insurgents resisting US occupation , because of setbacks in the area .
At the same time , McChrystal was compelled to acknowledge that the recent offensive carried out by US troops in the largely rural Marjah district of Helmand province had failed to dislodge the Taliban and had turned the area into a “ bleeding ulcer . ”
The corrupt puppet regime of President Hamid Karzai , fearing an American defeat , has increasingly distanced itself from US objectives , reportedly opening up independent negotiations with the Taliban .
It is in this context that the bitter remarks attributed to McChrystal and his aides in the Rolling Stone article take on their real significance .
They are part of the recriminations within the military and the Obama administration over the failed policy in Afghanistan as leading personnel seek to blame each other for this evident debacle after nearly nine years of war .
There is another , more ominous , side of the controversy , however .
The remarks of McChrystal and his aides are indicative of the open contempt with which large sections of the US military command regard the civilian government and the bedrock constitutional principle of civilian control over the military .
Sections of the media have compared the present controversy over McChrystal to the showdown between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War .
While no doubt both cases involve a challenge to civilian control , the differences are striking .
MacArthur openly challenged Truman ’s policy in Korea , demanding authority to use nuclear weapons and openly appealing to the Republicans in Congress for support .
In the present situation , Obama ’s policy in Afghanistan has been largely dictated by McChrystal .
Anxious over potential accusations from the Republicans that he is insufficiently resolute as a “ commander - in- chief , ” the Democratic president has surrendered even greater power to the military .
What action Obama will take — if any — in response to McChrystal ’s statements is unclear .
The general himself issued a public apology , acknowledging “ poor judgment ” and stating that his behavior fell short of the “ principles of personal honor and professional integrity ” that he espouses .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs Tuesday described Obama as “ angry ” over the interview , calling it “ an enormous mistake in judgment . ”
Asked if the president would fire the general , Gibbs replied , “ All options are on the table . ”
Firing McChrystal would no doubt provoke a storm of criticism from the Republican right and renewed charges that Obama is insufficiently supportive of the military .
The most likely reaction of the White House to such attacks would be a further turn to the right and increased militarism .
Leaving the general in place , however , would constitute a public admission by Obama of his administration ’s subservience to the military brass .
Whatever McChrystal ’s fate , the incident has once again exposed the political power and assertiveness of the military , which , together with the intelligence apparatus , increasingly dominates the American state .

Benin – World ’s 1st Cannabis Sativa ( Marijuana ) Coin –
The coin just issued by authority of the Government of the West African Republic of Benin is bound to create quite a stir among collectors and non-collectors alike .
As the first in a series of “ Famous Plants of the World ” , the 100 Central African Franc denominated Legal Tender coin features Cannabis Sativa , colloquially known as Marijuana , Pot , Mary Jane , Weed , Grass , etc .
The coin has been struck from a 27 gram copper - nickel planchet , 38.61 millimeters in diameter that is subsequently silver - plated .
The reverse features a bright green Cannabis Sativa leaf that when rubbed ( HORRORS !!!! ) , and releases the distinct aroma of Marijuana , although I have been assured that the aroma comes from a synthetic additive and not from the plant itself .
This process can be repeated approximately forty times before the smell disappears .
Total mintage for this coin is limited to 2,500 pieces and if early indications are correct , this coin is destined to become an instant classic , appealing to both coin collectors as well multitudes of flower children and rock band followers from the sixties and seventies .

As far as 6 - 0 games go , this one was close .
Everything that had gone right for the Canadiens over the last several games went wrong tonight .
Jaroslav Halak could n't make a save .
The forwards could n't capitalize on their chances .
The defenders could n't clear the front of the net .
The whole team could n't stay out of the box .
In so many ways , it was a game to forget .
And yet , penalties aside , the Canadiens had played a good first period , outshooting and outchancing Philadelphia .
The Flyers fielded a lot of post - game questions that suggested the game was easy but each and every time the answer was sincerely critical of their own game ..
Peter Laviolette , Chris Pronger , Daniel Briere and on down the line all saying that they needed to be better than they were in the first period and that the game could 've been very different with a bounce the other way .
I do n't know if it matters a whole lot but when I hear the Flyers speak about the Canadiens , they seem like the first team to think that the Canadiens could really beat them on merit .
Humility from the Flyers .
Who would 've thunk it ?
Scoring chances and more after the jump .
Scoring Chances
For those who'd like a definition : a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
And , of course , a big thanks to Vic Ferrari for making the whole damn thing possible with his awesome script .
As some of you may already know , Olivier ( En Attendant Les Nordiques ) has been counting scoring chances for the Canadiens all season and has continued doing so throughout the playoffs .
With both Olivier and I counting scoring chances for this series , we should get a pretty good look at whether or not these counts are consistent between observers .
In this game , I scored 33 chances , Olivier scored 27 and we had 26 chances in common .
Thanks to the aforementioned Vic Ferrari , I can run something called Cohen 's Kappa Test to see the degree of our agreement .
According to Vic 's test , our two lists of results have a correlation of 0.78 which is a pretty good level of agreement .
My " unique " chances were as follows :
Phi - 1st - 14:48
Phi - 1st - 8:17
Mtl - 1st - 6:41
Mtl - 1st - 0:50
Phi - 2nd - 19:31
Phi - 2nd - 10:45
Phi - 3rd - 5:20
Olivier 's unique chance was :
Phi - 1st - 7:50
Back to the game itself , the game was actually very close at even strength with Montreal having the advantage after the first period .
The big difference in terms of chances came on special teams , where Philadelphia scored two of its first four goals ( and a third just after a penalty ended ) to put the game out of reach .
Although the Canadiens probably feel that they can do a better job of penalty killing , the fact is , they spent over ten minutes of the game killing penalties and of the six minor penalties they took , several were of the boneheaded variety .
Jaroslav Halak also struggled on the penalty kill , allowing a couple of goals from outside the faceoff dots ( Briere and Gagne with the third and fourth goals of the night ) before getting pulled .
Better goaltending and more disciplined play should cure most of what hurt the Canadiens defensively .
Montreal 's line of Cammalleri , Kostitsyn and Plekanec was by far their most effective on the night getting several of Montreal 's best chances against Philadelphia 's top pairing of Pronger and Carle .
If they can be that effective throughout the series , the Canadiens actually have a pretty good chance of winning .
They 'll need their goalie to be better of course and they 'll need more from Gomez and Gionta as well , but having their top unit winning the battle at even strength is significant .
Sons of Light
3. Michael Leighton -
He did n't allow a goal !
There is n't a whole lot more to say , though I will say that the did n't need to make too many marvelous saves .
Even the scoring chances I 've noted were n't generally of the most dangerous variety .
But credit where it 's due , Leighton stopped every single one and was a big contributor to the win .
2. Kimmo Timonen -
His partner , Braydon Coburn , scored the first goal of the game but Timonen also played a significant role on an effective Flyers power play .
That duo was also charged with taking on Scott Gomez and Brian Gionta with surprisingly ( in my view ) good results .
Both Gionta and Gomez are very good hockey players at even strength and that pairing did a great job of preventing them from getting a sniff in the offensive zone .
Gomez had his best chance of the game in the first period when Timonen was riding pine .
Timonen also led the team in SH TOI with 4:35 .
1. Claude Giroux -
I thought he and linemate James Van Riemsdyk were both fantastic , though I liked Giroux a bit more .
In addition to leading his team in chance differential , he also led them in the faceoff circle , winning nine of his fourteen draws .
The most influential of those came early in the second period when he pushed the puck forward for Van Riemsdyk who put the puck in the net to give the Flyers a 2 - 0 edge .
Giroux 's goal to put the Flyers ahead 6 - 0 was a nice reward for a game well played .
Sons of Darkness
3. P.K. Subban - I have n't seen much of this player but he was n't very impressive on this night .
He was on the ice for four of the Philadlephia goals , including the first three when the result was still in doubt .
On the first goal Ville Leino made him look like an absolute fool as Subban laid down to block a shot only to see Leino dance around him to the front of the net to get a shot which led to a rebound goal .
On the second goal , it was Giroux 's turn to let Subban play the role of Washington General by pushing the puck forward to himself and then passing right through Subban to an open Van Riemsdyk in front of the net .
Bad , bad mistakes .
2. Jaroslav Halak -
After getting it done so many nights in a row Halak really did n't give his team much chance in this one .
Two of the four goals came from just outside the dots and those need to be stopped .
He 's been very good for much of the playoffs but has been mixing in the occasional stinker .
The Canadiens had better hope they remain very occasional .
1. Scott Gomez - Penalties .
His first one was just plain dumb ( punching a guy from behind as he skates to the bench ) and it cost the Canadiens a goal .
His second penalty was similarly stupid ( a retaliatory slash ) , though this time Gomez was able to get out of the box before Philly scored .
The penalties aside , Gomez was n't particularly effective against at even strength which is where the Canadiens need him most .
He may not have been the absolute worst player on the ice , but he was definitely the most underwhelming given my expectations .
The FDIC which technically supports the nation ’s banking system is for all practical purposes insolvent .
I ’m not sure the magnitude of this problem has sunk into the psyche of the American public .
The FDIC insures accounts at banks that include checking , saving , and CD accounts from a bank failure .
This has occurred with regular frequency since the recession started 29 long months ago .
Some 247 banks have failed since 2008 with a total asset base of $ 616 billion .
The government has tried to calm the unsettled waters by raising the regular deposit coverage from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 even though the FDIC deposit insurance fund is in the negative .
This seems to have calmed the nerves of people since the days of long lines at IndyMac Bank in California but nothing has really changed at least at the core of the financial system .
To the contrary things have worsened for the banking system .
The list of troubled banks continues to grow :
Source : Fortune , FDIC
This chart tells us that we should be gearing up for another round of bank failures .
The increase of deposit insurance from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 is largely a charade .
1 out of 3 Americans have absolutely no savings whatsoever .
We have 17 percent unemployed or underemployed and another 20 to 25 percent working in the low paying service sector .
Nearly 50 percent of Americans have nowhere close to $ 100,000 in liquid assets to insure , so increasing the insurance to $ 250,000 is merely a public relations move to show strength .
The current amount of assets at troubled banks is over $ 400 billion but since the FDIC does n’t list all troubled banks this is much larger :
Source : FDIC
Now the above survey only goes up to the end of 2009 .
Since the start of the year another 82 banks have failed and the FDIC is probably at some undisclosed location somewhere in the United States right now getting ready to close another few banks since Fridays have become synonymous with bank closings .
The list of troubled banks increasing is a reflection of the massive amount of troubled loans .
These loans would n’t be in such deep trouble if the economy was healthy and Americans were servicing their loans .
But the middle class is n’t really participating in this shadow recovery .
A recent survey by none other than the FDIC shows that a good portion of Americans do n’t even participate in the banking system :
“ A substantial percentage of lower - income households are unbanked .
Nearly 20 percent of lower income U.S. households — almost 7 million households earning below $ 30,000 per year — do not currently have a bank account .
Households with earnings below $ 30,000 account for at least 71 percent of unbanked households .
Not having enough money to feel they need an account is the most common reason why unbanked households are not participating in the mainstream financial system . ”
Do these people care that accounts are insured up to $ 250,000 ?
Who are we really protecting here ?
You also need to ask how we are going to pay for all these additional bank failures if the deposit insurance fund is already in the negative .
That is where the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury step in with more of your taxpayer money .
The Federal Reserve attempts to paint this image as a government agency but they are not .
They serve the purpose to protect the banking system .
Even the Fed website gives us a nice little history on this :
“ ( Fed history ) From December 1912 to December 1913 , the Glass - Willis proposal was hotly debated , molded and reshaped .
By December 23 , 1913 , when President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law , it stood as a classic example of compromise — a decentralized central bank that balanced the competing interests of private banks and populist sentiment . ”
There is much more back history to this but suffice it to say that this move helped consolidate the power of banks into a few hands instead of having many more banks competing for your business .
Keep in mind when this past , the public was heavily against it just like the public was against TARP when this crisis rolled around .
Yet the Fed listens to their big banks and protects them at all costs even if it means robbing the public blind ( a sort of reverse Robin Hood ) .
In the end after nearly 100 years of the Federal Reserve , the main purpose is nearly accomplished :
“ The top 4 banks of Bank of America , JP Morgan Chase , Wells Fargo , and Citibank make up 55 percent of all banking assets . ”
And banking assets across the country are enormous .
The FDIC backs 8,000 banks that carry over $ 13 trillion in assets .
These big four banks have their hands in over 50 percent of this amount .
Who controls the wealth in this country controls the levers of political power .
The way the system is currently setup we find that the banks have an incredible amount of power .
Actually , it is the biggest banks that have the big power since they are fine with hundreds of little bank failures since that opens up the market for bigger banks to step in and open up shop .
Smaller banks do n’t have access to the easy money Federal Reserve window and certainly did not get handouts like many of the biggest banks did .
Foreclosures remain at record levels and this means banks are facing more and more loans that enter into default .
This costs money .
As we have mentioned , the FDIC is insolvent so where is this money coming from ?
“ ( US Banker ) Treasury likes it , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. likes it , and the banking industry likes it — that is , S. 541 , introduced last week by Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . )
The bill would permanently increase the FDIC ’s ability to borrow from the Treasury for its Deposit Insurance Fund , raising the cap to $ 100 billion from $ 30 billion , the limit set back in 1991 .
The Depositor Protection
Act would also temporarily allow the FDIC to borrow up to $ 500 billion after consultations with Treasury , the Federal Reserve , and the President .
FDIC chairman Sheila Bair voiced enthusiasm in a letter to Dodd , noting “ the FDIC believes it is prudent to adjust the statutory line of credit proportionally to leave no doubt that the FDIC can immediately access the necessary resources to resolve failing banks and provide timely protection to insured depositors . ”
Passage of the increased borrowing ability “ would give the FDIC flexibility to reduce the size of the recent special assessment , while still maintaining assessments at a level that supports the DIF with industry funding . ”
And there you have it .
I am certain that the banks are spending large amounts of money creating a way to couch this additional bailout as a helping hand for middle class Americans but in the end if we do n’t change the system , the money will flow through the same rivers as of those from the last decade .
With so many bank failures lined up because of horrible commercial real estate and residential loans , we can expect to bailout indirectly failed casinos in Las Vegas and owning shopping malls in random parts of the country .
The FDIC is flashing code red and they are lining up with hat in hand for taxpayer money .
If after 29 months you still have n’t gotten it , this money is likely to funnel up to the top 1 percent in an incredibly unbalanced fashioned .

I ’ve put childish fears behind me .
I look at my fellow passengers .
Almost everyone ’s Hispanic .
Espanol is the lingua franca of el autobus .
Some people are sleeping .
Others are chattering into their cell phones .
No one seems excited about going into The City .
I wonder if suburbanites riding the bus to jobs in Paris feel the same way .
I guess if you ’ve seen one naked city you ’ve seen them all .
The heavy man sitting next to me smells like garlic and onions .
Fast asleep , cheek pressed flat against the window , a dribble of saliva works out of his mouth and jitters down the glass in synchronous rhythm with the tires bouncing on the pavement .
Across from me a young man with a peach fuzz mustache clutches a backpack tightly .
He ca n’t be more than nineteen .
Maybe he ’s thinking about some girl .
Maybe he ’s thinking about the ten pounds of plastic explosives he ’s got in the bag .
I check and see if he ’s got wires or a detonator peeking out of his sleeve .
I sniff the air for rosewater .
I read somewhere that terrorists bathe in rosewater before setting out on their one way trips .
Then again I used wait on a regular customer who reeked of the stuff .
She never blew the restaurant up .
The drivers radio squawks reassuringly .
The calm measured voice of officialdom seeps through the speakers and floats past my ears .
I read the sign saying undercover police officers might be riding on the bus .
I wonder what I ’d do if young man with the peach fuzz mustache got up and started praying to Allah .
Would I tackle him ?
Jump over the fat guy and dive out the window ?
Pray there really was a cop on board ?
I ’d hate the words “ blown up in the Lincoln Tunnel ” to be in my obituary .
Suddenly I realize I prefer the fears of my childhood .
Peach Fuzz is not a terrorist .
I ’ve read too many spy novels .
I have an overactive imagination .
But I ca n’t get the vision of the London bombings out of my head – the twisted charred metal , people ’s shoes lying everywhere .
That ’s the problem with having a well developed imagination .
If you can think of beautiful things you can think of terrible things .
Ninety - seven feet under the river we cross the line separating New Jersey and New York .
I look out the opposite window and stare at the thin metal catwalk hugging the left side of the tunnel .
When I was a kid I used to look for the maintenance workers zipping alongside in their little electric cars .
If the tunnel sprang a leak they would rescue me .
I ’m still looking for them thirty years later .
We approach the end of the tunnel .
I suddenly remember Hitchcock ’s sly cinematic move in the last scene of North by Northwest , where he used the imagery of a train powering into a dark tunnel to represent what Cary Grant was doing to Eva Marie Saint .
If going into a tunnel represents sex what does coming out of one mean ?
Birth ?
If it does I ’m coming into the world smelling like garlic and onions .
The bus breaches into the dull light of a late December afternoon .
I look down into the cars racing below us .
One guy ’s arguing on his cell phone while another driver applies her lipstick .
I ’d rather chance terrorists and public transportation than drive with those people .
The bus angles upwards as we hit the ramp heading into the Port Authority Terminal .
As we start climbing above the streets I look at the windows of the apartment buildings close by .
Each window is somebody ’s home .
Each window is people talking and hating , crying and laughing .
Each window is awe and possibility .
Each window is sex and loneliness .
Each window is gentleness and light .
Each window is the Power and the Glory .
As the bus corkscrews towards the sky there ’s a gap in between the roadways , revealing the streets below .
As if peering through the asphalt and steel iris of a concrete god , I see a modest coffee shop squatting on a busy corner .
On the other side of its plate glass window a waitress drops a check at a booth .
She has dark hair and might be pretty .
I wonder how long she ’s been working there .
I wonder if she ’s scared of growing old and lonely .
I wonder what she dreams about at night .
Before I can wonder anymore the god ’s eye closes and the waitress is gone .
The bus pulls into the terminal .
The kid with the peach fuzz mustache jumps out of his seat before the bus comes to a stop .
He wants to get off first .
I guess he ’s not blowing anybody up .
The fat man next to me wakes up and peels his cheek off the window .
I disembark , go down escalators and stairs , and head towards the 42nd Street exit .
Three young women are walking in front of me , pulling suitcases on rollers .
They look like college students from Minnesota .
Unlike the passengers on my bus theyre excited about being in New York .
“ Oh my God ! ” one of the girls squeals .
“ I ’ve never been so excited and scared in my entire life ! ”
I smile to myself .
It must be wonderful to see New York for the first time .
I watch as the girls step onto the street and do what every tourist does when they first gaze upon Gotham , look up .
Standing together on the sidewalk , the immensity of New York City breaks over us like a neon tsunami .
Even though I ’ve lived around the bright lights of the big city since I was a boy , I find myself looking up too .
For a moment I forget who I am .
A bum interrupts my reverie and asks me for a dollar .
I give it to him .
The girls from Minnesota ask a young cop for directions .
I smell pretzels baking .
I buy one with mustard .
I eat my pretzel and enjoy the sights and sounds of the city .
I glory in being all grown up .
A million faces walk by .
Happy faces , excited faces , cunning faces , drunk faces .
They ’re like those apartment windows .
Like that waitress they all have a story .
Suddenly I ’m filled with joy .
For a moment I ’ve become the Eye of God .
The western sky simmers violet as the sun finishes its dive towards the horizon .
I look at my watch .
I ’m running late .
I finish my pretzel and throw the wrapper in the trash .
I stick my hands into my pockets , walk down 42nd Street , and disappear into the babble of a million stories .
I ’ve never been so excited and scared in my entire life .
