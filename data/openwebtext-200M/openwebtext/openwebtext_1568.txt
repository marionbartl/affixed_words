After the succession of feasts – Pessah , Yom Ha’atzmaut , Lag Ba’omer and Shavuot , many of us look for lighter fare .
This means , of course , including more vegetables in our menus .
Preparing lighter meals does not necessarily require a drastic change in family customs .
When my mother was living with me , I suggested a vegetarian Shabbat , but she rejected this idea .
Quoting the Shabbat hymn “ Meat and fish and all tasty things , ” she made it clear that to her a main course of meat or chicken was a must for Shabbat .
The solution was simple .
We changed the ratio of vegetables to meat in our traditional stews and casseroles .
Using liberal amounts of vegetables might sound like a modern idea , but in fact it is a time - honored custom .
Throughout the ages , Mediterranean cooks have come up with a variety of dishes using meat as a flavoring for a preponderance of vegetables .
I have long loved the Shabbat main courses developed in the Maghreb countries of Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia .
By using a modest amount of meat with a few savory seasonings , cooks achieve entrees that are tasty but not heavy and are perfect as warm - weather Shabbat entrees .
Tunisian - born Pascal Perez , author of ( in Hebrew ) , wrote that the entrees of her childhood took full advantage of the wealth of fresh vegetables .
Her full - meal Tunisian stew has just a small amount of meat by Western standards , 250 grams for four or five portions .
The meat cooks with plenty of vegetables – cabbage , chard , turnips , onions , cardoons , tomatoes and chickpeas , and fresh seasonings of parsley and coriander leaves .
Her beef and green bean tajine calls for more veggies than meat – in addition to the beans , there are tomatoes and lots of onions .
For her okra and meat stew , she uses a generous proportion of okra , green peppers , tomatoes and onions , with seasonings of turmeric and cinnamon producing a flavorful dish .
Klementine Konstantini , author of , also highlights the lavish amount of vegetables that Tunisians include in their main courses .
In one of her simple , light stews , she cooks veal with fennel bulbs and onions and seasons the dish with red pepper and ground coriander .
Zette Guinaudeau Franc , author of , prepares a beef ragout with vegetables – turnips , carrots , potatoes or all three – using 1.5 kilos of vegetables for one kilo of beef and a big handful of fresh coriander leaves .
For his Algerian meat ragout with fava beans , Algerian chef Farid Zadi , an instructor at the California School of Culinary Arts in Pasadena , cooks ground meat with green fava beans , onions , carrots , celery and tomato sauce , flavors the dish with a blend of cumin , ground caraway and cayenne , and serves it over pasta .
By using ground meat , which he notes can be beef , lamb or veal , the stew can be prepared quickly .
You can use these satisfying , healthy entrees as basic recipes to adapt to your own preferences , changing the vegetables and seasonings to your taste .
You can make this dish with hot and semi - hot peppers , or simply use sweet peppers and a touch of cayenne .
This version includes potatoes and green and yellow beans to make a complete main course .
You can substitute zucchini for half the beans ; cut them in sticks and cook them along with the beans .
The stew can be kept , covered , for two days in the refrigerator .

A tajine is a Moroccan stew usually prepared with meat or chicken and is named for the dish with a cone - shaped lid that is traditionally used for cooking and serving it .

Faye Levy ’s International Jewish CookbookHealthy Cooking for the Jewish Home .
Carlo Ancelotti could offer no real explanation .
The Italian surveyed a goal tally the like of which Chelsea , as a top - flight side , have not revelled in since the mid-1960s and summoned something approaching a bemused shrug as if contemplating where it had all gone so wrong .
" I do n't consider myself an attacking coach , " he said .
" I am Italian , and the mind - set of Italian football is defensive .
The team that wins Serie A is not usually the side that scores the most , but the one that concedes the least .
But , here , we are in England . "
At Old Trafford tomorrow lunchtime , the division 's most prolific side have an opportunity to wrest back the advantage in the title race .
If Chelsea were unnerved by their Champions League elimination by Internazionale in a stuttering six - week period , then their recovery in their past two games has been as timely as it was stunning .
Portsmouth and Aston Villa , the latter who started last Saturday with the joint best defensive record in the division , were dismissed to the tune of 12 goals in two matches , swelling the team 's tally to 82 in the league and 115 in competitive fixtures this term .
What made the thrashing of Villa all the more remarkable was that it was conducted with Didier Drogba , the club 's leading scorer with 30 goals this season , putting his feet up on the home bench .
In his absence , the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation used at Fratton Park was moulded into a Christmas tree 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 , Nicolas Anelka taking the lone striker 's brief , and Chelsea were still untouchable .
Frank Lampard is enjoying one of his trademark scoring bursts and boasts 21 goals .
Florent Malouda , the team 's most improved player , has scored five in five and 13 this season , dazzling as he rips forward down the left .
There is pace , power and panache in this side which is propelling their pursuit of domestic honours .
While the other title contenders have spent this week surveying the desperate fallout from Champions League contests that left key combatants Wayne Rooney and Cesc Fábregas on crutches , Ancelotti's principal concern has been how to incorporate the array of attacking options at his disposal .
Drogba 's absence last weekend was temporary and the Ivorian will return tomorrow , despite the kick on the knee suffered in training this week and the hernia that has been troubling him for four months .
Yet , having plundered at will with midfielders supplementing a lone forward , the Chelsea manager must consider whether the front pairing with Anelka , last year 's leading Premier League scorer and so impressive at times this term , is his best option .
The Frenchman sustained this team while Drogba was at the Africa Cup of Nations but has not scored since January in the victory at Burnley some 11 matches ago , though he has retained a creative spark through his lean spell .
Anelka would normally command a place in Ancelotti's first - choice line - up – he was excellent against Villa – yet the 31 - year - old has never been comfortable when asked to play in effect as a winger .
At United , the inclusion of Joe Cole or Salomon Kalou on the right , or even the incorporation of Michael Ballack in midfield , would not be a surprise .
It is a pleasant dilemma for Ancelotti to confront .
" Up to December , Drogba and Anelka did a fantastic job together , " he said .
" Everyone was surprised at the start of the season that they could play together , but they have experience , quality and strength and did very well , if not in the last few games .
The position Anelka plays in a game depends upon his feeling .
He likes to move , sometimes left or right , or behind [ a forward ] .
I 've never given him a precise position to play .
I want him to move how he wants to .
Playing with him and Drogba is an option , one of the options we have .
As for Didier , now he 's fit he has to play . "
The possible omission of Anelka is less of a surprise given how productive this team is proving from midfield .
It has been Chelsea 's fluid movement that has been truly irresistible at times this season , Deco 's recent unexpected return to form offering rhythmic passing while the energy around him unsettles opponents .
The lone forward has rarely been short of close assistance .
Ancelotti worked with the likes of Kaká and Ronaldinho at Milan , yet he described Lampard as " unique " .
" He is very dangerous , " he said .
" [ Darren ]
Fletcher and [ Michael ]
Carrick are fantastic also , but Lampard has such good timing to get into the box that it 's difficult to block him if you go man - to - man against him .
He 's a very dynamic player , but it is his timing that is his most important quality .
I was n't aware of that when I first came here . "
So much of this first campaign in English football has proved an eye - opener for the Italian , and not least the attack - minded play he has coaxed from his side .
His baffled reaction to his side 's reputation as great entertainers suggests all this is so out of character .
" I do like to hurt the opposition , of course , but I like defence first and foremost , and balance , " added Ancelotti .
" That is the first priority , to avoid conceding goals and counter - attacks .
But this team 's idea is to attack and control the game that way .
This is the most difficult game [ in the Premier League ] to achieve that , but we all know that the destiny of the title will be in the hands of the side that wins this match . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British university is to hold a conference on Vampires in an effort to counterbalance the “ Americanization ” of the fictional genre .
Delegates to the University of Hertfordshire ’s “ Open Graves , Open Minds : Vampires and the Undead in Modern Culture ” conference to be held on April 16 - 17 will have their food served to them out of coffins as part of a mission to encourage students of all ages to study literature .
English lecturer Sam George , who has just launched a Master of Arts degree in vampire fiction at Hertfordshire , said the most famous vampire narrative of all , Dracula , was written by Irishman Bram Stoker and set in London and Whitby in Yorkshire , but that now with the “ Twilight ” saga and “ True Blood , ” modern vampires have become Americanized .
“ It ’s amazing how many British actors have played Dracula on screen , ” George said in a statement on the university ’s website .
“ I aim to put the British vampire back on the map . ”
George said she is particularly interested in the new teen vampire narratives which act as a useful metaphor for wider teen anxieties about their bodies and the first stirrings of desire .
“ The new breed of vampires are far from monstrous , they are glamorous and sexy and have an emotional side , ” she said .
“ Their ( teenagers ’ ) attraction to vampire figures provides a safe way for them to acknowledge these desires . ”
Conference lectures will be delivered by academics and author Marcus Sedgwick , who writes young adult fiction with a vampire twist .
Panel topics during the two - day event will include “ Dracula Lives , ” “ Appetites of the Undead , ” “ Undead Victorians , ” “ Undead Teens , ” “ Politics of the Undead , ” “ Undead Romance , ” “ The Gay Undead , ” “ Undead TV , ” “ Undead in the New Media , ” “ Identity , Legality and the Undead ” and “ Gendering the Undead . ”
It is the most mysterious wildflower in Britain , the strangest , the rarest , the hardest to see , and it was given up for lost .
But like a wandering phantom , the ghost orchid has reappeared .
After an absence of 23 years , during which it was declared extinct , this pale , diminutive flower , the most enigmatic of all Britain 's wild plants , rematerialised last autumn in an oak wood in Herefordshire .
Its sighting , initially kept a close secret , has electrified the British botanical community .
Forget your black tulip .
This has been British botany 's holy grail , searched for annually and ardently by a small army of enthusiasts for more than two decades , but never found .
Its eventual rediscovery was due to the painstaking detective work of an amateur botanist , Mark Jannink , who identified 10 possible sites in the Welsh borders and visited them regularly throughout the summer , until on 20 September he found a single example of Epigogium aphyllum , bearing a single white flower on a white stem only five centimetres tall .
The plant was so unobtrusive that it was invisible from a few yards away .
On spotting it , Mr Jannink exclaimed : " Hello you – so there you are ! "
There had been no previous ghost orchid sighting in Britain since a single plant was found in Buckinghamshire in 1986 .
It was officially declared extinct in Britain 's Red Data List in 2005 .
Mr Jannink , 42 , who runs a motorbike company in Malvern , Worcestershire , and has been a wildflower enthusiast since his childhood , said yesterday : " To be honest , I was ready to give up , and the feeling when I saw it was of relief more than anything .
It was the following day I felt the euphoria . "
The species is hard to find because it does not appear every year and behaves more like a fungus than a flower , according to the naturalist Peter Marren , author of Britain 's Rare Flowers .
" It has no green leaves , " Mr Marren said .
" It does n't depend on photosynthesis at all , and it does n't manufacture its own food .
" Instead , the food is manufactured for it by a fungus on its roots .
It lives largely underground ; in fact it can live underground without flowering properly for years on end , and it only flowers when conditions are just right . "
Mr Marren added that when it does bloom , the ghost orchid flowers in the thick leaf - mould in the darkest parts of the woodland , where there is no other vegetation .
" It 's the hardest British flower to see , " he said .
" It looks extraordinary .
It produces these flowers without chlorophyll which in the dim light look like ghosts , and if you shine a torch beam on them they appear to be translucent white in the pitch darkness , almost like a photographic negative . "
He described the rediscovery as " terrific news " , adding : " It 's one of the most fascinating flowers . "
A remarkable irony of the rediscovery is that last September , in the very month in which the plant was found – but before the finding was made public – the ghost orchid was chosen as the symbol of a new conservation campaign because of its presumed extinction .
Plantlife , the wild flower charity , called its new manifesto for preventing wild flowers from disappearing The Ghost Orchid Declaration .
" The rediscovery of a single ghost orchid is wonderful news , " one of the declaration 's authors , Dr Trevor Dines , said yesterday .
My audience with a rare orchid
In mystique , there is only one other flower in the whole of the British flora with which the ghost orchid , Epigogium aphyllum , can be compared , and that is another orchid species – the lady 's slipper .
For more than half a century , only a single plant of this purple and yellow bloom existed and during its flowering season it was guarded around the clock at its secret location .
Orchid fanciers had reduced it to the very brink of extinction .

Will America Accept Slavery Under The Hand Of Obama ?
Decision Must Be In By December 21 , 2012 .
Posted on by Armaggedon
The Obama slavery plan is in place .
Just a few more , thousand page bills to pass and America is toast .
The plan is simple .
He who controls energy controls the source of all wealth .
Obama intends to establish a dummy corporation to control energy and wealth under the heavy hand of his government .
Obama has learned the art of satanic magic , which uses the unholy trinity of antichrist spirit to enslave the people .
That trinity is hate , lies and death .
Obama manipulates the desires and opinions of his subjects through hate and lies .
Obama always uses a target to focus his hate and lies .
There is always a villan and some crisis leading to death to alarm the people into hasty and reckless action .
Obama is not alone .
He was put into place by those who love and serve Satan 's lies from the beginning of the fall of humanity .
We are in end times and the masters of black magic know their time is short .
This is their final attempt to establish a one world order and government .
This dictatorship will be imposed upon the people through might and power .
Only those who love and serve God in Spirit and in Truth , stand in the way of the usurpers .
Daniel 7:25 - 26 .
" And he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time .
But the judgement shall sit , and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end . "
When Obama speaks out against those who love and serve the LORD he also speaks out against the most High .
We see what a hypocrite and liar , Obama the usurper is .
Saints are condemned while Obamas ' violant supporters are excused and honored .
Obama will not carry on his unholy trinity of hate , lies and death beyond time and times and half a time .
That is three and a half years from his inauguration on January 20 , 2009 .
The question before each one of us is , are we going to accept slavery under Obama and share in his plagues ?
The first year of rule Obama has passed .
We are in year two .
A time of lies and deceit as Obama places link after link of chain upon America .
Year three is to come with famine and rationing .
The half time falls in midst of the fourth year .
The cycles move in progression .
Water , air , earth and fire .
Year four is fire .
When the fire falls , the usurper is consumed .
Daniel 7:27 .
" And the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High , whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey Him . "
The Christ Trinity is Love , Truth and Life .
The LORD seeks those who worship Him in Spirit and in Truth .
Can we do this over the next two years , while the usurper Obama prances about the world stage , before his final curtain call ?
Let the dead bury the dead .
We serve the God of the living saints .
The fire prepares to fall from heaven and only those who love and serve God can stand in the divine fire .
We are members of a divine body standing in a fire ark .
Love God and stand in the Ark .

Idiots prefer slavery as long as they can watch NCAA ball games and other inane garbage .
TV controls Americans .
The way to stop it is to cancel it but most are too stupid to get it .
They are more interested in whether Corn Cob U won .

Blacks and other minorities must come to understand that the brand of socialism and communism being exercised by this administration and Congressional democratic leaders are regenerating slavery , adopting slavery , continuing slavery because THAT IS WHAT BIG GOVERNMENT MEANS .
BIG GOVERNMENT MEANS BEING A SLAVE .
Blacks and other minorities qho think they have risen above slavery have just traded one taskmaster for another and that other taskmaster is BIG GOVERNMENT , THE STATE .
Blacks and minorities must come to realize that they are now the new slaves to their liberal big government elitist taskmasters .
To : Ev Reeman
Yes indeed .
Few know the depth and despair of slavery being prepared for them in plantation Obama .
Obama the driven egomaniac is a cruel taskmaster .
We are fed desires and opinions to snare and bind us into plantation Obama .
The LORD God says “ Let my people go . ”
Nothing purifies the heart faster than loving God .

It truly has been an interesting journey getting here — from what started as a well - deserved homage to San Francisco nine months ago to what it is now , 100 posts later , a constantly evolving collection of elegant photographs and personal stories about food .
It has been fascinating learning about brining my own chicken and corning my own brisket , discovering amazing hole - in - the - walls in the most unexpected places , and meeting equally passionate foodies in this wonderful city .
The journey has been frustrating , too .
Oftentimes , I feel that my life has been reduced to a miserable obsession with blog stats .
It sounds funny but it ’s actually sad when you think about it : how I am so deeply fixated with clicks and views , with being gawked at and spotted .
It ’s not sad , it ’s pathetic .
While I worry about my blog impressions , I worry about a million other things in the kitchen like the butter burning , the pan de sal not rising , the ube ice cream melting , and the natural light in the loft fading too quickly before I can finish my shoot .
Feeling frustrated may be an understatement .
Feeling defeated may be more appropriate .
But despite these somber feelings of defeat , the journey has actually been very rewarding .
When the clicks are down , I turn to readers like Cindy and Jon who write thoughtful and detailed notes about what worked and what did n’t while they recreated my recipes .
I turn to readers like Dina , Iya , Lou and Bruce , who love not only my photographs but also the stories behind those photographs .
I turn to Dennis and his hairy knuckles .
Yes , those hairy knuckles kneading the dough for char siu baos are his .
He ’s my number one fan and my number one critic .
Whenever I am ready to pack my camera and quit , Dennis is the one who cheers me up and pushes me to write my next post .
Where do I go from here ?
Writing Jun-Blog truly has been a wonderful experience .
But where do I go from here ?
I do n’t want to be just another food blogger who makes asparagus soup because they ’re in season or who makes strawberry coulis - infused pancakes because they ’re coulis - infused .
The web is already saturated with amazing food - blogging moms and chefs who , frankly , can do a much better job that I can making asparagus soup and making strawberry coulis - infused pancakes .
I want to be different .
I have always drawn inspiration from the incredibly diverse food offerings in San Francisco and the Bay Area , from fine dining to street food , from the Farmers ’ Markets to the unique ethnic grocery stores .
Lately , I have also been inspired by stories about beekeepers , fishermen , farmers , and mushroom hunters — stories that reconnect me with the people who bring food to my kitchen .
I think it ’s truly fascinating to learn about why honey tastes like vanilla or why morels thrive in lightly charred pine trees .
Our salmon fishing trip a couple of weeks ago , even though we came home sunburned and empty - handed , gave me a deeper sense of appreciation for the hard work fishermen do so I can enjoy a plate of grilled fish for dinner .
Growing a vegetable garden .
Canning tomatoes .
Making berry jams .
Butchering pigs and deer .
These are the kind of stories I want to write more about .
Although , I must say that I enjoy dipping Peeps in melted Venezuelan chocolate , too .
Reinventing Filipino Food
Revisiting my roots on a recent trip back home has made me realize how much I miss and how much I love Filipino food .
I ’ve always wondered why there ’s a dearth of great Filipino food in the Bay Area considering its diversity and its huge Filipino - American community , one of the largest in the country .
Filipino food is a rich blend of Spanish , Chinese , and Malay influences , among others .
The amazing local flavors , textures and ingredients deserve so much more attention and affection .
I get so thrilled whenever I hear about chefs in the city trying to reinvent Filipino food .
Kitchenette ’s offering in a recent street food event is a perfect example of how it should be done : taking something truly Filipino — a souring technique called kinilaw — and elevating it by using fresh local ingredients .
There ’s so much more to Filipino food than the ubiquitous chicken adobo , lumpia and pancit in cafeteria - style restaurants .
Filipino food needs a little bit of sophistication to make it more appealing to the more discriminating international palate .
And that ’s the big challenge .
These are exciting times for Jun-Blog .
A hundred posts may seem trivial but for a chemical engineer turned photographer , it ’s a huge thing .
A " super Jupiter " and its sibling world have been found circling their parent star with steeply tilted orbits — the first time such a configuration has ever been spotted , astronomers say .
All eight planets in our solar system orbit the sun in roughly the same plane , an imaginary disk that extends from the sun 's equator .
But new data show that two of the three Jupiter - like planets known to circle the sunlike star Upsilon Andromedae have orbits that are tilted 30 degrees from each other .
The orbit of the third , innermost planet is still unknown .
( Find out about a batch of planets recently found outside our solar system that have tilted , " wrong way " orbits . )
The unusual discovery suggests that astronomers can't assume all star systems with multiple worlds will always be able to keep planetary siblings in line .
( See " Our Solar System May Have Millions of ' Twins . ' " )
The Upsilon Andromedae system probably formed the same way as other planetary systems , including our own , said study leader Barbara McArthur of the McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin .
When a cloud of material condenses and collapses to form a star , some leftover material can circle the star 's middle in what 's called a protoplanetary disk .
This disk , in turn , can coalesce to form planets .
In Upsilon Andromedae 's case , something knocked two of the outer planets into strange , crisscrossing orbits after the star system had been born .
The star has a binary companion , a dim red dwarf star that orbits Upsilon Andromedae at a distance of about 70 billion miles ( 112 billion kilometers ) .
If that red dwarf has a very elongated orbit , it might have swooped in close to Upsilon Andromedae sometime in the past , disturbing the planets ' orbits with its gravity .
There 's also evidence that a " missing " planet might have been involved in a gravitational tug - of - war with its peers .
The planets could have pushed each other around so much that the loser got thrown out of the system , while the remaining worlds were left askew .
" Planet - planet scattering is a very likely cause for what we see , " McArthur said .
Massive Planet Almost a Dim Star ?
The new information about the Upsilon Andromedae system , collected using the Hubble Space Telescope and a suite of ground - based observatories , also allowed the researchers to more precisely calculate the masses of the star 's planets .
Planet c , which orbits just 76 million miles ( 122 million kilometers ) from the star , has 14 times the mass of Jupiter , the scientists estimate .
A gassy body that massive would normally qualify as a brown dwarf , a starlike object just shy of being able to start hydrogen fusion and ignite .
" But people 's theories of the formation of brown dwarfs [ assume ] that they were formed like stars , " said study co-author Fritz Benedict , also of the McDonald Observatory .
( See a picture of two brown dwarfs said to be the dimmest " stars " in the universe . )
" This one was obviously formed like a planet , " since it 's part of a larger planetary system , Benedict said .
Study leader McArthur coined the term " super Jupiter " to describe the ultramassive gas giant .
Meanwhile , planet d has ten times Jupiter 's mass and lies about 237 million miles ( 381 million kilometers ) from Upsilon Andromedae .
That puts the planet in its young star 's habitable zone , the region where rocky , Earthlike worlds would theoretically get the right amount of heat for liquid water — and thus life — to exist , Benedict said .
Since planet d is a gas giant , it 's unlikely to harbor life as we know it , he added — " but there could be [ potentially habitable ] moons . "

It was 21 years ago that the Exxon Valdez leaked oil and unleashed torrents of environmental hysteria .
Rothbard got it right in his piece " Why Not Feel Sorry for Exxon ? "
After the British Petroleum–hired oil rig exploded last week , the environmentalists went nuts yet again , using the occasion to flail a private corporation and wail about the plight of the " ecosystem , " which somehow managed to survive and thrive after the Exxon debacle .
The comparison is complicated by how much worse this event is for BP .
Eleven people died .
BP market shares have been pummeled .
So long as the leak persists , the company loses 5,000 – 10,000 barrels a day .
BP will be responsible for cleanup costs far exceeding the federal limit of $ 75 million on liability for damages .
The public relations nightmare will last for a decade or more .
In the end , the costs could reach $ 100 billion , nearly wrecking the company and many other businesses .
It should be obvious that BP is by far the leading victim , but I 've yet to see a single expression of sadness for the company and its losses .
Indeed , the words of disgust for BP are beyond belief .
The DailyKos sums it up : " BP : Go f*** yourselves . "
Obama 's press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said that the government intended to keep " its boot on BP 's neck . "
How about reality ?
The incident is a tragedy for BP and all the subcontractors involved .
It will probably wreck the company , a company that has long provided the fuel that runs our cars , runs our industries , and keeps alive the very body of modern life .
The idea that BP should be hated and denounced is preposterous ; there is every reason to express great sadness for what has happened .
It is not as if BP profits by oil leaks , or that anyone reveled in the chance to dump its precious oil all over the ocean .
BP gains nothing from this .
Its own CEO has worked for years to try to prevent precisely this kind of accident from occurring , and done so not out of the desire to comply with regulations , but just because it is good business practice .
In contrast to those who are weeping , we might ask who is happy about the disaster :
the environmentalists , with their fear mongering and hatred of modern life , and the government , which treats every capitalist producer as a bird to be plucked .
The environmentalists are thrilled because they get yet another chance to wail and moan about the plight of their beloved marshes and other allegedly sensitive land .
The loss of fish and marine life is sad , but it is not as if it will not come back : after the Exxon Valdez disaster , the fishing was better than ever in just one year .
The main advantage to the environmentalists is their propaganda victory in having yet another chance to rail against the evils of oil producers and ocean drilling .
If they have their way , oil prices would be double or triple , there would never be another refinery built , and all development of the oceans would stop in the name of " protecting " things that do human beings not one bit of good .
The core economic issue concerning the environment is really about liability .
In a world of private property , if you soil someone else 's property , you bear the liability .
But what about in a world in which government owns vast swaths , and the oceans are considered the commons of everyone ?
It becomes extremely difficult to assess damages to the environment at all .
" The liability for environmental damage should be 100 % at least . "
There is also a profound problem with federal government limits on liability .
That is central planning gone mad .
The liability for environmental damage should be 100 % at least .
Such a system would match a company 's policies to the actual risk of doing damage .
Lower limits would inspire companies to be less concerned about damage to others than they should be , in the same way that a company with a bailout guarantee faces a moral hazard to be less efficient than it would be in a free market .
But such a liability rule presumes ownership , so that owners themselves are in a position to enter into fair bargaining , and there can be some objective test .
There is no objective test when the oceans are collectively owned and where huge amounts of territory are government owned .
And it is precisely the government and the Obama administration that gain from the incident .
The regulators get yet another lease on life .
They are already sending thousands of people to " save " the region .
" Every American affected by this spill should know this : your government will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this crisis , " Obama said .
Are we really supposed to believe that government is better able to deal with this disaster than private industry ?
Meanwhile , the Obama administration must be thrilled to have an old - fashioned change of subject , so that we do n't have to notice every single day that its economic stimulus has been an incredible flop , with unemployment higher today than a year ago and the depression still persisting .
And why , by the way , when every natural disaster is hailed by the Keynesian media for at least having the stimulative effect of rebuilding , is nothing like this said about the oil spill ?
At least in this case , losses seem to be recognized as losses .
The abstraction called the " ecosystem " — which never seems to include mankind or civilization — has done far less for us than the oil industry , and the factories , planes , trains , and automobiles it fuels .
The greatest tragedy here belongs to BP and its subsidiaries , and the private enterprises affected by the losses that no one intended .
If the result is a shutdown of drilling and further regulation of private enterprise , we only end up letting the oil spill win .
Microsoft is outsourcing its internal IT to Indian company Infosys .

Dell on Tuesday formally unveiled the Streak , an Android - powered device the company is marketing as a tablet , though it will only boast a five - inch screen .
The Streak , formerly known as the Mini 5 , will first be available in the U.K. later this month through O2 , and will come to the U.S. this summer .
The Streak includes built - in Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , and available 3G , which will handle e-mail , texting , instant messages , and voice calls .
At a Citrix Synergy event in San Francisco earlier this month , chief executive Michael Dell reportedly said that AT&T would be the Streak 's provider , but a Dell spokesman said Tuesday that the company has not announced a U.S. carrier yet .
The Streak includes a 1GHz Snapdragon processor , a 5 - megapixel camera with dual LED flash .
It includes 2 G - bytes of internal storage , though the Micro SD card can hold up to 32 GB of expandable memory , which will support up to 42 movies , 32,000 photos , or 16,000 songs , Dell said .
Later this year , the Streak will include support for .
The Android software includes integrated Google Maps with turn - by - turn navigation , street , and satellite views .
It also supports social media like Twitter , Facebook , and YouTube , Dell said .
The five - inch screen is a capacitive , multi - touch WVGA display .
For comparison , the new smartphone has a 4.3 - inch screen .
Dell first showed off the Streak , , at this year 's Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas .
At the time , Dell said it was investigating other screen sizes , so a larger version could be in the works .
PCMag 's mobile analyst Sascha Segan with the device at CES .
At the time , it had a few new touches , but appeared to be running straight - up Android .
The touch - based keyboard was comfortable , movies played smoothly , and Google Maps looked great on the large screen .
The device also supports voice ; it has a microphone .
Dell said in January that it expects most people to use a Bluetooth headset since the device is larger than the average smartphone .
The theme this week is apparently performance wear enhanced with special lighting effects .
Today ’s featured wearable is an amazing stage costume made and designed by Wei-Chieh Shih .
The nylon suit is embedded with 200 laser diodes , transforming the performer into a mobile light show .
I love the punk aesthetics of the lasers themselves .

UPDATE ( at bottom ) : White House hits back at Fox News ’s ‘ very special and unique interview ’ with Brown
Michael Brown , former President George W. Bush ’s infamous FEMA chief , claimed yesterday that President Obama is using the Gulf oil spill to play politics .
And he went further : he said Obama waited for the oil spill to worsen so he could shut down offshore drilling .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This is exactly what they want , because now he can pander to the environmentalists and say , ‘ I ’m gonna shut it down because it ’s too dangerous , ' ” Brown told Fox ’s Neil Cavuto .
“ This president has never supported Big Oil , he ’s never supported offshore drilling , and now he has an excuse to shut it back down . ”
Brown ’s comments ring strange because Obama actually announced earlier this year that he was expanding the allowed zones for offshore work , much to the consternation of his supporters .
The former Bush official resigned in the wake of his tepid response to Hurricane Katrina and questions about his resume .
Brown is n’t the only one making waves with his comments during the Gulf spill .
In a 30 - minute speech to a Republican crowd in Kansas City Saturday , onetime Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin dubbed the gulf spill “ very tragic , ” but added : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ I want our country to be able to trust the oil industry .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Writing in the Kansas City Star , reporter Steve Kraske summed up her remarks as , “ She said the U.S. must wean itself from foreign oil in order to be truly free . ”

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve got to tap domestically because energy security will be the key to our prosperity , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Palin remarked .
Brown ’s comments are available in the following video , uploaded by the liberal watchdog group MediaMatters .

UPDATE : White House hits back at Fox News ’s ‘ very special and unique interview ’ with Brown
At Tuesday ’s White House press briefing , a Fox News reporter asked press secretary Robert Gibbs to respond to “ critics ” who ’ve accused the Obama administration of purposefully detonating an oil rig in order to shut down further offshore drilling .
He was not amused .

“ I watched Fox yesterday , ” Gibbs said , his expression shifting from cordial to agitated .
“ Fox had the very special and unique interview with Michael Brown — you opened it and I had to do it — who , for those who were n’t let in on the big secret , Mr. Brown , FEMA director Brown under Katrina , intimated on Fox and was n’t , I would editorially say , did n’t appear to be pushed back on real hard — that this spill was leaked on purpose in order for us to walk back our environmental and drilling decisions and that the leak that we did on purpose got out of control and now is too big to contain . ”
Gibbs sparred with the Fox News reporter and suggested that he should “ call headquarters ” and ask why the network would seemingly promote such a theory without offering a stern counter - point .
“ IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not entirely sure a factual answer that I might give to any one of your questions is going to change the notion that your network put out the former FEMA director to make an accusation that the well had been purposefully set off in order to change an offshore drilling decision , ” he said .

At present , graphene probably is the most investigated new material system worldwide .
Due to its astonishing mechanical , chemical and electronic properties , it promises manifold future applications - for example in microelectronics .
The electrons in graphene are particularly movable and could , therefore , replace silicon which is used today as the basic material of fast computer chips .
In a research cooperation , scientists of Leibniz University Hanover and of the Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt ( PTB ) have now investigated in which way a rough base affects the electronic properties of the graphene layer .
Their results suggest that it will soon be possible to control plasmons , i.e. collective oscillations of electrons , purposefully in the graphene , by virtually establishing a lane composed of projections and humps for them .
The results were published in the current edition of the New Journal of Physics .
The structure of graphene itself is fascinating :
It consists of exactly one single , regular layer of carbon atoms .
To manufacture this incredibly thin layer absolutely neatly is a great challenge .
A possible method to recipitate graphene extensively on an insulating substrate is epitaxy , i.e. the controlled growth of graphene on insulating silicon carbide .
For this purpose , a silicon carbide crystal is heated in vacuum .
Starting from a specific temperature , carbon atoms migrate to the surface and form a monoatomic layer on the - still solid - silicon carbide .
An important question for later applications is , how defects and steps of the silicon carbide surface affect the electronic properties of the graphene grown on it .
Within the scope of a research cooperation between PTB and Leibniz University Hanover , the influence of defects in the graphene on the electronic properties has been investigated .
During the investigations , special attention was paid to the influence of the defects on a special electronic excitation , the so - called plasmons .
By different sample preparation , first of all silicon carbide crystals with different surface roughness and , thus , with a different concentration of surface defects were investigated , on which , subsequently , graphene formed .
The influence of the defects on the plasmon excitations was then investigated by means of low - energy electron diffraction ( SPA - LEED ) and electron loss spectroscopy ( EELS ) .
The process revealed a strong dependence of the lifetime of plasmon on the surface quality .
Defects , as they are caused on step edges and grain boundaries , strongly impede the propagation of the plasmons and drastically shorten their lifetime .
Here it is remarkable that the other electronic properties of the plasmons , in particular their dispersion , remain largely unaffected .
This opens up interesting possibilities for the future technical application and use of plasmons ( the so - called " plasmonics " ) in graphene .
By selective adjustment of the surface roughness , different graphene ranges could be generated in which the plasmons are either strongly dampened or can propagate almost unobstructedly .
In this way , the plasmons could be conducted along " plasmon conductors " with low surface roughness specifically from one point of a graphene chip to another .

Taking direct aim at his Republican critics , President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE promised Saturday there would be no additional bailouts offered to the financial industry .
" Never again will taxpayers be on the hook because a financial company is deemed ' too big to fail , ' " he said in his weekly address .
ADVERTISEMENT
Senate Minority Leader ( R - Ky. ) took to the Senate floor this week and said the Democrats ' pending financial regulatory reform bill in the Senate " not only allows for taxpayer - funded bailouts of Wall Street banks , it institutionalizes them .
" Obama said McConnell made a " cynical and deceptive assertion . "
" He knows that it would do just the opposite , " Obama said .
" Every day we do n’t act , the same system that led to bailouts remains in place -- with the exact same loopholes and the exact same liabilities .
And if we do n’t change what led to the crisis , we ’ll doom ourselves to repeat it .
That ’s the truth . "
" Opposing reform will leave taxpayers on the hook if a crisis like this ever happens again , " he added .
Obama said a " failure of responsibility " from Wall Street and Washington cost the country " 8 million jobs lost , trillions in savings erased [ and ] countless dreams diminished or denied .
" Obama said the Democrats ' financial reform will close the " loopholes " that led to the economic crisis .
"
It ’s these loopholes that allowed executives to take risks that not only endangered their companies , but also our entire economy , " he said .
" And we ’re going to put in place new rules so that big banks and financial institutions will pay for the bad decisions they make -- not taxpayers .
" He closed by saying , " We will hold Wall Street accountable . "
I have to
tell you , sometimes , being a critical reviewer in the realm of technology is not an easy task .
The problem comes down to the sheer rate of improvement among the products we review .
If we were Car and Driver , it would look something like this .
One year , we ’d be reviewing a car that could accelerate from zero to 60 in eight seconds .
A year later , we ’d be testing a car in the same price range with a six - second 0 - 60 time .
Another year after that , the standard would be down to four seconds .
The next year ?
Three .
Soon , pressing the accelerator would subject the driver to forces strong enough to be lethal in the right amounts .
Which is , for a car guy , a barrel of fun .
We have that sort of dynamic going on with computer chips , and it ’s also quite entertaining , if you ’re so inclined .
I ’ve gone from listening to short programs load in from tape on an Atari 800 to 12 - megapixel monitors arrays playing amazing - looking games in full motion .
This is not normal in any other walk of life .
Now , do n’t get me wrong .
I can pick nits with the best of ’em .
But some days , I ’m still amazed that I do n’t have to listen to a series of bleeps and bloops for 30 minutes before I get to play Borderlands .
At times like that , this new processor Intel will be officially introducing soon is almost incomprehensible .
The Core i7-980X builds on the foundation established by the first Core i7 processors back in late 2008 , but it raises the core count from four to six and adds a bundle of performance in the process .
Given this thing ’s performance and other qualities , I ’m having a difficult time finding reasons to complain .
Keep reading , and you ’ll see what I mean .
Gulftown chips on a wafer .

Introducing Gulftown
If you ’ve been following Intel CPUs lately , you ’re probably well - versed in code names .
Knowing them is helpful because the complexity of Intel ’s product portfolio is surpassed only by that of its naming scheme .
Consequently , we ’ve started referring to Clarkdale , Lynnfield , and Bloomfield rather than attempting to enumerate all possible products based on those bits of silicon .
The Core i7-980X adds a new code name to that constellation : Gulftown .
Like the dual - core Clarkdale Core i3 / i5 processors introduced earlier this year , Gulftown is a part of the Westmere family of 32 - nm chips .
This six - core processor is primarily known , in its server / workstation guise , as Westmere - EP ; Gulftown is the code name for the desktop variants of the chip .
Gulftown is intended to be a drop - in replacement for the existing members of the Core i7-900 series , all of which are based on the quad - core chip code - named Bloomfield .
If your head has n’t exploded yet from code - name overload , I congratulate you .
The main things you need to know about Gulftown are reproduced in the table below , which should act as something of a code - name decoder .
Code name Key products Cores Threads Last - level cache size Process
node ( Nanometers ) Estimated transistors ( Millions ) Die area ( mm² ) Penryn Core 2 Duo 2 2 6 MB 45 410 107 Bloomfield Core i7 4 8 8 MB 45 731 263 Lynnfield Core i5 , i7 4 8 8 MB 45 774 296 Westmere Core i3 , i5 2 4 4 MB 32 383 81 Gulftown Core i7-980x 6 12 12 MB 32 1170 248 Deneb Phenom II 4 4 6 MB 45 758 258 Propus / Rana Athlon II
X4/X3 4 4 512 KB x 4 45 300 169 Regor Athlon II X2 2 2 1 MB x 2 45 234 118
Compared to Bloomfield , Gulftown has 50 % more cores and cache , yet it fits into the same basic power envelope at the same clock speed .
Gulftown packs substantially more transistors into a smaller die area than Bloomfield , too .
All of this magic comes courtesy of Intel ’s new 32 - nm chip fabrication process , which combines second - generation high -k + metal gate transistors with first - generation immersion lithography .
The image above shows Gulftown ’s layout nicely .
As a drop - in replacement for Bloomfield , Gulftown has no integrated PCI Express connectivity ( a la Lynnfield ) and no integrated graphics ( a la Clarkdale ) .
Instead , it relies on a QuickPath Interconnect to link it to the X58 chipset .
Interestingly , Intel ’s architects call the uncore area running up the center of the chip “ the tube . ”
( Well , I thought it was interesting , anyway . )
Your eye may also be drawn to the top left corner of the chip , where there ’s a pretty big area with not much going on .
In a briefing , Dave Hill , Westmere ’s lead architect , acknowledged this “ white space ” and noted only that he was n’t going to talk about the reasons for it .
Presumably , Intel would want to minimize wasted space on a design like this one , so I ’m intrigued .
Almost looks to me like one could eliminate the apparent white space on both sides of the memory controller and the I/O , uncore , and memory controller would wrap pretty snugly around four cores their associated L3 cache .
As far as we know , though , Intel has no plans to release a native quad - core derivative of Westmere .
Instead , the firm will press ahead with a quad - core version of Sandy Bridge , the upcoming architectural refresh slated for the 32 - nm process .
Speaking of which , the chips in the Westmere family are a “ tick ” in Intel ’s vaunted tick - tock cadence .
They ’re a refinement of the quad - core Nehalem architecture introduced at 45 nanometers , with a relatively conservative set of enhancements outside of the obvious changes in core counts and cache sizes .
Sandy Bridge will be a “ tock ” with more radical architectural remodeling .
Still , the same Oregon - based team that created Nehalem also did Westmere , so the ins and outs of the processor were already familiar to them .
They could n’t resist making a few tweaks along the way .
Most notable among them is the addition of seven new instructions tailored to accelerate the most common data encryption algorithms .
Another improvement , carried over from the Lynnfield Core i5 / i7 chips , is the addition of a gate that can cut off power to most elements of the “ uncore ” when the chip is idling in its lowest sleep states , substantially reducing power consumption and even leakage power .
This provision extends the power gate concept first implemented in Nehalem processors .
Gulftown has seven power gates , one for each core and one for the uncore .
Not all elements of the uncore are affected by the power gate .
Notably , the chip ’s built - in power management processor is n’t shut off , for obvious reasons .
Meanwhile , the memory controller , QuickPath Interconnect , and L3 cache have their voltage reduced to “ retention levels . ”
The chip ’s architects say there ’s no substantial increase in the time required for the CPU to wake up from its deeper sleep states .
Other Westmere changes are perhaps even more esoteric .
The APIC timer now remains running all of the time , even during sleep .
Large pages , up to 1GB in size , are now supported , and some improvements have been made for the sake of virtualization performance .
Despite the presence of more and larger caches , the data pre-fetch algorithms for the caches remain the same .
One other modification in Gulftown will please folks trying to achieve higher memory clocks .
With Bloomfield , the maximum memory speed is half the uncore frequency .
As a result , Bloomfield ’s uncore must run at 4GHz in order to accommodate 2GHz DIMMs .
Like Lynnfield , Gulftown ’s uncore only needs to run at 1.5X the max memory speed , so 2GHz memory frequencies are possible with the uncore at 3GHz .
The Core i7-980X Extreme gets a fancy cooler
Gulftown processors will drop into an LGA1366 - style socket , like those used on all X58 motherboards , and should generally be compatible with current boards with the help of a BIOS update .
Intel ’s own DX58S0 “ Smackover ” board can handle a Core i7-980X after a quick BIOS flash , as did the Gigabyte X58A - UD5 in our test system .
As is often the case , though , the move to a smaller fab process has prompted some voltage changes , so you ’ll want to check with your motherboard maker to verify compatibility .
Like Bloomfield , the i7-980X supports three channels of DDR3 memory at up to 1066MHz .
Oddly , Intel has withheld its official endorsement of higher memory frequencies , although the chip ’s memory controller will easily run at higher speeds .

The table above shows Intel ’s current Core i7 lineup .
The Core i7-980X is the first and so far only Gulftown - based product to come to market .
As an Extreme edition , the 980X has an unlocked multiplier to facilitate overclocking .
If you ’re willing to cough up a grand for its best processor , Intel wo n’t stand in the way of you having a little fun with it .
As you can see , the 980X essentially supplants the Core i7-975 Extreme at the same price and frequency , with more cores and cache .
That ’s about it for the Core i7 -980X ’s competition .
We have included the fastest desktop processor from AMD , the Phenom II X4 965 , in our testing , of course , but it lists for only $ 185 and simply can’t match the performance of the fastest Intel CPUs .
AMD does have a six - core version of its Opteron processor that fared pretty well in our last round of server / workstation CPU tests , but the firm has so far elected not to bring it to the desktop .
Pictured above is the Core i7-980X ( trust me , it ’s under there ) installed in our Gigabyte X58A - UD5 mobo , along with Intel ’s nifty stock cooler for this CPU .
That ’s 12GB of Corsair Dominator DIMMs in the picture , by the way a new arrival in Damage Labs although we tested with just three DIMMs and 6GB for the sake of continuity with our existing results .
The new stock cooler will come with retail boxed versions of the Core i7 -980X , and thank goodness , it has a screw - based installation mechanism with a retention bracket that goes on the underside of the motherboard .
Intel claims the retention mech has been tested with shock forces up to 50 Gs , which should prevent it from breaking off and bouncing around inside the case of a pre-built PC  like the tab - based Intel cooler that I installed in my brother - in - law ’s PC did , killing a GeForce GTX 260 in the process .
The cooler has both Quiet and Performance modes , which can be set with a switch on the heatsink .
We found it to be fairly hushed in quiet mode and pretty darned effective in performance mode , as you ’ll soon see .
And now , we have an incredibly large set of CPU test results to navigate , comparing the Core i7-980X to everything from a Core i7 - 870 to a five - year - old Pentium 4 .
I ’m going to keep the commentary to a minimum since we ’re still fresh off of our last massive CPU roundup , and the only big change here is the addition of the i7-980X .
Let ’s get started .
Test notes
We ’ve underclocked the Core i5 - 661 to 2.8GHz in order to simulate the Core i3-540 .
Although we did change the core clock to the proper speed , the processor ’s uncore clock remained at the i5 - 661 ’s stock frequency .
We believe shipping Core i3 - 540 processors have a 2.13GHz uncore clock , while the i5 - 661 has a 2.4GHz uncore clock , so our simulated processor may perform slightly better than the real item due to a higher L3 cache speed .
The differences are likely to be very minor , based on our experience with Lynnfield parts the L3 cache is incredibly fast , regardless  but we thought you should know about that possibility .
Additionally , our Core i7 -960 is an underclocked Core i7-975 Extreme , but in that case , we ’re fairly certain all of the clocks match what they should , since Bloomfield gives us a little more control over such things .
In order to run the Core i7 -960 ’s memory at 1333MHz , we raised its uncore clock to 2.66GHz .
That comes with the territory , and I expect many Core i7 - 960 owners have done the same .
As is our custom , we ’ve omitted the simulated processor speed grades from our power consumption testing .
After consulting with our readers , we ’ve decided to enable Windows ’ “ Balanced ” power profile for the bulk of our desktop processor tests , which means power - saving features like SpeedStep and Cool ’n ’ Quiet are operating .
( In the past , we only enabled these features for power consumption testing . )
Our spot checks demonstrated to us that , typically , there ’s no performance penalty for enabling these features on today ’s CPUs .
If there is a real - world penalty to enabling these features , well , we think that ’s worthy of inclusion in our measurements , since the vast majority of desktop processors these days will spend their lives with these features enabled .
We did disable these power management features to measure cache latencies , but otherwise , it was unnecessary to do so .
Our testing methods
As ever , we did our best to deliver clean benchmark numbers .
Tests were run at least three times , and we reported the median of the scores produced .
Our test systems were configured like so :

I ’d like to thank Asus , Corsair , Gigabyte , OCZ , and WD for helping to outfit our test rigs with some of the finest hardware available .
Thanks to Intel and AMD for providing the processors , as well , of course .
The test systems ’
Windows desktops were set at 1600 × 1200 in 32 - bit color .
Vertical refresh sync ( vsync ) was disabled in the graphics driver control panel .
We used the following versions of our test applications :
The tests and methods we employ are usually publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
Power consumption and efficiency
We have reams of test results to wade though , but we ’ll begin with our power consumption tests , since they ’re especially relevant to a new 32 - nm processor like the Core i7-980X .
For these tests , we used an Extech 380803 power meter to capture power use over a span of time .
The meter reads power use at the wall socket , so it incorporates power use from the entire system the CPU , motherboard , memory , graphics solution , hard drives , and anything else plugged into the power supply unit .
( The monitor was plugged into a separate outlet . )
We measured how each of our test systems used power across a set time period , during which time we ran Cinebench ’s multithreaded rendering test .
We ’ll start with the show - your - work stuff , plots of the raw power consumption readings .
We ’ve broken things down by socket type in order to keep them manageable .
Please note that , because our Asus H57 motherboard tends to draw more power than we ’d like , we ’ve tested power consumption for the Core i5 - 530 and the Core i5 - 661 on our P55 mobo , instead .
We can slice up these raw data in various ways in order to better understand them .
We ’ll start with a look at idle power , taken from the trailing edge of our test period , after all CPUs have completed the render .
Next , we can look at peak power draw by taking an average from the ten - second span from 15 to 25 seconds into our test period , when the processors were rendering .
The Core i7-980X ’s power draw , both at max and idle , mirrors that of the Core i7 -975 quite closely .
Heck , it ’s a few watts lower at peak , despite the addition of two more cores and extra cache .
We can highlight power efficiency by looking at total energy use over our time span .
This method takes into account power use both during the render and during the idle time .
We can express the result in terms of watt - seconds , also known as joules .
( In this case , to keep things manageable , we ’re using kilojoules . )
The X58 platform ’s relatively high power use at idle keeps the i7-980X from performing well by this measure .
We can pinpoint efficiency more effectively by considering the amount of energy used for the task .
Since the different systems completed the render at different speeds , we ’ve isolated the render period for each system .
We ’ve then computed the amount of energy used by each system to render the scene .
This method should account for both power use and , to some degree , performance , because shorter render times may lead to less energy consumption .
In our most direct measurement of power efficiency , the Core i7 -980X takes top honors .
With six cores and , thanks to Hyper - Threading , 12 hardware threads , the 980X makes short work of Cinebench ’s test render .
By finishing so quickly , the 980X - based system requires the least energy to render this scene .
Holding the line on clock speeds and raising the core count is a very effective strategy for attaining energy - efficient performance in multi- threaded applications , and Intel has followed that template almost perfectly with Gulftown .
Memory subsystem performance
Now that we ’ve considered power efficiency , we ’ll move on to our performance results , beginning with some synthetic tests of the CPUs ’ memory subsystems .
These results do n’t track directly with real - world performance , but they do give us some insights into the CPU and system architectures involved .
For this first test , the graph is pretty crowded .
I ’ve tried to be selective , generally only choosing one representative from each architecture .
This test is multithreaded , so more cores with associated L1 and L2 cachescan lead to higher throughput .
With six L1 data caches , six L2 caches , and a massive 12MB L3 cache , the Core i7-980X is the fastest solution at nearly every data point .
This graph becomes almost impossible to read once we get to the larger block sizes , where we ’re really measuring main memory bandwidth .
Stream is a better test of that particular attribute .
Gulftown essentially matches Bloomfield here , with near - identical bandwidth scores .
The 980X ’s very low memory access latencies are even more impressive given the fact that its L3 cache is 50 % bigger than Bloomfield ’s .
( Larger caches typically have longer latencies . )
Intel informs us that Gulftown ’s L3 cache runs at the same speed as Bloomfield ’s , so there ’s no improvement due to higher frequencies .
I do think , however , that we may have to adjust our sample to the 32 MB block size soon .
Latencies for Gulftown at the 16MB size may be getting partially cushioned by the 12MB L3 cache .
At the 32 MB sample size , latencies for the i7-975 and i7-980X are almost identical and work out to about 51 ns .
For what it ’s worth , this benchmark reports that the latency for the Core i7-975 ’s L3 cache is 36 cycles ( of the CPU core ) , while the i7-980 ’s is 43 cycles .
Borderlands
This is my favorite game in a long , long time , so I had to use in it our latest CPU test suite .
Borderlands is based on Unreal Engine technology and includes built - in speed test , which we used here .
We tested with the game set to its highest quality settings at a range of resolutions .
The results from the lowest resolutions will highlight the separation between the CPUs best , so I ’d pay the most attention to them .
The higher resolution results demonstrate what happens when the GeForce GTX 260 graphics card begins to restrict frame rates .
Well , yeah .
Borderlands runs quickly enough on a sub -$ 100 processor like the Athlon II X2 255 , so the Core i7-980X should n’t find it a challenge .
There ’s little improvement from the i7-975 to the i7-980X , but this game engine does n’t use enough threads to take full advantage of Gulftown not that it needs to .
DiRT 2
This excellent new racer packs a nicely scriptable performance test .
We tested at the game ’s “ high ” quality presets with 4X antialiasing .
So continues our object lesson in how most of today ’s games do n’t really require the fastest CPUs .
The 980X does well ; so does everything but the Pentium 4 .
Modern Warfare 2
With Modern Warfare 2 , we used FRAPS to record frame rates over the course of a 60 - second gameplay session .
We conducted this gameplay session five times on each CPU and have reported the median score from each processor .
We ’ve also graphed the frame rates from a single , representative session for each .
We tested this game at a relatively low 1024×768 resolution , with no AA , but otherwise using the highest in - game visual quality settings .
Look , folks .
Those IBM CPUs in the Xbox 360 are n’t gonna set any land speed records .
For now , the largest - budget games and biggest hits are likely to have relatively modest processor needs .
Left 4 Dead 2
We tested Left 4 Dead 2 by playing back a custom demo using the game ’s timedemo function .
Again , we had all of the image quality options cranked , and we tested with 16X anisotropic filtering and 4X antialiasing .
The game ’s multi-core rendering option was , of course , enabled .
Valve ’s
Source engine is no challenge to any modern processor , either .
The 980X again shows that it ’s good for gaming but so is the Core i3-530 .
Source engine particle simulation
Next up is a test we picked up during a visit to Valve Software , the developers of the Half - Life games .
They had been working to incorporate support for multi-core processors into their Source game engine , and they cooked up some benchmarks to demonstrate the benefits of multithreading .
This test runs a particle simulation inside of the Source engine .
Most games today use particle systems to create effects like smoke , steam , and fire , but the realism and interactivity of those effects are limited by the available computing horsepower .
Valve ’s particle system distributes the load across multiple CPU cores .
At last , a more targeted test where Gulftown gets to show us what it can do .
If game developers make heavy use of these effects in games and if they do n’t accelerate them via the GPU , which even Valve now seems to be doing then newer Intel processors with Hyper - Threading should handle them especially well .
Older ones with Hyper - Threading , not so much .
Productivity
We have , for quite some time now , used WorldBench in our CPU tests .
Over that time , we ’ve found that some of WorldBench ’s tests can be rather temperamental and may refuse to run periodically .
We ’ve also found that some of the same tests tend to have inconsistent results that are n’t always influenced much by processor performance .
Other applications in WorldBench 6 , like the Windows Media Encoder 9 test , make little or no use of multithreading , despite the fact that such applications are typically nicely multithreaded these days .
As a result , we ’ve decided to limit our use of WorldBench to a selection of its applications , rather than the full suite .
MS Office productivity
Firefox web browsing
Multitasking – Firefox and Windows Media Encoder
Both the Office and Firefox / Windows Media Encoder tests have an element of multitasking built into them , but Gulftown ’s extra cores and hardware threads are n’t much help when the applications themselves involve mostly serial operations and ( in the case of this older version of Windows Media Encoder ) only a few threads .
The 980X performs well here , but no better than its predecessors .
File compression and encryption
7 - Zip file compression and decompression
Whoa .
7 - Zip puts Gulftown ’s six cores to use , with stunning results over 10X the performance of a Pentium 4 and just under twice the performance of the Core i7-920 .
WinZip file compression
This old version of WinZip in the WorldBench suite uses maybe one or two threads , and the results are predictable .
Again , the 980X comes out looking pretty good , but it ’s not really any faster than Ye Olde Core 2 Duo E8600 .
TrueCrypt disk encryption
Here ’s a new addition at our readers ’ request .
This full - disk encryption suite includes a performance test , for obvious reasons .
We tested with a 50 MB buffer size and , because the benchmark spits out a lot of data , averaged and summarized the results in a couple of different ways .
This , folks , is without any help from Gulftown ’s new instructions that accelerate encryption .
My understanding is that a version of TrueCrypt with support for Westmere ’s new instructions is forthcoming , and we ’ll try to test it once it ’s available .
Still , Gulftown is fast enough on its own to encrypt data more than quickly enough for most storage subsystems .
Yeah , this little data dump is for those of you who are really , really interested in a particular encryption routine .
Enjoy .
Image processing
The Panorama Factory photo stitching
The Panorama Factory handles an increasingly popular image processing task : joining together multiple images to create a wide - aspect panorama .
This task can require lots of memory and can be computationally intensive , so The Panorama Factory comes in a 64 - bit version that ’s widely multithreaded .
I asked it to join four pictures , each eight megapixels , into a glorious panorama of the interior of Damage Labs .
In the past , we ’ve added up the time taken by all of the different elements of the panorama creation wizard and reported that number , along with detailed results for each operation .
However , doing so is incredibly data - input - intensive , and the process tends to be dominated by a single , long operation : the stitch .
So this time around , we ’ve simply decided to report the stitch time , which saves us a lot of work and still gets at the heart of the matter .
The 980X will stitch together your panorama in half the time it takes a Core 2 Quad Q6600 or an Athlon II X4 635 .
picCOLOR image processing and analysis
picCOLOR was created by Dr. Reinert H. G. Müller of the FIBUS Institute .
This is n’t Photoshop ; picCOLOR ’s image analysis capabilities can be used for scientific applications like particle flow analysis .
Dr. Müller has supplied us with new revisions of his program for some time now , all the while optimizing picCOLOR for new advances in CPU technology , including SSE extensions , multiple cores , and Hyper - Threading .
Many of its individual functions are multithreaded .
Recently , at our request , Dr. Müller graciously agreed to re-tool his picCOLOR benchmark to incorporate some real - world usage scenarios .
As a result , we now have four new tests that employ picCOLOR for image analysis .
I ’ve included explanations of each test from Dr. Müller below .
Particle Image Velocimetry ( PIV ) is being used for flow measurement in air and water .
The medium ( air or water ) is seeded with tiny particles ( 1..5 um diameter , smoke or oil fog in air ,
titanium dioxide in water ) .
The tiny particles will follow the flow more or less exactly , except may be
in very strong sonic shocks or extremely strong vortices .
Now , two images are taken within a very
short time interval , for instance 1us .
Illumination is a very thin laser light sheet .
Image resolution is
1280 ×1024 pixels .
The particles will have moved a little with the flow in the short time interval and
the resulting displacement of each particle gives information on the local flow speed and direction .
The calculation is done with cross-correlation in small sub-windows ( 32×32 , or 64×64 pixel ) with some
overlap .
Each sub - window will produce a displacement vector that tells us everything about flow speed
and direction .
The calculation can easily be done multithreaded and is implemented in picCOLOR with
up to 8 threads and more on request .
To give you some context for these results , picCOLOR ’s scores are indexed against a Pentium III 1GHz system ; a score of 1.0 represents its performance .
The Core i7-980X is 54 times that fast in this test .
Real Time 3D Object Tracking is used for tracking of airplane wing and helicopter blade deflection and deformation in wind tunnel tests .
Especially for comparison with numerical simulations , the exact deformation
of a wing has to be known .
An important application for high speed tracking is the testing of wing flutter , a
very dangerous phenomenon .
Here , a measurement frequency of 1000 Hz and more is required to solve the
complex and possibly disastrous motion of an aircraft wing .
The function first tracks the objects in 2 images
using small recognizable markers on the wing and a stereo camera set - up .
Then , a 3D - reconstruction
follows in real time using matrix conversions .
. . .
This test is single threaded , but will be converted to 3 threads in the future .
Multi Barcodes :
With this test , several different bar codes are searched on a large image ( 3200×4400 pixel ) .
These codes are simple 2D codes , EAN13 ( =UPC ) and 2 of 5 .
They can be in any rotation and can be extremely fine
( down to 1.5 pixel for the thinnest lines ) .
To find the bar codes , the test uses several filters ( some of them multithreaded ) .
The bar code edge processing is single threaded , though .
Label Recognition / Rotation is being used as an important pre-processing step for character reading ( OCR ) .
For this test in the large bar code image all possible labels are detected and rotated to zero degree text rotation .
In a real application , these rotated labels would now be transferred to an OCR - program – there are several good programs
available on the market .
But all these programs can only accept text in zero degree position .
The test uses morphology
and different filters ( some of them multithreaded ) to detect the labels and simple character detection functions to locate the text and to determine the rotational angle of the text .
. . .
This test uses Rotation in the last important step , which is fully multithreaded with up to 8 threads .
The 980X ’s strong performance continues , but the newcomer is n’t able to distinguish itself from its predecessors in operations with fewer threads .
I ’m not sure what happened in the Multi Barcodes test , where it was even a little slower .
picCOLOR ’s synthetic tests measure a number of the program ’s individual functions , and the program then computes an average score , again indexed versus a 1GHz Pentium III .
The 980X grabs the top spot here by just a bit .
Media encoding and editing
x264 HD benchmark
This benchmark tests one of the most popular H.264 video encoders , the open - source x264 .
The results come in two parts , for the two passes the encoder makes through the video file .
I ’ve chosen to report them separately , since that ’s typically how the results are reported in the public database of results for this benchmark .
Remember , kids : pass two is where the magic happens .
That ’s where the six cores of Gulftown truly get exercised , with happy results nearly a 50 % increase in encoding rate over the Core i7-975 .
Windows Live Movie Maker 14 video encoding
For this test , I used Windows Live Movie Maker to transcode a 30 - minute TV show , recorded in 720 p .wtv format on my Windows 7 Media Center system , into a 320 ×240 WMV - format video format appropriate for mobile devices .
Wow , Microsoft .
You really could n’t see this coming ?
This is a video encoding app , pretty easily parallelized , and you thought , “ Hey , eight threads ought to be enough for anybody . ”
Really ?
LAME MT audio encoding
LAME MT is a multithreaded version of the LAME MP3 encoder .
LAME MT was created as a demonstration of the benefits of multithreading specifically on a Hyper - Threaded CPU like the Pentium 4 .
Of course , multithreading works even better on multi-core processors .
Rather than run multiple parallel threads , LAME MT runs the MP3 encoder ’s psycho-acoustic analysis function on a separate thread from the rest of the encoder using simple linear pipelining .
That is , the psycho-acoustic analysis happens one frame ahead of everything else , and its results are buffered for later use by the second thread .
That means this test wo n’t really use more than two CPU cores .
We have results for two different 64 - bit versions of LAME MT from different compilers , one from Microsoft and one from Intel , doing two different types of encoding , variable bit rate and constant bit rate .
We are encoding a massive 10 - minute , 6 - second 101MB WAV file here .
LAME MT remains in our test suite after many years as an example of the limits of multithreaded software and , by extension , multi-core processors .
Yes , you can encode multiple files at the same time faster on a six - core , 12 - thread machine like a Gulftown , but we ’re not aware of an encoder that uses more than two threads well while encoding a single audio file .
Hence , the i7-980X is no faster than the dual - core Core i5 - 661 .
3D modeling and rendering
Cinebench rendering
The Cinebench benchmark is based on Maxon ’s Cinema 4D rendering engine .
It ’s multithreaded and comes with a 64 - bit executable .
This test runs with just a single thread and then with as many threads as CPU cores ( or threads , in CPUs with multiple hardware threads per core ) are available .
Ah , rendering .
The embarrassingly parallel task that spawned the GPU .
This is happy territory for the Core i7-980X and unhappy territory for any of its competitors .
It ’s nearly twice the speed of the Phenom II X4 965 here .
By the way , there is a newer version of Cinebench out , release 11.5 , that hopefully resolves some problems with performance scaling at higher core and thread counts .
That ’s not much of a problem for the Core i7-980X here , obviously , but we have seen issues with dual - socket , Nehalem - based systems .
Unfortunately , we did n’t have the stomach for re-testing twenty - some processors with Cinebench 11.5 for the sake of this review .
POV - Ray rendering
We ’re using the latest beta version of POV - Ray 3.7 that includes native multithreading and 64 - bit support .
In the chess2 scene , Gulftown accomplishes in 37 seconds what the Pentium 4 670 does in 10 minutes .
POV - Ray ’s benchmark depends largely on a long , single threaded operation , like some sort of strange testament to Amdahl ’s Law .
That ’s why the i7-980X can’t improve performance there as much .
3ds max modeling and rendering
The first 3ds max test measures 3D modeling speed , not rendering , which is why it shows no gain with the 980X .
Valve VRAD map compilation
This next test processes a map from Half - Life 2 using Valve ’s VRAD lighting tool .
Valve uses VRAD to pre-compute lighting that goes into games like Half - Life 2 .
The presence of the Pentium 4 kind of distorts the scale of this bar chart , but the 980X again delivers a nice reduction in rendering time .
Scientific computing
Folding@Home
Next , we have a slick little Folding@Home benchmark CD created by notfred , one of the members of Team TR , our excellent Folding team .
For the unfamiliar , Folding@Home is a distributed computing project created by folks at Stanford University that investigates how proteins work in the human body , in an attempt to better understand diseases like Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s , and cystic fibrosis .
It ’s a great way to use your PC ’s spare CPU cycles to help advance medical research .
I ’d encourage you to visit our distributed computing forum and consider joining our team if you have n’t already joined one .
The Folding@Home project uses a number of highly optimized routines to process different types of work units from Stanford ’s research projects .
The Gromacs core , for instance , uses SSE on Intel processors , 3DNow ! on AMD processors , and Altivec on PowerPCs .
Overall , Folding@Home should be a great example of real - world scientific computing .
notfred ’s Folding Benchmark CD tests the most common work unit types and estimates the number of points per day that a CPU could earn for a Folding team member .
The CD itself is a bootable ISO .
The CD boots into Linux , detects the system ’s processors and Ethernet adapters , picks up an IP address , and downloads the latest versions of the Folding execution cores from Stanford .
It then processes a sample work unit of each type .
On a system with two CPU cores , for instance , the CD spins off a Tinker WU on core 1 and an Amber WU on core 2 .
When either of those WUs are finished , the benchmark moves on to additional WU types , always keeping both cores occupied with some sort of calculation .
Should the benchmark run out of new WUs to test , it simply processes another WU in order to prevent any of the cores from going idle as the others finish .
Once all four of the WU types have been tested , the benchmark averages the points per day among them .
That points - per - day average is then multiplied by the number of cores on the CPU in order to estimate the total number of points per day that CPU might achieve .
This may be a somewhat quirky method of estimating overall performance , but my sense is that it generally ought to work .
We ’ve discussed some potential reservations about how it works here , for those who are interested .
We have , in the past , included results for multiple WU types , but given the fact that per-core performance results are distorted when Hyper - Threading allows multiple threads to be run simultaneously , we ’ve decided simply to report the overall score this time .
A nice result , but I should note that you can probably expect to accumulate many more points per day if you use the SMP client for Folding .
I ’m hoping notfred will succumb and change the benchmark to use the SMP client soon .
If not , we may have to retire this test , since the SMP client seems to be what everyone is using these days .
MyriMatch proteomics
Our benchmarks sometimes come from unexpected places , and such is the case with this one .
David Tabb is a friend of mine from high school and a long - time TR reader .
He has provided us with an intriguing new benchmark based on an application he ’s developed for use in his research work .
The application is called MyriMatch , and it ’s intended for use in proteomics , or the large - scale study of protein .
I ’ll stop right here and let him explain what MyriMatch does :
In shotgun proteomics , researchers digest complex mixtures of proteins into peptides , separate them by liquid chromatography , and analyze them by tandem mass spectrometers .
This creates data sets containing tens of thousands of spectra that can be identified to peptide sequences drawn from the known genomes for most lab organisms .
The first software for this purpose was Sequest , created by John Yates and Jimmy Eng at the University of Washington .
Recently , David Tabb and Matthew Chambers at Vanderbilt University developed MyriMatch , an algorithm that can exploit multiple cores and multiple computers for this matching .
Source code and binaries of MyriMatch are publicly available .
In this test , 5555 tandem mass spectra from a Thermo LTQ mass spectrometer are identified to peptides generated from the 6714 proteins of S. cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) .
The data set was provided by Andy Link at Vanderbilt University .
The FASTA protein sequence database was provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database .
MyriMatch uses threading to accelerate the handling of protein sequences .
The database ( read into memory ) is separated into a number of jobs , typically the number of threads multiplied by 10 .
If four threads are used in the above database , for example , each job consists of 168 protein sequences ( 1/40th of the database ) .
When a thread finishes handling all proteins in the current job , it accepts another job from the queue .
This technique is intended to minimize synchronization overhead between threads and minimize CPU idle time .
The most important news for us is that MyriMatch is a widely multithreaded real - world application that we can use with a relevant data set .
MyriMatch also offers control over the number of threads used , so we ’ve tested with one to eight threads .
I should mention that performance scaling in MyriMatch tends to be limited by several factors , including memory bandwidth , as David explains :
Inefficiencies in scaling occur from a variety of sources .
First , each thread is comparing to a common collection of tandem mass spectra in memory .
Although most peptides will be compared to different spectra within the collection , sometimes multiple threads attempt to compare to the same spectra simultaneously , necessitating a mutex mechanism for each spectrum .
Second , the number of spectra in memory far exceeds the capacity of processor caches , and so the memory controller gets a fair workout during execution .
Here ’s how the processors performed .
The drop from 59 seconds with the Core i7-975 to 41 seconds with the 980X is pretty darned good for a benchmark that purports to be largely bound by memory bandwidth .
Gulftown is efficient enough with its memory accesses , perhaps in part due to its larger cache , to extract more performance from its additional cores .
STARS Euler3d computational fluid dynamics
Charles O’Neill works in the Computational Aeroservoelasticity Laboratory at Oklahoma State University , and he contacted us to suggest we try the computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) benchmark based on the STARS Euler3D structural analysis routines developed at CASELab .
This benchmark has been available to the public for some time in single - threaded form , but Charles was kind enough to put together a multithreaded version of the benchmark for us with a larger data set .
He has also put a web page online with a downloadable version of the multithreaded benchmark , a description , and some results here .
In this test , the application is basically doing analysis of airflow over an aircraft wing .
I will step out of the way and let Charles explain the rest :
The benchmark testcase is the AGARD 445.6 aeroelastic test wing .
The wing uses a NACA 65A004 airfoil section and has a panel aspect ratio of 1.65 , taper ratio of 0.66 , and a quarter - chord sweep angle of 45 º .
This AGARD wing was tested at the NASA Langley Research Center in the 16 - foot Transonic Dynamics Tunnel and is a standard aeroelastic test case used for validation of unsteady , compressible CFD codes .
The CFD grid contains 1.23 million tetrahedral elements and 223 thousand nodes . . . .
The benchmark executable advances the Mach 0.50 AGARD flow solution .
A benchmark score is reported as a CFD cycle frequency in Hertz .
So the higher the score , the faster the computer .
Charles tells me these CFD solvers are very floating - point intensive , but oftentimes limited primarily by memory bandwidth .
He has modified the benchmark for us in order to enable control over the number of threads used .
Here ’s how our contenders handled the test with different thread counts .
Hmm , what was I saying above about memory bandwidth , efficiency , and caches ?
The same must apply here , where the 980X ’s performance again scales up awfully well .
AMD ’s fastest Phenom II achieves well under half the computational rate of the i7-980X .
Overclocking
After our Clarkdale overclocking exploits yielded very healthy overclocks speeds of 4.4 and 4.5GHz for the two chips we tried I had high expectations for their Gulftown cousin .
Since the 980X has an unlocked multiplier , I simply turned up the multiplier and CPU core voltage in order to overclock it .
At its stock 1.25V , our Gulftown did n’t take well to higher frequencies a humble 3.6GHz was all it would do .
Fortunately , taking the voltage up to 1.41V did the trick , and our 980X was stable with a 31X multiplier , which should yield 4.13GHz .
In fact , I left Turbo Boost enabled during my overclocking attempts , and once the system had booted into Windows , the 980X simply ran at 4.26GHz pretty much all of the time , with one thread or 12 , even during our Prime95 torture test .
That ’s a bit better than the 4GHz we coaxed out of our Core i7 -975 a while back .
Here ’s how the 980X performs at that speed .
( Note that I ’ve also included a few other overclocked CPUs from here .
The “ H57 ” notations are explained there . )
You ’re really not going to extract much more out of DiRT 2 with a faster CPU , I ’m afraid , but Cinebench is clearly another story entirely .
Good grief .
What about power consumption at this speed and voltage ?
Now you can see why Intel chose to hold the line on clock frequencies for Gulftown .
There ’s room in the 32 - nm process , obviously , to reach higher speeds , but you ’ll need to increase the voltage to get there .
Higher voltage means exponentially higher power draw , taking the Core i7-980X well outside of the established power and heat boundaries .
Fortunately , though , Intel ’s cooler for the Core i7-980X is up to the task of cooling the CPU when it ’s overclocked to this degree .
In our torture tests , using the cooler ’s Performance mode , CPU temperatures were in the high fifties Celsius and steady .
The fan was n’t exactly silent at that point , but it was a good deal quieter than the worst CPU and GPU coolers I ’ve heard .
The value proposition
Now that we ’ve buried you under mounds of information , what can we make of it all ?
One way to filter the information is to consider the value proposition for each CPU model .
Exercises like this one are inherently fraught with various , scary dangers giving the wrong impression , committing bad math , overemphasizing price , coming off as irredeemably cheesy  but our value comparisons have proven to be popular over time , so with the capable assistance of TR System Guide guru Cyril Kowaliski , I ’ve taken another crack at it .
What we ’ve done is mash up all of our performance data in one , big summary value for each processor .
The performance data for each benchmark was converted to a percentage using the Pentium 4 670 as the baseline .
We ’ve included nearly every benchmark we used in our overall index , with the exception of the purely synthetic tests like Stream .
We excluded MyriMatch and Euler3D , since not all processors were tested in those benchmarks .
In cases where the benchmarks had multiple components , we used an overall mean rather than including every component score individually .
Each benchmark should thus be represented and weighted equally in the final tally .
( The one case where we did n’t average together a single application ’s output was WorldBench ’s two 3ds max tests , since one measures 3D modeling performance and the other rendering . )
This overall performance index makes me a little bit wary , because it ’s simply a mash - up of results from various tests , rather than an index carefully weighted to express a certain set of priorities .
Still , our test suite itself is intended to cover the general desktop PC ’s usage model , so the index ought to suffice for this exercise .
We then took prices for each CPU from the official Intel and AMD price lists .
Note that AMD ’s prices include a small cut since our last CPU roundup .
For our historical comparison , we ’ve also included the Core 2 Quad Q6600 and the Pentium 4 670 in a couple of places at their initial launch prices .
If we simply take overall performance and divide by price , we get results that look like this :
By this measure , you should almost always buy one of the cheapest CPUs on the market .
This bar chart gives us a strong sense of value , but it may focus our attention a little too exclusively on CPU prices alone .
For many of us , time is money , and faster computer hardware is relatively inexpensive .
What we really want to know is where we can find the best combination of price and performance for our needs .
To give us a better visual sense of that , we ’ve devised our nefarious scatter plots .
The faster a processor is , the higher on the chart it will be .
The cheaper it is , the closer to the left edge .
The better values , then , tend to be closer to the top - left corner of the plot .
If you wish , you can find your price range and look for the best performer in that area .
For our purposes today , the most noteworthy result is how the Core i7-980X Extreme delivers a major performance boost over the Core i7-975 Extreme at the exact same price , which gives it a much nicer position on the scatter plot , in spite of its relatively high price .
That gets us closer to the heart of the matter , but in reality , the price of a processor is just one component of a PC ’s total cost , and the various platforms do have some price disparities between them .
To give some context , we ’ve selected a series of components for each processor and platform that might go into a fairly high - end PC of the sort a Core i7 - 980X might inhabit .
The specs were largely based on the Double - Stuff config from our recent system guide .
Our goal was to achieve rough parity by selecting full - featured ATX motherboards with dual PCIe x16 slots , each with a full 16 - lanes of connectivity if possible .
Here are the components we picked for the different platforms , along with system prices :
Platform Total price Motheboard Memory Common components AMD 790FX $ 1839.89 Gigabyte GA -790FXTA - UD5 ( $ 184.99 ) 8 GB Corsair DDR3 - 1600 ( $ 219.98 ) XFX Radeon HD 5870 1GB graphics card ( $ 399.99 ) , Intel X25 - M G2 160 GB ( $ 499.00 ) , 2x Western Digital Caviar Green 2TB ( $ 359.98 ) , LG WH08LS20 Blu-ray burner ( $ 179.99 ) , Asus Xonar DX ( $ 89.99 ) , Cooler Master Cosmos 1000 ( $ 179.99 ) , Corsair HX750W ( $ 149.99 ) Intel X48 $ 1784.89 Asus P5E3 Pro ( $ 129.99 ) Intel P55 $ 1839.89 Gigabyte GA - P55A - UD4P ( $ 184.99 ) Intel X58 $ 2034.89 Gigabyte GA - X58A - UD5 ( $ 279.99 ) 12 GB OCZ DDR3 - 1600 ( $ 319.98 )
What happens when we factor these rather considerable system prices into our value equation ?
Voila !
You ’re pretty much compelled to buy a Gulftown now , folks .
Fire up the credit card and go for broke .
The numbers do n’t lie !
In the context of a high - end system like this one , the additional performance offered by the Core i7-980X is actually worth the price of entry .
The scatter plots tell the same story in nearly as compelling a manner .
You ’re getting a major increase in overall performance by stepping up to the Core i7 -980X , and the added cost is n’t a huge part of the total expenditure .
Of course , the AMD fans in the house who have a deep and abiding affection for cheap processors and some other value mavens would have me remind you that less expensive CPUs will look like better values in the context of cheaper systems .
See our last roundup or our even lower - cost analysis for some examples .
Our focus today is on more expensive CPUs and systems since we ’re reviewing the 980X .
Performance per dollar is n’t the whole story these days , though .
The power efficiency of a processor increasingly helps determine its value proposition for a host of reasons , from total system costs to noise levels to the size of your electric bill .
We measured full system power draw and considered efficiency earlier in this article ; now , we can factor in system prices to give us a sense of power - efficient performance per dollar .
The 980X ’s combination of a high price and excellent power efficiency puts it in the top third of the pack on our bar charts .
Both the bar chart and the scatter plot tell us that the 980X represents a major improvement over the Core i7 -975 Extreme at the same price .
If you were running a render farm , a Gulftown ( or more likely , a Westmere - EP Xeon ) system could be a very rational purchase once energy costs were taken into account .
Still , some of Intel ’s less expensive processors offer pretty good power efficiency for much less money , so they ’re at the top of the bar chart .
The Truth in Cultural Relativism By Antti Kauppinen
Do moral judgments form a psychological natural kind ?
Lately , Stephen Stich and his colleagues have been arguing on the basis of empirical evidence that the features psychologists have identified as key to moral judgment do not , as a matter of fact , cluster together in a lawlike fashion .
In particular , they argue that harm attributions do not always evoke the signature moral response pattern of authority - independence and generality , and conclude that since the purported nomological cluster breaks down , moral judgments do not form a natural kind .
Their argument , of course , leaves open the possibility that there is some other cluster to be found .
I am not a big believer in nomological clusters , but I will propose an alternative content feature that does seem to pair with the signature moral pattern in a lawlike fashion .
Namely , it seems that whenever people take a piece of behaviour to express , in context , any of a set of attitudes that ranges from disrespect to debasement , the signature moral pattern is evoked .
( As usual , I ’ll just focus on wrongness judgments . )
In short , people are intuitive deontologists , and for all that Stich says , there may be a psychological natural kind of moral judgment .
My alternative model involves commitment to a commonsense cultural relativism , but one of an entirely innocuous kind that poses no threat to moral objectivism .
To distinguish it from standard or deference relativism , I ’ll call it significance relativism .
The psychological state weâ€™re in when we judge that something is morally wrong is , on the face of it , different from the state weâ€™re in when we judge that something violates a conventional rule .
The essential features of the moral stance have long been the object of philosophical inquiry , but they have also attracted the attention of psychologists working on childrenâ€™s moral development .
The best known tradition on the psychological side was initiated by Elliot Turiel and his colleagues thirty years ago .
Drawing in part on philosophical work , Turiel proposed that moral judgment has four distinctive marks .
The formulations differ , but the starting point is that we judge a rule violation to be morally wrong if certain counterfactuals hold : we would judge it to be wrong independent of what any de facto authorities say , and we would judge it to be wrong in any other time and place as well .
These two features , authority - independence and generality , are key to what Stich labels the signature moral pattern .
It contrasts with responses to conventional rule violations , like not wearing a tie to a job interview , which we may actually judge to be wrong , but would not if , say , the university interviewed for had a policy of not wearing ties .
Nor would we judge it to be wrong in all other times and places , like ancient China .
( Turielâ€™s third content - independent criterion is seriousness , but it clearly plays a secondary role . )
The fourth distinctive feature of moral judgment for Turiel was justification in terms of harm , injustice , or rights violation .
This relates to the content of moral judgment : unless justifications are merely ex post facto rationalizations ( which is a real possibility ) , presumably people judge ( what they take to be ) harmful , unjust , and rights - violating actions to exhibit the three distinctive formal features , if Turielâ€™s view is correct .
This , at any rate , is how Stich and his colleagues read him .
( It is quite possible that this is a misreading : Turiel need not be committed to claiming that people judge what they take to be harmful things to be morally wrong , only that people justify their judgments with reference to harm .
I wonâ€™t press this point here . )
Leave aside beliefs about injustice and rights violation , as they plainly already constitute moral judgments .
The question that Stich is interested in is whether harm attributions are necessary and sufficient to evoke the signature moral response pattern .
If they did , he believes , we would have a nomological cluster sufficient to underwrite the claim that there is a psychological natural kind here .
So he cites and produces empirical data that suggests harm attributions are neither necessary nor sufficient for the signature moral pattern .
The Non-Existence of the Harm Cluster
Let us begin with the data .
Why arenâ€™t harm attributions necessary for evoking the signature moral pattern ?
The clearest experimental studies concern the role of affect .
In the well - known Haidt , Koller , and Dias ( 1993 ) study , it was found that particularly low - SES subjects both in the US and Brazil judged certain harmless but disgusting behaviours to be wrong authority - independently and generally .
For example , many people think masturbating with a dead chicken or cleaning the toilet with an old and disused national flag to be morally wrong .
( Here it is important that â€˜harmâ€ ™ is understood fairly concretely in these studies , and does not include any kind of symbolic harm . )
Thus , thinking that something is harmful is not necessary for evoking a signature moral response .
But are thought about harmfulness sufficient ?
This is what Kelly , Stich , Haley , Eng , and Fessler ( 2007 ) set out to investigate .
Here are two of their best scenarios ( best for their case , that is ) .
The first examines the generality of harm - based judgments :
Whipping / Time
Three hundred years ago , whipping was a common practice in most navies and on cargo ships .
There were no laws against it , and almost everyone thought that whipping was an appropriate way to discipline sailors who disobeyed orders or were drunk on duty .
Mr. Williams was an officer on a cargo ship 300 years ago .
One night , while at sea , he found a sailor drunk at a time when the sailor should have been on watch .
After the sailor sobered up , Williams punished the sailor by giving him 5 lashes with a whip .
The questions that subjects were asked to answer were â€ œIs it OK for Mr. Williams to whip the sailor ? â€ and â€ œOn a scale from 0 to 9 , how would you rate Mr. Williams â€™ behavior ?â€ .
In the comparison case , the time was changed to present :
Mr. Adams is an officer on a large modern American cargo ship in 2004 .
One night , while at sea , he finds a sailor drunk at a time when the sailor should have been monitoring the radar screen .
After the sailor sobers up , Adams punishes the sailor by giving him 5 lashes with a whip .
Parallel questions were asked .
The results were clear : half the subjects thought whipping was OK 300 years ago , while only 10 % thought they were so in the present .
Present whipping was also rated much worse ( 7 vs. 4 ) on the Likert scale .
( In other scenarios , such as the contrast between ancient and modern slavery , the differences in peopleâ€™s judgments were negligible , though statistically significant . )
The second set of questions in the Kelly et al. study tested whether harm attributions are sufficient for authority - independence .
Military / Authority
For many years , the military training of elite American commandos included a simulated interrogation by enemy forces in which the trainees were threatened and physically abused .
Most people in the military believe that these simulated interrogations were helpful in preparing trainees for situations they might face later in their military careers .
Though no one was ever killed or permanently disabled by the physical abuse they received during these simulated interrogations , the trainees often ended up with bruises or injuries that lasted for a week or more .
Recently , the Pentagon issued orders prohibiting physical abuse in military training .
Sergeant Anderson is a soldier who trains elite American commandos .
He knows about the orders prohibiting physical abuse and his immediate superiors have ordered him not to do it .
Nonetheless , he regularly threatens and physically abuses trainees during the simulated interrogations that he conducts .
The second condition in this within - subjects study was the following :
Now suppose that the Pentagon had never issued orders prohibiting physical abuse in military training , and that Sergeant Andersonâ€ ™ s superiors had told him that the use of physical abuse was acceptable in simulated interrogations .
The results were that when abusing trainees was described as prohibited , less than 10 % said it was acceptable , while if it wasnâ€™t prohibited , almost 60 % said it was acceptable .
Thus , most subjects were willing to change their judgment about a clearly harmful transgression depending on what local de facto authorities said .
Stichâ€™s conclusion is that harm attributions do not cluster together with authority - independence any more than with generality ; hence , the features identified by the Turiel School donâ€™t form a homeostatic property cluster , and moral judgment isnâ€™t a psychological natural kind .
( This latter conclusion is emphasized by Stichâ€™s more recent work on the definition of morality . )
The Intuitive Deontologist Hypothesis
Turielâ€™s harm condition is , I believe , derived from the utilitarian tradition that was prominent in English - speaking moral philosophy when he began to work on childrenâ€™s moral development .
His claim , of course , isnâ€™t normative , but he as it were projects on people a tendency to make moral judgments on a kind of consequentialist basis .
( In fairness , he also includes the categories of injustice and rights violation , but this introduces circularity thatâ€™s better avoided , as already noted . )
But the studies by Stich and colleagues suggest this is false .
So itâ€™s worth considering whether another tradition in normative ethics might come closer to capturing how people actually think .
Iâ€™m thinking of a broad church going back to Smith , Kant , and Hegel and continuing today in original work by Elizabeth Anderson , Stephen Darwall , and Axel Honneth , among others .
In this broadly deontological recognition - theoretic tradition , what makes something wrong isnâ€™t the harm it causes , but the attitude it expresses .
The harm , in the concrete sense of the Turiel tradition , is the same if I accidentally elbow you in the stomach as it is if I deliberately do so .
But morally speaking , there is all the difference in the world between these actions .
Depending on the context , deliberately elbowing you in the stomach can express disrespect or disesteem or disregard , failure to recognize you as an equal , and so on .
Of course , if you ask for it to test your stomach muscles , or recognize it as a fit punishment for what you did , it may express respect or benevolence toward you .
Importantly , this is not just a matter of the agentâ€™s intentions and attitudes : whatever my actual attitude , if I have seen too many hip - hop videos and innocently use the n-word to greet a black friend , I may thereby express an offensive attitude in a particular cultural setting .
The moral status of a piece of behaviour depends on the attitude it expresses ( its significance or meaning ) , and the attitude it expresses depends on the context , of which the agentâ€™s intentions are only a part .
So suppose that ordinary people are intuitive deontologists rather than consequentialists .
( This happens to be a part of my version of moral psychological sentimentalism , but it could be accommodated by very different kinds of account . )
In that case , their judgments will manifest the signature moral pattern if and only if they take behaviour to express one or another of the offensive attitudes .
They judge throwing sand in anotherâ€™s eyes to be wrong not because of the harm it causes , but because deliberately causing such harm means treating the other as a mere plaything .
They judge lying to be wrong even if no one is harmed by it , because it expresses a willingness to undermine the victimâ€™s ability to make informed choices about the matter – an attitude that any impartial spectator would resent in the shoes of the victim .
And so on .
Why Disrespect Attibution Is Sufficient for the Signature Moral Pattern
What does the intuitive deontologist hypothesis predict about Stichâ€™s cases ?
Start with whipping sailors and generality .
According to the hypothesis , people are sensitive to the significance or meaning of the action , so before they form a judgment , they have to ask themselves : what does whipping someone say in its context ?
Unlike a straightforward harming action like throwing sand in someoneâ€™s eyes , the significance of whipping may change from context to context .
( Think of whipping an ecstatic masochist . )
If I think about someone being whipped on a ship today , I can pretty straightforwardly ask myself how I would feel were I in such a personâ€™s position , and why .
Given the expectations that contemporary sailors have , itâ€™s hardly much different from my own boss whipping me against my will in terms of significance , so I can confidently take it to express a demeaning attitude , and consequently judge it to be wrong independent of authority and regardless of time and place ( I will qualify the latter below ) .
But what about 300 years ago ?
On the intuitive deontologist hypothesis , to judge this behaviour , I must first form a view about its meaning in context .
The stereotype I personally have , and I suspect many people will share , is that those were different times and different men , coarse and used to harsh treatment , and moreover enlisted in the full expectation of such .
In the world of rum , sodomy , and the lash ( as Churchill supposedly described the British naval tradition ) , whipping must have had a different significance than it does in todayâ€™s rule - focused world in which even soldiers are mollycoddled .
If there was any doubt about this , Kelly et al .
explicitly state that almost everyone thought it was appropriate ( Iâ€™ll return to the significance of this stipulation ) .
Hence , it wasnâ€™t much of a shame to be whipped , nor did whipping express contempt or moral devaluation .
So I predictably hesitate to judge it to have been wrong , and so will many others , as my take on the meaning of the action is hardly anything special .
The intuitive deontologist hypothesis thus predicts the observed responses .
So far , Iâ€™ve suggested that the signature moral pattern clusters with the attribution of expressing something like disrespect in the original cultural context .
When I briefly discussed this hypothesis with Stich last week , he claimed I was flat out contradicting myself â€ “ how could one both hold that judgments are sensitive to cultural context and that they involve commitment to place - and time - transcendence ( generality ) ?
The way out is to go fine - grained about the object of judgment .
The truth in cultural relativism means that it is imprecise to say that people take whipping , for example , to be wrong regardless of time and place .
Rather , the object of the judgment is whipping - in - cultural - context - type - C , such as whipping in a cultural context relevantly like ours .
( For relevant similarity assessments , the attitudes expressed by the practice will surely be crucial . )
Thus , holding xâ€™s wrongness to depend on its cultural context and commitment to culture - transcendent validity are consistent with each other : the commitment is to the generality of judgments about of x - in - context - type - C .
This isnâ€™t trivial , as there may well be several relevantly similar cultural contexts .
For example , the view predicts that whipping sailors - in - contexts - like - ours would be judged wrong regardless of time and place â€ “ for example in science fiction , provided the action would be taken to have the same significance in the context .
The kind of cultural relativism that falls out of the intuitive deontologist hypothesis has nothing to do with what we might call deference relativism , according to which what is right or wrong to do in a cultural context depends on the de facto accepted moral standards of that context ( or , according to a subjectivist variant , the standards embraced by the agent herself ) .
Significance relativism is a form of moral objectivism : if a behaviour expresses an objectionable attitude in its context , it is wrong regardless of what anyone anyplace thinks of its moral status .
The intuitive deontologist hypothesis says that ordinary people are significance relativists but not deference relativists .
At this point someone might object that responses to the Kelly et al. scenarios track ( to an extent ) what is described as morally acceptable in the culture in question , both when it comes to generality and when it comes to authority - independence .
Surely this suggests that people are deference relativists ?
My response is that this is actually a confound .
There are non-accidental connections between the attitudes expressed by behaviours and the local norms concerning them .
The mere fact that an action is forbidden by a social norm changes its significance .
Smoking inside a bar now says something very different than it did when it wasnâ€™t prohibited , not to mention what it meant when people were unaware of the connection between smoke and cancer .
In part this is because we reasonably assume that norms donâ€™t change without reason .
Take physical abuse in military training .
When Pentagon forbids it , we presume itâ€™s because itâ€™s no longer considered effective , or perhaps not worth the psychological toll it takes , or inconsistent with the dignity of the trainees .
Whatever it is , once the change is made , continuing with the practice now suggests insubordination and possibly sadism .
Its wrongness looks authority - dependent , but this is only because significance can be , in part , authority - dependent .
( Hypothesis : if it was made clear in the story that Pentagon only forbids rough treatment out of effete sissiness and Sgt. Anderson is a battle - hardened veteran with nothing but the best interests of the trainees in mind and a proven track record of excellence , his methods would be approved by many more . )
Influence also goes the other way : socially accepted moral norms change when the significance of behaviour changes .
Take norms concerning neighbours .
In a rural society , it was offensive not to greet a neighbour on the road , as it would have suggested an attitude of superiority or , depending on the situation , perhaps shame for oneâ€™s own class .
With urbanization , the meaning of being a neighbour has dramatically changed .
Failing to greet a neighbour need not carry any particular attitude .
Hence , unsurprisingly , our norms concerning it have changed , and many behaviours are no longer morally disapproved .
Since significance and local norms are linked in both directions , it is not trivial to decouple them .
But in principle , we can surely come up with a scenario in which a behaviour or practice is locally morally accepted , but nevertheless ( from our point of view anyway ) expresses an objectionable attitude .
Take another of the Kelly et al. scenarios , spanking in school .
They found that many people judged it to be acceptable in a cultural context in which it was locally accepted ( as a result of regulations by a de facto authority ) , but not when authorities forbade it .
( Local moral acceptance can obviously vary independently of what authorities say , but the two may also go together . )
So it looks like ( many ) subjects defer to locals .
But they may also be making assumptions about the significance of spanking in this context .
To tease these apart , all we need to do is have people read a Dickens novel involving corporal punishment of schoolchildren .
Here we have a society in which the practice enjoys de facto local moral acceptance , but nevertheless plausibly manifests cruelty , smugness , superiority , and other objectionable attitudes towards the children .
If subjects , appreciating the significance of the practice , still go with local norms , they are deference - relativists ; if they go with the significance , they are objectivists .
Note that Iâ€™m not joking when I talk about reading an entire book ( or maybe watching a movie ) : conveying the significance of an action in a different cultural context is not something you can do in a vignette â€ “ even if the significance is the same as it would be in our culture !
( This spells trouble for experimental testing , but fortunately that ’s not my worry . )
Why Disrespect Attribution May Be Necessary for the Signature Moral Pattern
So far , Iâ€™ve argued that the evidence is consistent with the thesis that if people consider a violation disrespectful , they judge it to be wrong in an authority - independent , serious , and locale - transcendent manner .
This analogue of the weaker Turiel thesis is thus empirically supported .
But is there an analogue of the stronger thesis â€ “ that is , whenever a subjectâ€™s judgment manifests the signature moral pattern , she also takes the agent to express an inappropriate attitude ?
Iâ€™ll take a quick look at the Haidt et al. disgust cases .
Start with cleaning the toilet with a disused and tattered national flag .
Think about this from the perspective of the low socioeconomic status conservatives who respond to it with the signature moral pattern .
Are they not precisely the people who find such usage disrespectful toward those who gave their lives to protect the flag and what it stands for ?
Or take the lonesome dead chicken - seducer .
Donâ€™t the conservatives take his behaviour to manifest a perverted attitude toward sexuality , animals , and cooking ?
This seems extremely plausible .
Further , the liberals who think these behaviours are OK might well think that while they are disgusting , they are not disrespectful or offensive .
To be sure , the fact that the disgust cases fit nicely fit the intuitive deontologist hypothesis doesnâ€™t suffice to show that offensive attitude attribution is necessary for manifesting the signature moral pattern .
The point is just that the cases that are counterexamples to the necessity of harm attribution ( and thereby the Turiel paradigm ) are not counterexamples to the intuitive deontologist hypothesis .
Thatâ€™s why I say that ( broadly speaking ) disrespect attribution may be necessary for the signature moral pattern , for all present studies show .
Conclusion
So it looks like there might after all be a cluster of features that moral judgments share , at least for all that present empirical research shows .
Does this mean that moral judgment is a psychological natural kind ?
I suppose so , if natural kinds come so cheap .
In my view , however , we do not need a content criterion for moral judgment , whether it is harm or disrespect ;
Iâ€™m perfectly happy to say that people are moralizing even if they pay no attention to attitudes or consequences of actions , as long as the judgment plays the right kind of functional role .
Conceptual analysis , I claim , tells us that the key elements of such functional role are subjective normative authority ( which includes not only authority - independence but also desire - and goal - independence ) , emotional resonance ( internal connection to guilt , moral shame , and indignation , among others ) , felt intersubjective validity ( expectation and demand that others , suitably informed , share the moral verdict ) , and commitment to practical consistency ( judging like cases alike ) .
But even if you donâ€™t believe in conceptual analysis , the intuitive deontologist hypothesis suggests that you can still believe that moral judgment forms a natural kind .

Lending cut more by banks taking aid
Analysis : Conduct counter to U.S. goal
Banks that received federal assistance during the financial crisis reduced lending more aggressively and gave bigger pay raises to employees than institutions that did n't get aid , a USA TODAY / American University review found .
The reduction of credit during the worst of the recession raises questions about whether the $ 247 billion assistance program achieved one of its primary goals : to stimulate the economy by reviving the flow of credit to businesses and individuals .
USA TODAY and the American University Investigative Reporting Workshop used federal bank data to conduct the first comprehensive analysis comparing the behavior of 940 banks in the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) and 7,400 banks outside it .
Key findings about TARP 's first year :
• Lending fell .
The amount of loans outstanding to businesses and individuals fell 9.1 % for the 12 months ending Sept. 30 , 2009 , at banks that participated in TARP compared with a 6.2 % drop at banks that did n't .
• Employee pay rose .
Average pay at banks getting aid rose 9.4 % in the program 's first year .
By contrast , non-TARP banks increased salaries 1.8 % .
• Cost - cutting limited .
Banks in TARP cut costs less than those outside the program .
Government - aided banks increased branches by 2.7 % while non-TARP banks cut branches by 1.2 % .
The differences narrowed in the last three months of 2009 as many banks repaid the government .
President Bush signed TARP into law on Oct. 3 , 2008 , at the peak of the financial crisis .
The program sought to stabilize the financial system and restore the flow of credit .
Banks have repaid about $ 181 billion , including interest and dividends .
Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , says the analysis shows that TARP " has been highly ineffective . "
The Treasury Department , which runs TARP , says the program succeeded .
Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly says that " overall lending is improving as a result of the government 's actions . "
Laura Chinchilla .
By Elena Zeledon , Costa Rica
April 16 , 2010 -- Costa Ricans have the highest standard of living in Central America including universal free education and health care and a social safety net of workers ’ unemployment benefits and pensions that is the the envy of Central America .
However , these hard - won gains are threatened by the capitalist crisis , the implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement and other pro-capitalist policies of the governing social democratic National Liberation Party .
The NLP won re-election in February with Laura Chinchilla succeeding Oscar Arias as president .
What does this mean ?
Will intensified attacks spark social struggles ?
The reality of Costa Rican politics is always more complex than can be summed up in a few simple sentences .
Such is the case when analysing the results of the February 7 , 2010 , election in Costa Rica .
On the surface , the win by Laura Chinchilla , representing the social - democratic National Liberation Party ( PLN ) , can be seen as the maintenance of the status quo and the social - liberal agenda of the social - democratic parties , which finished first and second in the election .
But this hides important realities .
The vote represented a repudiation of rightist forces that identified with last year ’s right wing in Honduras , which ousted President Zelaya .
The election took place in the larger context of the capitalist crisis and its effects on Costa Rica ; the rise in social polarisation throughout Central America and its political consequences ; and the influence of the Bolivarian movement in nearby Venezuela .
What the election does n’t reflect is the growing social polarisation in Costa Rica .
Chinchilla represents the continuity of social liberalism of outgoing President Oscar Arias .
In fact , barely two weeks after the election was held , Arias announced he was signing the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) .
The treaty was put to a national referendum a little over one year ago , and approved by a margin of less than 1 per cent of those voting .
The campaign around the no vote against CAFTA was a better indication of how Ticos ( Costa Ricans ) view the world .
Chinchilla is Costa Rica ’s first female president and as such represents an advance in the political consciousness of the people .
Costa Rica has a unicameral national assembly with 57 seats , a president and two vice - presidents , with an appointed cabinet serving as an executive .
While there have been several female vice - presidents in the past , Chinchilla ’s convincing margin of victory lays to rest the “ women ca n’t win ” argument used by the conservative wings of the major political parties , and validates Tico women ’s growing participation in the political process .
Her major opponent , Otton Solis , who in 2006 came within 18,000 votes of defeating Arias and the PLN , was this time soundly trounced , gaining only 25 per cent of the vote to Chinchilla ’s 46 per cent .
Solis served as finance minister in Arias ’ first presidential term , during the period of the years of US President Ronald Reagan .
The Citizens ’ Action Party ( PAC ) , formed by Solis after leaving the PLN , represents a more populist brand of social democracy , repudiating some of the more obsequious social liberal policies pursued by Arias
Electoral analysis
The defeat of the PAC was a result of several factors .
Throughout the lead - up to the election , Solis and the PAC trailed not only Chinchilla and the PLN , but also the hard right of the Movimiento Libertario ( Libertarian Movement ) , US - influenced rightwingers who want a wide open market , privatisation and reduced government .
The Libertarian Movement ’s leader , Otto Guevara , is a product of the US Ivy League school system .
Except for the last week of the campaign , when a poll showed Solis in second place , the strength of the Libertarian Movement played into the PLN ’s hands .
The PLN kept repeating that nobody in Costa Rica wanted a Libertarian Movement government , and if the situation were reversed they would vote for Solis to stop Guevara .
This message was taken to heart by a portion of the PAC base and it lost 13 per cent of its former vote , half of it to the PLN .
On the other side of the spectrum , the Libertarian Movement has supplanted the former grand party of the Costa Rican right , the conservative Social Christian Unity party ( UP ) .
But between them , the right was able to garner only 25 per cent of the vote .
The social - democratic and socialist parties took about 70 per cent of the vote .
Their vote reflects the repudiation of any attempt to turn Costa Rica further to the right .
The groups to the left of the PLN - PAC , the Frente Amplio ( Broad Front ) and Partido Renevador National ( PRN ) , were each able to hold on to enough of their urban base in San Jose to maintain their parliamentary representation of one deputy each .
Aftermath
Chinchilla ’s victory was made inevitable by the lack of a clear alternative to the social - liberal policies of the PLN and the lack of a campaign targeting growing frustration with official corruption , CAFTA and its effects on the Costa Rican economy , and urban crimes involving the police .
The pent - up frustrations with the social - liberal policies felt by many Ticos were not mobilised .
On the other hand , the clear repudiation of Guevara ’s support for the Honduran military - civilian coup and his friendship with the newly elected right - wing president of Panama provided an outlet in a much distorted way to express the indignation of the Costa Rican people .
As Chinchilla begins to implement the social - liberal agenda using the crisis as an excuse to cut social services and workers ’ benefits and to privatise key parts of the Costa Rican economy , the honeymoon will end very quickly .
In addition , the growth of the social movements in Nicaragua and Honduras and the escalating social conflicts there will force Ticos to make choices about whether to join the mass movement or to stand aside and let the PLN and the imperialists attack the hard - fought gains of the Costa Rican people .
Costa Ricans obtained these impressive gains through a civil war and a form of social - democratic revolutionary program that included abolishing the standing army in 1948 and maintaining diplomatic political neutrality ( as in Switzerland ) .
They are proud of these gains and , faced with the choices the social democrats will soon hand them , they will begin to mobilise to defend their standard of living , despite the election results .
Postscript , April 19 , 2010
It is not often that history speeds up the tempo of its movement to prove the prognosticator correct .
Since the original story was written , the Costa Rican government has made a hard - right turn in concert with imperialism ’s allies in Panama , Colombia and Honduras .
The opening shot was fired by President Oscar Arias , who took direct aim at the heart of the Costa Rican organised workers ' movement .
Arias , in league with his PLN supporters in the dockworkers ' union SINTRJAP and the “ independent agency ” which operates the port of Moin , on Costa Rica ’s Caribbean coast , attempted to remove the democratically elected leadership of the union and replace it with his toadies .
This was just another , but more serious , attempt by the Costa Rican government to crush SINTRAJAP , which has been leading a 15 - year struggle to stop the privatisation of the port , one of the major employers on the Caribbean coast .
In 1996 , SINTRAJAP was an integral part of Limon en Lucha , a mass workers ' and community struggle which launched a general strike that lasted several months , brought the coast into a situation of dual power and forced the government to deal directly with the Limon en Lucha negotiating committee .
In Costa Rica , the Caribbean workers and their allies , the original workers in the banana and cocoa plantations and on the docks , have a tradition of workers ' militancy reaching back to the early 20th century .
It is thus no accident that Arias , whose term does n't end until May 1 , decided to crush the heart of any potential popular resistance movement there .
This confrontation with the workers has been accompanied by a barrage of neoliberal and repressive operations .
At the level of bourgeois politics , the newly elected president Laura Chinchilla has made a pact with the Movimiento Libertario , thus giving her a majority in the national assembly , and providing a coherency to her political projects .
At the same time , the government has given the green light to a series of legislative initiatives which will open the way to privatisation of parts of ICE , Costa Rica ’s telephone , power and internet publically owned company .
Through its control over the constitutional court , it has approved opening up an environmentally sensitive area to a Canadian goldmining firm .
This has spawned a movement of activists and militants in the union of ICE workers and environmentalists , which have begun organising a one - day national strike , in the case of the ICE workers , and a mass march in San Jose by environmentalists .
More ominously , however , is the government 's attack on the long - held autonomy of university campuses .
In the second week of April the government sent in the OIJ , the investigating arm of the prosecutor general 's office .
This invasion of the campus of the University of Costa Rica , the home of many socialist and community activists , was designed to set a precedent .
This invasion resulted in a pitched battle between students , faculty and the OIJ , with the students setting up barricades in front of the law college on the main road around San Jose .
This police incursion , over the protests of the university rector , is designed to open the way to using state force against student and faculty militants who act as the organisational and political vanguard of resistance .
There will be resistance .
It has already appeared .
The challenge facing the revolutionary left is to find ways to link and generalise the struggles , to give organisational forms and political content to the deepening class and social polarisation , to find ways to create a front of national resistance that can build towards replacing the old power with workers ' and popular power .

Washington is out of control .
It does as it likes , without restraint .
It spends American money and American lives to fight remote wars for which it cannot provide a plausible reason .
It determines what our children will be taught , who we can hire and fire , to whom we can sell our houses , whether we can defend ourselves , even what names we can call each other .
The feds read our email and track the web sites we visit , make us hop around barefoot in airports at the command of surly unaccountable rentacops .
They search us at random in train stations without even a pretense of probable cause .
We have no influence over them , no way of resisting .
Except , perhaps , to ignore them .

Washington has learned to insulate itself from interference by the population .
Huge impenetrable bureaucracies beyond public control make regulations that amount to laws , spending God knows how much money to do God knows what for the benefit of the interest groups that run the government .
These bureaucrats cannot be fired and usually cannot be named .
Congress , like the bureaucracies , serves not the United States but the big lobbies .
The looters of Wall Street wreck the lives of millions , and get millions in bonuses for doing it instead of the end of a rope .
Further , the federal government simply does n’t work .
It is clogged up , constipated , gridlocked , using antiquated technology to do badly things it ought to do and things it ought n’t .
In large part this is because federal hiring rests on the desires of racist and feminist lobbies instead of suitability for the work to be done .
Whole departments — HUD , Education — do much harm and little good .
IRS is ruthless , incompetent , and unaccountable , the tax laws burdensome and crafted for the benefit of special interests and of Washington .
I can change my address with my bank online in five minutes and know that it has been done ; IRS requires a paper form and six to eight weeks to effect the change , and you do n’t know whether it has been done .

It ca n’t be fixed .

 The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . 
A great many states now begin to do a great many things counter to Washington ’s wishes .
I think it wise to keep resistance within the framework of the Constitution , but the entire question comes down to a blunt truth :
No law extends beyond the lawmaker ’s power to enforce it .
Congress can pass a law against gravitation , but ca n’t prevent things from falling when released from a height .
The federal government made alcohol illegal but , in the face of massive public disregard , could n’t make it stick .
What happens if , as may happen , California legalizes marijuana — not just for contrived medical purposes , but legalizes it , period ?
I search in vain for the Marijuana Clause in the Constitution .
The feds do not have the manpower to enforce federal laws within California without the help of the police of California .
What happens if a state passes a law saying that its citizens cannot be forced to buy health insurance ?
What can Washington do ?
It can persecute individuals , but a state , or thirty states , are another thing .
The FBI can arrest any one person , but it cannot arrest Wyoming .
Much depends on how sick people really are of the ever - growing thicket of laws , regulation , imposed political correctness , surveillance , and having to live according to the dictates of remote elites with whom they have nothing in common .

They cannot arrest Wyoming , but they can deny it federal highway funds .

Now , if Idaho passes a law ( I ’m making this up ) saying that no restrictions on the ownership of guns will be enforced within the state , Washington might choose discretion over valor and ignore it .
Legalizing marijuana , however , or refusing to accept compulsory medical care , would be a direct if not necessarily intentional challenge to the power of the central government .
The feds could not afford to let either of these things slide .
The danger of the precedent to the grip of the governing classes would be too great .
A deadly serious confrontation would ensue .
What could , or would , the federal government do in response to defiance ?
Send the Marines to occupy Sacramento ?
Or the FBI to arrest Arnold and the legislature of California ?
Or cut off California ’s financial water ?
No bailout for the state ’s tottering economy , no more fat subsidies to the universities , and so on ?
The question is how ugly might things get .
Washington may be able to make the states back down .
It may not .
The peril for the feds is that it might occur to the states that , while they get their money from Washington , Washington gets its money from the states .
The central government depends absolutely on the states , whereas the states would get along swimmingly without the current central government .
How tired are Americans of a dysfunctional , oppressive Washington , unconcerned for its citizens , unaccountable and tending fast toward the totalitarian , that sprawls across the continent like an armed leech of malign intent ?
That is the question .
The first time a populous states says  No ,  if such a state ever does , we will get the answer .
The United States has been free , prosperous , and reasonably well governed for a long time .
It no longer is .
Things go downward , within and without .
Nothing lasts , change comes , and things break .

I 'm interested in using the Module Pattern to better organize my future projects .
Unfortunately , there are only a few brief tutorials and proof - of - concept examples of the Module Pattern .
Using the module pattern , I would like to organize projects into this sort of structure :
project.arm.object.method ( ) ;
Where " project " is my global project name , " arm " is a sub-section or branch of the project , " object " is an individual object , and so on to the methods and properties .
However , I 'm not sure how I should be declaring and organizing multiple " arms " and " objects " under " project " .
var project = window .
project || {} ; project.arm = project.arm || {} ; project.arm.object = ( function ( ) { var privateVar = " Private contents . " ; function privateMethod ( ) { alert ( privateVar ) ; } return { method : privateMethod } ; } ( ) ) ;
Are there any best practices or conventions when defining a complex module structure ?
Should I just declare a new arm / object underneath the last ?
Nero AG , a company with one of the most fitting names ever ( can you imagine a company called Hitler or Stalin 2000 years from now ? ) , has filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the MPEG - LA .
The German technology company claims the licensing body has abused its monopoly power , and that is has not honoured agreements made with the US Department of Justice .
There ’s some juicy stuff in here .
Nero ’s antitrust argument
Back in 1997 , the MPEG - LA sought a promise from the US Department of Justice that it would not initiate any antitrust investigations against the licensing body .
The DOJ expressed then that it currently had no intention of acting upon the MPEG - LA , but this lack of intention was conditioned on a number of things .
First , the MPEG - LA would engage with independent experts to ensure only essential patents would be placed in the MPEG - 2 pool .
They told the DOJ that the MPEG - 2 pool constituted of 53 essential patents .
Second , independent experts would “ weed out nonessential patents ” from the pool .
Third , licensing terms would be “ fair , reasonable , and nondiscriminatory ” .
Nero claims none of these safeguards were honoured , and here ’s where it gets juicy ; “ absolute power has corrupted the MPEG - LA absolutely ” , according to Nero .
First of all , the so - called independent expert was anything but independent .
The expert helped form the MPEG - LA , helped in drafting the first MPEG - LA licensing agreements , answers questions from licensees on behalf of the MPEG - LA , has attended business settlement meetings on behalf of the MPEG - LA , and has testified before US congress on behalf of the MPEG - LA .
Heck , he is listed on the MPEG - LA website as “ MPEG - LA ’s US patent counsel ” .
Nero also claims that the MPEG - LA has unlawfully extended its patent pools by adding non-essential patents to the MPEG - 2 patent pool .
Even though the MPEG - LA told the DOJ there were only 53 essential MPEG - 2 patents , the non-independent expert added round and about 800 more patents to the pool , extending the duration of the patent pool , since the old , 53 essential patents expired .
“ On information and belief , MPEG LA has similarly extended the duration and scope of its monopoly power in the relevant technology markets for the licensing of patents relating to the MPEG - 4 Visual and AVC [ H264 ] standards by adding nonessential patents to its MPEG - 4 Visual and AVC pools , which now contain more than 1000 and 1300 patents , respectively , ” Nero further claims .
Nero further claims that the MPEG - LA has “ formulated and imposed licensing terms that are unfair , unreasonable , and discriminatory ” , by charging different royalty rates from licensees for the same MPEG - 2 license and by not making any downward adjustment in line with the “ rapid and dramatic ” decrease in costs of implementing the MPEG - 2 standard .
In addition , the MPEG - LA collects royalties for the same device multiple times ( internal hardware , software , monitor , etc. ) , and the licensing body has failed to “ communicate its policies equally to all licensees ” .
Nero argues that these things combined have led to the MPEG - LA having 100 % market share , since every device or piece of software even remotely related to video needs a license from the MPEG - LA .
The MPEG - LA itself has estimated that in 2006 , the value of MPEG - 2 products ( so just that one license pool ) exceeded half a trillion dollars .
Nero also tries to ride the Main Street wave by highlighting the exorbitant bonus culture within the MPEG - LA , which ensures “ Enron- esque ” salaries to C - level officers , including expensive apartments and sports cars ( a Porsche , though ?
Seriously ?
So apart from being patent trolls , these guys also lack any form of taste ) , which Nero claims to reflect a “ culture of greed ” .
“ Such a culture may have driven , and may still continue to drive , MPEG LA ’s wilful maintenance or extension – and other abuses – of its monopoly power to maintain cash flows necessary to maintain the lifestyle that has accompanied such culture of greed , ” Nero claims .
All we need now is Joe the Plumber .
A large part of the suit focuses on the concept of trial software , which , as most of you will know , is an important part of the software industry .
Before purchasing a license from the MPEG - LA , Nero asked if trial software would constitute a sale – the licensing body said no .
At numerous other occasions , the MPEG - LA confirmed this answer “ verbally , in writing , and by conduct ” .
Then , in February 2008 , the MPEG - LA reversed this position abruptly , demanding royalties for trial software , thereby defying the licensing agreements .
The MPEG - LA then sought to use the New York Parol Evidence Rule to hide evidence from the court regarding the parties ’ agreements on this subject .
“ Therefore , MPEG - LA ’s unlawful actions have caused , and will continue to cause , Nero irreparable harm for which it has no adequate remedy at law , ” Nero concludes , “ In sum , MPEG - LA ’s predatory and abusive conduct has caused antitrust injury to innovation , competition , and consumers in the relevant technology markets . ”
MPEG - LA ’s response
According to the MPEG - LA , Nero ’s case is nothing special .
“ I think we ’re looking it as a typical response by a company that has not abided by the terms of the license they ’ve taken , ” said Sullivan & Cromwell ’s Garrard Beeney , the lawyer representing the licensing body in this case .
He states this is pretty common in license fee disputes .
Conclusion
And this is the organisation the pro-Apple / MPEG - LA / H264 lobby wants to hand over video on the web to .
We already established the MPEG - LA is headed by a clear - cut patent troll , and it seems that if any of the stuff in Nero ’s complaint is true , we ’re dealing with a company much more damaging than a mere patent troll .
While I ’m not a particular fan of the whole greed culture wave Nero tries to ride , the remainder of the complaint is made up of verifiable information – information that we were actually already aware of .
The MPEG - LA constitutes a major threat to not only video on the web , but also the digital video industry as a whole .
The MPEG - LA stifles innovation and places unnecessary costs upon consumers and the industry as a whole .
This must end .
Just as we do n’t want Microsoft to abuse its monopoly position , we should n’t want the MPEG - LA to do so either .
From the playgrounds of my childhood home in Chicago to the Olympic village in Beijing , one thing remains constant in competition : if you lack the ability to focus and the willingness to pay the price others wo n't , you will fail .
In business , as in life , this ability to focus with a sense of resolve and passion is essential .
During one of the most challenging economic conditions in our nation 's history , Arizona is competing for something that is even greater than Olympic gold ; we are fighting as individuals and as communities for the health and future of our families , our state and , ultimately , our children .
Candidly , when I was approached by Gov. Brewer to assist her in leading the Governor 's Commerce Advisory Council , I was n't sure the passion necessary to win was present within our state 's political system .
My criterion for involvement was similar to my approach in leading USA Basketball .
First , I was unwilling to " go through the motions . "
Second , if hard things needed to be brought to light , they would be .
And third , I wanted to see a passion to compete .
With that in mind , the governor 's council has attempted to bring business solutions to advance this state .
We have withheld nothing in pursuit of eliminating distractions to the ultimate goal of restoring economic vitality and stability to our state .
We have eliminated the Department of Commerce 's culture of entitlement and political sloth , and we have introduced what I believe to be a ferocious approach to both retaining and attracting business for the benefit of Arizonans , their families and children .
I am proud to have served and I look forward to " getting after it . "
As I said from the beginning , this effort is neither passive nor political .
Let the games begin .

Mandatory Registration of All Firearms
All who purchase a firearm will be required to register that firearm by submitting their name , address , place of birth , phone number , occupation , and sex to the California Department of Justice … .
WTF
Sacramento , CA –-( AmmoLand.com ) -
On April 5 , 2010 , Assembly Member Feuer ( D - Los Angeles ) amended AB 1810 to require the Attorney General of California to permanently keep and maintain a firearms registry that includes extensive personal information of all firearms purchasers .
Under AB 1810 , all those who purchase a firearm will be required to register that firearm by submitting their name , address , place of birth , phone number , occupation , and sex to the California Department of Justice .
AB 1810 is little more than an extreme invasion of personal privacy masked as an important crime fighting tool .
At this point , it is unclear whether or not California ’s existing handgun registration law is helping to fight crime in any meaningful way .
Therefore , it is unnecessary to greatly expand the handgun registration law to include all firearms , particularly given that traditional sporting arms make up less than 10 % of all firearms related homicides in California each year .
AB 1810 will be heard in the Assembly Committee on Public Safety on April 13 , 2010 .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on Friday signed into effect the toughest immigration law in the United States , which President Barack Obama singled out as a “ misguided ” effort that showed the need for national reform .

Police in the border state with Mexico will now be required to determine if people are in the country illegally if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” -- which critics charge will open the door to racial profiling .
Immigration is a bitterly fought issue in the United States , where some 10.8 million illegal immigrants live and work in the shadows .
But until recently it has been eclipsed at the national level by other issues such as healthcare and financial reform , angering many Latino supporters of Obama .
Several thousand people gathered outside the state capitol in Phoenix ahead of the governor ’s announcement , mostly opponents carrying signs saying “ We Are Human ” and “ Enough is Enough . ”
The bill -- passed by the Republican - controlled state Senate this week and signed by Brewer , a Republican -- is expected to spark a legal challenge and already is a hot issue in the run-up to U.S. congressional elections in November .
“ If we continue to fail to act at a federal level , we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country , ” Obama said earlier on Friday at a ceremony swearing in new U.S. citizens .
Brewer said the new law strengthened Arizona and would help keep it safe from drug cartels and other threats .
“ It protects all of us , every Arizona citizen and everyone here in our state lawfully and it does so while ensuring that the constitutional rights of all in Arizona remain solid , ” she said .
Brewer said that Arizona acted because Washington had not , and she said that police would be trained on the concept of what constitutes “ reasonable suspicion ” that someone is an illegal immigrant .
“ I do not know what an illegal immigrant looks like , ” she said in response to a question .
BACKLASH FEARED
While Republican - backed measures such as this anger immigration reform supporters , the Democratic Party fears a backlash from Latinos in the November congressional elections because of a lack of movement on the issue since Obama took office .
The Arizona law is the harshest of a growing number of immigration measures passed by U.S. states .
It requires state and local police officers to arrest those unable to provide documentation proving they are in the country legally .
It also makes it a crime to transport someone who is an illegal immigrant , and to hire day laborers off the street .
The passage of the law , which is slated to take effect 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns , prompted immediate and strong reactions .
“ It ’s a great day for the people of Arizona because once implemented we will all be safer , ” state Representative John Kavanagh , a Republican who backed the measure , told Reuters .
“ The message this sends to the country is that when the federal government lets us down we know what to do and the message it sends to illegal aliens is do n’t come to Arizona , ” he added .
Janet Murguia , president of civil rights group the National Council of La Raza and an opponent of the measure , expressed deep disappointment “ that Governor Brewer chose politics over sound policy , ” in signing the bill into law .
“ The passage of ( the bill ) will legitimize racial profiling in Arizona and it goes against our laws and our values as a country , ” she added .

A MONSTER hammerhead shark caught off the NSW north coast could soon become a Queensland tourism attraction .
Famed Hervey
Bay shark hunter Vic Hislop has bought the 1200kg , 5 m monster and this week transported the amazing catch to Queensland .
The huge shark made headlines in northern NSW last month when it was caught by a fishing boat four nautical miles off the coast of Evans Head .
It had eaten a smaller shark hooked by the fishing boat and then became trapped itself .
At 5 m long , the shark is longer than a family car and could probably comfortably fit a few family members inside its massive belly .
Researchers estimate the shark was at least 40 years old .
Speaking to The Courier - Mail , Mr Hislop said he had not decided whether to house the spectacular specimen at his Hervey Bay shark show .
" It 's a magnificent specimen that 's for sure , " he said .
" I have n't decided what I am going to do with it yet though .
" If I keep it there ( at the shark museum ) I will freeze it first . "
Some species of hammerheads are on the global endangered list , but they are rarely implicated in attacks on humans .
Although that would be of little comfort to someone faced with a shark bigger than most Great Whites , the most feared of all sharks .
And Mr Hislop had even more chilling news .
" That 's not the biggest one I 've seen either , " he said .
" I 've caught bigger . "

Sri Lankan defence ministry begins evicting poor in Colombo
By our correspondent
10 May 2010
Last Saturday , the Sri Lankan defence ministry deployed police and the army to evict 45 families from central Colombo and demolish their houses .
Over recent days , police also have been mobilised to remove thousands of street hawkers in Colombo and its suburbs , in Kandy in the central hills and in the southern city of Galle .
Hundreds of people at Mews Street in Colombo ’s Slave Island area were confronted by police officers , including the riot squad , who had been mobilised to evict them .
The families ’ houses were located beside a school for the children of military personnel .
When people refused to leave their homes , police dragged them away .
Soldiers were deployed around the area .
Bulldozers were brought in and started demolishing houses while local people looked on .
When residents refused to leave the area , arguing that they had a legal right to housing , police riot squad members brutally beat them with batons and chased them away .
Army personnel deleted photographs of the bashings from journalists ’ cameras .
Colombo hawkers after police destroyed their makeshift stalls
These attacks are a part of the re-elected government ’s broader plans to evict the poor from the country ’s main cities and release the real estate for big business developers .
Just a few days after the new government was established following last month ’s general election , President Mahinda Rajapakse placed the Urban Development Authority ( UDA ) under the control of the defence ministry .
Defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse , the president ’s brother , has been appointed UDA chairman .
Placing the defence ministry in charge of urban development marks a further militarisation of Sri Lankan society .
It is another demonstration that the repressive military methods used against the Tamil population in the north and east during the war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) will increasingly be unleashed against working people throughout the island .
Successive governments tried on a number of occasions since 1977 to remove Colombo ’s street vendors but backed away in the face of opposition .
By placing the cities under the defence ministry , the government hopes to utilise the security machine built up during the war to forcibly clear the poor from areas it has earmarked for corporate ventures .
The government has planned several projects in major cities , including Colombo , to attract foreign investment and tourists .
According to the UDA , Colombo will become the “ Core Area ” and will dominate in “ port - related activities , banking , financial and insurance sectors ” on the basis of a “ revised zoning plan ” .
The government is planning to relocate administrative offices in Sri Jayewardenepura - Kotte , nearly five kilometres from the Colombo city centre .
Existing industries in Colombo will be located in free trade zones away from the city .
Bulldozer destroying homes
Gotabhaya Rajapakse declared the government ’s wider intention to remove street hawkers and demolish the houses of the poor while touring the former northern war zone last week .
He told the media in northern Kilinochchi that slums and other “ illegal structures ” were “ eyesores ” and would be removed from Colombo .
The occupants would be provided with new houses to make the city attractive to the tourists , the defence secretary claimed .
According to government statistics , nearly 54 percent of Colombo ’s residents are slum dwellers .
They occupy nearly 1,000 acres of prime land “ illegally ” .
Authorities have accused the poor of draining the resources of the city and causing “ serious nuisance to citizens and impeding development ” .
To justify the removal of Colombo ’s pavement vendors , the government and the media claimed the action was pedestrian - friendly and necessary to eliminate crime .
Friday ’s editorial in the state - owned Daily News commended Gotabhaya Rajapakse for his “ no nonsense ” stand of rejecting “ the pleas of politicians on behalf of these criminals and ordering all unauthorised structures be removed ” .
When WSWS reporters visited Slave Island yesterday , hundreds of people remained there on the roads or in near - by buildings .
Police personnel had been deployed , and army troops stationed at the junction .
Residents angrily recounted that the UDA had called them a week ago and announced that their houses would be demolished on May 8 .
One resident explained : “ Many of us earn a living as street hawkers .
We were asked to go to temporary huts about 4 kilometres away .
There are no toilets there and the huts are not suitable for living .
A UDA official said they had orders from ‘ higher up ’ to demolish our houses .
“ I think this area is being cleared for the defence school .
We were given 5,000 rupees ( about $ US45 ) .
But we refused to take that money .
They say these buildings have been constructed illegally .
That is a lie .
Our people have lived here for about 80 years .
We have legal documents . ”
Another resident said : “ The defence secretary has started this .
This is only the first step . ”
He asked : “ Is this the ‘ wonder in the Asia ’ ? ” — referring to President Rajapakse ’s claim to make Sri Lanka an economic wonder in Asia .
He added : “ Here Sinhala , Muslim and Tamil people were living peacefully .
Is this the way the poor are treated by this government ? ”
A schoolboy told us : “ Yesterday I saw tractors come and break our houses .
I ca n’t go to school for months .
My school bag and uniforms are under the debris .
My sister is facing the same situation .
I am crying , and my mother is also crying .
Do n’t demolish my mother ’s and grandmother ’s house ! ”
Many street hawkers expressed their outrage .
One declared : “ How can we live without our businesses ?
How will our children eat and go school ?
This is very unjust .
We need a fair solution .
Most pavement vendors supported the government in the elections , but since winning the elections the government does n’t care about us . ”
Amid rising anger , President Rajapakse held a meeting with a delegation from the payment hawkers ’ association in Colombo ’s Pettah area on May 4 .
He promised land in the area for 1,000 small stalls and offered to pay 2,000 rupees per day to vendors for two weeks until the construction was completed .
Street hawkers do not trust this face - saving move , and fear that they will be eventually evicted from the new area as well .
There are about 20,000 hawkers in Colombo alone , drawn from the poorest sectors of the country ’s population , including the rural poor and plantation families .
Some of them have been engaged in their small businesses for decades .
Sugath and his father Piyasiri have been selling clothes in front of Colombo ’s Fort Railway Station for more than 15 years , since arriving from Midigama village near the southern city of Matara .
Sugath thought that the cleared area would be allocated to government supporters .
He said : “ My uncle ’s son also works as a pavement vendor .
I have three children , all in school .
Without doing our job , how can we feed our children ?
We do n’t know any other job . ”
Vendors contemptuously recalled the government ’s election promises .
One declared : “ We are poor people .
During the election , the government said that if it won , it would not forget us .
But what has happened now ?
We have been pushed into the underworld . ”
A vendor selling clothes in Borella , another Colombo neighbourhood , said he was taking a risk after the vendors were chased away because he had no other means to live .
He added : “ I have to send my children to school .
The cost of living is very high .
I spend 300 rupees for my daily meals .
We earn different income each day , but it is just enough to live .
We do n’t have enough money to buy goods to sell , so we borrow money and have to pay high interest daily .
The government decision is very unfair . ”
The government ’s offensive against the poor must be taken as a warning to the entire working class .
Working people will be treated in the same brutal manner when they resist the austerity measures that the government is currently drawing up to meet the terms of last year ’s $ US2.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund .

HALIFAX — Prime Minister Stephen Harper said other G8 countries are free to pay for abortions in developing nations , but Canadians want their humanitarian aid dollars to focus on less controversial ways of promoting maternal health .
“ Canadians want to see their foreign aid money used for things that will help save the lives of women and children in ways that unite the Canadian people rather than divide them , ” Harper told the House of Commons in Ottawa Tuesday .
“ We understand that other governments , that other taxpayers , may do something different , ” Harper said .
“ We want to make sure our funds are used to save the lives of women and children and are used on the many , many things that are available to us that frankly do not divide the Canadian population . ”
It was the strongest statement yet from the Conservative government on its refusal to fund access to safe abortion procedures as part of its signature G8 project on child and maternal health — especially on the reason why – and was delivered as G8 development ministers or their designates sat around a Halifax table carefully avoiding the issue .
“ The word abortion never came up once , although there was a bit of talk . . . that each country has to recognize the political difficulties each would have in its own country , ” said Liberal MP Glen Pearson ( London North Centre ) , who as the opposition critic for international co-operation was invited to sit in on the working sessions .
Pearson said potential challenges raised were the rise and fall in public support for foreign aid in G8 populations and differing approaches to health care – especially when it comes to measuring results – rather than abortion .
“ That could be veiled and ( abortion ) could be in there , but it was never overt , it was never said , ” Pearson added .
“ But the idea that we do have to be flexible to other countries with their various needs was obviously there , because they all have different protocols .
So part of what was said was ‘ Look , we all have our different ways of approaching things , but how do we then end up with what we say we are looking for at the G8 ? ”
That cautious sidestepping continued in public .
International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda held a news conference and brought along Rajiv Shah , chief administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development , to insist Canada and the U.S. agree on a definition of family planning that advocates control over the timing of childbearing – which includes the use of contraceptives but does not specifically address abortion – and that the U.S. will support Canada ’s initiative .
But U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke out strongly during a Canadian visit last month about the need for governments to put their personal ideologies aside when it comes to helping women in developing countries obtain safe abortions , and Shah said she was “ absolutely ” speaking on behalf of the administration of President Barack Obama .
“ We know that when we have effective family planning programs we reduce the numbers of both unwanted pregnancies and abortions that are in play , that when people use unsafe abortions , that is technically a cause of maternal mortality , ” said Shah , noting the Obama administration quickly rescinded a Bush - era policy to cut down support for abortion - related aid .
Still , when asked whether the U.S. was at odds with the Canadian position , Shah said “ No , not at all ” on his way out of the news conference .
Adding to the confusion was the suggestion by Oda that there was nothing new in all the recent rhetoric over abortion .
“ Canada has never funded a procedure that included abortion , ” Oda said , even though the federal government has in fact given funds to the pro-choice International Planned Parenthood Federation since the mid-1980s , an organization that is still waiting to hear whether a grant from the Canadian International Development Agency that expired last December will be renewed .
“ Canada will honour its current commitments with all organizations to undertake all the activities it has , ” Oda said when asked whether groups historically funded by the agency that do include abortion as one of their services would be affected .
Scott Cantin , a spokesman for the development agency , said only that “ CIDA does not fund any project specifically aimed at increasing the availability of abortion .
In keeping with existing international agreements , the Government of Canada does not promote abortion as a means of family planning , either domestically or internationally . ”

Pearson said despite the vague wording of discussions at the official sessions Tuesday , his background conversations with delegates – including CIDA experts – at the coffee shop and on the sidelines of the summit involved a lot of questions about the details .
“ This is a political announcement , ” Pearson said .

Not yet born Age ( 1985 ) Not yet born Age ( 2015 ) Late teens Physical description Gender Female Hair color Blonde Eye color Brown Behind - the - scenes information Played by Michael J. Fox

" A teenage girl stepped into the living room at the bottom of the stairs .
Oh , my God !
Jennifer [ watching through the slats of the louvered closet door ] breathed in sharply .
The teenager was the spitting image of Marty ! " — From Back to the Future Part II by Craig Shaw Gardner ( quote , page 69 )
" The teenager [ Marlene ] shrugged her broad shoulders .
She was built sort of huskily for a girl , Jennifer thought , probably one of those high school athletic types . "
— From Back to the Future Part II by Craig Shaw Gardner ( quote , page 70 )
Marlene McFly was the daughter of Marty McFly and Jennifer Parker , and sister to Marty Jr .
Marlene , like her brother , looked very much like her father .
She appeared to like talking to her friends on the video telephone , and seeing her grandparents ; she seemed to get along very well with her Grandma Lorraine in particular .
Otherwise , little else is known about her personality .
Biography
In the original timeline , after her brother was tried in a data - court and ended up going to prison for fifteen years due to being involved with Griff Tannen 's plan to rob the Hill Valley Payroll Substation , Marlene hatched a plan to break him out of jail .
About a week after October 22 , 2015 ( the date of the robbery , at 1:38 a.m. ) , Marlene attempted her plan , but was caught and sentenced to twenty years in prison .
Dr. Emmett Brown , visiting from 1985 , found out about this and traced everything back to the afternoon of October 21 , when Griff had convinced Marty Jr. to join him .
Doc headed back to 1985 to pick up Marty and Jennifer , who were just about to take a ride in Marty 's new Toyota Hilux 4X4 and brought them to 2015 .
In the revised timeline of the future , Marty pretended to be his son .
By saying " no " to Griff , Marty managed to save his future family — Marty Jr. was now no longer involved in the robbery , and Marlene would not have to break him out of prison .
Thus , both McFly siblings were safe .
Marlene attended the family dinner on the evening of October 21 , where she was seen speaking to someone over her video glasses — possibly one of her friends .
She was annoyed when her father asked her to pass the kelp tea , as well as when Douglas J. Needles , her father 's co-worker , called a few minutes later , as the McFlys ' only having one phone line meant she had to interrupt her conversation .
Behind the scenes
Marlene 's age is disputable — a draft script for Back to the Future Part II says she is 17 in 2015 , like her brother , thus putting her year of birth as 1998 .
However , there is no mention of them being twins , and many fans think that she may be a year or two older than Marty Jr. due to the way she acts .
She appears to be within the 20 year range .

When is a cross not a cross ?
When it ’s built on federal land in the middle of the California desert near Nevada as part of a tribute to those who died in WWI , and Catholic Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court say that it ’s a symbol of all soldiers – regardless of their religion .
In the end , five of the Supremes used that rationale to overturn a lower court decision that the giant metal cross must be taken down because it represents one specific religion , Christianity .
The case against the cross was filed in 2001 by Frank Buono , a former National Park Service employee , with the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
Buono ’s contention was , logically , that the all - too - familiar Christian symbol does n’t represent those service members who are Jewish , Muslim , Atheist , etc .
Trying to avoid any violation of the First Amendment ’s prohibition on “ establishment of religion , ” Congress then sold the patch of land around the cross to a vet ’s group .
The lower court agreed with Buono that the cross was a Christian thing and simply had to go .
Five of the six Catholics on the Supreme Court ultimately sent the case back to the lower court for another hearing .
They said the cross does n’t have to go , but can remain where it is .
“ Although a Christian symbol , ” Kennedy wrote , “ the cross was not placed on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian message . ”
But it does , Blanche , it does .
There is nothing in the world that instantly invokes Christianity quite as clearly as the image of the cross .
That ’s because , as Peter Eliasberg , attorney for the ACLU , told the highest court : “ It signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins . ”
For the past 2,000 years , the cross has been used by Christians to mark themselves as “ true believers . ”
Churches are adorned with them .
People wear miniature metal replicas around their necks and are buried with them in their coffins .
Catholics make the “ sign of the cross ” when they pray or pass a church .
It ’s no wonder that in Arlington National Cemetery and every other place where war dead are laid to rest , there are Jewish stars among the rows of white crosses .
“ I have been in Jewish cemeteries .
There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew , ” Eliasberg told the Supremes .
This case should have been a no - brainer for the court .
Too bad five justices think with their bibles , not their law books .
Which is why I still believe that President Obama needs to replace John Paul Stevens , the liberal justice who is retiring from the court this summer , with an atheist or other nonbeliever .
Crosses do n’t belong on public land .

Pininfarina unveiled their new prototype electric car today , called the Nido EV the car is designed to be a modular test bed for future electric vehicles .
The Nido EV was designed at Pininfarina ’s Style and Engineering Centre in Cambiano , Turin ( Italy ) and is designed to be a highly modular vehicle that can be re-jigged from a 2 door city car , to a 2+2 hatchback , into a light van and everything else in between .
The Nido EV features a 30Kw electric motor , a 21kWh battery system giving the car about a 87 mile ( 140 kilometer ) range on a full charge .
The little blue car can manage 0 - 60 mph in 6.7 seconds ( actually pretty good for the vehicle genre ) .
With obvious similarities to the Smart Car and the Mitsubishi MiEV the Nido EV is clearly targeting the short range city mobility market .
This would probably be a perfect car for someone who either lives in a large city or within 50 miles of one , long range driving would n’t be an option but cars like the Nido EV would probably cover the overwhelming majority of most peoples day to day driving needs .

Official Pininfarina Nido EV Press Release
Source : Pininfarina
Class : PRESS RELEASE
SYNOPSIS : Tubural steel frame esigned to adapt to four different , completely electric or hybrid vehicles : 2 - seater , 2+2 , pickup and light van .
To mark the celebrations of its 80th anniversary , Pininfarina unveils the Nido EV , the first running prototype of the “ Nido Development Programme ” , the project for an electric car conceived , designed and built entirely by the Pininfarina Style and Engineering Centre of Cambiano ( Turin ) .
The Nido EV bears witness to the skills and experience that Pininfarina has built up in the development of electric vehicles , paying particular attention to the Segment A city cars that will populate the streets of the future to make our towns more pleasant to live in .
The Nido EV is one outcome of the pioneering , far - sighted decision taken by Pininfarina three years ago , to focus on sustainable mobility , approaching it from various angles : not only the adoption of a hybrid or electric driveline , but also research focusing on reducing consumption and “ wheel to wheel ” emissions , the use of alternative materials that are lighter and recyclable , active and passive safety , and IT , which will have to combine the sustainable use of means of transport with intelligent traffic management .
The exterior design of the Nido EV takes up and updates the lines and volumes that won the Nido of 2004 the award for the Most Beautiful Car in the World in the Prototypes and concept cars category , the Compasso d’Oro 2008 and a place in the temple of modern art , the MoMA of New York .
On the other hand , the interiors of this first Nido EV project are still those of a technical prototype , with no attempt at stylistic research .
The Nido EV is a veritable laboratory designed both to explore the electrification of a small city car and to develop a modular floorpan .
The body structure of this first prototype is a tubular steel frame , while the final version will have an aluminium space frame .
The structure was designed to adapt to four different , completely electric or hybrid vehicles : 2 - seater , 2+2 , pickup and light van .
The Nido EV , a small city car ( marginally larger than a Smart ) , has 2 seats and a permanent magneto rear engine .
The “ Nido Development Programme ” also envisages the development of two more , slightly larger versions : the first will be a hybrid with an endothermic engine positioned at the front and an electrical engine at the rear ; the second will be electric with a front engine .
In both cases , the position of the engine makes it possible to increase roominess to seat 4 , and to improve weight distribution .
The Nido EV prototype is powered by a Zebra Z5 Ni-NaCl battery , which guarantees very high levels of safety and reliability .
When fully charged , it has a range of 140 km and a top speed of 120 km/h ( limited electronically ) , and accelerates 0 - 60 km/h in 6.7 seconds .
The environmental compatibility of the Zebra Z5 battery is enhanced by the total absence of harmful or polluting chemical substances and the fact that it is 100 % recyclable at the end of its life , in fact the batteries are recycled in the foundry and used to produce stainless steel .
The prototype is also equipped with “ green ” tyres , developed by Pirelli paying particular attention to safety , environmental sustainability and saving .
Where climate control is concerned , the “ Nido Development Programme ” will use an AC electrical compressor and a high voltage electric heater making it possible to implement automatic control strategies which will help to reduce consumption in most conditions .
The Programme will also cover research into solutions and light - weight components with a high mechanical / electrical efficiency , and energy saving solutions ( batteries with outstanding charging performance ) and braking systems specifically for hybrid / electrical applications .
Pininfarina aims to become the benchmark in Italy , and further afield , for sustainable mobility , just as it has been a global benchmark for style for the last 80 years , always investing in research and development programmes to tackle problems as they emerge in the motor industry rapidly and methodically .
During the energy crisis of the 1970s , for example , the industry concentrated on aerodynamics and alternative sources of energy to reduce petrol consumption .
Pininfarina replied by developing the CNR Energetica 1 prototype , with ideal aerodynamic bodywork .
Those years also produced the Ecos , the first electric car developed by Pininfarina , underlining that it was on the cutting edge in an area that the motor industry had only begun to reassess recently .
In the 1980s , Pininfarina research into the application of light materials resulted in the Audi Quartz and Lancia Hit prototypes , which explored the use of new and lighter metallic and compound materials .
The 1990s brought greater understanding of environmental problems , more research in the field of recyclable materials and ergonomics , and a more efficient concept of how to “ package ” the vehicle .
Pininfarina offered new solutions with the Ethos macro- project , a family of 3 cars with an aluminium chassis , recyclable resin bodywork and an innovative combustion engine with reduced emissions , building up to the Ethos 3EV in 1995 , another zero emissions car .
More recently , Pininfarina has focused its research on hybrid vehicles , with the Eta Beta and Metrocubo projects , two small cars with modular cabins that also tackle the problems of driving in town and on medium hauls .
Then , in 2004 , Pininfarina returned to the issue of safety , which it had touched on with the Sigma , Alfa Romeo P33 and Sigma Grand Prix prototypes , and in 2008 it proposed the Sintesi , a futuristic concept car powered by 4 fuel cells ( one per wheel ) .
Today , with the new global crisis and the need to curb emissions and consumption , the opportunities offered by zero emissions urban mobility have grown significantly : the world is increasingly aware of the environment , and Pininfarina was the first industrial company in Italy , and one of the first in Europe , to propose a project for a 100 % electric car , the BlueCar , developed jointly with the Bolloré company .
Today , when all the large carmakers view the electric car as an opportunity , Pininfarina takes another step forward , promoting a new philosophy that incorporates the choice of individual and collective electric transport in the context of a new lifestyle that everyone should adopt in order to increase energy saving , and protect the planet .
This is why sustainable mobility has become one of the pillars underpinning the Group ’s activities .
And it is also why the new Nido EV project is now being launched , in parallel with the BlueCar .

Manchester City plan a huge £ 50 m bid for Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas
Manchester City are ready to make a sensational £ 50 million bid this summer for Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas .
Barcelona have known to be interested in signing the Spaniard for some time , but City believe their huge bid could see Fabregas staying in the Premier League .
Arsenal star : Cesc Fabregas in action against Barcelona earlier this month
The move has been authorised by owner Sheikh Mansour , according to a report in the News of the World .
City plan to make a number of major signings this summer in a bid to win the title next summer , and are desperate to finish fourth and qualify for the Champions League to further boost their ambitions .
Liverpool striker Ferdnando Torres and Barcelona star Zlatan Ibrahimovic are also believed to be on their wish list .

Daryl F. Gates , whose aggressive approach to law enforcement as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department was both admired for its innovation and criticized for the racial unrest it provoked , died Friday at his home in Dana Point , Calif .
He was 83 .
In a statement , the Police Department said he died after “ a short battle with cancer . ”
Mr. Gates began his police career in 1949 as a Los Angeles patrolman .
It ended when he was forced to resign in June 1992 , after 14 years as chief , in the wake of riots that followed the acquittal of four police officers in the highly publicized beating of Rodney King .
The years in between were a raucous era in which Los Angeles almost doubled its population while becoming overwhelmed by drugs , gangs , guns and a tide of violent crime .
Mr. Gates , who embraced the tough , principled and inflexible strategy of his mentor , William H. Parker , the former Los Angeles police chief , responded to that climate by stressing discipline in the ranks of his 8,000 - strong department , enlarging the police presence in the streets and developing new policing tools .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The Democratic House leadership has announced plans to ram through a bill to stack the deck in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico .
Amazingly enough , several ordinarily sensible conservatives , including House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence , are poised to help them .
The collaborators ought to reconsider .
Arguments in favor of political self - determination may seem reasonable , but the bill in question actually tramples self - determination in favor of an underhanded political power grab .
The single worst part of H.R. 2499 , dubbed the Puerto Rico Democracy Act , is that it would allow former Puerto Ricans to vote in a pro-statehood advisory referendum even if those former residents are already registered voters in a U.S. state .
Instead of voting “ early and often , ” this might be called the “ vote here , there and everywhere ” stratagem .
It is fundamentally undemocratic at its core .
At its root , the bill is deliberately designed to unfairly make it harder for Puerto Rico to keep its current status as a territory with special benefits rather than as a state .
It does so by setting up a complicated two - step voting process that helps proponents of all other options - statehood , full independence or some sort of weird hybrid - gang up against the option of remaining as a territory .
Several previous referenda have shown that the option of remaining a territory is the first choice of a plurality of Puerto Rico ’s residents , but this system effectively would take that first choice off the table .
There also is the problem that Puerto Rico is a predominantly Spanish - speaking land .
No other state has ever joined the union without having English as its only official language .
Some , like Mr. Pence , might see a move toward statehood from the standpoint of a Jack Kemp - like outreach to people trying to grab the American dream .
However , the late Republican leader himself surely would be turned off by the underhanded features of this legislation .
He also surely would listen to his fellow New York representatives of Puerto Rican descent , both Democrats , who oppose this horrible bill .
Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez and Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez , Illinois Democrat , all have objected to various aspects of the proposal .*
Ms. Velazquez , who favors a constitutional convention in the territory to decide how to approach the issue , testified before a House committee last summer on the bill .
“ The process promoted by those bills , ” she said , “ has been perceived to be skewed in one form or another .
It is now time to break this cycle . ”
There is no good reason for any member of Congress to support such a skewed process .
* Correction : Contrary to an earlier version of the editorial , Rep. Jose E. Serrano ( D - NY ) is a supporter and co-sponsor of H.R. 2499 , the Puerto Rico Democracy Act .

Not so into constructive criticism
Successful screenwriters must be adept at handling feedback , a fact not lost on 32 - year - old Bob Feldman , an aspiring scribe from Tennessee who ’s completely open to positive reactions to his scripts .
“ A guy in my writing group said my script was really funny , especially the parts with the two teenagers talking about sex , ” said Feldman .
“ That ’s really useful , because it means my writing is great . ”
But that does n’t mean Feldman is open to all feedback .
When a friend suggested he develop a stronger arc for the main character , Feldman balked .
“ Look , I ca n’t address every single note I get .
I ’m not a stenographer , ” he said , before listing off all the reasons why the note made no sense whatsoever .
“ I do agree with what [ his friend ] said about the ending being hilarious , though . ”
Feldman is currently unrepped .
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE , Calif. , April 20 ( UPI ) --
The California Highway Patrol said one of its offices was evacuated due to a suspected bomb in a man 's anal cavity that turned out to be a vibrator .
Investigators said a 60 - year - old man stopped in a " No Parking " zone near Luther Pass was arrested at about 4:30 a.m.
April 7 when an officer found him to be in possession of a substance suspected to be methamphetamine , the Tahoe ( Calif . ) Daily Tribune reported Tuesday .

Officers at the South Lake Tahoe area office discovered " a suspicious wire , with an on / off switch " in the suspect 's front left pocket leading to his anal cavity .
The police report said " the subject began to explain his knowledge of explosives and bomb - making , " making officers suspicious of the device .
An El Dorado County Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team evacuated the office at about 5:45 a.m. and rendered the device safe -- determining it was not an explosive device , the report said .
" The vibrator was subsequently removed and placed into property , " it said .
The suspect was taken to the El Dorado County Jail in South Lake Tahoe on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance .
The office was reopened by 9:20 a.m .
Leonardo Da Vinci is generally known to many as an artist above all accomplishments , however he excelled in other areas including mathematics , engineering , and oddly , astronomy .
Leonardo Da Vinci ’s works remain undiminished , as does his mind which was restlessly inquiring for higher knowledge .
His deep understanding of nature and the world and his quest for understanding , led him down an illuminated path .
He fashioned flying machines , crossbows , and cannons , using his deep interest in science to figure out any technical matter .
Using his wild imagination , he turned his sights to the moon .
Leonardo Da Vinci pushed forward using his ideals of shadow and light to observe the moon , thus formulating the Codex Leicester explaining earthshine and his contrasting beliefs , leading to what earthshine really is defined as .
Source
As with photography and art , light and shadow can define an object , area , or even a planet .
Placing yourself in a specific location can cause an object to appear different , thus your perspective of an object that ’s unchanging , becomes fluid .
Leonardo Da Vinci ’s perspective , although appropriately geared more towards an artistic sense , heavily relied on the Earth and the planets themselves .
His works , more importantly his paintings , always reflected the correct light and shading of the background to produce the perfect outcome .
Shading and light were the sources that drove Da Vinci to look to the Moon , thus prompting him to study the Moon in its crescent stage .
In the beginning , it was about observing the light in the sky when the Sun sets on the Moon .
It gets dark -- but not entirely dark .
There 's still a source of light in the sky : Earth .
Our own planet lights up the lunar night 50 times brighter than a full Moon , producing the ashen glow or what some people may call " the old Moon in the new Moon 's arms " .
Of course , Leonardo Da Vinci did n’t realize the technical aspects of his observations , although he did proceed to sketch exactly what he saw in the sky .
Already during the 16th century , Leonardo da Vinci had correctly gathered enough information and drawings to explain the nature of earthshine .
In Da Vinci ’s Codex Leicester , published in the early 16th century , he states his belief that the Moon possessed an atmosphere and oceans , and that it was a fine reflector of light because it was covered with so much water .
He also speculated about how storms on Earth could cause the earthshine to become brighter or dimmer , which is indeed observable with modern instrumentation .
Once again , using his observations of the secondary light phenomenon , he formed these provocative words within his Codex Leicester .
He wrote :
Some have believed that the moon has some light of its own , but this opinion is false , for they have based it upon that glimmer visible in the middle between the horns of the new moon ... this brightness at such a time being derived from our ocean and the other inland seas -- for they are at that time illuminated by the sun , which is then on the point of setting , in such a way that the sea then performs the same office for the dark side of the moon as the moon when at the full does for us when the sun is set .
Although Da Vinci ’s assessment about the Moon is both revolutionary and in some aspects accurate , there are certain statements that have been proven to be erroneous .
First of all , the moon has no oceans .
This statement was clear when astronauts traveled to the Moon in 1969 on the Apollo 11 mission .
They did n’t step out on a fluid foundation , although the term “ Sea of Tranquility ” alludes to that aspect .
They stepped out onto solid rock .
Observers in space , such as the Apollo 11 astronauts , were never able to experience earthshine because they never stayed overnight to view the nightfall .
They may have been able to see nearby objects illuminated by earthshine , as things on earth may be illuminated by moonlight .
However , in direct sunlight , it was nearly impossible to experience the direct effects of earthshine , which would have been a ghostly glow of the moon at their feet .
If neither the Earth nor the Moon is the source of earthshine , than something in the atmosphere has to be the source of light .
In fact , earthshine is actually the Moon ’s night side reflected from the surface of the Earth , and to be more specific , the clouds are creating the reflection .
When we observe a crescent moon , we can clearly see a type of grayish luminosity .
No one could really explain what this glow was until Leonardo Da Vinci looked up at the moon and placed himself on the surface .
If an average person desires to investigate earthshine , it ’s not completely impossible , although you have to know what you ’re looking for .
For instance , when the Moon is a thin crescent , it is visible as a pale - gray ghostly glow over the remainder of the disk .
If you look between the horns of the crescent , you will see the entire shadow of the moon .
This is called earthshine .
Earthshine can be difficult to see less than a day after new Moon because the Moon is lower in the sky .
It is , however , most noticeable between one and four days before or after the new Moon .
Astronomers and scientists believe it ’s best seen at about two days , as the Moons moves away from the Sun in the darker night sky , and before the area of brightly lit Moon overpowers the Earthshine , and the lit face of the Earth toward the Moon diminishes .
The intensity of earthshine varies as the level of cloud cover changes over the Earth , and is an indicator of climate change .
In fact , climatologists have studied earthshine , or rather the Earth ’s albedo in conjunction with the concept of earthshine .
According to Geophysical Research Letters , to derive the long term anomalies in the earthshine effective albedo , ES measurements had to take place .
These measurements allow the astronomers , scientists , and researchers to examine ground based astronomical observations of the bright and dark side of the Moon , thus allowing them to take large - scale instantaneous measurements of the Earth ’s effective albedo , typically over a third of the Earth ’s surface at a given time .
In the case of earthshine , Leonardo believed that the surface of an object reflects the color of the light which illuminates it .
Therefore , the atmosphere which lies between the eye and the object is the transparent medium .
What does this all mean ?
It means that it is quite possible that Da Vinci might have known how the clouds and atmosphere reflected light , however he did n’t consider this a source of earthshine .
Leonardo Da Vinci recognized the fact both Earth and the Moon reflect sunlight .
What he did n’t realize was that when the Sun sets anywhere on the Earth - facining side of the Moon ( this happens every 29.5 Earth - days ) the landscape remains lit -- illuminated by sunlight reflected from our own planet - NASA .
This perspective of the planets allows astronauts today to look upon the Moon as Leonardo Da Vinci once did over five centuries ago , with an open mind .
His immense reputation and the articulation of his hands and mind left others with a lifetime of understanding .

When FireFox was released most users adopted it for the speed and standards support .
But with Opera and Chrome now running circles around it in speed and standards , why is FireFox ’s user base still growing ?
Extensions , extensions , extensions .
While FireFox still holds the lead in sheer volume and variety of extensions , Chrome has caught up enough for me to make it my primary browser .
Lets take a look at the some of the most popular FireFox Extensions , a few extensions I ca n’t live without , their Chrome alternatives and the pros and cons of each .
AdBlock : Unquestionably the most “ must have ” add - on for any browser .
Surfing the web just is n’t the same without it .
Chrome Alternative : AdBlock
While the Chrome version of Adblock renders up ad - less pages , it ’s still downloading those ads in the background .
If you ’re running ad - block to reduce your bandwidth usage , the Chrome version of Ad- Block may not cut it for you .
NoScript : Extra security and speed while browsing by blocking JavaScript , Java and other executable content .
Stops most of the webs worst browser attacks cold in their tracks .
Chrome Alternative : None
While there are built - in options to only allow javascript only on sites you specifically allow , at this time the necessary functions to enable this sort of blocking are n’t available in Chrome .
But do n’t despair , according to the NoScript developers these functions will show up eventually .
FireBug : Web development tools integrated right into FireFox .
Shows download times , HTML , CSS , scripts and live edit any of them .
Chrome Alternative : None Needed ( for small values of none )
Chrome includes a dev console that mimics 90 % of the functionality of FireBug .
To access the developer console at any time in Chrome press Control ( Command on Mac ) +
Shift + J .
GreaseMonkey : Modify any website to look better or perform better .
Add functions that were not previously available .
Chrome Alternative : None needed !
Most GreaseMonkey scripts will install themselves directly as extensions in Chrome .
Not 100 % compatible , you ’ll just have to test to see which extensions work .
FireGestures : Mouse gestures for FF .
Switch to a new tab , open a tab , close a tab or create your own commands .
Opera has this functionality built - in .
Chrome Alternative : Smooth Gestures
Exactly the same functionality , exactly the same performance .
Unlinker :
Take a list of unlinked or linked image URLs and in one click have those images load on the page .
Chrome Alternative : SB Unlinker
Same functionality .
Only down - side is instead of the unlinking function residing in the right - click menu like FF , it resides in a button in the navigation bar .
Functionally its perfect .
Download Statusbar : Skip FireFox ’s native download window and use this much more streamlined and still functional add -on .
Chrome Alternative : None needed !
It ’s almost as if Chrome stole the idea from Download Statusbar .
As they say ; Imitation is sincerest form of flattery .
Smooth Scrolling : FireFox has this built - in , but for some reason the Chrome developers did n’t feel the need for it .
I ’m such a stickler for smooth scrolling that this one lack of feature prevented me from using Chrome at all for quite a while .
Chrome Alternative : SmoothScroll
It does exactly what it says , and because of its customization is better than FireFox ’s scrolling .
A few of the extensions available for both FireFox and Chrome :
Xmarks : Bookmarks and Password Syncing .
Password syncing not supported on Chrome currently .
Cooliris : Transforms your browser into a full - screen 3D Wall for searching , viewing and sharing the Web .
Stylish : Lets you easily install themes and skins for Google , Facebook , YouTube , Orkut , and other sites .
Web Developer : Adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools .
With these extensions Chrome has all of the flexibility plus an extra dose of speed versus FireFox .
I ’ve taken the plunge and am now using Chrome as my primary browser .
The next version of FireFox is aiming to take back the speed crown by incorporating a lot of the features that makes Chrome so great , running tabs and plugins as independent processes being one of those .
Humans should have fewer babies to help mitigate climate change , argue scientists including well - known conservationist Jane Goodall .
" It 's our population growth that underlies just about every single one of the problems that we 've inflicted on the planet .
If there were just a few of us , then the nasty things we do would n't really matter and Mother Nature would take care of it -- but there are so many of us , " the 75 - year - old English scientist told Agence France - Press in an interview .
" We should be talking about somehow curtailing human population growth , " said Goodall , a United Nations Messenger of Peace , whose 1960s research on chimpanzees altered views on the relationships between humans and animals .
" It 's very frustrating as people do n't want to address this topic . "
The controversial topic was not addressed at the United Nations ' climate summit in Copenhagen in December .
Powerful groups such as the Catholic Church oppose contraception , and others see population control efforts such as China 's one - child policy as totalitarian .
Even some climate scientists see limited value in it , because most greenhouse gas emissions come from developed countries with small growth rates .
Still , like Goodall , other scientists , advocacy groups and lawmakers argue that slowing population growth could be key to fighting climate change .
The United Nations Population Fund 's 2009 annual report links slower population growth to reduced greenhouse - gas emissions .
" The whole world has been talking about carbon credits , carbon trading and emissions targets .
But not enough has been said about the people whose activities contribute to those emissions , " the report says .
" Unless climate policies take people into account , they will fail to mitigate climate change or to shield vulnerable populations from the potentially disastrous impacts . "
In December , more than 60 members of Congress , citing in part the need to address climate concerns , urged the Obama administration to improve financing for family planning efforts in a letter to Peter Orszag , director of the Office of Management and Budget .
A report in September from the London School of Economics found that contraception is almost five times cheaper than conventional green technologies such as windmills or solar panels at combating climate change .
It cites U.N. estimates that 40 % of pregnancies worldwide are unintended .
" Stabilizing population levels has always been essential ecologically , and this study shows it 's economically sensible , too , " said Roger Martin , chair of the Optimum Population Trust , which commissioned the report .
The non-profit Trust , of which Jane Goodall is a patron , campaigns for family planning , sex education and women 's rights .
It advocates that couples voluntarily " stop at two . "
Who was deceived ?
Peter Mandelson said the 37 heavy - hitting businessmen were " deceived " by the Conservatives .
Surely not .
They know exactly what they are doing – rooting for the low tax , small state , cut - the - public - services party .
Some are Tory donors , some like Sir Christopher Gent famously said they would leave Britain if Labour won in 1997 ; but here they still are .
All are phenomenally highly paid .
Their righteous protests that the national insurance rise is a " tax on jobs " is good cover but they heard David Cameron 's dog- whistle promise ( when circumstances permit ) to abolish the 50 % tax rate .
Genuine concern about unemployment would consider the cascade of £ 12bn worth of public service jobs that will be lost to finance this tax cut .
No , it was Labour that was deceived .
Some of these businessmen ( all are men ) are on the PM 's business council .
Courted assiduously , they gave nothing in return , like the shameless Digby Jones who took a peerage and ran off after a year to rubbish his Labour benefactors .
Cameron says their support marks " a very important moment " – and so it is .
This is his real " big society " , not a photo opportunity with volunteers but a gathering of the Tory clans .
All Labour did with its prawn cocktail charm offensive was strike a deal : honours , praise and no new taxes on the rich in exchange for a muting of their overt assaults .
But , just like Murdoch , once these wealthy few had a credible candidate , out came their guns .
The deal meant Labour never confronted the worsening dysfunctions of modern capitalism .
Powerless or negligent shareholders chasing short - term profit provided no effective governance of these signatories .
The crisis has brought warnings from all sides ; even the CBI chief admonishes big company bosses who " occupy a different galaxy " .
The governor of the Bank of England , the head of the FSA , Lord Myners and the head of the Treasury select committee all express widely held anxiety that lessons have not been learned , risking a terminal crash next time .
But why should these masters of the universe listen ?
They personally are at no risk : bankers paid no price .
These deregulators and anti-taxers are by nature monopolists , as Labour supporters will find if they try to boycott their businesses .
Lacking tough government control , they manipulate markets , bully politicians and harry regulators .
Pontificating , most are economically , politically and socially ignorant of their country .
They are absolutely unaccountable to the public .
If they venture into a studio , they get kid - glove respect compared with politicians – but in general they shun public appearance for fear of questioning on why , in only a decade , their pay has risen from 47 times to 81 times the average .
Looking back now , it 's odd how insecure Labour was back in 1997 , despite a mighty Commons majority , overwhelming good will , a strong economy , nothing to fear .
Labour had the brains to know what should be done – but it flinched .
As long as money from business and the City flowed into the Treasury to spend on tax credits , Sure Start , schools and hospitals , then that deal held .
No criticism on pay , no scrutiny , no troubling their tax havens , no probing failed corporate governance .
Not until the bubble burst has Labour dared make slight recalibrations .
From Cameron , nothing ; the " change " man offering no change at all .
This is the real class war , as old as the hills .
Never mind Eton collars – Conservatives represent money in all its forms , old and new .
Always did , always will .
Labour colluded in the deception of the public , pretending " middle Britain " was bigger and richer than it was .
It is only just dawning on the true middle that they did n't share in the growth of the fat years .
As 65 % of people earn below average , the median earners – the real middle on around £ 23,000 – gained little .
They did get better public services , but now risk losing those if the current deficit mania groupthink really leads to tougher cuts than Thatcher's .
Let 's hope all parties are bluffing : such brutalism is politically impossible without strikes and riots .
" Efficiency saving " as a euphemism for cuts is the worst deception .
What might Labour do ?
Still wrangling over the manifesto , their only hope is to be the change that Cameron is n't .
Even adopting a few of the beacon policies to be published next week by Compass would energise Labour support – and the opinion polling proves it .
Electoral reform to break the Westminster stalemate ( 65 % support ) , splitting banks to shed their casinos ( 68 % ) , cut Trident ( 63 % ) , take back the railways ( 70 % ) , ban advertising to children ( 77 % ) , replace fees with a fairer graduate tax ( 88 % ) , a Robin Hood tax on bank transactions ( 53 % ) , cap loan shark interest rates ( 89 % ) , create a high - pay commission ( 65 % ) – and a living wage ( 58 % ) .
Take just one of these , the living wage .
Escorted round the Ocean estate by London Citizens community organisers , Cameron was confronted with hard truths .
Before his election , this group lobbying for a living wage cornered Boris Johnson into keeping Ken Livingstone 's pledge to pay £ 7.60 a hour to all GLA staff and contractors .
This week London Citizens cornered Cameron too so he blurted out : " Boris has done a brilliant job by going for a living wage and I think government departments should all consider that . "
There !
Bank it , Labour .
Make a manifesto promise to phase it in .
Tucked away in last month 's Low Pay Commission report is research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , estimating that for every 10 % the minimum wage rises , the state saves between £ 560 m and £ 680 m in credits and benefits .
With the minimum at a puny £ 5.91 , the taxpayer is subsidising employers such as those signatories to pay people non-survivable wages .
When I talked to 14 - year - old Tia this week , she burst into tears as she said she described going without lunch at school .
Her family of five is just above free school meal limits , but high rent , council tax and debts leaves them eating mostly soup and lentils .
One brother reluctantly left school to work as a hotel cleaner , the next is about to leave , though wanting to go to college .
Her mother and grandmother have worked together for 12 years for an office cleaning contractor .
" They are treated like slaves ! " Tia says .
Her grandmother has bad osteoporosis but has to keep earning , yet despite fearing for their jobs they joined the London Citizens campaign .
Where do they work ?
They clean the chancellor 's office in the Treasury .
What 's your favourite piece of technology , and how has it improved your life ?
Without question , my favourite piece of technology is my Nokia n900 phone .
It is super amazing and pisses all over the iPhone .
The ingenious bit about it is that it 's open source , so you can program it to do whatever you want .
I used to do some work with Linux when I ran a post - production house , so we 've worked out how to make it do all sorts of funky things .
Some boffins who we do some work with have connected it up to a Rollodex , so as you spin through your contacts , a motor spins through the rollodex .
And they canibalised an old Speak & Spell , so you can send texts that sound like ET .
It 's the best thing ever .
When was the last time you used it , and what for ?
I use the phone 24/7 – my friends joke about me growing a phone - shaped cancer on the side of my head .
What additional features would you add if you could ?
I would want it to talk to my Mac better , but I do n't think that 's going to happen .
Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years ' time ?
Of course – everything is .
However , the Speak & Spell and Rollodex were supposed to be obsolete but now they are coming back , so never say never !
What always frustrates you about technology in general ?
I think people make new devices in such a way as to make them obsolete very quickly .
Sometimes I want to punch people who make technology .
Is there any particular piece of technology that you have owned and hated ?
The motor car , of course , because I was a danger to myself and others when I drove – I was crashing all the time .
And the car itself is just fucking up the planet .
If you had one tip about getting the best out of new technology , what would it be ?
To never , ever , ever buy the first of anything that comes along – always wait .
Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd ?
I 'm an utter nerd .
I try to pretend that I 'm a cool , funky director of documentaries , but I 'm a complete and utter geek .
What 's the most expensive piece of technology you 've ever owned ?
I used to run a post - production company for a few years and the most expensive thing in that was an HDD5 deck , which cost us £ 80,000 .
It 's now an obsolete format , and I sold it two - and - a - half years later for just £ 16,000 .
Mac or PC , and why ?
Macs , for video editing – I edit all my films using Final Cut Pro , and Avid is the most pointlessly shit platform ever invented .
Robot poledancer , by Chris Atkins
Do you still buy physical media such as CDs and DVDs , or do you download ?
I download illegally quite a lot and I encourage people to do the same to my own films .
Basically , the studio system is just there to rinse money out of the public and the filmmakers .
Why give another dollar to Steve Jobs ?
That 99 c is n't going to the artist , it 's going to Sony , or Warners , or whoever .
Robot butlers – a good idea or not ?
I filmed an event last month with robot pole dancers .
I tried to take one home with me , but she would n't have a bar of me .
So yes , I think replace humans with robots wherever possible .
What piece of technology would you most like to own ?
It 's just got to be hover boots – we were promised back in the 80s that we'd have them by now .
But where are they ?

Allison Lefrak is a Washington lawyer who represents the last of the Russian detainees , Ravil Mingazov , 43 , in the Guantanamo Bay detention center .
Her client ’s habeas corpus hearing is in two weeks and Lefrak was on the phone with him last week when he told her that inmates in his block – Camp 4 , the most compliant detainees – were gathering unopened food and beverages for victims of the earthquake in Haiti .
The U.S. military is using the Marine base as a staging area for humanitarian relief for Haiti .
Though the inmates ca n’t see the effort from their area , their lawyers are very familiar with it since it ’s being done from next to where the attorneys stay when they ’re down there .
Some counsels have told their clients about what ’s going on and the denizens of Camp 4 have limited television privileges and have seen some of the devastation on the news .
“ What our client was telling us is it seems so wasteful for all this food to be thrown away and with the Haiti relief mission next door it was common sense to ask to give it to them , ” Lefrak told me in a phone call today .
Apparently , even unopened food and beverages are discarded .
So far the camp guards have not been facilitating the donations , so they ’re starting to pile up , she added .
“ My client told me , ‘ I hope this story gets out I hope people realize that they ’re all not just a bunch of terrorists and we have hearts , too , ’ ” Lefrak said .
I contacted public information officers at Guantanamo Bay for comment and I ’ll post when I get it .
Update :
I just heard from Commander Brook DeWalt , director of public affairs for joint task for Guantanamo , who says that most meals are served buffet style and while there are certainly leftovers , they are n’t easily or obviously packaged to be sent over to Haiti .
He said the prisoners do eat communally and have bottled water and beverages that they theoretically could compile but that there ’s usually just an adequate amount given for the population .
He also added that as flights have resumed direct into Port - au - Prince and the port has semi-reopened , the U.S. military is no longer using Gitmo as a staging area for relief work .

If you ’re visiting Japan , venture beyond sushi and and try the following weird foods .
These are the slimiest , hairiest , chewiest and smelliest foods commonly eaten in Japanese households .
1. Natto
Natto are fermented soybeans notorious for their pungent smell , which reminds some of dirty old socks .
These slimy beans are commonly slurped for breakfast with hot rice , with the optional raw egg mixed in for added nutrition .
2. Umeboshi Plums
If you thought Lemon Heads were the sourest food of all , try placing an entire umeboshi plum in your mouth — it ’s salty sour flavor will be sure to pucker your face .
Umeboshi photo by tamakisono
The potent red plums are rarely eaten on their own , used instead to season rice , vegetables and meats .
I ’ve even seen umeboshi flavored potato chips .
The Japanese believe that the umeboshi plums help ease nausea from motion sickness , and some carry around the freeze dried or individually wrapped version for air travel .
3. Mozuku
This stringy and soft seaweed may remind you of the handful of hair accumulated in your shower drain , but mozuku is far more nutritious .
The hairy seaweed has got fucoidan , a polysaccharide touted for its ability to enhance your killer T cell activity , giving your immune system an added boost .
Mozuku is usually served cold in a vinegar sauce to distract you from thinking that it ’s the algae growing in the fish tank .
4. Shishamo

Imagine a skinny little smelt with its entire body cavity crammed with millions of small crunchy eggs .
These small fish are grilled and served on a platter with their heads and tails still on .
No chopsticks here – shishamo is finger food .
Rip the fish head and tail off and nibble everything in between .
5. Inago
The small brown crickets resemble roaches when viewed from far away , but I assure you that roaches are n’t a part of the Japanese culinary repertoire .
Inago are caught in rice paddies and either fried crisp or cooked in a sugary soy sauce broth and served as a condiment with steamed rice .
Everything on the critter is devoured — including its sex organs and puny brain .
6. Dried squid or octopus
Dried squid is the Japanese equivalent to beef jerky snacks , but with more omega 3s and a fishiness that can be smelled from across the room once a package has been opened .
Dried squid photo by sushiboy555
The squid or octopus is seasoned , then dried in shreds or rings .
Try the jar of dried baby squid or dried octopus legs made extra chewy with its tentacles .
These dried cephalopods are usually served with some icy Sapporo beer .
7. Mochi
Mochi is a chewy rice cake made by pounding sweet glutinous rice and forming it into discs — commonly served on New Years Day , which is also the day when mochi choking incidents are the highest .
If you ’re tired of your regular bubble gum , you can blow and pop bubbles with mochi instead .
I find mochi delicious when served as a dessert , stuffed with sweetened azuki beans .
8. Konnyaku
Wobbly and low in calories , this rubbery rectangular lump is loved by dieters .
Konnyaku is made from the wild Konnyaku potato .
It ’s very high in dietary fiber , which gets your system clean while expanding in your tummy and tricking you into feeling full .
You may identify konnyaku immediately in the nabemono ( hot pot ) because it ’s slippery body is very difficult to grasp with chopsticks .
9. Koya dofu ( freeze dried tofu )
>
Koya dofu is tofu which has been freeze dried , and sold in many Japanese supermarkets .
Do n’t attempt to eat it uncooked as you may chip your teeth .
When cooked in broth , its texture becomes that of a sponge that soaks up flavors — much like your kitchen sponge soaking up sink water .
10 . Niboshi ( dried anchovies )
When you see a pile of niboshi , it may remind you of a morgue for desiccated small fish .
These dried , salted anchovies are used to make dashi , or fish stock commonly used in Japanese cooking .
The crunch of niboshi are also enjoyed as snacks when sold pre-seasoned with a sweet and salty coating .
If you ’re going to the movies , they ’re available at concession stands , and their crunch is similar to that of popcorn – but fishier .
11 . Anko ( sweetened azuki bean paste )
Anko and Mochi photo by jim212 jim
Most of us are used to eating our beans in savory dishes , and would n’t dream of eating them as a dessert .
Let this be an eye opener for you , as anko finds its way into many traditional Japanese sweets , ice - creams , popsicles and bread fillings .
You may forget that anko is made of beans , as the high sugar content often overpowers the bean flavor .
For beginners , visit a Japanese Dunkin Donut shop and have an anko filled doughnut with some coffee .

During the campaign then - candidate Barack Obama kept reminding us that “ politics is the art of the possible . ”
We were encouraged to understand “ possible ” in the same context as “ Hope® ” and “ Change We Can Believe In™ . ”
That is , the Obama presidency was to usher in a new age where the old business as usual politics of the Beltway would n’t be tolerated .
“ Yes We Can© , ” he insisted , summoning the disaffected masses into an arena of engagement where the entrenched forces of corporatism and corruption could be , would be , overthrown .
That was the promise .
That was the dream .
The reality of the Obama administration has been a smidge less kumbayah than many might have hoped , though .
The health care “ debate ” was as nasty and dishonest as anything the Republic has seen since … well , honestly I can’t quite think what the applicable touchpoint might be here .
Civil rights ?
The Summer of 1968 ?
The entirety of the Reagan years ?
Blowjobgate ?
Heck , I do n’t know .
Suffice it to say that from one end of the process to the other , if a government or corporate official ’s lips were moving , somebody was being played .
In the end we got “ reform . ”
I wo n’t try and parse the details – that ’s been done pretty well in other places – but I will point out that the Monday after the bill was passed in the House , health stocks led a thumping Wall St. rally .
Those of us who believe that things happen for reasons felt this was significant .
The bill passed and signed provided for no public option and much of what the public was encouraged to believe about the bill was … how to put this ?
… open to interpretation ?
How about rescission ?
Denial of care for pre-existing conditions ?
Legal mandate for people to buy coverage but no caps on rates ?
Hunh .
Stay tuned .
Now , if you were even remotely plugged in , you know that the health care debacle sparked a range of responses .
Some said that while the bill was flawed , and that it fell short of what the massive majority of the public wanted , it was nonetheless an improvement , and a significant one .
Do n’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good , they said .
Others saw in the bill an epic betrayal and a monumental bailout of a corrupt , amoral insurance industry .
Obama is a bought - up corporatist , they said , and one who is functionally no different from a Republican .
Some defended Obama , arguing that this was the best that could have been done , given the current construction of Congress .
Others pointed out that he pandered to the “ center ” while either ignoring or arm - twisting the “ left , ” and they noted consistent poll results showing that the progressives were in line with a 70 + % majority of the population .
[ Ed. Note :
See comment # 1 below for an addendum to this section . ]
It ’s hard to remember a time when the idealists and pragmatists were so at each other ’s throats – and I ’m talking about idealists and pragmatists who fundamentally agree on the shape of reality and the direction of the promised land here .
I saw brutal arguments on blogs and lists that , had they been conducted in person , might have come to blows .
And again , I ’m talking about arguments between folks who agree on about 99.9 % of the issues in play .
These were dark moments , and by “ were ” I mean “ still are and are likely to be for the foreseeable future . ”
And by “ foreseeable future , ” of course , I mean “ for the rest of my life and some years beyond . ”
Or longer .
The privilege elites and their divide - and - conquer machine have succeeded so magnificently that they ’ve now wedged powerful progressive minds against each other .
Can I imagine ways we might pull together get the train back on the tracks ?
Sure , but let ’s be honest : there ’s a big difference between “ possible ” and “ probable . ”
I can imagine Martians landing on the White House lawn this afternoon , too , but it ’s not something I ’d wager a lot of money on .
We Americans are bad about that , are n’t we ?
We get all fife - and - drum - corps over The Land Where Anything is Possible® ( well , anything except making education a national priority ) but we rarely slow down long enough to ponder what is plausible .
I ’m not here to tell you what to think .
And my point is n’t about health care policy , although I certainly have my opinions .
Instead , I ’m here to point out that those in the “ epic betrayer ” camp are on the verge of having still more ammunition , because as Jason Rosenbaum explains , the Obama administration seems to be on the verge of abandoning another major campaign issue : net neutrality .
Granted , this is one with more than a few legal and judicial twists and turns to consider , but language like “ keeping in place the current regulatory framework for broadband services ” is rhetorical sleight - of - hand .
It certainly sounds better than “ selling out a campaign promise because corporations are more important to this administration than the people who elected us . ”
But hey , I work in Marketing so I certainly appreciate strategic messaging .
The analysis linked above talks about potential abuses if we fail to enact a net neutrality policy .
What might those abuses look like ?
Well , Rosenbaum speculates at four – and here are some more to ponder :
(1) Block your tweets , if you criticize Comcast ’s service or its merger , especially if you use the # ComcastSucks hashtag .
( 2 ) Block your vote to the consumerist.com , when you vote Comcast the worst company in the nation .
No need for such traffic to get through .
( 3 ) Force every candidate for election to register their campaign - donations webpage and abide by the same weird rules that apply to donations by text message .
( 4 ) Comcast could even require a “ processing fee , ” becoming the Ticketmaster of campaign contributions .
( 5 ) Comcast could reserve the right to approve of every campaign online and every mass email to a political party ’s or advocacy group ’s list ( as they do with text message short codes ) .
( 6 ) If you create a small online business and hit it big , threaten to block your business unless you share 1 / 3 or more of all your revenues with them ( apps on the iPhone app stores often are forced to give up a 1/3 or more ; so are cable channels on cable TV ) .
( 7 ) Block all peer to peer technologies , even those used for software developers to share software , distribute patches ( world of warcraft ) , distribute open source software ( Linux ) .
In fact , Comcast has shown it would love to do this .
( 8 ) Block Daily Kos , Talking Points Memo , Moveon.org ( and its emails ) , because of an “ exclusive ” deal with other blogs .
Or alternatively , block FoxNews.com because of a deal with NBC and MSNBC .
( 9 ) Monitor everything you do online and sell it to advertisers , something else that some phone and cable have done , with the help of a shady spyware company .
( 10 ) Lie to you about what they ’re blocking and what they ’re monitoring .
Hell , the FCC would n’t have any authority to make them honest .
The FCC could n’t punish them .
This is a really , really big deal – in some ways perhaps a bigger deal than health care because of the role that the Net plays in the development of public opinion ( such as it is ) and shaping policy .
And Obama is a big believer in net neutrality .
He campaigned on it .
He continues to be a strong supporter of it .
How do we know ?
Because he said so :
I said I ’m not telling you what to think , but I am going to ask a question .
Begin by watching this brief clip :
The question : how can we credibly believe a word that Barack Obama says ?
Obama ’s decision to sign ( support , push for , cut back room deals for , etc. ) a health care bill without a public option was n’t a departure from a vaguely articulated policy position , was it ?
It was a direct contravention of an explicit campaign promise .
There ’s no gray area here .
The campaigning man said I will not and then the elected official did .
It ’s when like your teenaged kid says “ I will not be over at Billy ’s getting high . ”
Later : “ Where you been , son ? ” “ Over at Billy ’s getting high . ”
Maybe Obama lied or maybe he changed his mind .
Changing our minds happens to the best of us .
Especially to the best of us , because we keep ourselves open to the possibility of new and better information .
Usually when we change our minds on the big stuff , though , we acknowledge that we ’re departing from the script and offer up a defense / explanation of our decision .
I do n’t recall Obama ’s “ I know I said I ’d never do this , but ” speech – if I missed it , will somebody send me a link ?
All I saw was a lot of posing and posturing and a very satisfied president declaring victory .
Regardless , the cold , harsh fact is this : we can no longer believe Barack Obama , even when he ’s making a direct , unambiguous , cross - my - heart - and - hope - to - die promise .
He caved on his signature issue , and whether he had reasons or was justified in doing so is beside the point .
Now he appears to be on the verge of caving on another high - profile issue that , as he himself explains , he campaigned on .
This does n’t mean that his decisions are inherently wrong .
It does n’t mean that he ’s going to be a bad president .
It just means that when his lips move …
He asked us to “ hope . ”
He asked us to “ believe in change . ”
He asked us to embrace the possible .
And now he ’s proven , beyond even the most naïve credulity , that the same - old same - old is still the law of the land .
This ca n’t be a good thing for a man who has to stand for re-election here in a couple of years .
GOP voters are voting against him no matter what he says , and it ’s hard to leverage “ hope ” for “ change you can believe in ” when those who once supported you know – know – that you can not be trusted .
A new wave of strikes against austerity measures are under way in Greece as unions react to social security changes ahead .
It has been a lukewarm return to the pre-Easter labour mobilisations , but it seems that another strike wave is on the rise in greece , once again against the austerity measures imposed under the constant shadow of the possibility of the country coming under IMF supervision .
Last week , taxi drivers performed a two day strike , while lawyers withdrew their labour for three days .
This week the strike forecast , as the media have dubbed it , is more dense .
Kiosks will be shut for 24h across the country , a vital strike at the local day - to - day economy .
At the same time PAME , the Communist Party controlled union umbrella has declared a 48h strike starting tomorrow , which will be joined on Thursday by the overall public sector union umbrella ADEDY .
The ADEDY 24h strike will see all state - run business and services shut , including the greek airspace with no flights performed .
GSEE , the private sector union umbrella is holding talks with the government on Friday before deciding on new strikes on its part .
The focus of the present strikes is to prevent any anti-labour changes in the social security law , an almost certain possibility that has placed the Ministry of Labour under considerable EU pressure .
The minister has pledged that pensions up to 800 euros per month will not be affected , but higher pensions will lose up to 300 euros per month .
Indicatively in terms of the real value of this , a loaf of bread costs from 70 c to 1.10 Euros , while an espresso 1,5 Euros take - away , 2.5 Euros sit-in .

Aphids Evolved Special , Surprising Talents
These insect pests pioneered new frontiers in genetics
An aphid and fungus are linked by a DNA strand .
This DNA is responsible for producing carotenoids .

Contrary to popular belief , aphids are not just sap - sucking , plant - destroying enemies of agriculture .
In fact , these pests are genetic pioneers that evolved two unique traits , according to a study that appears in the April 30 issue of the journal Science .
First , aphids are , so far , the only animal known to produce essential pigments known as carotenoids .
The aphid 's pigment - producing ability is unique to the animal kingdom .
Other animals , including humans , that need carotenoids cannot produce these essentials themselves ; instead , they must obtain carotenoids from food .
Why are carotenoids needed by many plants and animals ?
Because they provide vital support to varied functions , ranging from promoting immunity to reducing cell damage and providing color to fruits and vegetables .
For example , carotenoids give tomatoes their red color and flamingoes their pink color .
Carotenoids also determine whether aphids are red or green -- a color distinction that influences their vulnerabiilty to predators and other threats .
As for the second unique trait , aphids probably acquired their carotenoid - producing ability through a rare , and perhaps unique , process : millions of years ago , aphids apparently " snatched " carotenoid - producing genes from a carotenoid - producing member of the fungi kingdom , and then snapped those snatched genes into their own genetic code .
Gene transfer between organisms is not itself a rare phenomenon .
However , the fungi - to - aphid gene transfer is the only known gene transfer between members of the fungi kingdom and animal kingdom -- which are so evolutionarily distant from one another that it was long thought that never the twain would genetically meet .
But by busting through kingdom barriers , aphids gained something akin to a " genetic magic wand " that empowered them to produce their own carotenoids .
They were thereby freed of the need to scavenge for carotenoid - yielding foods .
The result : one less chore on the aphid's " to do " list , and a new self - sufficiency for these insects .
No one knows what compelled genes to jump from fungi to aphids .
But " the transferred fungi genes may have originated from a closely associated fungus , such as one of the fungi that causes diseases in aphids , " says Nancy Moran of the University of Arizona , the lead author of the Science paper .
" Because the carotenoid - producing genes were the only fungus - related genes that we found in the aphid genes , we think that the fungi - to - aphid transfer was an extremely rare event . "
" This is a very big discovery , " says Matt Kane of the National Science Foundation .
" By recognizing the horizontal transfer of nutritionally important carotenoid genes , Nancy Moran and her colleagues are the first to discover that gene transfer can occur between very distantly related groups of higher , multi-cellular organisms such as fungi and insects . "
The foundation for the discovery of the fungi - to - aphid gene transfer was laid when a research team that included Moran constructed the first map of the entire genetic code of aphids .
Then , when follow - up studies of the aphid 's genetic map were conducted by a different research led by Moran , the presence of carotenoid - producing genes was discovered .
Because a few cases of bacterium - to - animal gene transfer are known and because aphids have close associations with bacterial symbionts , bacteria were initially considered a more likely suspect for genetic swapping with aphids than were the more genetically complex fungi .
But after identifying signature similarities between the sequences and arrangements of the aphid and fungi carotenoid - producing genes , Moran 's team was able to eliminate bacteria , as well as laboratory contamination , as potential sources for the aphids ' carotenoid - producing genes .

Anyone who is a young adult today and who has low self - confidence or few resources can no longer rely on the strength of collective communities .
Individualization means that young adults are on their own when it comes to responsibility for their successes and failures .
This is emphasized in a new thesis from the University of Gothenburg , Sweden .
" Individualization means that the individual must tend more towards self - confidence and support from home .
Social conditions and the class concept thus play a different role today .
The collective community no longer provides the same security , " says Gunnar Gillberg of the Department of Work Science .
He has studied young adults ' notions of work and self - realization .
Dominant role in future
Young adults , those aged 20 - 29 years , will shortly dominate the labour market .
Forty per cent of those who worked in 2003 will have been replaced by 2015 .
Young adults ' notions of working life and self - realization are therefore a factor of significance .
Gunnar Gillberg points out that individualization is a result of altered structural conditions , not of dissolved structural conditions .
Globalization , a global division of labour and a reduction in the proportion of jobs that can provide a basis for a collective society are examples of changed structural conditions and therefore lead to increased individualization .
Strategic choices
" Other structural conditions have increased significance - conditions which were previously compensated for and embedded in collective communities and frameworks .
Family , social surroundings and the local environment have a greater significance than before when it comes to the ability of young adults to develop resources .
In extreme cases , negative identities develop , for example , those associated with criminal gangs , " says Gunnar Gillberg .
Society 's new conditions affect young adults to a particularly high degree .
They must also make more weighty and strategic decisions at a time in their lives when there are great changes taking place .
Social change is thus easy to identify in precisely this group of young adults .
" Potential horizons have increased for most young adults .
However , the ability to realize that potential in an ever more individualized world is extremely unequally distributed .
All young adults are forced to choose .
Not all have the resources to carry that decision through , " says Gunnar Gillberg .

It 's probably no exaggeration to say that Apple 's draconian security policies are among the tightest of any company operating purely in the private sector , with a focus on secrecy that rivals that of military contractors .
But even so , the control freak obsessiveness which Steve Jobs is bringing to bear on the iPad — and the desperate flailing around evident among Apple 's competitors — bears some examination .
What 's going on ?
Firstly , the Apple vs. Adobe vendetta gets even nastier , with a public letter from Steve Jobs explaining why Adobe 's Flash multimedia format will not ever be allowed into the garden of pure ideology that is the iPhone / iPad fork of OSX .
I 've got a theory , and it's this : Steve Jobs believes he 's gambling Apple 's future — the future of a corporation with a market cap well over US $ 200 Bn — on an all - or - nothing push into a new market .
HP have woken up and smelled the forest fire , two or three years late ; Microsoft are mired in a tar pit , unable to grasp that the inferno heading towards them is going to burn down the entire ecosystem in which they exist .
There is the smell of panic in the air , and here 's why ...
We have known since the mid-1990s that the internet was the future of computing .
With increasing bandwidth , data does n't need to be trapped in the hard drives of our desktop computers : data and interaction can follow us out into the world we live in .
Modem uptake drove dot - com 1.0 ; broadband uptake drove dot - com 2.0 .
Now everyone is anticipating what you might call dot - com 3.0 , driven by a combination of 4G mobile telephony ( LTE or WiMax , depending on which horse you back ) and wifi everywhere .
Wifi and 4G protocols will shortly be delivering 50 - 150 mbps to whatever gizmo is in your pocket , over the air .
( 3G is already good for 6 mbps , which is where broadband was around the turn of the millennium .
And there are ISPs in Tokyo who are already selling home broadband delivered via WiMax .
It 's about as fast as my cable modem connection was in 2005 . )
A lot has been said about how expensive it is to boost the speed of fibre networks .
The USA has some of the worst domestic broadband in the developed world , because it 's delivered over cables that were installed early — premature infrastructure may give your economy a leg up in the early years , but handicaps you down the line — but a shift to high - bandwidth wireless will make up the gap , assuming the frequencies are available ( see also : shutting down analog TV and radio to make room ) .
It 's easier to lay a single fat fibre to a radio transciever station than it is to lay lots of thin fibres to everybody 's front door , after all .
Anyway , here 's Steve Jobs ' strategic dilemma in a nutshell : the PC industry as we have known it for a third of a century is beginning to die .
PCs are becoming commodity items .
The price of PCs and laptops is falling by about 50 % per decade in real terms , despite performance simultaneously rising in real terms .
The profit margin on a typical netbook or desktop PC is under 10 % .
Apple has so far survived this collapse in profitability by aiming at the premium end of the market — if they were an auto manufacturer , they'd be Mercedes , BMW , Porsche and Jaguar rolled into one .
But nevertheless , the underlying prices are dropping .
Moreover , the PC revolution has saturated the market at any accessible price point .
That is , anyone who needs and can afford a PC has now got one .
Elsewhere , in the developing world , the market is still growing — but it's at the bottom end of the price pyramid , with margins squeezed down to nothing .
At the same time , wireless broadband is coming .
As it does so , organizations and users will increasingly move their data out into the cloud ( read : onto hordes of servers racked up high in anonymous data warehouses , owned and maintained by some large corporation like Google ) .
Software will be delivered as a service to users wherever they are , via whatever device they 're looking at — their phone , laptop , tablet , the TV , a direct brain implant , whatever .
( Why is this ?
Well , it 's what everyone believes — everyone in the industry , anyway .
Because it offers a way to continue to make money , by selling software as a service , despite the cost of the hardware exponentially dropping towards zero .
And , oh , it lets you outsource a lot of annoying shitty admin tasks like disk management , backup , anti-virus , and so on . )
My take on the iPhone OS , and the iPad , is n't just that they 're the start of a whole new range of Apple computers that have a user interface as radically different from their predecessors as the original Macintosh was from previous command - line PCs .
Rather , they 're a hugely ambitious attempt to keep Apple relevant to the future of computing , once Moore 's law tapers off and the personal computer industry craters and turns into a profitability wasteland .
The App Store and the iTunes Store have taught Steve Jobs that ownership of the sales channel is vital .
Even if he 's reduced to giving the machines away , as long as he can charge rent for access to data ( or apps ) he 's got a business model .
He can also maintain quality ( whatever that is ) , exclude malware , and beat off rivals .
A well - cultivated app store is actually a customer draw .
It 's also a powerful tool for promoting the operating system the apps run on .
Operating system , hardware platform , and apps define an ecosystem .
Apple are trying desperately to force the growth of a new ecosystem — one that rivals the 26 - year - old Macintosh environment — to maturity in five years flat .
That 's the time scale in which they expect the cloud computing revolution to flatten the existing PC industry .
Unless they can turn themselves into an entirely different kind of corporation by 2015 Apple is doomed to the same irrelevance as the rest of the PC industry — interchangable suppliers of commodity equipment assembled on a shoestring budget with negligable profit .
Signs of the Macpocalypse abound .
This year , for the first time , the Apple Design Awards at WWDC '10 are only open to iPhone and iPad apps .
Mac apps need not apply ; they do n't contribute to Apple 's new walled garden ecosystem .
Any threat to the growth of the app store software platform is going to be resisted , vigorously , at this stage .
Steve Jobs undoubtedly believes what he ( or an assistant ) wrote in his thoughts on flash : " Flash is a cross platform development tool .
It is not Adobe 's goal to help developers write the best iPhone , iPod and iPad apps .
It is their goal to help developers write cross platform apps . "
And he really does not want cross-platform apps that might divert attention and energy away from his application ecosystem .
The long term goal is to support the long - term migration of Apple from being a hardware company with a software arm into being a cloud computing company with a hardware subsidiary — almost like Google , if you squint at the Google Nexus One in the right light .
The alternative is to join the PC industry in a long death spiral into irrelevance .
Let 's peer five years into the future ...
LTE will be here .
WiMax will be here .
We will be seeing pocket 4G routers similar to the MiFi but featuring 50 - 100 mbps internet connectivity .
( Meanwhile , fibre - in - the - ground speeds will be mostly topped out at 50 - 100 mbps , except where new construction in high - value areas has permitted the installation of gigabit and faster links . )
Internet access will be increasingly mobile .
Phone screens are okay , but a 7 - 8 cm diagonal screen is too small for anyone aged over 40 - 45 to be comfortable squinting at : hence the market for larger pads / tablets .
The availability of 50 + mbps data everywhere means that you do n't need to keep your data on a local hard drive ; it can live on a server elsewhere , streamed to your pad as you need it .
Apple is known to be investing heavily in data centres suitable for cloud hosting .
There are persistent rumours that " iTunes 10 " will be some kind of cloud service , slurping up your music and video library and streaming it out to whatever device you 've registered with Apple .
There 's MobileMe for email , and iWork.com for office documents .
There will be more — much more .
The iPad by 2015 will have evolved .
There will be smaller models with 7 " / 18 cm screens , and larger desktop models .
Most importantly they 'll be using newer processors , either a descendant of today 's Atom CPU ( remember , Apple 's demand that developers only use Apple 's compiler toolchain mean that Apple can shift the app store to a new CPU architecture quite easily ) or Cortex A9 class ARM cores — dual core , 2GHz , and up , vastly faster than the current machine ... or vastly more energy - efficient at the same performance level .
But where it will really shine — the value proposition that will keep punters forking over huge gobbets of steaming money , in the midst of a PC industry that 's cratering — will be the external benefits of joining the Apple ecosystem .
If you 're using an iPad in 2015 , my bet is that you wo n't bother to have home broadband ; you 'll just have data on demand wherever you are .
You wo n't bother yourself about backups , because your data is stored in Apple 's cloud .
You wo n't need to bother about software updates because all that stuff will simply happen automatically in the background , without any fuss : nor will worms or viruses or malware be allowed .
You will , of course , pay a lot more for the experience than your netbook - toting hardcore microsofties — but you wo n't have to worry about your antivirus software breaking your computer , either .
Because you wo n't have a " computer " in the current sense of the word .
You 'll just be surrounded by a swarm of devices that give you access to your data whenever and however you need it .
This is why there 's a stench of panic hanging over silicon valley .
this is why Apple have turned into paranoid security Nazis , why HP have just ditched Microsoft from a forthcoming major platform and splurged a billion - plus on buying up a near - failure ; it's why everyone is terrified of Google :
The PC revolution is almost coming to an end , and everyone 's trying to work out a strategy for surviving the aftermath .
DENVER - On Monday , March 22 , the Colorado House Judiciary Committee will consider HB 1284 , a bill to regulate the distribution of medical marijuana in the state .
Rep. Sal Pace will offer an amendment to allow individuals diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder to have access to medical marijuana , if they have a recommendation from a psychiatrist .
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is actively lobbying members of the legislature to oppose this amendment .
The actions of the Colorado Health Department stand in stark contrast to the thoughtful process followed by its counterpart in New Mexico , which added PTSD to the list of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana patients in that state in February 2009 .
The New Mexico Department of Health 's decision followed a recommendation of approval from an advisory board of eight medical practitioners , who examined the evidence and determined that the use of marijuana by patients with PTSD could be a beneficial treatment option , if used in accordance with a recommendation from a psychiatrist .

" We are frankly disgusted by the actions of the Colorado Health Department , " said Steve Fox , director of state campaigns for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" After a review of the evidence , health professionals in New Mexico agreed that medical marijuana could be beneficial for patients suffering with PTSD .
By contrast , health officials in Colorado are attempting to deny veterans and other individuals with PTSD a legitimate treatment alternative based on nothing more than fear mongering and misinformation .
We demand that officials in the department publicly release the studies they have reviewed to determine that the risks of using marijuana for PTSD patients outweigh the potential benefits .

" We are further outraged by reports that Colorado Health Department officials are telling state legislators that allowing psychiatrists to recommend medical marijuana to PTSD patients is like giving alcohol to an alcoholic , " Fox continued .
" The sad irony is that many PTSD patients have serious alcohol problems that worsen their overall state of health .
As we have seen in New Mexico , the psychiatrist - advised use of medical marijuana can actually help PTSD patients reduce their alcohol intake , dramatically increasing their quality of life .
Moreover , it is widely known that both alcohol and many of the pharmaceutical drugs given to PTSD patients increase the risk of suicide .
Marijuana use does not .
The Department officials ' callous disregard of this fact alone should make them ashamed of their actions . "

Trust me , no one likes filling in forms — especially on mobile devices where one - handed , on - the - go data input and slow connections are common place .
As a result , designing forms that make mobile input faster , easier , and less error - prone is crucial .
Here 's a few ways it can be done .
To illustrate , let 's look at two mobile forms for booking a hotel : one from the Expedia mobile Web site , the other from the Kayak iPhone application .
Expedia 's mobile
Web site has made several modifications to the desktop version of their hotel booking form : the layout has been optimized for slender mobile screens ; the " search near " set of options has been listed out ; and the room count input uses a set of " + " and " - " buttons instead of a drop - down menu for input .
Yet , there 's still room for improvement .
The form uses a free - form text input field that requires users to provide clarifying information on another screen if a mistake is made .
And in many mobile contexts ( fat fingers , one - handed typing , on the go ) — mistakes do happen .
The date selection field makes use of a calendar pop-up that requires people to tap a small " > > " target to advance to the previous or next month .
The set of inputs for guest count uses ( up to ) three drop - down select menus for input , which require manipulating a list of options in a pop - up list .
Kayak 's mobile iPhone application also allows people to book hotels but it features a few additional mobile optimizations .
Current location is available as a single click input in addition to a free - form text input .
This allows people to search for hotels where they are now without typing .
The free - form text entry field provides inline suggestions as you type .
This not only reduces the amount of typing required ( it only took me 3 characters to see Monterrey , CA ) , but it reduces errors as well .
On the Kayak form , there 's little need for the clarification screen Expedia requires .
The date selection calendar allows people to use a simple scroll gesture to move between months instead of tapping a small target to change months .
Users can just flick the calendar itself up or down through direct manipulation instead of having to use the " > > " control Expedia requires .
The Kayak form does n't use any drop - down menus , opting instead for " + " and " - " buttons that are easily tapped on a touch screen .
( I 'm not sure why Expedia uses these for room count but not guest count as both inputs only need to support a small number of possible values . )
In aggregate , these small enhancements go a long way to making forms on mobile devices faster and easier for people to complete .

In this tutorial , we ’ll be creating a dark , modern contact form in Photoshop .
We ’ll use some layer styles and some basic effects to give a metal cut - out look .
Nothing too fancy but some pretty effective styles .
Final Image Preview
Step 1
Create a new 800×800 document in Photoshop .¬†
Select a dark grey to black gradient and fill in the background .
Step 2
Add noise to your background layer ( Filter > Noise > Add Noise ) .
Use just a slight amount of noise to create a subtle texture .
Step 3
Create the form box .
With a medium grey selected ( # 8a8a8a ) draw out a rounded rectangle in the center of your background .
Add a similar noise texture to your box .
Step 4
Apply some layers styles to the form box .
Add a minimal drop shadow and 1px stroke to clean up the edges and add a little depth .
Step 5
Draw out your input boxes .
For this simple form , we ’ll just be using a Name field , Email field , and Comment field .
With a dark grey selected ( #353434 ) draw out 2 single line inputs and a larger text area box .
Step 6
Apply layer styles to the new boxes .
Apply a gradient overlay similar to the background layer to give some some contrast and interest .
Apply an inner shadow to give the input box a cut - out appearance .
Accent the inner shadow with a slight white drop shadow .
This emphasizes the cut - out and completes the illusion .
Step 7
Next , it ’s onto the submit button .
Create another rounded box below the text area box .
Color does n’t matter as we ’ll be applying a gradient in the next step .
Step 8
Add a red to dark red linear gradient to the button .
Add a drop shadow to add depth and contrast the input boxes .
Step 9
Add the “ Submit ” text .
I ’m using Helvetica Neue Bold , font size 18 px .
Add a drop shadow to the text for a little punch .
Step 10
Let ’s create the checkbox circle .
Draw out a dark red circle onto the submit button .
Apply the following layer styles to give it a cut - out look , similar to the input boxes .
Step 11
Choose a checkbox from the custom shapes tool menu .
Draw out a white checkbox and add a slight drop shadow .
Step 12
With the form elements complete , let ’s add some titles and instructions .
Type out your title .
I ’m using the font ChunkFive .
Type out “ Contact Us ” , “ Name ” , “ Email ” , and “ Message ” using the same red font .
Step 13
Apply an inner shadow to your titles .
Step 14
Add some instructions and some dummy fill text to complete the design .

Alex4Customs ist eine Benutzeroberfläche zum verwenden und manipulieren von Custom Level - Sets für Alex the Allegator 4 .
Wie das Projekt entstand
Mein Sohn kann sich sehr begeistern für das Jump and Run Spiel Alex4 .
Nachdem er herausgefunden hat , dass man auch eigene Levels erstellen kann war er gleich Feuer und Flamme .
Mein Problem bestand darin , auf Grund nicht vorhandener Dokumentation für Haiku , zu wissen wie man den Editor bedient ( Tastenbelegung , Mouse - Steuerung ) und wie man letztendlich einen selbsterstellten Level ausführt .
Zum Glück gab es entsprechende Anleitungen im Internet , wenn auch für andere Systeme aber dennoch zutreffend .
Da mein
Sohn noch nicht lesen und schreiben kann brauchte ich eine Möglichkeit für Ihn diese zu spielen .
Eine Eingabe im Termin konnte ich von Ihm nicht erwarten , also musste eine GUI her .
Hier konnte mir yab ( yet another basic ) gute Dienste erweisen .
Nachdem ich diverse frei verfügbare Level - Sets im Internet gefunden habe , sind auch diese gleich mit eingeflossen .
Installation
Ihr bekommt Alex4 Customs von unseren Repository Server :
http://software.besly.de
Hier könnt Ihr das Paket direkt herunterladen oder unseren Repository Server zu HaikuDepot hinzufügen und dann darüber installieren .
Source : pkgman add - repo http://software.besly.de/repo
Bedienung
Die Bedienung von Alex4 Customs ist denkbar einfach .
Auf der linken Seite befindet sich eine Auflistung der enthaltenen Level - Sets .
Wählt man eine der Level - Sets aus , werden diesbezügliche Informationen auf der rechten Seite angezeigt .
Dies sind eine ( wenn enthalten )
Beschreibung des Level - Sets , die Liste der enthaltenen Maps und ein Bildschirmfoto des ersten Levels .
Drückt man nun auf Start , wird das Level - Set gestartet .
Im Spiel kann man jetzt sehen das Du eine Custom Map gestartet hast .
Da man bei den Custom Maps , wie bei dem originalen Level , keine bereits geschafften Level im Menü auswählen kann , kann man aus diese gezielt in Alex4 Customs auswählen .
Möchtest du in einen anderen Level des Level - Sets in das Spiel einsteigen , wähle den entsprechenden Level in der Map - Auflistung aus und drücke auf Start .
Einzelnen Level starten
Arbeiten man mit dem Editor und möchte seine erstellten Levels testen war es sinnvoll auch für das Ausführen einzelner Levels eine Möglichkeit zu schaffen .
Um dies zu tun , wähle im App - Menü Start single map …
Wähle im System die entsprechende Map und drücke auf öffnen .
Aktualisieren der Level - Sets
Alex4Customs hat eine Update - Funktion über die du weitere Level - Sets von unserem Server beziehen kannst .
Dadurch ist es nicht notwendig ständig neue Versionen der GUI herauszugeben nur um neue Level - Sets hinzuzufügen .
Gehe dazu im App - Menü auf Check for updates , damit das Programm prüft ob eine neuere Version der Level - Sets verfügbar ist .
Ist eine neuere Version verfügbar bekommt man eine diesbezügliche Information .
Führ man diese aus , wird das Update aus dem Internet gezogen und installiert .
Danach wird die Liste der Level - Sets aktualisiert und Du kannst diese ausführen .
Eigene Level - Sets erstellen
Um eine neue Zusammenstellung von Levels zu erstellen ( z.B. die eigenen ) gehe im App - Menü auf Create new map set .
Hier gebe im oberen Eingabefeld den Namen des Level - Sets an .
Dies muss zwingend ein Name ohne Leerzeichen sein .
Dann gebe im Editorfeld darunter eine kurze Beschreibung über das Level - Set an .
Danach schiebe deine Map - Dateien auf die Dropzone , diese befindet sich unten Rechts .
Das Gleiche kannst
Du mit einem Bildschirmfoto von deinem ersten Level machen .
Danach drücke auf Create um deinen Level - Set zu erstellen .
Danach wird dein Level - Set in der Liste der Custom Maps angezeigt .
Info : Alex4 Custom ist noch in einer sehr frühen Version .
Es werden sicherlich noch Änderungen und Verbesserungen folgen , die eine Bedienung erleichtern , oder besser erklären .
Probleme beim Beenden von Alex4
Da Alex4 nur selten richtig beendet wird , wenn man das Spiel verlässt und dieses Alex4 Customs dann komplett blockiert , habe ich ein extra Fenster erstellt mit einer Schaltfläche um das laufende Alex4 zu beenden .
Sollte also Alex4 auch nach dessen Beendigung immer noch in der Tastleiste angezeigt werden , drücke auf die Schaltfläche mit dem Stop Alex Symbol .
Du kannst natürlich auch die klassische Variante nutzen indem Du den Taskmanager öffnest ( Strg + Alt + Entfernen ) und dort Alex auswählen und auf Beenden erzwingen gehen .
Momentan muss das Zusatzfenster einzeln beendet werden und wird nicht zusammen mit Alex4 Custom geschlossen .
Um dies zu tun gehen neben die Schaltfläche und drücke die rechte Mouse - Taste .
Es erscheint ein Pop - Up Menü mit dem Quit Eintrag .

Who'd a thunk it ?
Kevin Costner goes from appearing in a disaster about water to perhaps being a real hero of the Gulf oil disaster :
Desperate times call for desperate measures .
So with hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil still spewing into the Gulf of Mexico each day , and its corporate image starting to resemble the tar - covered sea creatures now washing on to Louisiana 's fragile shoreline , BP has called on Kevin Costner to help stave off environmental Armageddon .
The Hollywood star has been bobbing around the Mississippi Delta helping representatives of the British oil firm and US coastguard test - drive a stainless steel device called the Ocean Therapy .
In a claim which sounds as unlikely as the plot premise of Waterworld , he says it can quickly and efficiently clean oil from tainted sea water .
Bizarrely , Costner may be on to something .
The actor has spent 15 years and roughly $ 26 m ( £ 18 m ) of his personal fortune developing the patented machine with the help of his elder brother Dan , a scientist .
It works like a giant vacuum cleaner , sucking up dirty liquid and then using a high - speed centrifuge to separate it into oil , and heavier water .
When he allowed the local media to see Ocean Therapy in action – albeit on dry land – it appeared to work as advertised .
Yesterday , six of the devices were attached to boats and floated into the Gulf , so the organisers of the clean - up operation could see whether they might also be capable of functioning on the high seas .
" This is a technology that we know works , and has worked for a long time , " Costner said , adding that 26 of the machines are now in Louisiana ready to be put into action .
" I 'm just really happy that the light of day has come to this , and I 'm very sad about why it is .
But this is why it was developed , and like anything that we all face , as a group , we face it together . "
Costner , 55 , has quietly been developing Ocean Therapy since the mid-1990s when he founded the Costner Industries Nevada Corporation , a company which funded eco-friendly research by his brother and a team of scientists .
Aside from the water cleaning device , the firm has also invented a non-chemical battery .
Each of the 26 Heath Robinson - style machines now in Louisiana waiting to be deployed can clean between 5 and 200 gallons of water a minute , depending on its size , said Costner 's lawyer and business partner , John Houghtaling , which means they could in theory mop up oil at the rate it is currently gushing into the Gulf .
Polluted sea water which passes through them comes out 97 per cent clean .
" Kevin saw the Exxon Valdez spill , and as a fisherman and an environmentalist , it just stuck in his craw , the fact that we did n't have separation technology , " said Houghtaling .
" Kevin wrote all the checks for this project .
This was one man 's vision .
Sometimes it takes a star to come in with their money and time to make a difference . "
Larry King talked to Robert Kennedy Jr. who is representing the fishermen in Louisiana in a class action law suit against British Petroleum and James Carville about the incident at the Deepwater Horizon rig .
Besides the problems with Halliburton and their faulty work with the cementing process and the lack of and the lack of an acoustic switch , Kennedy said they were also violating their permit by drilling too deeply .
Although they were only permitted to drill down 18,000 ft. , Kennedy said they now have evidence that they were drilling as deeply as 25,000 ft .
As Kennedy noted and Susie already wrote about here , it seems all they 're worried about now is limiting their liability although the company is now trying to walk that back after the bad publicity .
The Democrats are introducing a bill to raise the liability cap that Kennedy also cited as a problem with their litigation .
I think we 're going to be lucky to ever get a penny back from BP or any of the companies involved but if BP violated their drilling permit as Kennedy claims here , it 's going to make it harder for them to avoid responsibility for the disaster instead of pawning it off on the subcontractors .
Hockeimer declined to describe in detail any of the recovered Web - cam photos , or identify the people in them or their surroundings .
He said none appeared to be " salacious or inappropriate " images but said that in no way justified the use of the program .
Opponents of Arizona 's tough new crackdown on illegal immigration are planning a protest march in Phoenix on Saturday .
Organizers briefed reporters about the march on Tuesday .
They say they predict upward of 50,000 marchers will come from around the country .
Opponents plan to demand that President Barack Obama order federal immigration authorities not to accept custody of illegal immigrants brought in under the Arizona law .
And they want the Obama administration to revoke agreements that allow local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws .
The march is being organized by labor unions and civil rights groups .
Supporters of Arizona 's law also plan a protest on Saturday .
As the opening credits begin , a pair of black - gloved hands come into frame to unlock and open a footlocker containing the cardboard cutouts of the characters .
These characters are displayed with their respective name credit .
As the closing credits end , the same pair of black - gloved hands come into frame to close and lock the footlocker .

As you can see from the video below , the MoD is running at a nice , stable framerate of about 25 fps on Nokia 's N95 8GB and N82 .
Besides the small displays , controls are always an issue when porting 3D - stuff to portable devices .
I have n't found many convincing solutions so far , one of the few is provided by Mr. > Paulius Petkevicious .
Best thing about it :
It works great with MoD !
Final challenge on the way to a good mobile shooter : wireless connection between the players !

We ’ve already got a good handle on how periodical publishers intend on using the iPad to revitalize their businesses , but what about book publishers ?
Outside of just having another e-book platform to publish for , how can the iPad ’s incredible multimedia and interactive capabilities be leveraged to transform the way we experience literature ?
On Tuesday , Penguin Books ’ CEO John Makinson tried to answer just those questions , demonstrating some upcoming books that will be coming to the iPad .
Perhaps the most impressive demo was for the iPad version of the beloved children ’s book , Where ’s Spot ?
which has been transformed into an adorable interactive learning app .
Penguin ’s not stopping there : their Vampire Academy e-book is “ an online community for vampire lovers ” that features live chat between readers ( a nice touch , but parents might get their heckles up at the idea of a real - life Edward Cullen prowling for pre-teens in the pages of their cildren ’s book ) , while a Paris travel guide switches to street map view when it ’s put on a table .
Clearly , this is functionality that is n’t really supported by the ePub e-book format .
Penguin ’s going to be releasing their titles as full - blown apps : “ [ F ] or the time being at least we ’ll be creating a lot of our content as applications , for sale on app stores and HTML , rather than in ebooks , ” explains John Maiknson .
“ The definition of the book itself is up for grabs . ”
It ’s not all good , of course .
Makinson alarmingly threatened literature fans with a version of Pride and Prejudice including videos of Keira Knightly and Colin Firth bovinely lowing Jane Austen quotes in the video margins .
httpvhd://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw5wLaBqdV0
What ’s interesting about the presentation is that it hints that publishers will not so much publish e-books on the iPad as turn their titles into apps .
Because multiple iPad book apps on a single device will inevitably clutter and become unwieldy , I imagine most publishers will release their own “ library ” apps in which their interactive books can be published as in - app purchases .
The end result could be positively transformative : readers will finally start experiencing book publishers not just as printers , but as brands with their own distinct identities defined by the cleverness and presentation of their iPad book apps … something very few readers do today .
With the iPad , Apple looks like it ’s set to make the brand of a book publisher as important , or more so , than its individual titles .
This is going to be very interesting indeed .
Candidate Meg Whitman touts her experience at eBay , the online auction house that made her rich , but her career and personal fortune are entwined with another company : the Goldman Sachs investment bank , a major player in public finance in the state she wants to lead .
Whitman 's relationship with the giant Wall Street firm - as investor , corporate director and recipient of both insider stock deals and campaign donations - could pose conflicts of interest if the Republican front - runner is elected governor of California , critics say .
From 1998 to 2002 , while she was CEO of eBay , Whitman helped steer millions of dollars of her company 's investment banking business to Goldman , court records show .
In 2001 , Goldman put Whitman on its corporate board , paying her an estimated $ 475,000 for little more than a year of part - time service .
The company also gave her insider access to the initial public offerings of hot stocks worth millions , according to the records .
Whitman left the board in 2002 after she was singled out in a congressional probe of bond underwriters and " spinning " - a financial maneuver , now banned , in which Goldman and other firms allegedly traded access to hot IPOs for bond business .
Whitman later settled a shareholder lawsuit related to profits she and other execs made from buying the IPOs .
In recent years , Whitman has kept part of her fortune , estimated by Forbes magazine to be $ 1.2 billion , in investment funds managed by Goldman , her financial disclosure report indicates .
For her campaign , she 's received $ 105,500 in donations from Goldman executives , state records show .
Major player in finance
Meanwhile , Goldman is a major player in California state finance .
It has been the underwriter of $ 78.9 billion in bonds issued by the state since 2006 , records show , second only to Merrill Lynch , now a division of Bank of America , which was underwriter of $ 79.3 billion in the same period .
Goldman was underwriter of more than 2 percent of the bonds issued by the state in the past five years , the records show .
State pension funds , meanwhile , have invested more than $ 1.3 billion with Goldman .
The firm has sought other state business as well .
In 2007 , Goldman and the now - defunct Lehman Bros. investment bank pitched Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on an ambitious plan to boost state revenue by privatizing the California Lottery , according to news reports .
Goldman also urged the governor to raise money by selling EdFund , the state agency that insures student loans .
Schwarzenegger expressed interest , but the ideas were n't carried out .
With Goldman active on so many state issues , Whitman would face " a pile of potential conflicts of interest " if elected governor , said Doug Heller , spokesman for Consumer Watchdog of Santa Monica .
Whitman declined to be interviewed for this story , but her campaign lawyer said conflict concerns were overblown .
If elected , Whitman will sell her Goldman stock and put the rest of her portfolio , including her Goldman - managed investments , into a blind trust , the lawyer , Tom Hiltachk , said in a written statement .
That will " put further distance between Meg 's assets and her duties as governor , " he wrote .
Meanwhile , Whitman will " scrupulously " follow state law to avoid conflicts , he wrote .
Goldman could have ' access '
Eric Jackson , founder of the Ironfire Capital hedge fund in Florida and an advocate of corporate reform , said concerns could arise even after Whitman sold her Goldman holdings .
Given its long relationship with Whitman , Goldman probably would enjoy " access , and being able to make their case in terms of lobbying or certain outcomes that benefit them , " he said .
Whitman 's association with Goldman also raises questions about her values and judgment , some Wall Street reformers say .
While Whitman was on Goldman 's board , she served on the compensation committee , which approved multimillion - dollar bonus packages for then - CEO Henry Paulson and his top aides .
Also during Whitman 's service , Goldman invested $ 140 billion into mortgage - backed securities .
Years after she left , the firm sold off $ 135 billion in bonds tied to the risky home loans , according to published accounts , essentially unloading the assets before the market plunged and sent the nation into economic crisis .
Goldman 's dealings in the ramp - up to world recession have made the firm a lightning rod for criticism , especially as it has rebounded with record profits while the national unemployment rate hovers around 10 percent .
Wall Street 's spiral
Whitman 's campaign attorney said it was " plainly ridiculous " to hold Whitman responsible for the problems of Wall Street because she spent 15 months on Goldman 's board .
" Making Meg culpable for the culture of Wall Street ... is a stretch too far , " Hiltachk wrote .
He did n't respond to questions about decisions she made on the Goldman board .
In recent years , Whitman has only occasionally referred to her time at Goldman Sachs .
During the 2002 IPO " spinning " controversy , Whitman denied wrongdoing , telling eBay employees in a memo that Goldman had offered her stock deals because she was a private client of the firm , not in exchange for eBay 's bond business .
In her autobiography , " The Power of Many , " Whitman said she quit Goldman 's board because CEO Paulson wanted directors only to " rubber stamp " decisions he had already made .
Bill Whalen , a fellow at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution and a former adviser to Gov. Pete Wilson , warned that Democrats would face blowback if they attempted " to use Goldman as a bludgeon " against Whitman in the governor 's race .
" There 's a long list of Democrats who have ties to Goldman , " Whalen said , starting with former state Treasurer Kathleen Brown , who is a Goldman executive in Los Angeles .
Her brother , Democrat Jerry Brown , the former California governor who is expected to face Whitman in November if she wins the June 8 primary election , has no Goldman investments , campaign manager Steve Glazer said .
State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner , Whitman 's rival for the GOP gubernatorial nomination , borrowed $ 500,000 from Goldman in 2003 for an unsuccessful campaign for the state Assembly , records show .
Underwriter 's role
Based on Wall Street but with offices around the world , Goldman Sachs underwrites stocks and bonds , provides financing for business mergers , and manages the money of high - wealth individuals , corporations and even governments .
In 1998 , shortly after she became CEO at eBay , Whitman and the eBay board hired Goldman Sachs to underwrite a $ 72.5 million IPO .
The next year , Goldman was hired again , this time for an additional sale of $ 1.25 billion worth of stock .
Also in 1999 , Whitman and her husband , Stanford School of Medicine neurosurgery Professor Griffith Harsh , began investing their personal wealth with Goldman , her lawyer said .
In July 2002 , eBay hired Goldman again , this time to handle eBay 's $ 1.5 billion acquisition of the online payment business PayPal .
Goldman was paid more than $ 8 million for its work at eBay , wrote Delaware Judge William Chandler , who later presided over a shareholders ' lawsuit concerning the IPOs .
More important , Goldman also was able to buy 1.2 million shares of eBay stock at the IPO price of $ 18 , the judge wrote in an opinion on the case .
A year later , the stock was trading at $ 175 - a bump of $ 188.4 million .
While seeking eBay 's underwriting business , Goldman repeatedly gave Whitman and three other eBay officials the chance to buy IPO stock of other firms Goldman was taking public .
Whitman bought more than 100 offerings , according to the judge 's account .
The executives " were able to flip these investments into instant profit , " the judge wrote .
" Whitman sold these equities in the open market and reaped millions of dollars in profit . "
Joining Goldman 's board
By the time of the PayPal deal , Whitman was also a Goldman director .
Appointed in October 2001 , she was paid a package of cash and stock options for attending board and committee meetings .
An expert who reviewed the pay package for this report said Whitman received the equivalent of $ 475,000 for attending perhaps a dozen meetings over the 15 months she was on the board .
When she was on the board 's compensation committee , it twice signed off on big bonus packages for Paulson and four other top executives , including then - Vice Chairman Lloyd Blankfein , now CEO .
Paulson 's 2001 bonus package was $ 11.5 million , more than 19 times his salary , records show .
The company earned $ 2.3 billion that year .
In her two years on the committee , the five men were paid $ 79 million in bonuses .
The trend continued as Goldman 's profits soared in the intervening years .
In January , under pressure from shareholders ' lawsuits , Goldman agreed to slash its bonus pool and cut back on pay by about 15 percent .
Whitman left the board soon after the IPO " spinning " controversy became public .
In October 2002 , Rep. Michael Oxley , R - Ohio , chair of the House Financial Services Committee , identified 21 business executives who he said had obtained IPOs from Goldman and two other firms in exchange for bond business .
Oxley called the transactions " corrupt . "
Settling ' spinning ' complaint
The executives he named included William Clay Ford of Ford Motor Co. , Enron CEO Kenneth Lay , Yahoo founder Jerry Yang - and Whitman .
Goldman denied wrongdoing but , months later , paid $ 110 million to settle its part of a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint that accused 10 Wall Street firms of misleading customers with biased stock research .
As part of that settlement , " spinning " of IPOs was banned , records show .
For her part , Whitman insisted she had done nothing illegal or unethical , saying she was the victim of " the climate of finger pointing and scandal , " that accompanied the bursting of the dot - com bubble .
She made a profit of $ 1.78 million on the IPOs , she told eBay employees .
It was " a very small fraction of my investment portfolio , " she wrote in her book .
Nevertheless , two shareholder groups sued Whitman and the other eBay insiders , contending that money from flipping the IPOs should have gone to eBay .
Eventually , Whitman and the other officials paid about $ 3 million to eBay to settle the suits .
Goldman paid $ 395,000 of the settlement , she wrote in her book .
Goldman declined to comment for this story .
Whitman 's investments
Today , Whitman 's connection to Goldman endures through her investments .
The financial report she filed as a candidate requires her only to give a general estimate of the value of her investments .
Her lawyer declined to disclose the total value of her Goldman portfolio .
Still , the documents show she has a multimillion - dollar stake in 21 different investment funds managed by Goldman .
Most are private equity funds open only to investors who can put millions into a single fund .
She has more than $ 1 million in the firm 's Whitehall Street real estate funds , owner of the famed La Costa Resort in Carlsbad ( San Diego County ) at a deep discount ; $ 2 million in mezzanine funds , which provide high - cost financing , often for corporate leveraged buyouts ; and more than $ 3 million in a telecom - related fund .
She has more than $ 1 million each in two Goldman " distressed opportunity " funds , which focus on companies facing possible bankruptcy .
State 's ties to Goldman
Meanwhile , retirement funds for state workers , teachers and employees of the University of California have more than $ 1.3 billion in Goldman stock or equity funds .
CalSTRS , the California State Teachers ' Retirement Fund , has $ 299 million in a single Goldman investment .
Last fall , Goldman was underwriter of $ 8.8 billion in revenue anticipation notes when the cash - strapped state had to borrow to pay its bills .
More state borrowing - and thus , more bond issues - will be required before California gets its budget mess straightened out , experts say .
If voters approve the $ 11 billion state water bond on the November ballot , " it 's a certainty " that Goldman will be among the underwriters , said Tom Dresslar , spokesman for state Treasurer Bill Lockyer .
The treasurer 's office , not the governor , selects bond underwriters , and state retirement boards sign off on investments .
But the governor has appointment authority at the retirement boards , and the power to propose and promote bond issues .
Campaign funding
The issue of global warming probably will bring California 's next governor into contact with Goldman .
With the passage of AB32 , California is on the verge of creating a " market - based program to cap carbon emissions , " the governor has said .
Goldman has expressed interest in entering the cap - and - trade market .
Schwarzenegger , a proponent of the new law , has met with Goldman on global warming issues , he said in a press release .
Whitman 's other continuing connection with Goldman involves campaign cash .
Of the money she 's received from Goldman employees , $ 94,300 came from eight California - based executives of the firm .
If she is elected , Whitman will have to " disclose decisions that are being made by Goldman - and her part in them that relate to California , " said Robert A.G. Monks , a former federal pension trustee and an expert in corporate governance .
" Frankly , I do n't know how she 's going to do that , because there 's a lot of it . "

A British reporter who reported on an apparent cover -up of the killing of an Afghan family says the NATO - led forces in that country habitually lie about innocent civilians ’ deaths .
Jerome Starkey , the Afghanistan correspondent for the Times of London , says the “ embed culture ” of reporting in war zones results in military censorship and self - censorship that allows military commanders to get away with falsehoods about civilian deaths .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an article for Harvard University ’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism , Starkey explained he never would have discovered that locals in Paktia agree it was US and Afghan forces who killed two pregnant women , a teenage girl and two local government officials during a February night - time raid .
Starkey reported earlier this month at the Times of London :
The operation on Friday , February 12 , was a botched pre-dawn assault on a policeman ’s home a few miles outside Gardez , the capital of Paktia province , eastern Afghanistan .
In a statement after the raid titled “ Joint force operating in Gardez makes gruesome discovery ” , Nato claimed that the force had found the women ’s bodies “ tied up , gagged and killed ” in a room .
A Times investigation suggests that Nato ’s claims are either wilfully false or , at best , misleading .
More than a dozen survivors , officials , police chiefs and a religious leader interviewed at and around the scene of the attack maintain that the perpetrators were US and Afghan gunmen .
The identity and status of the soldiers is unknown .
“ The only way I found out NATO had lied — deliberately or otherwise — was because I went to the scene of the raid , in Paktia province , and spent three days interviewing the survivors , ” Starkey writes at the Nieman Web site .
“ In Afghanistan that is quite unusual .
… NATO is rarely called to account .
Their version of events , usually originating from the soldiers involved , is rarely seriously challenged . ”
Starkey says there is overwhelming military influence exerted on reporters in Afghanistan .

Some journalists in Kabul are hamstrung by security rules set in Europe or America …
These reporters can’t leave their compounds without convoys of armed guards .
They could n’t dream of driving around rural Paktia , dressed up in local clothes and squashed into the back of an old Toyota Corolla , to interview the survivors of a night raid .
Ultra risk - averse organizations go even further and rely almost entirely on video footage and still images gifted by the entirely partial combat - camera teams or the coalition ’s dedicated NATO TV unit , staffed by civilian ex-journalists who churn out good news b-roll .
Others lap up this material because it ’s cheaper and easier than having their own correspondents in a war zone .
Starkey says the problem is exacerbated by the practice of “ embedding ” journalists with the military , which — though it may help keep the journalist death toll down — compromises reporting .
“ British troops will only accept journalists who let military censors approve their stories before they are filed , ” he writes .
“ Ostensibly , this is to stop sensitive information reaching the insurgents .
In my three and a half years in Afghanistan , the British invariably use it as an opportunity to editorialize . ”

Starkey notes that , despite the fact the UN corroborated his story about the killings in Paktia province , he continues to be the target of a NATO campaign to discredit him .
But he says it ’s important that his sort of work continue .
“ NATO lies and unless we check them , they get away with it .
If we check them , they attack us .
It ’s unpleasant but important .
There ’s no doubt in my mind that we must continue to question what the soldiers want us to know . ”
Halo Reach Minus The Afterbirth
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 28th of April 2010 - 11:26 PM ]
Here it is , submitted for your approval .
Oh , and if you are confused a bit on what you are seeing , look below the clip for Bungie 's explanation as to what is going on here .
" The highly classified bio-augmentation procedure is a Spartan candidate 's final and most difficult ordeal before joining the ranks of the legendary soldiers .
The dramatic interpretation of Carter 's rebirth as a Spartan embodies the themes of courage , sacrifice and honor in Halo : Reach and gives viewers a unique look into the origins of a central character in the upcoming blockbuster game . "
Did you get all that from the clip ?
That is what you are suppose to take away from watching some guy get all pumped full of the stuff that makes Bane such a monstrosity for Batman .
I guess it is good to know that in the future , humans will start to look past the negatives of steroid abuse and embrace it as a symbol of courage .
Not to mention that it is the pivotal point in all Spartan 's origins and character .
Now to go 'roid up and Spartan Suit Up !
When working as a systems administrator , you ’ll always end up having to solve a file system full error in a hurry .
Here are a few commands and hints to help you get out of it quickly on a UNIX like system .
df command
The df ( disk free ) command will report how much of each file system is used .
You can combine this with with the sort command to get the fullest file systems at the end :
kattoo@roadrunner ~/ Downloads $ df | sort -n -k 5,5 Filesystem 1K - blocks Used Available Use % Mounted on shm 2029696 0 2029696 0 % / dev/shm / dev/sda6 1968588 3232 1865356 1 % /tmp udev 10240 228 10012 3 % /dev /dev/sda12 367628876 28899532 338729344 8 % / files /dev/sda7
1989820 246300 1743520 13 % /var /dev/sda9 1999932 260996 1738936 14 % /usr / portage /dev/sda5 244176 52264 191912 22 % / /dev/sda8 9990188 3161340 6828848 32 % /usr /dev/sda11 99947736 32910756 67036980 33 % /files/ vservers /dev/sda10 3989912 1699372 2290540 43 % /usr/portage / distfiles
The sort arguments are :
-n : order numerically
-k 5,5 : order by the 5th field
du command
When you found out that a specific file system is full , you need to quickly analyze which folders are the biggest .
You can use the du ( disk usage ) command .
This command will report the space used by a directory and sub-directories .
I usually run something like :
kattoo@roadrunner /usr / portage $ du - sk * | sort -n | tail - 20 5711 x11 - misc 6056 app- misc 6224 dev-ruby 6320 app - dicts 7219 profiles 7428 net - analyzer 7686 app - text 8112 media- plugins 8777 kde - base 8883 media - libs 8943 sys - apps 9764 dev-util 9986 media - sound 10955 dev-libs 11295 dev-python 11479 dev-java 11645 net - misc 17553 dev-perl 112556 metadata 1705976 distfiles
This will show the 20 largest files or directories .
du will display the size of each directories and sub - directories by default .
The -s switch will make du display only the grand total for each arguments .
According to the results , you might want to go on repeating this command in the sub - directories , until you ’ve narrowed down enough to find the culprit .
find command
The file system full error is more often than not due to a faulty script or program which logs are running wild due to a bug .
This will usually lead to a huge file somewhere in a directory , hogging all the available space on the file system .
An easy way to spot it is to use the find command .
The following snippet for example will search for files bigger than 10MB in the current directory and sub- directories and print the 10 largest ones :
kattoo@roadrunner /usr / portage $ find .
- type f - size +10000000 c - exec ls -l \{} \ ; | sort -n -k 5,5 | tail - 10 - rw - rw - r-- 1 portage portage 23416703 Oct 1 10:07 ./distfiles/samba-3.0.37.tar.gz -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 28749072 Jan 18 2008 ./distfiles/extremetuxracer-0.4.tar.gz -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 46905557 Oct 16 17:20 ./distfiles/firefox-3.5.4.source.tar.bz2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 46914620 Dec 2 05:32 ./distfiles/firefox-3.5.6.source.tar.bz2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 50380241 Oct 2 11:47 ./distfiles/VirtualBox-3.0.8-53138-Linux_amd64.run -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 50595281 Nov 17 10:44 ./distfiles/VirtualBox-3.0.12-54655-Linux_amd64.run -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 59368714 Aug 8 02:10 ./distfiles/gcc-4.3.4.tar.bz2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 61494822 Sep 10 00:34 ./distfiles/linux-2.6.31.tar.bz2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 125384668 Oct 1 13:58 ./distfiles/qt-x11-opensource-src-4.5.3.tar.gz -rw-rw-r-- 1 portage portage 314942420 Jun 18 2008 ./distfiles/sauerbraten_2008_06_17_ctf_edition_linux.tar.bz2 kattoo@roadrunner
/usr / portage $
I also like to filter out already compressed files , in order to collect the biggest files which I could compress to save some space with something like :
find .
- type f - size +10000000 c \! - name " *. Z " \!
- name " *. gz " \! - name " *. bz2 " - exec ls -l \{} \;
Tip :
Set this as an alias in your profile by adding this to your . bashrc ( if you ’re using bash … otherwise check your shell documentation ) :
alias bigfiles= ' find .
- type f - size +10000000 c \! - name " *. Z " \!
- name " *. gz " \! - name " *. bz2 " - exec ls -l \{} \ ; | sort -n -k 5,5 | tail - 10 '
This will give you the 10 largest not - yet - compressed files in a single handy command .
Caveat
“ Too many arguments ” error :
If you are working with directory holding an important number of files , you might get a “ Too many arguments ” error when using a star expansion ( like in the du - sk * example above ) .
This is actually not the du command complaining , but the shell which gets too much data when expanding the star .
When this happens , you are usually better off using the find command as explained above .
Another possibility is to pipe the output of find to the xargs command .
Basically xargs will take everything on the standard input and give it as arguments to the specified command .
Deleting / compressing a file which is still open
Also beware of this : if you delete or compress a file which is still being open by a process , then the space this file use wo n’t get freed before the process actually closes the file ( I ’ll explain why in a different post , this is an interesting topic on its own 🙂 ) .
If you deleted or compressed the file ( so basically the big file disappeared or was replaced by a compressed version ) , but the space does n’t get freed ( which you can check with df ) , then you can bet that a process is still holding the file open .
You can spot this with tools like lsof or fuser .
Those tools vary greatly according to which variant of Unix you ’re running .
On IBM ’s AIX , fuser had a handy -d option to spot files on the file system which have a link count of 0 and it will report the PID of the attached processes .
Better check those tools ’ man pages before you run into this situation !
A word to the wise
Those recipes will help you to find a way out when you are already facing a file system full problem .
The best is of course to avoid them in the first place …
The following ideas are a good start :
Set alerts to have an early warning and let you deal with it before applications start crashing .
Tools like Nagios would be your friends here , but home made scripts running from cron and sending emails might be enough .
to have an early warning and let you deal with it before applications start crashing .
Tools like Nagios would be your friends here , but home made scripts running from cron and sending emails might be enough .
Check the trends :
You can use tools like cacti to graph the space occupation of your file systems over the time .
This will let you anticipate when you ’ll need to add more disks or if your log rotation and / or file archiving policies are adequate .

I ’m working on a NASA - sponsored project to monitor safety - critical embedded systems at runtime , and that ’s started me thinking about cyclic redundancy checks ( CRCs ) again .
Error -checking codes are fundamental in fault - tolerant systems .
The basic idea is simple : a transmitter wants to send a data word , so it computes a CRC over the word .
It sends both the data word and the CRC to the receiver , which computes the same CRC over the received word .
If its computed CRC and the received one differ , then there was a transmission error ( there are simplifications to this approach , but that ’s the basic idea ) .
CRCs have been around since the 60s , and despite the simple mathematical theory on which they ’re built ( polynomial division in the Galois Field 2 , containing two elements , “ 0 ” and “ 1 ” ) , I was surprised to see that even today , their fault - tolerance properties are in some cases unknown or misunderstood .
Phil Koopman at CMU has written a few nice papers over the past couple of years explaining some common misconceptions and analyzing commonly - used CRCs .
Particularly , there seems to be an over - confidence in their ability to detect errors .
One fascinating result is the so - called “ Schrödinger ’s CRC , ” so - dubbed in a paper entitled Byzantine Fault Tolerance , from Theory to Reality , by Kevin Driscoll et al .
A Schrödinger ’s CRC occurs when a transmitter broadcasts a data word and associated CRC to two receivers .
and at least one of the data words is corrupted in transit and so is the corresponding CRC so that the faulty word and faulty CRC match !
How does this happen ?
Let ’s look at a concrete example :
11 - Bit Message USB - 5 Receiver A 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 Transmitter 1 ½ 1 1 0 1 1 ½ 0 1 1 ½ 1 0 0 1 Receiver B 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
We illustrate a transmitter broadcasting an 11 - bit message to two receivers , A and B .
We use USB - 5 CRC , generally used to check USB token packets ( by the way , for 11 - bit messages , USB - 5 has a Hamming Distance of three , meaning the CRC will catch any corruption of fewer than three bits in the combined 11 - bit message and CRC ) .
Now , suppose the transmitter has suffered some fault such as a “ stuck - at - 1/2 ” fault so that periodically , the transmitter fails to drive the signal on the bus sufficiently high or low .
A receiver may interpret an intermediate signal as either a 0 or 1 .
In the ﬁgure , we show the transmitter sending three stuck - at - 1/ 2 signals , one in the 11 - bit message , and two in CRC .
The upshot is an example in which a CRC does not prevent a Byzantine fault — the two receivers obtain different messages , each of which passes its CRC .
One question is how likely this scenario is .
Paulitsch et al. write that The probability of a Schrödinger ’s CRC is hard to evaluate .
A worst - case estimate of its occurrence due to a single device is the device failure rate . ”
It ’d be interesting to know if there ’s any data on this probability .

Bloody Bill Kristol claims he did n't watch any of the Health Care Summit , but that did n't stop him from giving Chris Wallace his critique of the event .
If he did n't watch it , how does he know how the President , Ryan and Alexander did ?
And of course him saying he did n't watch it did n't stop Chris Wallace from hanging on his every word while he explained what he thought about what he did n't watch .
WALLACE : Have you been clarified , Bill ?
KRISTOL : No , but I did n't watch it , so I ... I have a life , you know , and -- you compared it at the beginning of the hour to a dog - and - pony show , and I thought to myself , " That 's really an insult to dog - and - pony shows , you know ? "
Those are pretty -- I like the dog shows there on the Animal Planet .
But having said all that , of course , one has to say that it was -- many people were impressive .
The president showed his usual professorial ability to sort of say certain things and highlight certain facts or alleged facts .
Paul Ryan and Lamar Alexander and some of the Republicans did fine .
Look , the bottom line is , as one House Republican said to me Friday , unless this really changes the political dynamics , this bill will not pass the House .
I mean , it passed barely three months ago and the bill was less popular -- less unpopular three months ago than it is today .
That 's the big story .
The president gave a speech September 9th , the huge health care speech , to Congress .
Right around then the numbers were about even , do you approve or disapprove of Obama 's health care proposal .
Two months later , it had gone negative .
Now it 's as negative as it's ever been .
The more people see it , the less they like it .
Unless that summit sort of magically changes that dynamic , I do not believe that they will pass in the House and the Senate on a party - line vote something that is ...

UPDATE : Veggie burger rumors are flying !
Some readers and other news organizations have alleged that the study I wrote about on Monday was funded by the pro-meat , anti-soy group the Weston A. Price Foundation .
But this morning , I spoke with Cornucopia Institute director Mark Kastel , who said that the Weston A. Price Foundation did not contribute any funding to the “ Behind the Bean ” ( pdf ) study .
More here .
UPDATE : Readers ’ questions about veggie burgers and hexane answered here .
This is about the time of year when I start keeping packages of veggie burgers in the freezer , just in case of an impromptu barbecue .
In the past , I have n’t had much fake meat brand loyalty : I ’ve found that once I smother my hunk of textured vegetable protein in barbeque sauce , all soy patties are pretty much created equal .
But after reading a recent investigation by the Cornucopia Institute , I ’m going to be a lot more picky :
The food and agriculture nonprofit found that most non-organic veggie burgers currently on the market are made with the chemical hexane , an EPA - registered air pollutant and neurotoxin .
In order to meet the demands of health - conscious consumers , manufacturers of soy - based fake meat like to make their products have as little fat as possible .
The cheapest way to do this is by submerging soybeans in a bath of hexane to separate the oil from the protein .
Says Cornucopia Institute senior researcher Charlotte Vallaeys , “ If a non-organic product contains a soy protein isolate , soy protein concentrate , or texturized vegetable protein , you can be pretty sure it was made using soy beans that were made with hexane . ”
If you ’ve heard about hexane before , it was likely in the context of gasoline — the air pollutant is also a byproduct of gas refining .
But in 2007 , grain processors were responsible for two - thirds of our national hexane emissions .
Hexane is hazardous in the factory , too : Workers who have been exposed to it have developed both skin and nervous system disorders .
Troubling , then , that the FDA does not monitor or regulate hexane residue in foods .
More worrisome still : According to the report , “ Nearly every major ingredient in conventional soy - based infant formula is hexane extracted . ”
The Cornucopia Institute found that a number of popular veggie burgers were made with hexane .
The list ( pdf , page 37 , and below ) is longer than you might think :
Amy ’s Kitchen
Boca Burger , conventional
Franklin Farms
Garden Burger
It ’s All Good Lightlife
Morningstar Farms
President ’s Choice
Taste Above
Trader Joe’s
Yves Veggie Cuisine
Hexane - free products :
Boca Burgers
“ Made with organic soy ”
Helen ’s Kitchen
Morningstar “ Made with organic ”
Superburgers by Turtle Island
Tofurky
Wildwood
Also worth noting : Products labeled “ organic ” are n’t allowed to contain any hexane - derived ingredients , but that rule does n’t apply to foods that are labeled “ made with organic ingredients . ”
For more on soy sourcing , plus a list of popular “ made with organic ingredients ” - labeled protein bars that are made with hexane , read the Cornucopia Institute ’s full study , “ Behind the Bean . ”

MARCH 11 -- The latest tax return for Wyclef Jean 's foundation has been filed , and while it reveals that the musician is still paying himself from the group 's funds , the charity reports that it has just instituted a written conflict of interest policy .
So that must reassure prospective donors , right ?
As TSG has previously reported , Jean and a business partner personally received more than $ 400,000 from the Wyclef Jean Foundation between 2005 and 2007 .
The organization 's 2008 tax return , which is excerpted here , shows that the group reported gross receipts of $ 1.8 million , more than 20 times what it disclosed in 2007 .
More than $ 1 million of that sum was wired to a Haiti - based group that reportedly provided food and relief services in the country , and also organized a free outdoor concert in Port - au - Prince starring Jean himself .
Based on prior practices , it seems likely that Jean , a pay - for - play kind of humanitarian , would have pocketed an appearance fee for that gig .
The 2008 tax return shows that the group , again , paid $ 31,200 in rent for space inside a Manhattan recording studio owned by Jean and his cousin Jerry Duplessis , who is also a foundation board member ( that ' space ' was actually a cafe table in the studio's kitchen ) .
It is unclear whether the rent deal was the extent of such insider dealings , since the tax return notes , ' there were business transactions involving interested persons , but the payments did not exceed the reporting thresholds . '
The IRS filing also reveals the establishment of a conflict of interest policy that requires foundation officials to annually disclose ' interests that could give rise to conflicts . '
The tax return also reports that an unnamed donor made an in - kind contribution of stock valued at $ 534,660 ( the securities were quickly sold by the foundation ) .
Additionally , Jean 's organization reported having no employees , ' only three consultants , ' the highest paid of which was Zakiya Khatou - Chevassus , who banked $ 105,000 .
In addition to working closely with Jean , Khatou - Chevassus does a little acting / modeling .

MISS Michigan Rima Fakih won the Miss USA 2010 beauty pageant in Las Vegas today becoming the first Arab - American to be given the crown .
TV Latest said Fakih , 24 , a Lebanese - American born in New York , was among 51 beauties vying for the highly contested honour .
She beat first runner - up Miss Oklahoma , followed by Miss Virginia , Miss Colorado and Miss Maine .
The competition aired live to US viewers on NBC .
The network owns the pageant with celebrity entrepreneur Donald Trump .
Fakih will represent the US at the 2010 Miss Universe pageant later this year .
John McCain is impressing Republican primary voters again by calling for American citizen Faisal Shahzad , the suspect in the attempted Times Square car bombing , to be denied his Miranda rights .
“ Obviously that would be a serious mistake ” to read Shahzad his rights , “ at least until we find out as much information we have [ sic ] , and there are legal ways of delaying that ” McCain told Don Imus this morning .
His sentiment was echoed by Long Island congressman Peter King , who said , “ I hope that if they did read him his rights and if they are going for an indictment as opposed to a tribunal that he did discuss it with the director of National Intelligence , the Central Intelligence Agency , all the component parts of the intelligence community . ”
Attorney General Eric
Holder told reporters this afternoon that Shahzad was “ initially questioned under a public safety exception to the Miranda rule and was cooperative , ” but was “ later read his Miranda rights and ‘ continued talking . ’”
But is declining to read Shahzad his rights until we find out “ as much information ” as possible , or choosing to prosecute him in a military tribunal , even an option ?
Nope , says basically everyone .
• Marc Ambinder does n’t see any wiggle room : “ Military commissions only have jurisdiction over ‘ alien unprivileged enemy belligerents , ’ and Shahzad is a naturalized American citizen .
Unless McCain and King are willing to create two classes of American citizens , Shahzad has every right to be read his Miranda warnings , and he will be tried by federal prosecutors in a federal court . ” [ Marc Ambinder / Atlantic ]
• Andrew Sullivan says that the “ cynical ” and “ power - hungry ” McCain “ favors shredding any constitutional rights for an American citizen suspected of a terror attack . ” [ Andrew Sullivan / Atlantic ]
• Joe Klein writes that , undoubtedly , “ under current law , as an American citizen , Shahzad has ” Miranda rights .
But he could be open to modifying the law to “ exclude terrorism cases . ”
[ Swampland / Time ]
• Jennifer Rubin wonders if the administration has “ internalized any of the lessons of the Christmas Day bomber ” and even “ bother[ed ] to assess the risks and benefits of Mirandizing a terror suspect this time around . ” [ Contentions / Commentary ]
• Greg Sargent finds it “ striking how quickly King and McCain ( with others certain to follow ) rushed to offer pre-emptive criticism of the administration ’s handling of the suspect — a mere 12 hours after his arrest . ”
[ Plum Line / Who Runs Gov ]
• Steve Benen contends that “ we know that the Mirandizing suspects does not undermine our national security interests .
For decades , this was n’t even a subject open to debate until Republicans decided last year this might be exploited politically to confused scared voters . ” [ Political Animal / Washington Monthly ]
• Adam Serwer points out that “ things like Mirandization were non-issues for McCain during the Bush administration , when more than 403 convictions were secured through the civilian justice system . ” [ Tapped / American Prospect ]
• Glenn Beck confounded his Fox News colleagues by unambiguously backing Mirandization .
“ We do n’t shred the Constitution when it is popular , ” Beck added .
“ We do the right thing . ” [ HuffPo ]
• Ed Morrissey agrees : “ Shahzad is an American citizen , arrested by law enforcement in America .
As a US citizen , Shahzad has the right to remain silent .
In that sense , he differs from the EunuchBomber , who attempted to enter the country ( our airspace ) to conduct a sabotage mission for an enemy of the US . ” [ Hot Air ]
• Matthew Yglesias reminds McCain why we read people Miranda rights , because “ if you do n’t , you risk having your evidence thrown out of court .
If you gather all the information before mirandizing , you could be throwing the whole thing into doubt .
Which is why professionals give out the warning .
They warn amateurs and drug addicts and crazy people and sophisticated members of organized crime syndicates . ”

Although the linguistic repression that once endangered the Catalan language has become a problem of the past , limited to the pages of history books , the issue of how Catalan can be maintained remains troubling .
There are an estimated 6.5 million Catalan speakers living in Spain today , most of them located in the regions of Valencia and Catalonia .
In the interest of preserving the Catalan language , Catalonian lawmakers are now making a move to increase the number of Catalan language films shown in the region .
A History of Repression
The Catalan language has periodically been repressed throughout history .
The language was arguably at its strongest when it served as the official language of the Kingdom of Aragon ( located in region of Catalonia in present - day Spain ) in the 12th century .
With the Catalonian loss of independence in the mid-17th century , the Catalan language suffered major setbacks and was soon spoken almost exclusively in rural areas .
Despite a Catalan language renaissance in the late 19th century , the language took another hit during the rule of Spanish dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera ( 1923 -1930 ) , who banned the use of any language besides Castilian .
Repression of the Catalan language was picked up by General Francisco Franco , who ascended to power in 1939 after the Spanish Civil War .
Bringing Catalan to the Silver Screen
Given the shaky history of the Catalan language , it ’s understandable that Catalan speakers are concerned about the preservation of the language .
After all , it was n’t until the 1970s that serious efforts were made to counter former repression of Catalan by reinstating and revitalizing the Catalan language .
A recent New York Times report on efforts to maintain Catalan reveals that promoters of the language are now tackling a new challenge in the battle to preserve Catalan — the silver screen .
Although Catalan is the native language for the majority of residents in Barcelona , the movies shown in the Catalonian capital are predominantly Spanish language .
However the local government is preparing to pass a bill which will require that at least half of the copies of every non-European film , including major Hollywood blockbusters , must be dubbed into the Catalan language .
The Catalonian government proposed this measure once before , in 1998 , but did n’t carry it out because of feared opposition from theater owners .
This time , however , the law is expected to pass despite the fact that 576 of 790 movie houses in the region of Catalonia closed their doors for a day of protest .
Preserving Language Means Preserving Culture
Language and culture are closely intertwined , so it should come as no surprise that preserving a language ’s culture is just as important as preserving the language itself .
Worries about the preservation of Catalonian spirit have increased as natives fear that the Catalan culture may become overshadowed or made indistinguishable from that of Spain .
With a new movement to promote Catalan movies , the Catalonian government is taking valuable steps to insure not only the preservation of the Catalan language , but also its culture .

I just completed the command line crash course and want to express my feeling towards your lessons and teaching methods .
I have been learning all over the web about coding and very few places make me feel like I ’m grasping the methods .
I like how you “ made ” me make flash cards and things felt like a true bootcamp .
I have learned a lot more about the command line and am not so afraid of it anymore .
I wanted to ask if you have any JavaScript writings as I did not see any on your webpage , I will definitely be reading Ruby but JavaScript is really tripping me up in places and I could use better explanations for things than the ones I ’ve seen .

' As it got closer , I realised that this strange cloud was actually thousands of bees , each one an inch long and each one heading for me '
I heard the bees way before I saw them .
I also heard my friend John screaming before I knew what was happening .
He was a little way ahead of me , on a rock face close to the water .
I was 18 and backpacking around India with friends .
One very hot afternoon , four of us decided to cool off in a patch of river the locals had told us about .
We were n't climbers – we were wearing flip - flops – but to reach the water we had to scramble down a small ravine .
That 's when John started to wave his arms around and I knew something was up .
He jumped forward a few steps , then leapt 10ft off the precipice into the dark green pool beneath us .
I heard a low hum , which was growing louder , but I still did n't know what it was .
From a distance , the swarm looked almost like smoke , an opaque mass vibrating somewhere above me .
As it got closer , I realised that this strange cloud was actually thousands of bees , each one an inch long and heading for me .
John had been close enough to the rock edge to leap to safety , but I was unable to jump from where I was balanced on rocks higher up the ravine .
So I covered my face with my hands ; a childlike reaction to protect myself .
I genuinely thought that if I made myself invisible , they may not find me .
It was n't logical , but it made sense at the time .
I curled up into a tiny ball , praying they would think I was just another rock .
After a few seconds , and the sixth or seventh sting , I knew my plan had n't worked .
It was me the bees were after .
I could hear my friends below , shouting .
The two others had reached the water before the attack began , and they were telling me to get down to the pool fast .
By now I was in extraordinary pain .
Each sting was like a wave of agony – much worse than that of European wasps or bees .
I later found out that these were giant honey bees and that , when provoked , a swarm of them was easily capable of stinging a human being to death .
We had obviously disturbed their colony , although we never actually saw the nest .
The only way I could get away from them was to use my hands to climb down the rocks , yet this meant exposing my face .
The noise the bees made was so loud and terrifying , my instinct was to scrunch up my eyes and keep them closed .
Ultimately , however , I had no choice .
I did scramble down the rock face and jump into the pool , but I have no recollection of doing so .
Everything was blanked out by the sheer relief of being free from the pain .
I was safe , and the sensation of treading water seemed wonderful .
It was terrible , then , to realise that we still were n't out of danger .
Every time one of us tried to climb out of the pool , the bees swarmed back over our heads .
We spent the next three hours bobbing up and down in the water , which was just shallow enough at the edges to stand in .
We kept dipping our heads under to avoid the bees , keeping as still and as quiet as possible until they finally lost interest .
I was the first to make it out , covering myself with a damp sarong that had been around my neck .
Slowly I climbed back out of the ravine and sat under a tree .
One by one the others followed me ; it seemed to take for ever in the scorching heat .
One friend extracted my stings where she could – I had around 15 , including one up my nose .
" I do n't know whether to laugh or cry , " I said , at which point all of us fought back tears of fear , shock , horror and relief .
The real miracle was that John , who was already in the pool before the attack began , was lethally allergic to stings .
Had he been in my shoes , he would definitely have died .
As it was , he was stung twice and his arm swelled up to the size of a melon .
Any more stings and he could have suffocated , whereas I just had little red bumps with the stings sticking out of them , and was thankfully immune to their poison .
I do n't have much luck with wild animals in India .
As a child , I had to be rescued from a pack of wild dogs and not so long ago I was nearly trampled to death by an elephant in the Assamese jungle .
As you can imagine , I am not an animal lover , but I 'll always be thankful that the bees attacked me and not my friends .

Genetically modified cotton fields hide herbicide - resistant weeds ( Image : Scott Olson / Getty )
THE world ’s most popular herbicide is losing its knockout punch .
More and more weeds are evolving resistance to glyphosate – originally marketed by Monsanto as Roundup – but the problem could have been forestalled by farming practices enriched by a better understanding of evolution .
This is a serious problem .
“ Glyphosate is as important to world food production as penicillin is to human health , ” says Stephen Powles , a plant scientist at the University of Western Australia in Perth .
In 1996 , Monsanto began selling crop varieties genetically modified to contain a gene for glyphosate …
For 17 years Sir Alex Ferguson has been steadily placing explosives at the foot of Liverpool 's infamous perch and this weekend he will invite them to the detonation .
Whether to partake in a possible farewell to the honour of England 's most decorated champions , a mantle now shared with Manchester United , is the dilemma tearing at Anfield 's conscience .
Liverpool have been here before , of course .
For Chelsea 2010 read Blackburn Rovers 1995 , and a Sunday at Anfield when natural elation at a home victory will be severely tempered by the side - effect of assisting a Manchester United title challenge .
Providing , of course , that Ferguson 's team can capitalise on the offer , unlike 15 years ago when a United draw at West Ham gave Kenny Dalglish 's Blackburn the title regardless of their 2 - 1 defeat at Anfield .
That day still represents one of the most surreal match - going experiences for many Liverpool supporters , who were divided over which goals to embrace – Alan Shearer 's opener , John Barnes 's equaliser or Jamie Redknapp 's exquisite last - minute winner – but ultimately shared their former hero Dalglish 's joy as the losing team began to celebrate before the final whistle .
Yet 15 years ago a United title victory would have been an unpalatable irritation .
Their failure to score a second past Ludo Miklosko in the West Ham goal ensured Liverpool 's superiority over their Old Trafford rivals remained at 18 - 9 in championships .
There seemed no threat to the perch back then , but it is indicative of Ferguson 's command and Liverpool 's malaise that 18 - 19 beckons should Chelsea drop points at Anfield and United win their remaining two games .
Anfield 's dilemma has deepened as a consequence .
Indeed , a text doing the rounds beseeches Rafael Benítez to field Cilla Black , Ken Dodd , Holly Johnson , Sinbad the window cleaner – and Lucas Leiva – against Carlo Ancelotti's contenders this weekend .
Not all have veered from the doctrine that a supporter always supports .
John Mackin , co-author of " REDMEN : A Season on the Drink " , explained : " People have been talking about wanting us to lose for a few weeks now but personally I want to win it .
I always want my team to win .
The only thing I hope for is that it plays out like the Blackburn game in 1995 .
I remember United fans on the telly in the week leading up to that game saying : ' Win it for us , scousers ' , but thankfully the gods smiled upon the football world that day and it played out perfectly .
" My gut reaction when Redknapp scored that day was to punch the air and celebrate , but a few people around us were saying : ' What have we done ? '
We still have a chance of fourth place this season and I 'd be delighted to beat Chelsea even if it puts United in the driving seat .
We can't hope to stay the most successful team in the land because of another team 's failure .
We have to get our own house in order and try to stay the most successful team by virtue of our own success . "
Blackburn 1995 demonstrated perfectly the distinction between supporters ' emotions and a player 's professional duty .
Liverpool silenced all the sceptics that day , to the extent it gives United hope for the penultimate weekend and the game that , on paper , provides the best chance of another turn in the title race .
As Liverpool 's captain , Steven Gerrard , said : " We are underdogs for fourth position but our fans know that we have also got Everton breathing down our necks and we certainly do n't want them finishing above us .
We have got a couple of games left now and the idea is to take maximum points to see if we can get into fourth through the back door .
If we take maximum points , who knows ?
The teams above us might slip up . "
Wayne Rooney summed it up as a United player and Evertonian would .
" Liverpool are a proud club with a lot of history and I 'm sure they 'll want to win that game as they 're fighting for the Europa League , " the newly crowned PFA player of the year said .
Unlike 1995 , the timing of Liverpool 's belated influence on the title encourages the controversial prospect of Benítez fielding a weakened team against Chelsea .
No Liverpool manager wants United overtaking the club 's league title record on his watch .
It may not be devilment that influences Benítez 's thinking on Sunday , however , but what has unfortunately become standard managerial practice at this stage of a season .
Should Liverpool qualify for the Europa League final by beating Atlético Madrid on Thursday and see fourth place almost disappear with a Spurs victory over Bolton on Saturday , Benítez may be tempted to tinker , with a trophy in mind .
Roy Hodgson did precisely that with the Fulham side he fielded at Goodison on Sunday .
Likewise Sir Alex Ferguson in last season 's FA Cup semi-final against Everton , when he prioritised chasing the European Cup and Premier League in an admittedly more demanding schedule than faces Liverpool .
Finally , the thought of Benítez 's rotation policy being brought out of storage is sufficient to send a chill through Old Trafford .
No -win situation : Fans caught in a dilemma
Dave Usher
Editor of the Liverpool Way fanzine
' There will be no satisfactory outcome on Sunday .
If we win , we are basically handing the title to the Mancs and allowing them to overhaul us as the most successful side in the land .
But if we lose , we are giving up any faint hope of finishing in the top four .
I want us to win but if we do n't you wo n't find me crying about it .
There is a part of me that would find it hilarious if Rafa ' rested ' most of our side and we lost , as it would cause Fergie 's head to explode '
Les Lawson
Secretary of the Merseyside branch of the Liverpool Supporters ' Club
' This match is not one I 'm looking forward to .
I never want Man United to win the title and particularly so this year as it will be title No19 .
The problem on Sunday , too , is that Liverpool kick off before United do [ against Sunderland ] and so we can't even go into our game hoping that they 've slipped up and thus we can then go all out for a win .
It 's a very difficult situation '
Anil Patel
Kop season - ticket holder for 21 years
' For me there is no dilemma – I want Liverpool to win every game they play in , whether it be the first team , the reserves or the youth side .
Too many of our fans are obsessed with United but they should n't worry about them .
There is still a chance of us finishing fourth and we should aim for that until it 's mathematically impossible

The practice of opening the hood at every fuel stop used to be routine .
With an oil - soaked rag in hand , the worker reached over and pulled out the hot metal dipstick , and after a quick cleaning swipe , the dipstick was plunged back into its tube and pushed down into the sump of scalding oil .
Withdrawn again , a tell - tale black film in the middle of the scored lines marked the oil level very accurately .
Today , many late model vehicles are running sans oil dipstick .
Electronic oil level senders have replaced the metal rod – to the bafflement and frustration of the few remaining hands - on enthusiasts everywhere .
In an effort to find out who exactly is responsible for the dipstick - abolishing movement , Autoblog contacted Audi BMW and Porsche – three respected German automakers who have embraced the technology for several years .
All three gave us the same answer .
Contrary to Internet rumors , the elimination of an inexpensive metal rod is not a cost - cutting measure , nor is it an environmental issue ( word on the web said each check of a dipstick introduced ounces of polluting dirty oil into the ecosystem ) .
Quite frankly , the automakers point out that we simply do n't need dipsticks anymore .
Why ?
Because owners do n't use them .
While they do n't specifically say it , those who engineer and assemble our new cars ( and guarantee new vehicle warranties ) are much more comfortable knowing that a silicon chip is monitoring the oil level – not a consumer who has n't checked tire pressures ( or even opened the hood ) since the last time the Vikings won the Super Bowl .
Today 's comatose driver expects everything to be automated – and it is .
Look no further than the myriad of digitized warning lights on the dashboard when the key is turned ( um ... make that the start button ) .
Do n't blame the automakers for the disappearance of the dipstick – blame the public at large .
Hit - Girl : The Real Kick - Ass
Thirteen year - old Chloë Moretz is causing quite a stir in the new superhero movie Kick - Ass , playing Hit - Girl , a fierce , high - powered , homicidal eleven year - old girl who uses the C - word and has been trained by her gun-happy father ( Nicolas Cage ) .
The movie has garnered many positive reviews , although Roger Ebert called it “ morally reprehensible ” and the Christian Science Monitor asked , “ Are toddlers toting Uzis next ? ”
Moretz takes the whole thing in stride .
To her , it ’s just a movie , nothing more .
When ADD caught up with her at the recent Kick - Ass junket in NYC , she was locqacious , precocious and even a little dramatic when emphasizing people ’s strong reactions to the film .
She clearly loves the spotlight , and this role will certainly take her career to the next level .
( For more from Moretz , check out my Movies.com interview with the three young Kick - Ass stars . )
How did you react when you read the script ?
From the moment I read the script I really wanted to be Hit - Girl .
Cutting people apart is fake .
That ’s a prosthetic leg .
That ’s fake blood .
It ’s made of corn syrup ; you could eat the blood .
It was a lot of fun .
Who are your role models ?
Natalie Portman , Audrey Hepburn , Meryl Streep , people like that .
They ’re people who help the world .
They do more than just entertain .
They go out there and try to be somebody more than an actor .
What did your parents think of this role , and what did you watch as research ?
I watched a couple of films as research : Interview With The Vampire and Kill Bill .
I was allowed to see Kill Bill because it is so fake .
They cut off an arm , and it ’s obviously a fake prosthetic arm because it falls and looks plastic and shiny .
The blood squirts , stops squirting , and then starts squirting again .
I really researched the role , and my mom read the script before I did .
She knew it was a role that was challenging and unique and something that would really change an acting career .
Do you think many of your friends will see this film ?
It ’s an R - rated movie .
I advise all my friends not to see it .
Is it weird to tell your friends that it was really fun to make , but they ca n’t watch it ?
Not really , because they ’ve seen a lot of the other stuff that I ’ve done — Diary Of A Wimpy Kid and Big Momma ’s House 2 , movies like that .
There ’s a lot of stuff that they can see that I ’ve done , which is really cool .
I like doing movies that are challenging , and whatever connects to me I do .
What was it like to work with Nicolas Cage ?
Nicolas Cage is amazing .
Just shaking his hand I was starstruck .
I have never been able to work with an Oscar winner before .
Was he very protective of you ?
Yeah .
He ’s an amazing actor , and he brought something to the character that I was able to feed off of as an actor .
There ’s been some controversy over the language that your character uses in the film .
What do you say to people who complain about the violence and the language that your character uses ?
It ’s a film .
It ’s for your entertainment .
When you see it in context , it ’s not that shocking .
Some people go , “ Ohhhhhh ! ” Other people go , “ That ’s kind of cool . ”
There are maybe other people who are disgusted by it .
Were there deleted scenes that did n’t make it but will be on the DVD ?
There ’s this one scene where Nick gives me my Hit - Girl belt because he built it .
He gives it to me , and I think it ’s so cool .
As Mindy I ’m always wearing it because I love it so much because he made it for me .
There ’s one scene that will be in the director ’s cut .
We start talking about what we ’re going to do , and he goes , “ And we ’re not going to fail . ”
And he goes , “ Harmonize it now ! ”
Then he starts belting it : “ We ’re not going to fail ! ” That was one of the takes .
Did you know he was going to do that ?
No !
I was n’t told .
I almost cracked up , but I stayed in character .
What kind of direction did you get from director Matthew Vaughn about playing this character ?
He really let me just run with it .
My brother / acting coach and I talked about the role and decided what we wanted to do .
Everything comes naturally , so when you see me in the scenes and I ’m punching people , the reason it looks realistic is because I ’m so into it .
I become Hit - Girl .
I become this girl who just wants to fight back .
She ’s so naïve but does n’t even know it , which is why it ’s so cool .
How hard was it to do those violent scenes with Mark Strong at the end ?
It ’s a movie !
It ’s not real life .
It was fun because I was in character , and I like it because it ’s the only time you see Hit - Girl become a damsel in distress .

The Geek Group has been hit with a hefty tax bill despite their tax - exempt status .
We featured a boom camera built by the organization back in November .
It is the goal of The Geek Group to fulfill the thirst to explore and create by providing facilities , peer group , and camaraderie that make knowledge and learning not only acceptable , but desirable .
In the video after the break you can hear a bit about the organization ’s role in servicing donated computers and putting them out into the community , as well as its role in education through groups like the Boy Scouts of America .
This is all done without the goal for profit and accordingly they have attained 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status with the federal government ( we ’ve seen their 990 forms stating this ) .
To the best of our knowledge this does n’t mean that they do n’t need to pay property taxes , but it does make property taxes ridiculously low ( we ’ve heard of one cent per acre for non-profit land holdings before ) .
That ’s why it comes as quite a surprise when the township slaps a sticker on the doors giving notice of seizure and demanding payment for $ 47,652.78 in back taxes or the assets will be auctioned off .
The entire story , from The Geek Group ’s point of view , unfolds in a video of the quarterly Board of Directors meeting from last Saturday .
We ’re hoping this is just a mistake and can be remedied .
That being said , it ’s not easy to run this type of operation .
It ’s unfortunate that the Board of Directors needs to deal with a tax battle in addition to fulfilling the mission of the organization .
Good luck to them in navigating the road ahead .

However , Crown Princess Victoria wishes to walk to the altar at Stockholm Cathedral on the arm of her father , King Carl XVI Gustaf , at her wedding to Daniel Westling , a commoner .
The head of the Swedish church , Archbishop Anders Wejryd , has taken the unusual step of issuing a public statement expressing his disapproval at the adoption of such an Anglo - Saxon practice .
Art was always a great source of inspiration and today it is one of the most important functions .
Do you like modern art museums ?
Of course we can find many amazing things there but we ’ve decided to go outside and find the most inspirational exterior architectural designs of the world famous art museums .
Hope you ’ll like them all as well .
The Denver Art Museum is an art museum in Denver , Colorado ( DUH ! ) .
New design of the building was created by Studio Daniel Libeskind and Denver company named Davis Partnership Architects .
As you can see this concept design is based on shape irregularities and changing vectors .
Pretty impressive and spectacular exterior design makes this building one of the most remarkable sights in Colorado .

Lentos Art Museum is situated in City of Linz , Austria .
Zurich architects Weber & Hofer are the authors of this building design .
Despite 130 meter long building 8000 m2 of useful area this museum looks very airy and coherent .
Transparent glass casing attractively glows at night making this building one of the sights in the town .

The Milwaukee Art Museum ( MAM ) is located on Lake Michigan in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
One of the best buildings in the world is the part of museum complex and it is called Quadracci Pavilion , designed by Santiago Calatrava .
This project simply erases boundaries between engineering , sculpture and architecture .
According the Wikipedia “ the structure contains a movable , wing - like brise soleil which opens up for a wingspan of 217 feet during the day , folding over the tall , arched structure at night or during inclement weather . ”

Superheroes have always represented something of a challenge for film - makers .
It 's all very well for comic - book writers to create characters with laser vision and the ability to leap tall buildings at a single bound , but until advances in CGI , it was nigh on impossible to recreate them on the big screen .
Even the original Superman always looked a bit like he was lying on his side on the floor of a big blue room , rather than flying through the skies , politely showing Lois Lane the view of Metropolis from up above .
It 's no surprise , then , that the current slew of comic - book movies has arrived just at the point when special effects have reached a level of excellence at which it is finally possible to make the fantastical appear real .
Spider - Man can swing through the skyscrapers of Manhattan with ease , while the Incredible Hulk is no longer just an enormous bodybuilder covered in green paint .
Technology has finally caught up with the dreams and visions of the 20th - century 's most famous comic - book writers , and superheroes have become ubiquitous on the big screen .
In the past decade , Fantastic Four , Iron Man , the Hulk , the X - Men , Watchmen and Hellboy have all made their debuts , while Ant - Man , Thor , Captain America and the Avengers are on their way .
If the late 1930s and 40s were the golden age of comic books , the past decade and the one to come look set to be the golden age of comic - book movies .
There 's just one small problem , and it's one that is at the heart of the creation of Kick - Ass , a comic - book character so postmodern that he makes all those who came before look like relics of a bygone age .
The dreams and visions of comic - book readers and cinemagoers in the 1930s – or 50s and 60s in the case of many of Marvel 's characters – are not those of today 's audiences , no more than the 60s version of James Bond , with his misogyny , preposterous gadgets and cheeky one - liners , is suitable for a spy thriller in the new millennium .
Something fresh and new is required .
" The film world is plundering these characters that have been around for an awfully long time , " says Jane Goldman , the screenwriter of Kick - Ass , who worked with comic - book creator Mark Millar and director Matthew Vaughan to bring the film to cinemas .
" I think it 's just the way that the comic - book industry works .
Mark was wondering where the next set of heroes for our generation was . "
Kick - Ass is defiantly unconventional when it comes to comic - book tropes .
He has a normal American name , Dave Lizewski ( so normal that it was borrowed from the real - life winner of a competition to christen the character ) , and real - life teenage problems .
He does n't have a girlfriend , though desperately wants one , and has n't really got much of a clue about what he wants to do with his life .
All he knows is that he loves comic books .
" He 's extremely different because he does n't have any superpowers , " says Goldman .
" He 's an average guy – he's not a cartoon nerd , he 's just a regular teenage boy who happens to love comic books and wonders why nobody 's ever tried to be a superhero .
With that fabulous teenage lack of logic he decides to give it a try , which is obviously an appalling idea in real life . "
Rather than triumphantly dispatching his thug opponents during his first street battle , Dave has the living daylights beaten out of him and winds up in hospital , where he spends months recovering having extensive , expensive rehabilitation , which his night shift worker dad can ill - afford .
When he finally does make an impact – after saving the victim of a mugging from his attackers – he is caught on phone camera and becomes an instant YouTube sensation .
" I always thought it would be good to do a realistic superhero book , " says Millar , a Scot with the cheeriest disposition this side of the highlands , who is chief writer for Marvel .
" You always hear the word realism with superheroes but it never really is .
Watchmen is n't that realistic – there 's a big blue guy with his dick out , you know ?
It 's not like a guy just putting on a costume , going out with no superpowers and trying to make it happen .
" The trouble is that the superhero movies so far – and I do n't want to be unfair to them because I think generally they have been good – have been made two generations after they 've been created , and in Superman 's case three generations after they 've been created .
So if the technology had existed to make a Fantastic Four movie in 1966 it would have been amazing , because you had Kennedy and the space race and all of that .
But now , really , what is the Fantastic Four ?
" With Kick - Ass , the book 's just out and now the movie 's out six weeks later .
And I think that 's the way things are going to go now , because to go to Marvel 's B and C - list characters and try to get movies out them - what 's the point of that ? "
Certainly the likes of Captain America look pretty hokey in comparison to Hit Girl , a foul - mouthed 11 - year - old whom Kick - Ass encounters during his adventures .
She 's a tiny yet deliberately supercool figure played in the film by Chloe Moretz , who slices up opponents with samurai skills and can wield a glock with finer precision than Dirty Harry or Death Wish 's Paul Kersey could ever dream of .
There 's something Tarantinoesque about putting such a figure in a relatively mainstream movie , and to his credit Vaughan and Goldman have refused to tone down the character described in the comic book as " John Rambo meets Polly Pocket " , despite the predictable tabloid ire .
She still crashes into our conciousnesses with the immortal line : " Okay , you cunts , let 's see what you can do , " and the extreme violence superbly illustrated by John Romita
Jr in the comic has only been tempered a little for the cinema .
Kick - Ass is a remarkable vision to find its way to the big screen virtually unadulterated .
No studio would touch the project when Vaughan hawked it around Hollywood , and the director had to finance the whole thing himself .
But then the graphic novel was also a leap of faith : neither Millar nor Romita were paid upfront , and the latter spent two years working for nothing on the artwork , and later as a consultant on the film .
" I was so set on doing mainstream work , but my wife said : do something out of the ordinary , you 're so used to doing regular books , " says Romita , a buff yet gentle figure who has worked on some of Marvel 's most famous comics since the 1970s .
" I knew that with the following Mark has and whatever following I have , people would at least pick it up .
But I had no idea it would turn into this .
There 's always someone who 's a page ahead of everybody else and sets a precedent .
This time it 's Mark , and now everybody is going to follow on from this . "
Could Kick - Ass really usher in a new era of comic - book movies ?
Millar and Vaughan are so confident of the success of Kick - Ass that they have already begun plans for the sequel , and the comic - book writer is also in talks to start work on a separate comic book and movie double - header featuring a super - villain as the lead character , something he would not even have considered a few years ago .
" I think you need to be familiar before you can subvert , " he says .
" Kick - Ass is very knowing towards Sam Raimi's Spider - Man and the other films which came before it .
What 's quite interesting now is that we 've given people a broad education in superheroes and now we can start to play around with it a little bit .
I 'm trying to create a new wave here and get more radical with it – you certainly could n't have done a supervillain 10 years ago because people were n't familiar enough with superheroes to turn that on its head and do the story from a supervillain 's point of view . "
But what of those film - makers trying to bring more antiquated characters to the big screen ?
What about the torrent of comic - book movies that studios have on their slates ?
" They 're fucked , " grins Millar .
And suddenly there 's a little bit of Hit Girl in him .
" It 's a weird situation because Mark Webb is redoing Spider - Man now and in Kick - Ass the characters make jokes about the conventions of that character : it 's all stuff about somebody 's mum getting killed and it is funny .
You can't have Peter Parker with his gentle humour in the Spider - man reboot now - it 's going to look like Humphrey Bogart or something . "
The government will attempt to make intercept evidence admissible in court , the Guardian has learned , in a move likely to bring ministers into conflict with the intelligence services .
Officials are already looking into reversing the ban , after both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats supported a change in the law while in opposition .
" The government supports the principle of using intercept as evidence in criminal proceedings , " a Home Office spokesperson said .
" This is a complex area and the government will now consider how to build on the work of the privy council committee to bring about a workable solution . "
Senior intelligence and secret service officers have voiced continuing opposition to using the material in court .
Top MI5 and MI6 officials have told the Guardian that the use of such evidence in court would reveal secret techniques and operations , and would prove too expensive by requiring officers to trawl through vast numbers of phone recordings .
" Abolishing the rule about intercept underpins the rhetoric of both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats about control orders and secret evidence , " said Matthew Ryder QC , a barrister at Matrix chambers .
" What the government does now will be a serious indicator of whether their views on civil liberties are going to be different , or whether they will accede to security service interests in the same way that Labour did . "
Almost all big criminal investigations in the UK involve the use of phone intercepts .
But the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act makes intercept evidence inadmissible in criminal cases , even if it could help to prove the innocence of the accused .
Evidence from bugs is already admissible and has been used in a number of terrorism trials , prompting arguments that the ban on intercept evidence is no longer sustainable .
Calls from lawyers and civil liberties groups to make intercept evidence admissible have led to eight reports in 14 years on the issue , including one by Sir John Chilcot , the senior civil servant who now heads the Iraq war inquiry .
He concluded such evidence should be admissible but the consent of intelligence and law enforcement agencies should be obtained to protect secret techniques .
Prosecutors say they support principles of openness in criminal trials , but intercept evidence presents insurmountable practical problems .
" It 's not that simple , " said Max Hill QC , from 18 Red Lion Court chambers , who has prosecuted in a number of terrorism trials .
" Unless you have an investigation that has no reliance on intelligence sources – and let 's face it most do – you are going to end up with transcripts of telephone evidence that is heavily redacted .
" It is difficult to see a way round the impact opening up intercept evidence would have on intelligence - gathering , " Hill added .
" It 's going to be very difficult to achieve without real compromise by those who are enjoined to protect us . "
Civil liberties groups said they intended to increase pressure on the government to resolve tension between the demands of the security services and the benefits of making intercept evidence admissible .
" The coalition parties have bound themselves together with statements on civil liberties .
It will take early consistent action on repealing control orders and allowing the use of intercept evidence in fair criminal trials to keep those ties from fraying , " said Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights campaign Liberty .
" This evidence ought to be made admissible and the practical problems , which are real , will have to be confronted and solved , as they are in other countries , " another senior criminal barrister said .
NEW CITY , N.Y . -
It was n't quite man-bites - dog , but there were men and there were dogs and there was biting .
A sheriff 's office said Monday that one man bit another during a fight over a couple of dogs at a park in suburban New York City .
Rockland County sheriff 's Capt. William Barbera ( bahr - BEHR ' - uh ) says two dog owners got into it Sunday night .
One did n't like the way their pets were playing at a dog park in New City , about 30 miles north of New York .
Barbera says that a third man tried to break up the fight and that one of the combatants bit him on the wrist .
He says that no one has been arrested but that the case is still being investigated .
Well , it turns out there 's a reason those comics and beer companies keep making those jokes .
Many of the exciting advances in brain mapping and genetic research are proving that some of the oldest , most hackneyed gender - based stereotypes are totally true .
If you 've watched bad stand - up or beer commercials or listened to awful morning drive time radio DJs ( Science has yet to prove the existence of any other type ) you know about all of the supposed differences between men and women .
The # 1 topic of conversation among male hack comics is their nagging , chatter - box wives , and for hack females it 's ... well , vibrators .
But their insensitive , slob of a husband is a very close second .
6 Women Can't Drive and Park For Shit
There is allegedly one thing women and blind men have in common : their ability to navigate .
Even Google loves this stereotype , tossing back an impressive 75,200,000 hits when we typed in " women ca n't park . "

Then there are the supposed differences in the ways women and men get from one parking spot to the next , a practice often referred to as " driving . "
According to the Hollywood formula , men navigate by compass directions and a stubborn refusal to ask for directions ever , while women get from here to there by using landmarks , a winning smile and a little leg .
Tell a woman to turn north , then east and then north again and every sexist comedy writer we polled here at Cracked agreed she'd get turned around faster than a frog in a blender .
So , if this ridiculous stereotype were true , then Mother Nature has given men a serious edge in the " getting around " department .
But that can't be right , because the decade of the 70s promised us that Mother Nature does n't favor people based on race , sexual orientation or whether or not there are dangly parts between their legs .

What 's Under Construction at Disney , Universal and Other Top Theme Parks
With the theme park industry shut down for several months in 2020 , construction plans have been thrown into doubt throughout the industry .
But here 's what we know now about the state of newly announced projects at the world 's top theme parks .
The biggest project was Universal Orlando's new Epic Universe theme park , which was to open on a new site located just north of the Orange County Convention Center in 2023 .
Initial concept art depicts four immersive theme lands , tipped by many to include Orlando 's installation of Super Nintendo World as well as lands based upon The Wizarding World 's Fantastic Beasts franchise and Dreamworks Animation 's How to Train Your Dragon .
The project is now on indefinite hold , facing a one - year delay according to local officials .
As for Super Nintendo World , the first installation of that land was supposed to open this summer at Universal Studios Japan , then come Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Singapore at as - yet - unannounced dates .
Featuring real - life versions of Bowser 's Castle and Princess Peach 's Castle , the video game - themed land will include a Mario Kart ride — " the most immersive and cutting - edge technological attraction that we could possibly imagine , " Universal Creative officials have said .
At the Disneyland Resort , Disney California Adventure is scheduled to get a Marvel - themed Avengers Campus land featuring Web Slingers : A Spider - Man Adventure , a new interactive dark ride .
Disney 's original opening date for that was July 18 , but that 's been delayed with no new date announced .
Meanwhile at Walt Disney World , the trackless dark ride Ratatouille : The Adventure now is expected to open in Epcot 's expanded France pavilion in early 2021 , while the TRON Lightcycle Run roller coaster at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot 's Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind indoor coaster now appear to have been pushed back to 2022 .
Here is our complete list of all attractions currently under construction or officially announced at the world 's major theme parks .

Continuing a partnership begun with the game 's prologue , Gran Turismo 5 is once again teaming up with British TV series Top Gear , with the inclusion of the show 's famous test track in Sony 's PS3 racer .

Die -hard fans of the game ( or show ) may remember a fleeting promise of this all the way back in 2007 , but having recently been measured on the ground and photographed from the air over the course of four days , the track - which is used on the show to test cars as well as the driving skills of celebrities - is now , finally , ready to be one of the many included when the game ships ... whenever it ships .

Of course , it 's not like the occasion was going to go by without series creator Kazunori Yamauchi heading out onto the former airfield for a spin .
Asked by Top Gear 's website what it was like out there on one of the world 's most famous courses , he replied " I tried driving it myself , but it 's really hard to find the driving line .
It 's so wide that it becomes difficult to find markers and visual points .
It was only after I sat with the Stig as a passenger that I finally realised where all the turn - in points and the correct driving lines were . "
Sadly , Kaz was not a passenger in the show 's " reasonably priced car " , so he wo n't be taking a run at its famed leaderboard of top times .
Nothing stopping you from doing the same , though , once you get your hands on the game .
Now , if only Bill Bailey was also included ...

CNN Shuts Down Its BuzzFeed - Esque Great Big Story After 5 Years

The Times of India , relying on its sources at Air India , reported not long ago that teams of crash analysts and rescue workers have located the flight data recorders and the cockpit voice recorder from the Boeing 737-800 that overshot a runway at Mangalore International Airport ( IATA : IXE ; ICAO : VOML ) .
The passenger plane then tumbled down a steep hill and caught fire , killing 158 and leaving only eight survivors Saturday morning local time ( Friday evening EDT ) .
Weather during the landing attempt was rainy and foggy .
Moreover , speculation from the Christian Science Monitor suggests that the unusual location of Mangalore International Airport near the cliff over which the Boeing 737 tumbled , might be partially to blame .
It posits a false dichotomy to ask " Pilot error or dangerous Mangalore airport ? " but the link to that publication 's article is below in any case .
The plane , operating as Air India Express 812 , originated at Dubai International Airport ( IATA : DXB ; ICAO : OMDB ) , and was headed for Mangalore .
The pilot was in contact with air traffic control up until moments before the crash , and as yet there is no serious suggestion of terrorism .

Journalists abandon standards to attack the Pope
By Phil Lawler ( bio - articles - email ) | Apr 10 , 2010
We 're off and running once again , with another completely phony story that purports to implicate Pope Benedict XVI in the protection of abusive priests .
The " exclusive " story released by AP yesterday , which has been dutifully passed along now by scores of major media outlets , would never have seen the light of day if normal journalistic standards had been in place .
Careful editors should have asked a series of probing questions , and in every case the answer to those questions would have shown that the story had no " legs . "
First to repeat the bare - bones version of the story : in November 1985 , then - Cardinal Ratzinger signed a letter deferring a decision on the laicization of Father Stephen Kiesle , a California priest who had been accused of molesting boys .
Now the key questions :
• Was Cardinal Ratzinger responding to the complaints of priestly pedophilia ?
No .
The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which the future Pontiff headed , did not have jurisdiction for pedophile priests until 2001 .
The cardinal was weighing a request for laicization of Kiesle .
• Had Oakland 's Bishop John Cummins sought to laicize Kiesle as punishment for his misconduct ?
No .
Kiesle himself asked to be released from the priesthood .
The bishop supported the wayward priest 's application .
• Was the request for laicization denied ?
No .
Eventually , in 1987 , the Vatican approved Kiesle 's dismissal from the priesthood .
• Did Kiesle abuse children again before he was laicized ?
To the best of our knowledge , No .
The next complaints against him arose in 2002 : 15 years after he was dismissed from the priesthood .
• Did Cardinal Ratzinger 's reluctance to make a quick decision mean that Kiesle remained in active ministry ?
No. Bishop Cummins had the authority to suspend the predator - priest , and in fact he had placed him on an extended leave of absence long before the application for laicization was entered .
• Would quicker laicization have protected children in California ?
No. Cardinal Ratzinger did not have the power to put Kiesle behind bars .
If Kiesle had been defrocked in 1985 instead of 1987 , he would have remained at large , thanks to a light sentence from the California courts .
As things stood , he remained at large .
He was not engaged in parish ministry and had no special access to children .
• Did the Vatican cover up evidence of Kiesle 's predatory behavior ?
No .
The civil courts of California destroyed that evidence after the priest completed a sentence of probation -- before the case ever reached Rome .
So to review :
This was not a case in which a bishop wanted to discipline his priest and the Vatican official demurred .
This was not a case in which a priest remained active in ministry , and the Vatican did nothing to protect the children under his pastoral care .
This was not a case in which the Vatican covered up evidence of a priest 's misconduct .
This was a case in which a priest asked to be released from his vows , and the Vatican -- which had been flooded by such requests throughout the 1970s -- wanted to consider all such cases carefully .
In short , if you 're looking for evidence of a sex - abuse crisis in the Catholic Church , this case is irrelevant .
We Americans know what a sex - abuse crisis looks like .
The scandal erupts when evidence emerges that bishops have protected abusive priests , kept them active in parish assignments , covered up evidence of the charges against them , and lied to their people .
There is no such evidence in this or any other case involving Pope Benedict XVI .
Competent reporters , when dealing with a story that involves special expertise , seek information from experts in that field .
Capable journalists following this story should have sought out canon lawyers to explain the 1985 document -- not merely relied on the highly biased testimony of civil lawyers who have lodged multiple suits against the Church .
If they had understood the case , objective reporters would have recognized that they had no story .
But in this case , reporters for the major media outlets are far from objective .
The New York Times -- which touched off this feeding frenzy with two error - riddled front - page reports -- seized on the latest " scoop " by AP to say that the 1985 document exemplified :
… the sort of delay that is fueling a renewed sexual abuse scandal in the church that has focused on whether the future pope moved quickly enough to remove known pedophiles from the priesthood , despite pleas from American bishops .
Here we have a complete rewriting of history .
Earlier in this decade , American newspapers exposed the sad truth that many American bishops had kept pedophile priests in active ministry .
Now the Times , which played an active role in exposing that scandal , would have us believe that the American bishops were striving to rid the priesthood of the predators , and the Vatican resisted !
No , what is " fueling a renewed sexual abuse scandal " is a media frenzy .
There is a scandal here , indeed , but it 's not the scandal you 're reading about in the mass media .
The scandal is the complete collapse of journalistic standards in the handling of this story .

Helping Out
Join the nokogiri - talk Google Group so you can communicate with others working on the port .
The key folks right now are Yoko Harada and Sergio Arbeo ( who did the original bulk of the work for GSoC 2009 ) .
I 'm also poking at it a bit in my spare time .
Post to the group to let folks know you want to help .
This will help avoid duplicated effort .
Pick tests that appear to be missing or incorrect Ruby logic , like " not implemented " , nil results ( " method blah not found for nil " ) or arity errors ( " 3 arguments for 2 " kinds of things ) .
These are often the simplest ones to fix .
Do n't give up !
We 're almost there !
One of the most commonly used native extensions for Ruby is the Nokogiri XML API .
Nokogiri wraps libxml and has a fair amount of C code that links directly against the Ruby C extension API ... an API we do n't support in JRuby ( and wo n't , without a lot of community help ) .
A bit over a year ago , the Nokogiri folks did us a big favor by creating an FFI version of Nokogiri that works surprisingly well ; it 's probably the most widely - used FFI - based Ruby library around .
But the endgame for Nokogiri on JRuby has always been to get a pure - Java version .
Not everyone is allowed to link native libraries on their Java platform of choice , and those that are often have trouble getting the right libxml versions installed .
The Java version needs to happen .
That day is very close .
I spent a bit of time this weekend getting the Nokogiri " java " port running on my system , and the folks working on it have brought it almost to 100 % passing .
It 's time to push it over the edge .
Here 's my process for getting it building .
Let me know if this needs to be edited .
Added rake - compiler and hoe to gems you need to install and modified the git command - line for versions that do n't automatically create a local tracking branch .
1 . Clone the Nokogiri repository and switch to the " java " branch2 .
Install racc , rexical , rake - compiler , and hoe into Ruby ( C Ruby , that is , since they also have extensions ) 3 .
Build the lexer and parser using C Ruby4 .
Build the Java bits ( using rake in JRuby ) 5 .
Run the tests ( again with rake on JRuby ) On my system , I get about 8 failures and 19 errors , out of 785 tests and 1657 assertions .
We 're very close !
A few other useful tasks :
If you 'd like to help fix these bugs , there 's a few ways to approach it .
It would be great if we could have a 100 % working Nokogiri Java port for JRuby 1.5 final this month .
I hope to see you on the nokogiri - talk list !

Nash even had a subtle retort worthy of Jackson himself .
" It 's news to me .
I 'm fortunate .
I do n't know if I 've been called for a carry yet , " he said after the Suns practiced Saturday , then he added straight - faced : " I 've never heard anyone accuse me of carrying it .
I mean , the best coach in the league Gregg Popovich [ of San Antonio ] did n't have a problem with it last week . "
Get it ?
Popovich the best coach in the league ?
" We have the best officials in the world , " Nash continued .
" I 'll just leave it up to them . "
Jackson had grinned when asked on Friday if it 's tough for the Lakers to prepare to face Nash , the reigning NBA skills champion , because of the Suns guard 's frenetic style .

How to make yourself happier in just a few seconds :
Imagine an important positive event in your life ( like meeting your spouse ) never happened .
Mentally subtracting cherished moments from your life makes you appreciate them more , makes you grateful and makes you happier :
The authors hypothesized that thinking about the absence of a positive event from one ’s life would improve affective states more than thinking about the presence of a positive event but that people would not predict this when making affective forecasts .
In Studies 1 and 2 , college students wrote about the ways in which a positive event might never have happened and was surprising or how it became part of their life and was unsurprising .
As predicted , people in the former condition reported more positive affective states .
In Study 3 , college student forecasters failed to anticipate this effect .
In Study 4 , Internet respondents and university staff members who wrote about how they might never have met their romantic partner were more satisfied with their relationship than were those who wrote about how they did meet their partner .
The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the literatures on gratitude induction and counterfactual reasoning .

Arctic 2010 Sea Ice Maximum , Visualized
Kathryn Hansen
NASA 's Earth Science News Team
Sea ice coverage over the Arctic Ocean oscillates over the course of a year , growing through winter and reaching a maximum extent by February or March .
This year , Arctic sea ice grew to levels beyond those measured in recent years but slightly below average when compared to the 30 - year satellite record .
What does the 2010 sea ice extent look like and how is NASA studying it ?
To find out , view NASA 's updated sea ice animation and watch a video interview with polar scientist Lora Koenig of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight center in Greenbelt , Md.Arctic sea ice and seasonal land cover change are shown from Sept. 1 , 2009 , when sea ice in the Arctic was near its minimum extent , through March 30 , 2010 , the day before sea ice reached its 2010 maximum extent .

In the past data has been provided by ISPs , and FCC officials have admitted it was worthless while still releasing reports based on it .
In order to get some real world data the FCC has contracted with SamKnows , a company who has worked with UK telecom regulators at Ofcom for similar purposes .
Their most recent work showed that users of the most popular UK broadband services were only getting about half the speed advertised .
After soliciting volunteers who have broadband internet service from across the US , SamKnows will be providing specially modified routers which will analyze various aspects of each user 's connection .
In addition to providing the data and analysis to the FCC , SamKnows will allow participants to view data about their individual connections .
Details on the methodology to be used for the study will be released by the FCC within the next few days .
According to SamKnows ' website they will begin taking applications from the public to participate in the study " in the next couple of weeks . "
Maybe somebody could explain Facebook to me .
I ’m on it and I still do n’t get it .
I hate it without understanding it , like a dog barking at a vacuum cleaner .
Facebook ’s in the news for violating people ’s privacy and selling off their information , for general malfeasance and sleaze , the usual stuff .
Boycotts are called for .
It ’s made me wonder : is something as apparently rotten as Facebook worth the trouble of boycotting ?
If you ’re misguided enough to join Facebook in the first place , do n’t you deserve everything you get ?
Let me just say in my own defense , I never intended to be on it .
As soon as I heard about it , I sensed it was sinister .
“ What ’s it good for ? ” I ’d ask , and the eager Facebook shill would say , “ It lets people find you , people you used to know . ”
“ Holy God , ” I ’d say .
“ I ’d pay to make that not happen . ”
For years , I maintained a semblance of human dignity .
But the nagging got so intense , I finally succumbed to peer pressure about six months ago .
I set up my Facebook “ profile , ” which was no sweat .
Nothing but name , rank , and serial number , that ’s all you ever give up .
As for a photo of me , well , I laughed at the very idea .
A photo of somebody could go up there , as long as it was n’t me .
Morticia Addams , maybe ?
Lots of people hailed me right away , wanting to be “ friends . ”
Some of them I actually knew , and did n’t hate , so there was a brief interlude that was practically heartwarming .
Jolly greetings ( “ Eileen !! How ARE you ?! ” ) and all that .
So that was okay .
But I was immediately disturbed about the whole “ wall ” phenomenon .
See , people who are your “ friends ” write short messages , and any replies from their “ friends ” also show up , and pretty soon you ’ve got streams of communiqués , many from “ friends of friends , ” aka total strangers , messing up your “ wall . ”
For sheer randomness , it ’s like reading the graffiti in a public toilet , only minus all the interest , because public - toilet - writing generally involves the thrill of anonymous venting , heavy on the obscenities .
On Facebook , nobody vents at all .
Nobody even swears .
They used to , apparently .
During its first phase , as millions of tiresome gasbags will tell you , Facebook was the site for stupid college kids to revile their professors and employers and describe their embarrassing sex lives and post pictures of themselves drunk .
Then professors and employers starting reading Facebook , and the feds went after the Einsteins who posted their “ Should Obama Be Killed ? ” poll , and the party was over .
Which meant Facebook was safe for the oldsters .
Oldsters are more cagy but still fundamentally stupid .
They persist in providing absurdly generous “ profile ” information about themselves , throwing their identities open to the world , but they ’re all carefully pretending to be nice and upbeat and not -crazy .
Look , I ’m all for strangers being nice in public ; hell , I ’m in favor of bringing back dueling , just to guarantee that everybody thinks twice before being impolite to others on the street .
But I do n’t want to go to a special site for blasts of can - do perkiness ( “ I had a great day today yodeling in the Swiss Alps ! ” ) or random endorsements ( “ Evelyn is a fan of STP Motor Oil ” ) .
The whole point of having friends , as opposed to “ friends , ” is that you do n’t have to relentlessly keep up appearances and strike poses .
You can get out of the public eye and relax and curse and rant and glower and generally express yourself .
So I did n’t understand the point of Facebook .
Pretty soon I was only using it to send private messages to actual friends , and what ’s the point of that ?
I already knew e-mail was a great invention .
The queasy blend of friends and “ friends ” is central to the Facebook experience .
People who might get some sane use out of Facebook are advertising something , a business or a service or something .
Facebook might have originated as a means of personal connection , but now it seems like strictly business disguised as personal connection , and the rhetoric of it is just as horrible as that sounds .
Everybody writes in ad - sized bits , everybody “ likes ” a million products and services , everybody affirms things and exclaims over things like TV pitchmen .
It ’s as if everyone you know is turning into those horrible shills who blog about things they pretend to like for company kickbacks .
( You might say that ’s nothing , so what — pretending to like something for cash is no big deal .
But if so , you ’re already a goner .
What you like and dislike is fundamental , and if you ’ve lost touch with that , you ’re a pod-person .
Ask Ralph Waldo Emerson , who said the pressure to conform in America is so intense that most adults can’t even articulate to themselves what their true preferences are , and that almost no one lives as a free human being but the occasional small boy , who will fearlessly declare the desires of his soul and body , and damn the consequence . )
After a few tentative attempts at posting on Facebook , I retreated into horrified silence .
I could n’t do the lingo .
Then I decided not to try to do the lingo .
It ’s kind of like advertising for yourself , if your self was a plastic novelty toy : lots of cute photos and “ hurray for everything ” patter .
I can only stand to look at it once a week .
But I ca n’t seem to cut ties , no matter how obviously I should .
I mean , many friends are on there , posting like mad , poor sods !
Plus there ’s a terrible fascination about Facebook : it ’s so godawful , but so generally embraced .
It made me start to believe there really is such a thing as “ postmodernity , ” and that most people have cheerfully given up the idea of having an authentic self .
Happy artificial constructs !
Meanwhile I ’m a leftover modern type , still hanging back in the era of alienation , clinging to my likes and dislikes , occasionally fretting about the death of God .
Speaking of the death of God , I went to a graduation ceremony the other day , where the keynote speaker was a celebrated sound editor on many famous films .
He did a PowerPoint presentation , heavy on the cornball humor that plays so well at graduations , showing the students that they are all “ iGrad ” units who need to upload the “ experience app ” and prepare for the world by self - branding , getting a logo , marketing themselves as product .
“ Because you ARE all products , ” he said encouragingly .
“ Universities are in the business of PRODUCING graduates , in the hopes that you will all become PRODUCTIVE in the world . ”
The kids ate it up , and the profs smiled , and the parents applauded enthusiastically .
Way in the back , I broke out in a cold sweat .
A campaign to declare the mass destruction of ecosystems an international crime against peace - alongside genocide and crimes against humanity - is being launched in the UK .
The proposal for the United Nations to accept " ecocide " as a fifth " crime against peace " , which could be tried at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , is the brainchild of British lawyer - turned - campaigner Polly Higgins .
The radical idea would have a profound effect on industries blamed for widespread damage to the environment like fossil fuels , mining , agriculture , chemicals and forestry .
Supporters of a new ecocide law also believe it could be used to prosecute " climate deniers " who distort science and facts to discourage voters and politicians from taking action to tackle global warming and climate change .
" Ecocide is in essence the very antithesis of life , " says Higgins .
" It leads to resource depletion , and where there is escalation of resource depletion , war comes chasing behind .
Where such destruction arises out of the actions of mankind , ecocide can be regarded as a crime against peace . "
Higgins , formerly a barrister in London specialising in employment , has already had success at the UN with a Universal Declaration for Planetary Rights , modelled on the human rights declaration .
" My starting point was ' how do we create a duty of care to the planet , a pre-emptive obligation to not harm the planet ? ' "
After a successful launch at the UN in 2008 , the idea has been adopted by the Bolivian government , who will propose a full members ' vote , and Higgins has taken up her campaign for ecocide .
Ecocide is already recognised by dictionaries , but Higgins ' more legal definition would be : " The extensive destruction , damage to or loss of ecosystem (s ) of a given territory , whether by human agency or by other causes , to such an extent that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory has been severely diminished . "
The ICC was set up in 2002 to hear cases for four crimes against peace : genocide , war crimes , crimes of aggression ( such as unprovoked war ) , and crimes against humanity .
Higgins makes her case for ecocide to join that list with a simple equation : extraction leads to ecocide , which leads to resource depletion , and resource depletion leads to conflict .
" The link is if you keep over - extracting from your capital asset we 'll have very little left and we will go to war over our capital asset , the last of it , " adds Higgins , who has support in the UN and European commission , and among climate scientists , environmental lawyers and international campaign groups .
Although there is debate over how frequently people go to war over resources such as water , a growing number of important voices are arguing this case .
Most recently Sir David King , the UK 's former chief scientist , predicted a century of " resource wars " , and in response to a report on resource conflicts by campaign group Global Witness , Lessons Unlearned , the UN appeared to accept many of the arguments .
Controversially , Higgins is suggesting ecocide would include damage done to any species - not just humans .
This , she says , would stop prosecutions being tied up in legal wrangling over whether humans were harmed , as many environmental cases currently are . :
" If you put in a crime that 's absolute you can't spend years arguing : you take a soil sample and if it tests as positive it 's bang to rights . "
Under an ecocide law , which would be more potent because prosecutions would be against individuals such as directors rather than the companies , traditional energy companies could have to become largely clean energy companies , much extractive mining would have to be scaled back or stopped , chemicals which contaminate soil and water and kill wildlife would have to be abandoned and large - scale deforestation would not be possible .
" I 'm only just beginning to get to terms with how enormous that change will be , " admits Higgins .
Higgins will launch her campaign through a website – thisisecocide.com – asking for global support to pressure national governments to vote for the proposed law if it is accepted by the UN Law commission .
The deadline for the text is January , and a vote has been scheduled on other amendments in 2012 .
It would need a two - thirds majority of the 197 member countries to pass .
Higgins hopes the UN's " one member , one vote " system will help over - ride likely opposition of some nations and vested business interests .
She also believes many businesses favour clear regulation because they fear a future public backlash .
And she cites how , when the US entered world war two , its car manufacturers - despite initial opposition - made 10 times the number of aircraft originally asked for .
" It shows you how industry can turn around very fast . "

Unlike all my other options which involve mounted paper prints , this attractive display option uses a dye sublimation technique to infuse the image onto a thin , rigid aluminum sheet with an ultra glossy finish .
The result is a luscious display of deep , bold colors with excellent clarity and high contrast .
The aluminum print is mounted on a 1/ 2 " deep recessed float frame , so the print appears to float off the wall with no hanging system visible .

Fine Art Print ( Loose Print for Framing )
This is the option if you want a fine art print to have matted and framed yourself .
Printed with pigment inks on archival heavyweight Hahnemühle Baryta paper , these prints have a semi-gloss surface and gorgeous , vibrant colors .
The print is delivered without mounting or framing , so you 'll need to handle it with care and take it to a local framer to have it matted and framed as you 'd like .

Hundert - Euro- Honorargrenze gilt auch für Filesharing - Abmahnung Peter Mühlbauer
Ein Urteil des Amtsgerichts Frankfurt macht die " Vergleichsangebote " von Bushido und Co. deutlich unattraktiver
Am Wochenende veröffentlichte die Initiative Abmahnwahn - Dreipage auf ihrer Website ein mittlerweile rechtskräftiges Urteil vom 1 .
Februar , das einigen Abmahnkanzleien Kopfzerbrechen machen dürfte : Darin stellt das Amtsgericht Frankfurt nämlich fest , dass der § 97a auch dann zur Anwendung kommt , wenn ein Internetnutzer abgemahnt wird , weil man ihm die Verantwortung für das Anbieten einer Musik - CD in einem Filsharingnetzwerk anlastet ( Az. 30 C 2353/09-75 ) .
Der Paragraf 97 a wurde im Herbst 2008 in das Urheberrechtsgesetz aufgenommen .
Wörtlich heißt es in der Vorschrift , dass sich der " Ersatz der erforderlichen Aufwendungen für die Inanspruchnahme anwaltlicher Dienstleistungen für die erstmalige Abmahnung [...] in einfach gelagerten Fällen mit einer nur unerheblichen Rechtsverletzung außerhalb des geschäftlichen Verkehrs auf 100 Euro " beschränkt .
Zur Eindämmung des Abmahnmissbrauchs erwies sich der Absatz aber bislang unter anderem deshalb als nur bedingt geeignet , weil sich Anwälte um Begründungen , warum er auf ihre Erwerbsgrundlagen nicht anwendbar sei , durchaus nicht verlegen zeigten .
So behauptete etwa ein Hamburger Jurist , der die Versteigerung einer gebrauchten CD bei eBay abgemahnt hatte , der Fall sei schon alleine deshalb kein einfacher , weil die Vorschrift für Sachverhalte mit " internationalem Bezug " nicht einschlägig und die betroffene Band ja aus England sei .
Nun erreichten die in Bremen und Frankfurt ansässigen Anwälte Sven Hezel und Gernot Schmitt - Gaedke , dass die Klage einer abmahnenden Kanzlei , die einen als " Störer " in Anspruch genommenen Internetnutzer auf Zahlung von 651,80 Euro Rechtsanwaltskosten verklagt hatte , " größtenteils " abgewiesen wurde .
Größtenteils deshalb , weil der Kläger statt der geforderten 651,80 Euro lediglich 100 bezahlen muss .
Auf das Urteil dürfte künftig in vielen Schriftsätzen verwiesen werden , mit denen sich Abgemahnte gegen überzogene Kostenforderungen wehren :
In seiner Begründung stellt das Amtsgericht nämlich explizit fest , dass in dem Filesharing - Fall alle vier Voraussetzungen des Paragrafen 97 a Absatz 2 erfüllt waren : Die Erstmaligkeit , die Einfachheit , die Unerheblichkeit und die Außergeschäftlichkeit .
Das Kriterium der Erstmaligkeit sah das Gericht dadurch als gegeben an , dass vom Beklagten keine den Kläger betreffende identische oder wesensähnliche Verletzungshandlung bekannt ist .
Sehr viel umfassender sind seine Ausführungen zum Kriterium der Einfachheit , bei denen es sich unter anderem auf einen im letzten Jahr vom Münsteraner Juraprofessor Thomas Hoeren veröffentlichten Aufsatz zu diesem Problem stützt .
1 Schwierig , so die Frankfurter Richter , sei die Abmahnung deshalb nicht gewesen , weil es zu solchen Fällen mittlerweile eine " umfangreiche und gefestigte Rechtsprechung " gibt , auf die ein Anwalt zurückgreifen könne .
Zudem habe sich der Ermittlungsaufwand , den die klagende Partei ins Feld geführt hatte , nach Inkrafttreten des Paragrafen 101 des Urheberrechtsgesetzes , der einen eigenen Auskunftsanspruch über die beim Provider gespeicherten Daten des Inhabers einer IP - Nummer gewährt , deutlich verringert .
Und dass die Anfragen über die Justizbehörden laufen müssen , erhöhe zumindest ihren juristischen Schwierigkeitsgrad nicht .
Weil die rechtliche Bewertung bei allen immaterialgüterrechtlich geschützten Werken gleich sei , könnten die Abmahnenden schließlich auch " regelmäßig auf vorformulierte Schreiben zurückgreifen " , in die sie lediglich den Empfänger , das " konkrete Werk " , die Kosten und die Nachweisdaten einfügen müssten .
Das von Abmahnanwälten am häufigsten gebrauchte Argument war , dass die Kostenbremse für Filesharing - Abmahnungen deshalb nicht einschlägig sei , weil sie nicht unter den in der Beschlussempfehlung des Rechtsausschusses aufgeführten Fällen zu finden ist .
Hierzu stellte das Frankfurter Amtsgericht klar fest , dass die dort explizit geschilderte Verwendung eines Stadtplanausschnitts , eines Fotos oder eines Songtextes auf einer privaten Homepage nur von " beispielhaftem Charakter " sein kann , weil in der Gesetzesbegründung auf den Einzelfall verwiesen wird .
Darüber hinaus hätten alle drei aufgeführten Beispiele mit dem behandelten Filesharing - Fall gemein , dass auch hier die " abstrakte Gefährdung " besteht , die Werke könnten von Dritten heruntergeladen und weiterverbreitet werden .
Hinsichtlich des Kriteriums der Erheblichkeit der Rechtsverletzung befand das Gericht , dass hierzu nicht einfach auf die Kriterien zum " gewerblichen Ausmaß " zurückgegriffen werden darf , welche zum Paragrafen 101 des Urheberrechtsgesetzes entwickelt wurden .
Weil die Entscheidung ein ganzes Musik - CD - Album betrifft , geht die Initiative Abmahnwahn - Dreipage davon aus , dass auch die Abmahnung von einzelnen Musikstücken alle vier Kriterien des Paragrafen 97 a Absatz 2 erfüllt und damit bei 100 Euro gedeckelt werden muss .
Aus solchen Abmahnungen machte unter anderem der unlängst wegen massenhafter gewerblicher Urheberrechtsverletzungen beim Herstellen der ( wie man nun weiß , sehr bedingt ) " eigenen " Werke verurteilte Gangsterrapper Bushido ein Geschäft .
Andere mit ähnlichen Abmahnungen auffällig präsente Namen sind Cascada , Culcha Candela , Matthew Tasa , David Vogt und die GmbHs Uptunes und Styleheads .
Mit dem jetzt vorliegenden Urteil dürften deren " Vergleichsangebote " mit Forderungen zwischen 350 - 480 Euro für Abgemahnte deutlich weniger attraktiv werden .
Abmahnwahn - Dreipage zieht aus der Entscheidung deshalb den Schluss , dass " Empfänger von Abmahnungen nicht schutzlos sind , sondern rechtliche Hilfe vieles bewirken kann " .

Israel says the denial may be a misunderstanding
Renowned US scholar Noam Chomsky has been denied entry to the West Bank by Israeli immigration officials .
Prof Chomsky , renowned for his work on linguistics and philosophy , was planning to deliver a lecture at Birzeit University .
Prof Chomsky , 82 , had been trying to enter from Jordan .
An Israeli interior ministry spokeswoman said it was to trying to clear the matter up and allow Prof Chomsky to enter .
Prof Chomsky said the officials were very polite but he was denied entry because " the government did not like the kinds of things I say and they did not like that I was only talking at Birzeit and not at an Israeli university too . "
He added : " I asked them if they could find any government in the world that likes the things I say . "
Prof Chomsky's Palestinian host for the visit , Mustafa al - Barghouti , told Reuters : " This decision is a fascist action , amounting to suppression of freedom of expression . "
The interior ministry spokeswoman , Sabine Hadad , said : " We are trying to contact the military to clear things up and if they have no objection we see no reason why he should not be allowed in . "
Prof Chomsky has frequently spoken out against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories .
The International Whaling Commission has just unveiled a proposal to legalize commercial whale hunting for the first time in 24 years .
Now , countries are deciding whether to support it -- or push back .
Already , New Zealand 's Foreign Minister has described some provisions as " unacceptable , " " inflammatory , " and " offensive . "
A massive global outcry is needed now , as other key countries choose how to react .
Avaaz will deliver this petition to the Commission delegates each time it adds another 100,000 signatures -- sign below and spread the word !
Haskell LLVM bindings
This package provides Haskell bindings for the popular LLVM compiler infrastructure project .
Compatibility
We try to stay up to date with LLVM releases .
The current version of this package is compatible with LLVM 2.9 and 2.8 .
Please understand that the package may or may not work against older LLVM releases ; we do n't have the time or resources to test across multiple releases .
Configuration
By default , when you run cabal install , the Haskell bindings will be configured to look for LLVM in /usr / local .
If you have LLVM installed in a different location , e.g. /usr , you can tell the configure script where to find it as follows :
cabal install -- configure - option=--with-llvm-prefix=/usr
Package status - what to expect
This package is still under development .
The high level bindings are currently incomplete , so there are some limits on what you can do .
Adding new functions is generally easy , though , so do n't be afraid to get your hands dirty .
The high level interface is mostly safe , but the type system cannot protect against everything that can go wrong , so take care .
And , of course , there 's no way to guarantee anything about the generated code .
Staying in touch
There is a low - volume mailing list named haskell-llvm@projects.haskellorg .
If you use the LLVM bindings , you should think about joining .
If you want to contribute patches , please clone a copy of the git repository :
git clone git://github.com/bos/llvm
Patches are best submitted via the github " pull request " interface .

Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) will unveil legislation Thursday that revokes the citizenship of Americans who join foreign terrorist groups .
Lieberman will be joined by Rep. Jason Altimire ( D - Pa. ) , who is introducing companion legislation in the House , as well as Sen. Scott Brown ( R - Mass . ) and Rep. Charlie Dent ( R - Pa . )
ADVERTISEMENT
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee drew a brief sketch of the bill Tuesday , saying that it would amend existing law that prevents Americans from joining foreign armies , besides Israel 's , at the cost of their citizenship .
Lieberman defended his legislation Thursday as similar in scope to laws which might have stripped citizenship of those who joined the German or Japanese military during World War II .
“ It ’s one thing to belong to a club , even a political group , that I might think is radical here in the United States , " Lieberman said during an appearance on Fox News .
" But when you join a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the United States Department of State , that ’s not your freedom of association .
You ’ve joined a group , one of whose central purposes is to bring down America , to ruin our security , to change our way of life , and I think when you do that you ’ve essentially said : I do n’t want to be an American citizen anymore . ”
The move comes days after Faisal Shahzad -- a Pakistani -American who is a naturalized U.S. citizen -- was arrested in connection with a failed plot to set off a bomb in New York City 's Times Square .
Shahzad could be subject to the law if it passes .
The bill would allow such individuals to be tried before military tribunals instead of civilian courts .
Lieberman 's legislation has drawn criticism some members of his own party who have expressed concern that the plan might be unconstitutional .
The senator said during the appearance on " Your World with Neil Cavuto " that it does not make sense for individuals like Shahzad should not enjoy criminal civil rights afforded to other Americans .
“ You have to think about it as if someone went over to Germany or Japan during the Second World War and joined the German or Japanese military , " Lieberman said .

If you are looking for some extra cash to add to your savings accounts or if you 're in need of money for an unexpected bill , believe it or not , there 's a pretty easy way to come up with the cash .
Really , the only things you need are an internet connection , a computer and a digital camera .
If you have these things , you can list a few items on Craigslist and make some quick cash .
This is a good way to make money without having to take on an a second job and you do n't have to pay taxes on it !!
Stop for a second and take a look around your home .
I 'm absolutely SURE there is something that you do n't use anymore and it's sitting in the corner gathering dust .
Like the old saying goes , one man 's trash is another man 's treasure .

I recently sold a laptop and a TV stand on Craigslist .
The laptop was just sitting around not being used since I bought a new MacBook .
The TV stand was out in the garage taking up the precious bit of space I have left .
In fact , if I was n't paying attention when I got out of the car , I would sometimes bump into it with the door of the car or my knees .
If you want to sell your item quickly and for top dollar , remember these tips :
Description .
Give a good , clear and
accurate
description of the item ; including the item condition .
For electronics , make sure you list the model number and specs of the item .
For example , if you are selling a digital camera , make sure you tell how many megapixels it has and what the zoom is .
If you are selling an item of furniture , make sure you include measurements .
You do n't want a potential buyer to get to your home and not buy the item because it was not the size they were expecting .
Make sure your item title is specific and eye - catching .
Make sure your buyers know how to contact you .
If you are going to list your email address , you should probably create a secondary email so you are n't giving your primary email address out to total strangers ( think spam ) .
Pictures .
Take good , clear photos of your item .
I personally would not buy anything if there was no picture of the item .
Putting up a stock photo is better than nothing but a photo of the actual item is preferable .
Condition .
Take a few moments to cleanup the item you are selling .
My TV stand was all dusty and dirty and it did n't look good at all in that condition .
I took a little time to clean and dust it and it looked good as new .
I would much rather buy an item that is clean and in good condition instead of one that may be in good condition but needs cleaning .
Price .
This is very important if you want your item to move quickly .
I 'm not saying you should give the item away but it does need to be priced accordingly .
If a new item is selling for $ 50 , you do n't want to list your used item for $ 55 .
If you are n't sure how to price your item , do an internet search and see what other similar used items are selling for .
Using the tips above , I was able to get rid of 2 items I was no longer using and bring in about $ 500 in additional cash .
I need to take some time to go through my closets and find more stuff to put up for sale .
Not only can I declutter my home ; I can make extra cash doing it .

Here 's when and how it 's going to go down !
Saturday , May 08 6:00 pm GMT ( GMT+00:00 )
Yeah , you can stop gawking now .
It 's full of stars , right ?
Well , TL sat down with one of the brightest to see what he has to say about Saturday .
Below , Brood talks to our resident TSL Champion about SC2 , the TLI , and what his goals are for the tournament .
Nony Talks
By Brood
TL : How are you feeling about the upcoming TLI ?
NonY : I think it will be fun .
I do n't feel very competitive about it because I have limited practice time .
TL : Do you feel like you have a strong sense of the strengths , weaknesses or game style of the gamers in this tournament ?
NonY : I do n't know much about the SC2 styles of these players .
I have not been watching all the SC2 events going on .
TL : In BW , you were renowned for your clean builds and efficient execution .
How much of that description applies to your play style now , in SC2beta ?
NonY :
When I 'm well rested , I think my execution is among the best in the world right now .
Unfortunately , it 's been rare for me to be well rested lately .
I think I have cleaner builds than other people but I still hesitate to call them clean .
There was just way too much knowledge and experience behind my builds in BW and I 'm not anywhere near that point in SC2 .
TL : Which map or maps do you feel the most comfortable on ?
NonY : I like Metalopolis and Lost Temple but I think that might be common , especially among BW players .
They do n't have backdoors and they have many expansions .
TL : Is there a match - up that you feel is stronger than the others for you right now ?
NonY : I feel good about PvZ .
From the start of SC2 I have been thinking " I do n't want to be awesome at PvZ and bad at PvT like I was in BW " because I 'd rather have balanced matchups .
But I can't help it .
I love killing Zerg .
PvP is probably my weakest right now just because I 'm having trouble coming up with solid builds on many maps .
Against good players , I have yet to overcome the rock - paper - scissors dynamic like I did in BW PvP .
But of course I feel that 's entirely my fault , not some flaw in the game .
TL : Where do you feel you fall in regards to the rankings of American players before this tournament ?
How dependant would your personal rankings be on race ?
NonY : I think I rank pretty well .
Not as well as I did in BW but I am getting there .
I do n't think about race at all -- only how well they are playing .

Of course , Nony wont be getting a PvZ straight off .
He 'll start the day by facing qxc in a TvP .
How do we know ?
The bracket , of course .
Courtesy of random.org , we bring you the battle lines .
Look at that bracket and tell us you 're not expecting great games .
We certainly are !
From big names like Nony , Artosis , Tasteless and Day [ 9 ] to Team EG representing en masse in the form of Incontrol , Inka , Machine , Lzgamer and Louder , this TLI is littered with well known Starcraft : Broodwar personalities .
We 've got a few WCG US winners and even a TSL champion thrown in here , and if these guys do n't give us some games to remember , no one will .
What 's more , all of these players know each other very well , and the matches that unfold are sure to display this in style .
The rest of the pack includes TL favourites like Orb , a Protoss who is know for his great manner and awesome sentry usage and Cauthonluck , a player who , apart from being famous for his 11 Port build against Idra in MLG , is regarded as one of the best Terrans on US at the moment .
Speaking of Idra , the top American Zerg declined our invitation to play in this TLI and will be sitting this one out .
Of course , this does n't mean that there will a shortage of the swarm in the tournament .
Among other Zergs , Slush , an old school BW player is back after a lengthy RTS hiatus in which he played Counter - Strike .
Along with PainUser , Attero , Huk and qxc , he fills out the rest of the bracket , and completes the sixteen who will battle it out this weekend !
The Liquipedia team has been hard at work and compiled some information on all the players involved in this tournament .

With a healthy dose of Terran , Protoss , Zerg and Random , we think this bracket is going to give us some great Starcraft , and we hope you 'll join us this weekend as this event is casted live by TL's own Chill .
Be there , or risk welling up with envy as you hear over and over just how fantastic it was to see this go down .
See you Saturday , TL !

A little over a month ago , the first ever Team Liquid SC2 Invitational was played off on the European server , with WhiteRa emerging as Champion and TheLittleOne securing second place .
With some of the most exciting SC2 games to date , the tournament was awesome to watch , and as we step into the second leg of our Beta TLIs , we 're hoping that the US Edition will be nothing short of spectacular as well .

Ooey , gooey , melty cheese .
Salty bacon .
Briny olives and sweet sundried tomatoes .
The earthy sharp scent of oregano and basil .
Pillowy soft nuggets of buttery bread , gently coaxed off a warm loaf .
Heaven .
My friends , I promise you that I ’m not spouting hyperbole when I say that this is the best thing I have ever baked .
Ever .
Bar none .
If I had eight hungry friends at our house every weekend ( as opposed to every second weekend ) , this would easily become my pièce de resistance ; that recipe I was known for , the one that my near and dear would wax poetic over while thwarted lovers thrashed in the night , dreaming of what might have been .
Yes , this bread is THAT GOOD .
I think this bread might cure cancer .
There ’s no empirical evidence yet , but let ’s just wait and see .
If this bread was a band , I would don a mini-skirt and become a groupie with purple hair and a drooling over bite .
This is Obama - bread .
It is the cure to all things , and it bridges all gaps ( which I can totally say , because I ’m Canadian , eh .
We ’ll let you fight it out south of the border ) .
If this bread was a movie star it would be George Clooney .
We would all swoon against our wills , with tepid mutterings about how this ca n’t possibly be a healthy relationship , as we sidle just a little bit closer and lean in nice and deep .
PS – this bread loves a tight V - neck sweater .
I think it ’s official , and I am ready to ask you , plaintively , that if you just decide to make one thing from our site , let it be this .
If there is even one recipe that compels you beyond all others , tab away from it and focus on this .
I promise you , this is the bread of champions .
This is the bread that wins hearts and steels the souls of the damned .
This is the bread that I would make each and every day for the rest of my life if I did n’t have such a desperate fear of gout .
In short , this is THE BREAD .
Make this bread .
Share this bread .
Eat this bread .
Bread .
Bocconcini Stuffed Mediterranean Bacon Pull Aparts
Makes 1 large loaf , perfect for sharing
1 tbsp active dry yeast
12 tbsp unsalted butter , divided
4 tsp sugar
1.5 cups warm water
1 egg
3.5 cups flour
2 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp dried oregano , divided
2.5 tsp dried basil , divided
1 tsp garlic powder *
8 -10 oil packed sundried tomatoes ( 1/3 cup chopped ) **
12 -16 kalamata olives ( 1/3 cup chopped )
1 bunch green onions , about 6 ( 1 cup chopped and loosely packed )
1/2 lb bacon
1.5 cups dry grated parmesan cheese ***
1/2 tsp red chili powder
1 tub ( 200 g or 36 pieces ) mini bocconcini ****
* If you have garlic salt rather than garlic powder , reduce the salt in the dough by 1/4 tsp .
** If you do not have oil packed sundried tomatoes , rehydrate them by putting the halves in a small bowl and adding just enough boiling water to cover them .
Let the tomatoes sit for 15 - 20 minutes , or until they are tender .
***
This is one of those times when it is absolutely okay to buy the can of pre-grated parmesan cheese from the dry goods section of your grocery store .
However , if you can get “ fresh ” pre-grated parmesan , which is nice and crumbly but without the whole processed foods embarrassment , that is even better .
What you do n’t want to do is grate the fresh cheese yourself because , frankly , that ’s a waste of money .
Your lovely Parmigiana Reggiano is perfect for adorning pasta and adding rich , salty flair to salads and flatbreads .
However , the longer strings of grated parmesan will not adhere properly to the dough balls , nor will they firm up in a respectable way without browning and eventually burning .
**** No mini bocconcini ?
You can use fresh mozzarella cut into cubes about the size of your thumb .
Huh .
That ’s assuming that your thumb is the same size as the thumb on my potato picking paws .
If you have piano fingers , opt for just slightly larger than a nickle .
Melt five ( 5 ) tbsp of butter and let it cool until it is just warm to the touch .
I do this by putting the butter in my microwave for 35 seconds , stirring to melt any bits that are still firm , and giving it just a minute or two to cool .
In a medium sized bowl spoon in the sugar and yeast .
Pour the warm ( not hot ) water over top and add the egg .
Whisk this together until it is combined and slightly frothy before whisking in the butter .
Let the mixture stand .
After about 5 - 7 minutes the yeast mixture should be frothy and have a fairly thick ( about 1/2 inch ) pale brown foam on top .
Yay yeast !
If this has n’t happened , unfortunately it means that your yeast is no longer active ( either due to age or poor storage ) and you will need to start again with fresh yeast .
Put the flour and salt into a large bowl along with one ( 1 ) tablespoon of oregano and one and a half ( 1.5 ) teaspoons of dried basil .
Pour the buttery yeast mixture over top .
Stir until it comes together as a dough and then knead the ball in the bowl for about a minute .
Basically you just want to turn it over and around a few times , activating the gluten , and then let it rest .
Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and put it in a warm and draft free spot to rise for about an hour and a half .
Slice each rasher of bacon in half and then dice into chunks .
Put the bacon into a non-stick skillet over medium heat and fry the bacon until it is cooked through , slightly browned , and the fat is neatly rendered out .
Drain the fat from the bacon and strain the grease straight into a small bowl .
Melt the remaining seven ( 7 ) tablespoons of butter into the bacon fat .
Put the reserved bacon into a second bowl .
Pit the kalamata olives and give them a good chop .
Do the same with the sundried tomatoes and green onions .
Stir these fine friends together .
In a third bowl place the parmesan cheese , chili powder , garlic powder , remaining one ( 1 ) tablespoon of oregano and one ( 1 ) teaspoon of basil .
Stir this together .
When the dough has doubled in size it is ready to use .
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and start rolling it into a long cylinder .
Cut the roll of dough into quarters , and cut each quarter into slices until you have 36 pieces .
If math is not your strong suit , that means making 8 cuts into each for a total of 9 pieces per quarter .
Or cut more , I ’m not one to judge .
Just be sure that you have an equal ratio of dough slices to bocconcini balls , because can you imagine being the person to get the ONE DOUGH BALL that was left behind ?
If I was your friend , I would never forgive you .
Seriously .
Withholding cheese from me may mean a grudge that could never be overcome .
Pat each slice into a sort of flat , round shape .
Tuck one mini bocconcini into the center of each one and pinch the dough around it to make a seal .
Roll the ball between your palms a few times to make it nice and round .
Sprinkle one quarter ( 1/4 ) of the bacon and olive mixture into the bottom of a large , ungreased bundt pan .
Take a dough ball and roll it in the butter to get it nice and lubed up before rolling it around in the spiced cheese mixture .
Put the sauced and spiced ball into the bottom of your pan and repeat with another eight balls ( spaced about 1/ 4 ″ apart ) or until the bottom of the ring is just covered .
Sprinkle some of the bacon and olive mixture over top .
Repeat this process with the remaining dough , sprinkling the savoury mixture on top every 10 - 12 balls or so .
In terms of layering , this should end up being :
bacon / tomato / olives / green onion first layer dough balls bacon / tomato / olives / green onion second layer dough balls bacon / tomato / olives / green onion third layer dough balls
Drizzle any remaining butter mixture on top ( there should be about a tablespoon ) , disperse the last of your bacon mixture , and sprinkle any remaining parmesan on the whole lot ( there should be a scant 1/4 cup ) .
Put a tea towel on top of the bundt pan and let the bread sit in a warm , draft free spot for an hour , or until it has almost doubled in size .
You will be able to see gaping cracks in the cheese coating of each ball , and the dough should have risen almost up to the top of your pan .
While the bread is rising , preheat your oven to 350ºF .
Tuck the bread into the center of your oven for approximately 35 - 40 minutes , or until the top is browned and firm .
If the bread is browning too quickly but the dough still feels spongy when you lightly press down on it , loosely tent the pan with foil and allow it to continue cooking .
Turn the pan out onto a serving dish while it is still warm , and serve your buttery , decadent , cheesy bread .
Oh yeah .
That ’s what I ’m talking about .
Golden brown and utterly delicious .
When the bread is warm you can pull it apart into the individual morsels , each one filled with a rich , oozing center of molten cheese .
Does life even get any better than that ?
Five minutes into the Superbowl , and the bread already looked like this .
We were so full of carby goodness and dairy fat that frankly I was beyond caring who won or lost , I just wanted more cheesy Mediterranean pull apart bread .
This bread was a home run .
Or a TKO , winning shot , or whatever other kind of sports analogy it takes to mean that hungry fans are in your home and they are about to be pleased beyond their wildest dreams .
Because , people , if you think of this bread as the Olympics of pub - grub , that ’s just what I bring .
WASHINGTON — Republicans are promising a “ whale of a fight ” during the congressional election campaign if President Barack Obama picks too liberal a nominee to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens .
Eleven days before his 90th birthday , Stevens said Friday he would step down when the court finishes its work for the summer , in hopes that a replacement could be confirmed well before the next term begins in October .
Obama said he would quickly name a successor in the mold of Stevens , who he said was a voice for ordinary people rather than powerful interests .
A White House official said about 10 people are under consideration , but speculation has focused on fewer than that .
Leading candidates are said to be Solicitor General Elena Kagan , 49 , and federal appellate judges Merrick Garland , 57 , in Washington and Diane Wood , 59 , in Chicago .
All three were considered last year as well , and Obama interviewed Kagan and Wood before choosing Sonia Sotomayor for the high court .
Of those , Wood would be most likely to excite Obama ’s liberal base and stir up conservative opposition .
Garland is seen as most acceptable to Republicans , with Kagan somewhere in between .
Senate Republicans said the nominee should not be an activist , which they describe as someone driven by a preferred result rather than by the law .
In practice , though , Republicans find that only liberal Democratic - appointed judges wear the activist label .
“ I have hopes that President Obama will at least try to appoint somebody who will get a huge bipartisan vote , and if he will , he ’s going to go down in history as a better president , ” said Sen.
Orrin Hatch , R - Utah .
“ If he does n’t , there ’s going to be a whale of a fight if he appoints an activist to the court .
That ’s not good for him , it ’s not good for the Senate , it ’s not good for the country . ”
Looking toward the hearings , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said , “ Americans can expect Senate Republicans to make a sustained and vigorous case for judicial restraint and the fundamental importance of an evenhanded reading of the law . ”
Much like the Republicans , Democrats said they hoped to avoid a partisan fight , though neither party appears to expect anything other than a rancorous debate .
Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , appealed for civility .
“ I hope that senators on both sides of the aisle will make this process a thoughtful and civil discourse , ” he said .
With just 41 seats in the Senate — their second - smallest contingent in 29 years —
Republicans would have to be unified to block an Obama nominee .
Last year , nine Republicans joined to help confirm Obama ’s first high court nominee , the liberal - leaning Sotomayor .
Democrats said they would follow the same approach that led to Sotomayor ’s confirmation in August as the court ’s 111th justice .
Obama nominated her less than four weeks after Justice David Souter announced his retirement .
The Senate held a confirmation hearing in July .
Stevens is the court ’s last remaining World War II veteran .
His retirement had been hinted at for months , and the White House had made clear it would be ready to nominate a replacement quickly .
At the very least , the high court nomination could rev up both Democratic and Republican fundraising machines for the November election , even though Stevens ’ replacement by a liberal - leaning justice would not alter the court ’s ideological balance .
Partisans on both sides were ready for a conflict .
Jay Sekulow , chief counsel at the conservative American Center for Law and Justice , said , “ President Obama is likely to name a nominee who will embrace an extremely liberal judicial philosophy . ”
Michael Keegan , president of the liberal People for the American Way said , “ In recent years , the court has given extraordinary preference to powerful interests at the expense of ordinary Americans .
Justice Stevens was a bulwark against that trend .
Our country ’s next justice must play a similar role . ”
How much of a fight Republicans put up probably will turn on whom Obama chooses .
“ If it ’s Diane Wood , I think you ’ll see a very strong pitched battle , ” said Michael Carvin , a partner with the Jones , Day law firm who served in the Reagan administration Justice Department and is active in Republican politics .
Beyond the political back - and - forth , a new justice is unlikely to exert the same influence for which Stevens has been known over the past 15 years .
He has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to attract the support of the court ’s swing votes , now - retired Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy , to preserve abortion rights , to limit application of the death penalty and to restrain Bush administration policies on the detention of suspected terrorists following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
However , after the arrival of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , President George W. Bush ’s appointees , Stevens more often was among the four liberal justices in dissent .
He was on the losing end of a major case involving campaign finance laws in January .
That dissent showed both the eloquence of Stevens ’ writing and , in his stumbling reading of his opinion in the courtroom , signs that his age might at long last be affecting him , though he remains an active tennis player and swimmer .
Roberts said in a written statement Friday that Stevens “ has enriched the lives of everyone at the court through his intellect , independence , and warm grace . ”
We write about hockey , things we find funny , and the occasional atrocious bowel movement .
Affectionately named after the sportscaster Jay Onrait , we believe we need to bring our message of hope and liberty to the masses .
We are the Jay Onwrites .
I started the C25K last night .
Running for 60secs then walking for 90secs and alternating about eight times .
It was difficult but probably the same amount of work out as I get when I go running .
Because my iPhone app was telling me when to run I pushed myself .
Usually on my runs I run a 16:50 minute mile .
I did the calculations when I got home and I ’d been doing a 14:14 minute mile !
Wow that ’s a big difference .
I do n’t ache a whole lot today and could probably run again but people keep telling me the importance of rest days .
Instead I ’m going to do some core work .
I heard about a challenge that is to do 100 sit ups and 100 squats .
You do as many as you can and keep improving on it until you can do 100 .
I went for a brisk 20 minute walk this morning too so that ’s a good amount of exercise for a rest day .
Have n’t gone over my calories today although not far off .
Having lamb curry for tea so iPhone app believes I ’ll have overdone it on the sat fat .
It ’s probably right .
As for the shoe reward I ’m dropping my rewards down to two quid per challenge .
So after W1D1 I ’m on two whole pounds !
Win !
I also went to the doctors today and happened to get weighed .
I ’m a whopping 5lbs lighter than on my scales at home .
that would put me 3lbs from my America target .
Wish my scales were that forgiving .
I do wish I had better scales .
Mine often say ‘ Error ’ which might mean I ’m too heavy .
Rude scales .
Medical Debt Reduction
If you 're having many sleepless nights due to stifling medical debt reduction and are contemplating bankruptcy , you are not alone .
According to an American Journal of Medicine study , 62 % of all bankruptcies in 2007 were associated with medical debt .
Over 80 percent of the bankruptcy filers were underinsured .
Thus , it 's no surprise that many people get into credit card debt to pay off medical bills .
The popularity of medically - related credit card debt primarily stems from major deficiencies in U.S. health plans .
Because of high insurance premiums , co-payments , and deductibles and excluded chiropractic , acupuncture , dental and optical care , and name - brand prescription drugs , a medical problem can easily cause you to pay tens , if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in out - of - pocket medical expenses .
However , medical debt reduction can be successfully achieved with the Debt - to - Freedom Plan .

RHEL 6.0 was long overdue for release and when the beta finally hit the community , the download and the traffic ratesproved it .
There has been quite new releases in Linux camp this year , with Ubuntu Lucid Lynx being released last month .
When it comes to RHEL , version 5.0 was released in 2007 with Linux 2.6.18 kernel and despite a barrage of incremental patches , it was beginning to show its age .
The major release sports a Linux 2.6.32 kernel , a hybrid of several kernels with a strong emphasis on virtualization .
That means that bulk of new features are found in the KVM ( ) , which allows for managing virtual machines as easily as physical machines .
KVM has been upgraded by adding a lot of performance and hardware support based upgrades .
XEN has gone and it might be hard for some to make a move towards KVM .
Another addition on board is the addition of SELinux Sandbox which allows you to run any kind of arbitrary or untrusted code on your virtual machine , and is pretty handy with virtual hosts and allows to run guest machines in isolated environments .
Better multi-core support is the buzzword with RHEL 6.0 supporting new chip architectures including Intel 's Xeon 5600 and 7500 and the Power7 from IBM .
Also RHEL offers a plethora of disk formatting options when it comes to choosing a file system , with native support to ext4 and support being added for XFS file system .
Added support for Nvidia display drivers has been added .
When it comes to installation , the familiar Anaconda installer offers preconfigured software packages to suit your needs .
Pre -configured options include basic server configuration , web server packages , the desktop setup or the bare “ ” install , however you can customize your installation as per your whims by selecting individual packages .
However , upon installing the basic desktop setup , I found out that RHEL is not the place to look for the latest in the GNOME developments ( ) , the beta is stuck at GNOME 2.28 and several other prominent software offerings like Firefox and open office are showcased in their older versions .
However on the server front , everything was close to their latest stable version ; with Perl 5.10 , PHP 5.3 , Apache 2 and MySQL 5 bundled for web admins .
RHEL is targeted at enterprise deployment and development and you are better off with light weight linux distros for casual desktop use .
But its worth a try if you are just curious .
You can download beta from here ) , RHEL is available for these architectures , choose your pick from there :)
The car was a 1936 Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic .
Only three of these cars were ever built and it was designed by Jean Bugatti , the son of Ettore Bugatti .
The cars were made from aluminium with distinctive riveted seams .
This is one of only two of the cars that remain in their original condition : the other is owned by Ralph Lauren .
The car had been part of a Bugatti collection owned by neurologist Dr Peter D. Williamson .
Following the death of Williamson in 2008 , and the consequent sale of the other cars in the collection ( for $ 15.5 m ) , Gooding & Company brokered a deal on behalf of the family , with the Mullin Automotive Museum .
The car is known to have been sold for at least $ 30 million , although some sources suggest an even higher figure .
Previously , the highest price known to have been paid for a car was for a 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa .
This auction carried out by Sotherbys , in Maranello , Italy , in May 2009 saw the car sold to an unknown telephone bidder for $ 12.2 m
This specific Ferrari is considered one of the most competitive racing Ferraris ever built , having won 10 races in North and South America between 1958 and 1961 .
It boasts a 300 bhp , 2,953 cc single overhead cam degrees V - 12 engine , six Weber 38 DCN carburetors and a four - speed manual gearbox .
Only 22 of these cars were ever produced .
It would appear that year by year the highest price record is being smashed .
Prior to the 2009 auction , in 2008 , again at the Ferrari test track , Fiorino , in Italy at the annual Sothebys ’ auction , a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Spyder California came up for sale .
This car had previously been owned by actor James Coburn .
This time the purchaser was not unknown : it was UK radio and television presenter Chris Evans , who paid $ 11 m for the privilege of owning it .
Following the sale of the Bugatti Leslie Kendall , curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles , said : “ It does sort of recalibrate things in the sense that now , it ’s official , certain cars have reached the level of art .
People will start paying attention .
It ’s should be obvious that there are connoisseurs out there who appreciate cars just as much as they do art , fine wine , furniture and sculpture .
“ When the first car sold for seven figures , nobody could believe it .
Then one went for eight figures , now the Williamson Bugatti .
The nine - figure car is out there .
It ’s just a matter of when . ”
Edit added 14 May 2010
From the Sun newspaper today :
“ Chris Evans gave himself a present for pulling in a million more Radio 2 listeners – the most expensive car in Britain .
The Beeb DJ celebrated getting a breakfast show audience of 9.5 million by paying £ 12 million for the vintage Ferrari 250 GTO .
His latest motor cost £ 6,000 when new in 1963 .
Evans , 44 , who collects Ferraris as investments , flogged at least three from his existing fleet to help pay for it .
Just 36 of the 174mph roadgoing racing cars were made – and Ferrari nut Evans had long dreamed of owning one .
Evans , who has a £ 45 million fortune ….
stumped up around 20 million US dollars – and he plans to use the car on the road . ”

Armed with only an iphone and a piece of chalk , one Portobello resident has been chalking up a small victory for unwary pedestrians on the streets of Portobello
A Portobello resident has been out on the streets marking dog mess with chalk , in an effort to keep his fellow pedestrians from having an unfortunate mishap .
Paul Lambie is surprisingly modest about his recent act of good citizenship .
" It definitely made a few people smile .
I 'm pretty confident that nobody watches their dog take a dump and then walks off happy .
I hope it 's most often an accident .
Maybe it 's older folk that can't bend down to pick up the doo .
It IS something that needs addressing and I thought I might be able to get people talking about solutions .
And it 's funny .
It 'd be great if people all over town started chalking up dookie warnings . "
Lambie is n't the first to take this matter into his own hands .
Will Perrin , who writes a local blog about Kings Cross in London , used colourful Islington Council flags to draw attention to the worst areas in his neighbourhood .
There have even been suggestions by some , such as Nicky Getgood of Talk About Local that we harness the power of social media tools like twitter to create a geo - tagged #ukpoo map of Britain , similar to the #snowmap that was created last winter .
There is a serious issue here .
As Getgood writes in her call to arms , " it 's filthy , unsightly and downright dangerous when there are children about ( Toxocariasis is no urban myth ) . "
And , as the council website makes clear , it is an offence not to clear up after your dog when they foul a public place .
For now , Lambie 's old school use of chalk is an interesting way of raising awareness .
Perhaps other good citzens of Edinburgh could start chalking warnings on the worst streets in the city .
If you do , drop Guardian Edinburgh a photo .
You can even use the FixMyStreet tool on the frontpage to let the council know where it is .

Iowa Governor : Branstad 53 % , Culver 38 %
Rasmussen Reports ^ | Monday , May 03 , 2010
Posted on by iowamark
With the Iowa Republican Primary just five weeks away , former GOP Governor Terry Branstad still attracts much more support than either of his party rivals in the race against current Democratic Governor Chet Culver .
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey shows Branstad with 53 % support from likely Iowa voters to Culver 's 38 % .
That s a two - point increase in support for Culver since March and his highest level of support against Branstad since Rasmussen Reports began polling voters about the gubernatorial race last September .
But only three percent ( 3 % ) of voters remain undecided , while six percent ( 6 % ) prefer another candidate .
The gap between Culver and each of the other two GOP hopefuls is much narrower .
Against businessman and educator Bob Vander Plaats , Culver attracts 41 % support to Vander Plaats ' 45 % .
They were even closer a month ago , though , when Vander Plaats led 42 % to 40 % .
Nine percent ( 9 % ) currently prefer some other candidate given the match - up , and five percent ( 5 % ) are undecided .
State Representative Rod Roberts , a latecomer to the race , earns 41 % to Culvers 43 % .
The men were similarly positioned in the previous survey .
Nine percent ( 9 % ) favor another candidate , and seven percent ( 7 % ) are undecided .
Republicans will pick their nominee on June 8 .

If it 's in the news , it 's in our polls ) .
Rasmussen Reports updates are also available on Twitter or Facebook .
The survey of 500 Likely Voters in Iowa was conducted on April 29 , 2010 by Rasmussen Reports .
The margin of sampling error is +/- 4.5 percentage points with a 95 % level of confidence .
Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research , LLC .
See methodology
Republican Senator Charles Grassley continues to enjoy more than 50 % support in match - ups with three potential Democratic challengers .
Branstad , who served as governor from 1983 to 1999 , has been president of Des Moines University in recent years .
He is viewed very favorably by 29 % and very unfavorably by 21 % .
Seven percent ( 7 % ) have a very favorable opinion of Roberts , while 10 % view him very unfavorably .
Vander Plaats is viewed very favorably by 12 % and very unfavorably by 20 % .
For Culver , very favorables are 14 % , but very unfavorables are 35 % .
At this point in a campaign , Rasmussen Reports considers the number of people with a strong opinion more significant than the total favorable / unfavorable numbers .
Little changed from the previous survey are the 43 % who approve of the job Culver is doing as governor and the 56 % who disapprove .
This includes 15 % who Strongly Approve and 32 % who Strongly Disapprove .
Fifty - seven percent of Iowa homeowners believe that the value of their home is worth more than their mortgage , close to the national percentage who say so .
Thirty - seven percent ( 37 % ) say they owe more on the mortgage than their home is worth .
Fifty - six percent ( 56 % ) of likely voters in Iowa favor a welcoming immigration policy that keeps out only national security threats , criminals and those who would come here to live off our welfare system . 
Twenty - four percent ( 24 % ) disagree .
Fifty - six percent ( 56 % ) favor legislation like the law just adopted in Arizona that would authorize local police to check the immigration status of those whom they suspect of being in the country illegally .
This compares to 60 % nationally .
But 54 % are at least somewhat concerned that efforts to identify and deport illegal immigrants will also end up violating the civil rights of some U.S. citizens . 
In 2008 , Rasmussen Reports projected nationally that Barack Obama would defeat John McCain by a 52 % to 46 % margin .
Obama won 53 % to 46 % .
Four years earlier , Rasmussen Reports projected the national vote totals for both George W. Bush and John Kerry within half - a- percentage - point .
In Iowa during the 2008 campaign , Rasmussen Reports polling showed Obama leading McCain by eight , 52 % to 44 % .
Obama won by nine , 54 % to 45 % .
Other Iowa polling that year showed Senator Tom Harkin defeating Christopher Reed 57 % to 41 % .
Harkin won 63 % to 37 % .
In the 2006 race for Governor of Iowa , Rasmussen polling showed Chet Culver leading Jim Nussle 49 % to 45 % .
Culver won 54 % to 44 % .
In 2004 , the final Rasmussen Reports poll in Iowa showed George W. Bush and John Kerry tied at 48 % .
The final numbers were Bush 50 % , Kerry 49 % .

Greensgorge makes the Greenspad , a stainless - steel mousepad .
It is " the last mousepad you 'll ever need . "
Snark Law would dictate that I point out that all mousepads are the last mousepad you 'll ever need because , unless you compute on a glass - topped desk , you do n't need a pad at all .
But aesthetic considerations contradict the laws of snark and tell us instead that this is in fact the hottest mousepad ever .
The Greenspad is hand - cut from 1/8 - inch hot - rolled steel sheet into a variety of shapes , sanded , burnished and then , depending on your order , engraved .
The pads vary in price , with most coming in at $ 40 - $ 50 , and they have a lifetime warranty .
Given that all you 'll be doing is sliding a Teflon - footed plastic box around on top , we do n't think you 'll ever be claiming on that warranty .
You can go for boring old rectangles , but our favorite is the Ravenholm ( above ) , which looks like the blade from a circular saw but is in fact " 9 - inches of zombie - decapitating magic to ride your mouse around on . "
Aw hell yeah !
Now all I need is an actual mouse to ride on it .

Computer tycoon Sir Clive Sinclair , 69 , weds his 33 - year - old lap dancer
Simple ceremony : Angie Bowness and Sir Clive Sinclair wed at the Civil Court in Las Vegas on April 16
It was the unlikely relationship that many thought could never last .
But the Daily Mail can reveal that computer tycoon Sir Clive Sinclair , 69 , has secretly married his lap dancer fiancee Angie Bowness , who is 36 years his junior .
They have been engaged a year but have been seeing each other , on and off , for more than a decade .
The pair wed at the Civil Court in Las Vegas on April 16 .
The single witness is believed to have been a passer - by .
The inventor and Miss Bowness , 33 , a former Miss England , had flown to the U.S. two days before and were staying at the luxurious Bellagio Hotel .
Before heading for the U.S. , Sir Clive had bought a platinum wedding ring from jeweller Asprey .
Last night , Miss Bowness told the Mail : ' We 're over the moon .
We 're very happy . '
Sir Clive said : ' I suggested on the plane that we get married .
It was a spur of the moment thing . '
When asked what qualities attracted him to his future bride he replied : ' Well she is a former Miss England , is n't she . '
He added : ' We do n't know where we will honeymoon yet - it 's all been rather quick . '
On marrying at the age of 69 , he said : ' I had n't thought I 'd get married at this stage ' .
And , asked about the age gap between the pair , he replied : ' It 's just an age gap .
Our relationship works extremely well .'
According to sources , the vows were kept very simple because ' they just wanted to legally formalise their relationship ' .
Last night , a friend of Miss Bowness said : ' Angie is absolutely over the moon to have married Sir Clive .
And he 's thrilled - he can't stop calling her My Lady . '
Indeed , Miss Bowness now takes the title of Lady Sinclair .
She apparently wore a ' cute ' short blue Alexander Wang dress for the ceremony and Christian Louboutin shoes .
Sinclair , meanwhile , chose a suit .
Miss Bowness was working as a stripper in Stringfellows ' club in Central London when Sir Clive , inventor of the pocket calculator and the ill - fated C5 electric car , first got to know her in 1996 .
Happy couple : Sir Clive with Angie , who is 36 years his junior - the pair have dated on and off for a decade
However , shortly after that first encounter privately - educated Miss Bowness fell in love with businessman Mark Thornton .
Miss Bowness and Mr Thornton 's son Marcus was born in April 1998 .
But they broke up two months after the child 's birth and Sir Clive and Miss Bowness started dating again .
In October 1998 , Miss Bowness again left Sir Clive .
Even so , she and the inventor remained friends .
In 2003 , he proposed , despite the fact that they were not even dating at the time .
She turned him down , saying that she was too young .
But in February last year , Miss Bowness finally agreed to marry the former Mensa chairman .
She owns two homes but moved into Sir Clive 's £ 5 million flat overlooking Trafalgar Square following their engagement .
He is said to be close to her son Marcus , now 12 .
A film shoot about a Nassau County Police detective had more officers on the scene than the director wanted .
Fred Carpenter was directing a scene from his movie about a Nassau County Police detective , " Jesse , " at a Bellmore convenience store on Tuesday .
Since he was shooting on private property , he never notified police of the shoot .
The scene focuses on a gunman taking people hostage inside the store .
Someone driving by saw the commotion and called police .
Carpenter soon had more officers than he intended for the scene .
" All of a sudden I 'm directing and 15 police officers come in , " Carpenter told the Associated Press .
" And for a moment I 'm thinking it 's part of the movie and then I said , wait a minute , I wrote the movie and this was n't in the film .
And it was like , insanity . "
Police say it could have been tragic .
When police arrived , the gunman was in the store still holding the fake gun in his hand .
A Nassau County Police spokesperson said officers " showed great restraint " in defusing the situation .
The film stars Burt Young , best known for his role of ' Paulie ' in the " Rocky " movies .
For now , the shoot has been rescheduled and Carpenter says he learned his lesson and will notify police .
" They 're here to protect us and something bad could have happened , " Carpenter said , " We were so close to the highway , I guess we did n't realize that people would be looking in . "

A little over a year ago , Amarillo ’s swingers geared up for their New Year ’s Eve party at Route 66 Party and Event Rental , a downtown business owned by a prominent couple , Mac and Monica Mead .
Few in this conservative , church - heavy city knew about the weekend parties , and the swingers liked it that way .
“ Everybody in the lifestyle has to be very , very discreet , ” says Mac , a leather - skinned truck driver with a shaved head , piercing blue eyes and an earring .
The Meads enforced strict rules at the members - only club : no drugs , no single men , no audio - visual equipment .
Most couples , even ones who had been in “ the lifestyle ” for years , are on a first - name basis only .
The location of the club is ( or was ) “ to be kept strictly private . ”
So imagine the swingers ’ surprise when they arrived at their New Year ’s Eve bash to find two dozen protesters , local media in tow , holding signs and singing songs .
This was a most unwelcome coming - out party .
Some protesters , mostly young men in their teens and early 20s , wore black hoodies and military fatigues .
The men , Amarillo would soon learn , were foot soldiers of Repent Amarillo , a new , militant evangelical group that advertises itself as “ the Special Forces of spiritual warfare . ”
Their leader , David Grisham , a security guard at nuclear - bomb facility Pantex who moonlights as a pastor , explained the action .
“ We ’re here to shine the light on this darkness , ” Grisham told the Amarillo Globe - News .
“ I do n’t think Amarillo knew about this place .
This is adultery .
This is wrong .
There ’s no telling how many venereal diseases get spread , how many abortions . ”
The goal , Grisham says , was not just to save the swingers ’ souls , but to shut the club down .
It ’s hard for the swingers to drum up powerful allies in Amarillo , where real men worship Jesus at one of the biggest cowboy churches in the world and conservative politics run deeper than the Ogallala Aquifer .
Citizens of Amarillo will tell you , with a certain pride , that their city is the biggest little town in Texas .
For all the open space , it can seem like the walls are closing in .
For the past year , this Bible Belt city of 200,000 has been consumed by a culture clash between Repent Amarillo and their targets , a list that includes everything from gay bars to liberal churches .
For the Route 66 swingers , Grisham ’s “ special forces ” have been a near - constant presence .
Jobs have been lost , families estranged , assault charges filed and businesses shuttered .
So far , no public official has stood up to defend these businesses , which operate legally .
To the contrary , Repent Amarillo has managed to turn the city ’s own laws and employees into an effective weapon .
Amarillo , it turns out , does n’t have the stomach to stick up for gays , swingers , strippers or even Unitarians .
Absent a peacekeeper , the conflict might end up being settled the old - fashioned way , frontier - style .
“ This will not end until somebody gets hurt , either us or them , ” one swinger warns .
On a crisp winter night , Mac and Monica Mead lounge at the Route 66 club and recount the strangest year of their lives .
The club consists mainly of one room , a clean space with a tiny dance floor and some chairs and tables .
Off to one side is a hallway that holds three “ playrooms , ” each tackily decorated according to a different theme : Oriental , Egyptian ( featuring a wall hanging Mac ’s son brought back from a tour in Iraq ) , and jungle .
There is an eyebolt in the ceiling of the Egyptian room .
Mac says it ’s for one of the more popular attractions , a sex swing .
Mac chokes up a bit explaining how the place has been a “ home away from home ” for many .
The swingers are a decidedly working - class bunch : truckers , cabbies , schoolteachers and tow - truck drivers — hard - working couples , mostly married , who , for reasons known only to their libidos , enjoy having sex with each other ’s partners .
They ’re mostly middle - aged and are n’t going to win any beauty pageants .
A large - screen TV , which the Meads occasionally glance at , displays the surveillance camera on the parking lot adjacent to the building .
The lot , owned by the mayor ’s husband , has been the staging area for most Repent protests .
It ’s also used by Route 66 patrons .
Since the owner has n’t objected , Repent members can use the space , which puts them in direct contact with swingers and their vehicles .
Repent has been at every swinger get - together in the last year — 32 times , according to Monica ’s tally .
After the New Year ’s party , Repent tried to get authorities to shutter the club , first suggesting to local law enforcement that the Meads were running an illegal brothel .
When the cops showed no interest ( on - premises sex clubs are legal in Texas ) , the group filed complaints with the fire marshal and the city ’s code - enforcement division .
As in many cities , Amarillo code enforcement is primarily complaint - driven .
While it makes a certain amount of sense to focus on violations being noticed by the public , this case shows how easily the system can be manipulated .
The city did find some minor violations , like the lack of separate - sex bathrooms .
The club was shut down for five months while the Meads sank $ 20,000 into bringing the building up to code .
In June , when the building reopened , Repent Amarillo became an almost - constant presence , shouting through bullhorns , blasting Christian music , haranguing club members , following swingers in vehicles and sticking video cameras into people ’s faces .
The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission has been called out twice .
Police records show that nearby businesses have called frequently with noise complaints .
Repent even showed up on occasion when the Route 66 building was rented out for non-swinger events .
“ They have been here every time we open our doors , regardless of what kind of functions we have , whether I ’m down here doing maintenance , cleaning , whatever , ” Mac says .
“ They do n’t have a life .
Well , I guess we are their lives .
We ’re their blood .
At three or four in the morning , we ’ll open the door , and there they are .
They come waddling out of their vehicles with their cameras . ”
At first , the swinger community was mystified by the attention .
On the 60 - some hours of surveillance footage the Meads have , a swinger can be heard telling a Repent member that the swingers have n’t done anything to bother them .
“ You ’re going to hell , and it bothers me , ” Grisham responds .
“ What bothers me is you ’re going to hell . ”
Perhaps the most insidious tactic Repent uses is trying to destroy the reputation of the swingers .
In Amarillo , people can be ostracized over a whiff of impropriety .
On one tape , Grisham directs followers to get the license - plate numbers in the Route 66 parking lot .
“ A new couple can be here three or four hours , ” says Mac .
“ Whenever they leave , the Repent Amarillo group will call them by first and last name , know where they live , know where they work , just within a very few hours . ”
Randall Sammons says he was fired from his job of 13 years in August after his boss learned Sammons was a swinger from another employee , a Repent member .
He believes he ’s now as good as blacklisted in Amarillo .
“ I ’m screwed at finding a job , ” Sammons says .
Russell Grisham , David ’s 20 - year - old son who has a conviction on his record for hacking the computer system at his high school , has posted the names , photos and workplaces of swingers on the Internet , including one man whose wife works for a school district .
( “ Family - wise , it will kill both of us , ” the man says . )
In at least two instances , Repent members called swingers ’ employers .
Mac , meanwhile , is still far from the come - to - Jesus moment Grisham wants .
“ This group claims to be Christian , ” Mac says .
“ Sir , I am a Christian .
I believe in the God almighty , but I do not treat people the way they treat us or others . ”
In December , the Meads tried to get an Amarillo justice of the peace to issue a “ peace bond , ” which would have required Russell Grisham to forfeit money posted with the court if he continued threatening behavior .
The judge , Debbie Horn , said at the end of a three - and - a - half hour hearing that she did n’t have enough evidence to issue the bond .
While the authorities ’ hands - off attitude is mystifying to some in Amarillo , Norris , the city attorney , says the city ’s inaction is easily explained : Nobody ’s done anything illegal .
“ Both camps have pressed my office to use the power of government to shut down the other one , ” he says .
“ The swingers want me to shut down [ Repent ] .
Repent wants me to shut down the swingers . ”
He adds , “ The First Amendment is alive and well in Amarillo , and Amarillo is strong enough to allow everyone to have free speech . ”
It ’s debatable whether all of Repent ’s actions are legal .
In January , six Repent members showed up at a weekend swingers party at the private home of Cristal Robinson , Route 66 ’s attorney .
During the party , Robinson says the group trespassed on her property and tried to block cars from entering the driveway .
She called the police .
Sheriff ’s deputies showed up , followed not long after by a state trooper .
The two law - enforcement groups apparently had different ideas about how to handle Repent , according to a Potter County incident report .
The state trooper took photographs of the Repent vehicles and filled out suspicious activity cards , which go to the state ’s intelligence center .
The deputies , on the other hand , dismissed Robinson ’s account and left Repent to carry on .
Meanwhile the trooper stayed nearby .
Deputies later received a report that the DPS trooper was “ harassing ” Repent .
The deputies returned to find four “ extremely upset ” Repent members .
“ Big John ” Leinen complained to the deputies that the trooper had treated them “ like some sort of terrorist group . ”
Grisham claimed that the trooper had assaulted one of his people and broke a piece off the group ’s video camera .
The trooper told deputies he had observed Repent going through Robinson ’s dumpster and asked why the deputies “ did n’t write the protestors [ sic ] a citation for ‘ disturbing the peace ’ . ”
The deputy answered , “ because they are n’t disturbing the peace . ”
Deputies asked the trooper to leave , and no tickets were issued .
The swingers were mystified : How did Repent find out about the party ?
The invited guests had been carefully screened ; the event had n’t been advertised online ; and Robinson ’s home is miles outside of town .
Grisham claims he has an “ inside source ” but will say nothing more .
With law enforcement on the sidelines , swingers have retaliated in other ways .
Assault charges are pending against Monica Mead after Russell Grisham claimed he was assaulted outside the club .
Mead contends she accidentally fell into Grisham .
Charges were also filed against swinger Phillip Roark , who admits to slapping a video camera held by Russell Grisham .
Meanwhile , Repent has put the Meads on the brink of bankruptcy .
Since the protests started last year , the Route 66 building has been rented just three times , forcing the couple to put it up for sale .
For Repent , God had delivered a victory .
The group snatched up a Web site the Meads had let lapse , Route66 SwingersClub.com , and turned it into a call for “ adulterers ” to “ Repent or Perish ! ”
If it were n’t for the giant wooden cross over the porch , the Grisham house would be indistinguishable from the other middle - class homes on the quiet street .
Inside , visitors are greeted by a tidy , if somewhat shabby , interior .
I interview Grisham and his fourth wife , Tracy , a pleasant , moon - faced woman whose bangs hang in her eyes , and Leinen , who asked to videotape our interview .
Later , several men in their teens and early 20s show up dressed in camouflage pants .
They sit staring at laptops and do n’t say much .
In person , Grisham is friendly and polite .
“ I was a sexual sinner before I got saved .
I got saved seven years ago .
Prior to that –yeah , I ’ve been to strip joints and porn shops .
I ’ve done all kinds of things , ” he says .
“ We understand the destructive power of sin firsthand .
We ’ve lived it .
We ’ve walked in those shoes . ”
These days he ’s celebrating Repent ’s victory over the swinger ’s club .
“ We felt it was like the tip of the spear for sexual immorality for the devil in Amarillo , ” he says .
“ So we went after that specifically , and we exposed it so it would wither and die .
And it has . ”
Repent has made it clear that its crusade wo n’t end with the swingers .
Last January , community theater group Avenue 10 was set to open Bent , a play about the persecution of homosexuals during Nazi Germany .
The day before opening night , the fire marshal , police and code enforcers showed up , tipped off by a Repent associate , according to Sirc Michaels , co-founder of the theater .
Avenue 10 did n’t have the right permit for holding events , and the space was shut down .
What ’s next for Repent ?
They ’ve posted a “ Warfare Map ” on the group ’s Web site .
The map includes establishments like gay bars , strip clubs and porn shops , but also the Wildcat Bluff Nature Center .
Repent believes the 600 - acre prairie park ’s Walmart - funded “ Earth Circle , ” used for lectures , is a Mecca for witches and pagans .
Also on the list are The 806 coffeehouse ( a hangout for artists and counterculture types ) , the Islamic Center of Amarillo ( “ Allah is a false god ” ) , and “ compromised churches ” like Polk Street Methodist ( gay- friendly ) .
As I ’m preparing to leave the Grisham house , Russell announces that CNN has called and asked for a live interview .
In January , Repent caused a stir when the group rolled out BoycottHouston.com , a Web site that urges economic sanctions against Houston because the mayor is gay and a large Planned Parenthood building is being built .
In the Bible , Jesus commands his disciples to spread the good news of the gospel throughout the nations .
It remains to be seen whether Pastor Grisham ’s slightly less uplifting message will resonate outside the High Plains .

San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said he will bypass the Board of Supervisors and ask voters to decide on one of the city 's most contentious issues : whether it should be illegal for people to sit or lie down on sidewalks during certain hours .
In taking the debate about the sit / lie ordinance to the ballot box in November , Newsom is reacting to stiff resistance from a majority of supervisors .
They say the proposed law will unfairly target the homeless , day laborers and youth .
" It 's crystal clear that the board 's not serious about it , " Newsom said in an interview with The Chronicle .
" We 're moving forward with sit / lie . "
The mayor 's legislation is scheduled to be heard today before the board 's Public Safety Committee .
But Newsom has little faith that the board will approve it without watering it down after what his spokesman Tony Winnicker called a " kangaroo court " hearing before that committee two weeks ago .
Instead of relying on the board , Newsom said he will use his mayoral authority to put a similar measure on the ballot .
The measure comes at the urging of residents and merchants from the Haight - Ashbury neighborhood who first pushed it as a way to help deal with violent thugs camping in front of businesses and homes , harassing or attacking passers - by .
Those residents became frustrated after the almost seven - hour session before the Public Safety Committee on May 10 produced plenty of heated rhetoric on both sides , but no action .
It was the latest in a string of hearings on the topic before panels ranging from the Planning Commission to the Small Business Commission , including a five - hour hearing in March before the board 's Public Safety Committee , and many of the commissioners expressed concerns .
" I think the board mostly has been kicking the can down the road , " said Justin Buell , a 29 - year - old Haight - Ashbury resident who reported being punched and kicked when he asked a group of people camped in front of his home using drugs to move .
" I 'm happy to see it go to the voters . "
Board President David Chiu said the committee was n't stalling , but rather asking the tough questions on many residents ' minds .
" The mayor 's representatives were woefully ill - prepared and had no answers for the serious questions about the legality and effectiveness of this , " said Chiu , who has introduced his own measure for a neighborhood - based community court in the Haight that would also provide social services .
" They could n't explain why a half dozen laws on the books that have attempted to address the situation have failed . "
Still drafting a bill
It 's unclear exactly what shape Newsom 's ballot measure will take , although it will probably be a citywide ban on sitting or lying on public sidewalks during set hours , officials said .
Newsom originally considered two versions of the proposal : one that applied citywide , another that restricted behavior just on major commercial corridors such as Castro and Haight streets .
He put forward the citywide one .
Similar laws are on the books in numerous cities , including Santa Cruz , Palo Alto and Berkeley , although Newsom 's proposal would be more sweeping .
The mayor is basing his legislation on Seattle 's law , largely because it withstood a federal court challenge , but that ordinance applies specifically to commercial corridors .
Regardless , a coalition of groups from the American Civil Liberties Union to the San Francisco Labor Council to sex workers , is poised to oppose it .
Supervisor Chris Daly , who cut his political teeth as a homeless advocate , pointed to the ballot - box defeat of a less - restrictive measure pushed by Mayor Frank Jordan in 1994 .
" Let 's go to the ballot , " Daly said during the marathon May 10 hearing .
" That 's fine . "
Opponents contend that the measure will lead to police abuse , while better enforcement of existing laws against aggressive panhandling , assault and drug use could address neighborhood concerns .
Police officials say that 's not the case and that officers do n't have the authority to direct someone to stop lying on the sidewalk unless a witness or victim comes forward to lodge a complaint , thereby making them a target for retaliation .
Residents ' fed up '
" Listening to my citizens and community members , they 're just fed up , " said police Capt .
Teresa Barrett , who oversees the Haight .
" They 've had enough of all the uncivil behavior , the people with dogs and the random attacks on those unfortunate enough to get in their way . "
Despite the organized opposition , Buell said members of his grassroots movement are confident they will prevail in what promises to be a hard - fought political campaign that Daly described as a " wedge issue . "
" I think common sense will prevail in the end , " Haight skateboard shop owner Kent Uyehara said .
" It 's unfortunate that some are making this a political issue when in reality real people are rising up asking their government for help and not receiving it . "
In March , a Chamber of Commerce poll showed a sit / lie ordinance passing with 71 percent support for " a measure that prohibited individuals from sitting or lying on the sidewalks during specific hours in busy commercial or residential neighborhoods . "
" We 're a strong coalition , " Buell said .
" We 're the residents , the merchants , the police .
We 're literally the people .
We 're saying enough is enough . "
Try not to choke on the irony .
Glenn
Beck is enraged that people have been comparing the new immigration law in Arizona to Nazi Germany .
Yes .
Really .
He ’s mad .
Earlier today on his radio show Beck wanted to know how come it was okay for the left to rage over people making Hitler references but now it ’s okay for them to make them .
I thought it was bad to compare things to Nazi Germany … the left said that you should n’t use Hitler references and swastikas and compare things to Nazi Germany … I thought it was dangerous .
Did n’t Nancy Pelosi say , “ And they ’re using swastikas and stuff , and that ’s bad . ”
Was n’t everybody on the has n’t MSNBC been running nonstop , you know Timothy McVeigh was , you know , is being reincarnated right now ?
He got angrier on his show tonight .
Arizona sure is putting the AZ in Nazi .
I really hate to rain on the hate parade , but could we slow down for just a second here and ask :
You ’re out of your mind ?
Are you comparing the systematic cold - blooded extermination of millions of Jews , to America making sure people are here legally .
The parallels are non-existent .
Because , of course , non-existent parallels are a big no - no in Beckland .
Ha.
Short version of Beck ’s argument : this Nazi rhetoric is overblown and offensive , and Arizona is perfectly within it ’s right to step in where the federal government fails ( Beck is definitely not alone in this line of thinking ) , and it is perfectly okay to ask illegal immigrants to prove their citizenship ( no mention of the civil liberties of actual citizens ) .
Also , he ’s more than willing to concede if the law is unconstitutional it should be struck down .
In the meantime , the “ constitution is not a suicide pact … the states have to take action . ” Video below .
Side note : the title of this post was the subject line of Beck ’s daily email , which is what drew my attention to it .
Have a tip we should know ?

s7
s7 is a Scheme implementation intended as an extension language for other applications , primarily Snd , Radium , and Common Music .
It exists as just two files , s7.c and s7.h , that want only to disappear into someone else 's source tree .
There are no libraries , no run-time init files , and no configuration scripts .
It can be built as a stand - alone interpreter ( see below ) .
s7test.scm is a regression test for s7 .
A tarball is available : s7 tarball .
There is an svn repository at sourceforge ( the Snd project ) : Snd , and a git repository ( just s7 ) : git@cm-gitlab.stanford.edu :bil/s7.git s7.git .
Please ignore all other " s7 " github sites .
Christos Vagias created a web - assembly site with a repl : https://github.com/actonDev/s7-playground/.
s7 is the default extension language of Snd and sndlib ( snd ) , Rick Taube 's Common Music ( commonmusic at sourceforge ) , and Kjetil Matheussen 's Radium music editor .
There are X , Motif , and openGL bindings in libxm in the Snd tarball , or at ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/Lisp/libxm.tar.gz .
If you 're running s7 in a context that has getenv , file - exists ? , and system , you can use s7 - slib - init.scm to gain easy access to slib .
This init file is named " s7.init " in the slib distribution .
Although it is a descendant of tinyScheme , s7 is closest as a Scheme dialect to Guile 1.8 .
I believe it is compatible with r5rs and r7rs : you can just ignore all the additions discussed in this file .
It has continuations , ratios , complex numbers , macros , keywords , hash - tables , multiprecision arithmetic , generalized set ! , unicode , and so on .
It does not have syntax - rules or any of its friends , and it does not think there is any such thing as an inexact integer .
This file assumes you know about Scheme and all its problems , and want a quick tour of where s7 is different .
( Well , it was quick once upon a time ) .
The main difference : if it 's in s7 , it 's a first - class citizen of s7 , and that includes macros , environments , and syntactic values .
I originally used a small font for scholia , but now I have to squint to read that tiny text , so less - than - vital commentaries are shown in the normal font , but indented and on a sort of brownish background .
multiprecision arithmetic
All numeric types , integers , ratios , reals , and complex numbers are supported .
The basic integer and real types are defined in s7.h , defaulting to int64_t and double .
A ratio consists of two integers , a complex number two reals .
pi is predefined .
s7 can be built with multiprecision support for all types , using the gmp , mpfr , and mpc libraries ( set WITH_GMP to 1 in s 7.c ) .
If multiprecision arithmetic is enabled , the following functions are included : bignum , and bignum ? , and the variable (* s7 * ' bignum - precision ) .
( * s7 * ' bignum - precision ) defaults to 128 ; it sets the number of bits each float takes .
pi automatically reflects the current (* s7 * ' bignum - precision ) :
> pi 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884195E0 > (* s7 * ' bignum - precision ) 128 > ( set ! (* s7 * ' bignum - precision ) 256 ) 256 > pi 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286198E0
bignum ?
returns #t if its argument is a big number of some type ; I use " bignum " for any big number , not just integers .
To create a big number , either include enough digits to overflow the default types , or use the bignum function .
Its argument is either a number which it casts to a bignum , or a string representing the desired number :
> ( bignum " 123456789123456789 " ) 123456789123456789 > ( bignum " 1.123123123123123123123123123 " )
1.12312312312312312312312312300000000009E0
For read - time bignums :
( set ! *#readers * ( cons ( cons # \B ( lambda ( str ) ( bignum ( string - > number ( substring str 1 ) ) ) ) ) *#readers * ) )
and now # B123 is the reader equivalent of ( bignum 123 ) .
In the non -gmp case , if s7 is built using doubles ( s7_double in s7.h ) , the float " epsilon " is around ( expt 2 - 53 ) , or about 1e - 16 .
In the gmp case , it is around ( expt 2 (- ( * s7 * ' bignum - precision ) ) ) .
So in the default case ( precision = 128 ) , using gmp : > ( = 1.0 (+ 1.0 ( expt 2.0 - 128 ) ) ) #t > ( = 1.0 (+ 1.0 ( expt 2.0 - 127 ) ) ) #f and in the non-gmp case : > ( = 1.0 (+ 1.0 ( expt 2 - 53 ) ) ) #t > ( = 1.0 (+ 1.0 ( expt 2 - 52 ) ) ) #f
In the gmp case , integers and ratios are limited only by the size of memory , but reals are limited by ( * s7 * ' bignum - precision ) .
This means , for example , that > ( floor 1e56 ) ; (* s7 * ' bignum - precision ) is 128 99999999999999999999999999999999999999927942405962072064 > ( set ! (* s7 * ' bignum - precision ) 256 ) 256 > ( floor 1e56 ) 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
The non -gmp case is similar , but it 's easy to find the edge cases : > ( floor (+ 0.9999999995 ( expt 2.0 23 ) ) ) 8388609
math functions
s7 includes :
sinh , cosh , tanh , asinh , acosh , atanh
logior , logxor , logand , lognot , logbit ? , ash , integer - decode - float
random
nan ? , infinite ?
The random function can take any numeric argument , including 0 .
Other math - related differences between s7 and r5rs :
rational ?
and exact mean integer or ratio ( i.e. not floating point ) , inexact means not exact .
floor , ceiling , truncate , and round return ( exact ) integer results .
" # " does not stand for an unknown digit .
the " @ " complex number notation is not supported ( " @ " is an exponent marker in s7 ) .
" +i " is not considered a number ; include the real part .
modulo , remainder , and quotient take integer , ratio , or real arguments .
lcm and gcd can take integer or ratio arguments .
log takes an optional second argument , the base .
'. ' and an exponent can occur in a number in any base .
rationalize returns a ratio !
case is significant in numbers , as elsewhere : # b0 is 0 , but # B0 is an error .

See cload and libgsl.scm for easy access to GSL , and similarly libm.scm for the C math library .
The exponent itself is always in base 10 ; this follows gmp usage .
Scheme normally uses " @ " for its useless polar notation , but that means ( string - > number " 1e1 " 16 ) is ambiguous — is the " e " a digit or an exponent marker ?
In s7 , " @ " is an exponent marker .

What is ( / 1.0 0.0 ) ?
s7 gives a " division by zero " error here , and also in ( / 1 0 ) .
Guile returns +inf.0 in the first case , which seems reasonable , but a " numerical overflow " error in the second .
Slightly weirder is ( expt 0.0 0+i ) .
Currently s7 returns 0.0 , Guile returns +nan.0+nan.0i , Clisp and sbcl throw an error .
Everybody agrees that ( expt 0 0 ) is 1 , and Guile thinks that ( expt 0.0 0.0 ) is 1.0 .
But ( expt 0 0.0 ) and ( expt 0.0 0 ) return different results in Guile ( 1 and 1.0 ) , both are 0.0 in s7 , the first is an error in Clisp , but the second returns 1 , and so on — what a mess !
This mess was made a lot worse than it needs to be when the IEEE decreed that 0.0 equals - 0.0 , so we can't tell them apart , but that they produce different results in nearly every use ! scheme@( guile-user ) > ( = - 0.0 0.0 ) #t scheme@( guile- user ) > ( negative ? - 0.0 ) #f scheme@( guile- user ) > ( = (/ 1.0 0.0 ) (/ 1.0 - 0.0 ) ) #f scheme@( guile-user ) > (< (/ 1.0 - 0.0 ) - 1e100 1e100 (/ 1.0 0.0 ) ) #t How can they be equal ?
In s7 , the sign of - 0.0 is ignored , and they really are equal .
One other oddity : two floats can satisfy eq ? and yet not be eqv? : ( eq ? +nan.0 +nan.0 ) might be #t ( it is unspecified ) , but ( eqv? +nan.0 +nan.0 ) is #f .
The same problem afflicts memq and assq .
The random function takes a range and an optional state , and returns a number between zero and the range , of the same type as the range .
It is perfectly reasonable to use a range of 0 , in which case random returns 0 . random - state creates a new random state from a seed .
If no state is passed , random uses some default state initialized from the current time .
random - state ?
returns #t if passed a random state object .

I can't find the right tone for this section ; this is the 400 - th revision ; I wish I were a better writer !
In some Schemes , " rational " means " could possibly be expressed equally well as a ratio : floats are approximations " .
In s7 it's : " is actually expressed ( at the scheme level ) as a ratio ( or an integer of course ) " ; otherwise " rational ? " is the same as " real ? " : ( not -s7 ) > ( rational ? ( sqrt 2 ) ) #t That 1.0 is represented at the IEEE - float level as a sort of ratio does not mean it has to be a scheme ratio ; the two notions are independent .
But that confusion is trivial compared to the completely nutty " inexact integer " .
As I understand it , " inexact " originally meant " floating point " , and " exact " meant integer or ratio of integers .
But words have a life of their own .
0.0 somehow became an " inexact " integer ( although it can be represented exactly in floating point ) .
+inf.0 must be an integer — its fractional part is explicitly zero !
But +nan.0 ...
And then there 's : ( not -s7 ) > ( integer ?
9007199254740993.1 ) #t
When does this matter ?
I often need to index into a vector , but the index is a float ( a " real " in Scheme - speak : its fractional part can be non-zero ) .
In one Scheme : ( not -s7 ) > ( vector - ref # ( 0 ) ( floor 0.1 ) ) ERROR : Wrong type ( expecting exact integer ) : 0.0 ; [ why ?
" it 's probably a programmer mistake " ! ]
Not to worry , I 'll use inexact -> exact : ( not-s7 ) > ( inexact -> exact 0.1 ) 3602879701896397/36028797018963968 ; [ why ?
" floats are ratios " !]
So I end up using the verbose ( floor ( inexact -> exact ... ) ) everywhere , and even then I have no guarantee that I 'll get a legal vector index .
I have never seen any use made of the exact / inexact distinction — just wild flailing to try get around it .
I think the whole idea is confused and useless , and leads to verbose and buggy code .
If we discard it , we can maintain backwards compatibility via : ( define exact ? rational ? ) ( define ( inexact ? x ) ( not ( rational ? x ) ) ) ( define inexact -> exact rationalize ) ; or floor ( define ( exact - > inexact x ) (* x 1.0 ) ) Standard Scheme 's #i and #e are also useless because you can have any number after , for example , #b : > # b1.1 1.5 > # b1e2 4.0 > # o17.5+ i 15.625+1i ( But s7 uses # i for int- vector and does not implement #e ) .
Speaking of #b and friends , what should ( string - > number " # xffff " 2 ) return ?
define* , lambda *
define * and lambda* are extensions of define and lambda that make it easier to deal with optional , keyword , and rest arguments .
The syntax is very simple : every argument to define * has a default value and is automatically available as a keyword argument .
The default value is either #f if unspecified , or given in a list whose first member is the argument name .
The last argument can be preceded by : rest or a dot to indicate that all other trailing arguments should be packaged as a list under that argument 's name .
A trailing or rest argument 's default value is ( ) and can't be specified in the declaration .
The rest argument is not available as a keyword argument .
( define * ( hi a ( b 32 ) ( c " hi " ) ) ( list a b c ) )
Here the argument " a " defaults to #f , " b " to 32 , etc .
When the function is called , the argument names are set from the values passed the function , then any unset arguments are bound to their default values , evaluated in left - to - right order .
As the current argument list is scanned , any name that occurs as a keyword , : arg for example where the parameter name is arg , sets that argument 's new value .
Otherwise , as values occur , they are plugged into the actual argument list based on their position , counting a keyword / value pair as one argument .
This is called an optional - key list in CLM .
So , taking the function above as an example :
> ( hi 1 ) ( 1 32 " hi " ) > ( hi :b 2 :a 3 ) ( 3 2 " hi " ) > ( hi 3 2 1 ) ( 3 2 1 )
See s7test.scm for many examples .
( s7 's define * is very close to srfi-89's define * ) .
The combination of optional and keyword arguments is viewed with disfavor in the Lisp community , but the problem is in CL 's implementation of the idea , not the idea itself .
I 've used the s7 style since around 1976 , and have never found it confusing .
The mistake in CL is to require the optional arguments if a keyword argument occurs , and to consider them as distinct from the keyword arguments .
So everyone forgets and puts a keyword where CL expects a required - optional argument .
CL then does something ridiculous , and the programmer stomps around shouting about keywords , but the fault lies with CL .
If s7's way is considered too loose , one way to tighten it might be to insist that once a keyword is used , only keyword argument pairs can follow .
A natural companion of lambda* is named let * .
In named let , the implicit function 's arguments have initial values , but thereafter , each call requires the full set of arguments .
Why not treat the initial values as default values ? > ( let * func ( ( i 1 ) ( j 2 ) ) (+ i j ( if (> i 0 ) ( func (- i 1 ) ) 0 ) ) ) 5 > ( letrec ( ( func ( lambda * ( ( i 1 ) ( j 2 ) ) (+ i j ( if (> i 0 ) ( func (- i 1 ) ) 0 ) ) ) ) ) ( func ) ) 5
This is consistent with the lambda* arguments because their defaults are already set in left - to - right order , and as each parameter is set to its default value , the binding is added to the default value expression environment ( just as if it were a let * ) .
The let * name itself ( the implicit function ) is not defined until after the bindings have been evaluated ( as in named let ) .
In CL , keyword default values are handled in the same way : > ( defun foo ( &key ( a 0 ) ( b (+ a 4 ) ) ( c (+ a 7 ) ) ) ( list a b c ) ) FOO > ( foo :b 2 :a 60 ) ( 60 2 67 ) In s7 , we 'd use : ( define * ( foo ( a 0 ) ( b (+ a 4 ) ) ( c (+ a 7 ) ) ) ( list a b c ) )
Also CL and s7 handle keywords as values in the same way : > ( defun foo ( &key a ) a ) FOO > ( defvar x : a ) X > ( foo x 1 ) 1 > ( define * ( foo a ) a ) foo > ( define x : a ) :a > ( foo x 1 ) 1
To try to catch what I believe are usually mistakes , I added two error checks .
One is triggered if you set the same parameter twice in the same call , and the other if an unknown keyword is encountered in the key position .
To turn off these errors , add : allow - other - keys at the end of the parameter list .
These problems arise in a case such as ( define * ( f ( a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ) ( list a b ) )
You could do any of the following by accident : ( f 1 :a 2 ) ; what is a ? ( f :b 1 2 ) ; what is b? ( f :c 3 ) ; did you really want a to be :c and b to be 3 ?
In the last case , to pass a keyword deliberately , either include the argument keyword : ( f :a : c ) , or make the default value a keyword : ( define * ( f ( a : c ) ... ) ) , or set (* s7 * ' accept-all-keyword - arguments ) to some true value .
See s7test.scm for many examples .
What if two functions share a keyword argument , and one wants to call the other , passing both arguments to the wrapper ?
( define * ( f1 a ) a ) ; the wrappee ( define * ( f2 a : rest b : allow - other - keys ) ; the wrapper (+ a ( apply f1 b ) ) ) ( f2 :a 3 :a 4 ) ; 7 , b= '( :a 4 ) ( let ( ( c :a ) ) ( f2 c 3 c 4 ) ) ; also 7
Since named let * is a form of lambda* , the prohibition of repeated variable names makes it different from let* : ( let * ( (a 1 ) ( a 2 ) ) a ) is 2 , but ( let* loop ( (a 1 ) ( a 2 ) ) a ) is an error .
If let * and named let * agreed in this , we'd have an inconsistency with lambda * .
If all three allowed repeated variables , the decision as to which parameter is intended becomes messy : ( ( lambda * ( a a ) a ) 2 :a 3 ) , or ( let* loop ( (a 1 ) ( a 2 ) ) ( loop 2 :a 3 ) ) .
CL and standard scheme accept repeated variables in let* , so I think the current choice is the least surprising .
s7 's lambda * arglist handling is not the same as CL 's lambda - list .
First , you can have more than one : rest parameter : > ( ( lambda * ( : rest a : rest b ) ( map + a b ) ) 1 2 3 4 5 ) ' ( 3 5 7 9 ) and second , the rest parameter , if any , takes up an argument slot just like any other argument : > ( ( lambda * ( ( b 3 ) : rest x ( c 1 ) ) ( list b c x ) ) 32 ) ( 32 1 ( ) ) > ( ( lambda * ( ( b 3 ) : rest x ( c 1 ) ) ( list b c x ) ) 1 2 3 4 5 ) ( 1 3 ( 2 3 4 5 ) ) CL would agree with the first case if we used &key for ' c ' , but would give an error in the second .
Of course , the major difference is that s7 keyword arguments do n't insist that the key be present .
The : rest argument is needed in cases like these because we can't use an expression such as : > ( ( lambda * ( ( a 3 ) . b c ) ( list a b c ) ) 1 2 3 4 5 ) error : stray dot ? > ( ( lambda * ( a . ( b 1 ) ) b) 1 2 ) ; the reader turns the arglist into ( a b 1 ) error : lambda * parameter ' 1 is a constant
Yet another nit : the : rest argument is not considered a keyword argument , so > ( define * ( f : rest a ) a ) f > ( f :a 1 ) ( :a 1 )
macros
define - macro , define - macro* , define - bacro , define - nacro* , macroexpand , gensym , gensym ? , and macro ?
implement the standard old - time macros .
The anonymous versions ( analogous to lambda and lambda * ) are macro , macro* , bacro , and bacro* .
See s7test.scm for many examples of macros including such perennial favorites as loop , dotimes , do* , enum , pushnew , and defstruct .
> ( define - macro ( and - let * vars . body ) `( let ( ) ( and , @(map ( lambda ( v ) `( define , @v ) ) vars ) ( begin , @body ) ) ) )
macroexpand can help debug a macro .
I always forget that it wants an expression :
> ( define - macro ( add - 1 arg ) `(+ 1 , arg ) ) add - 1 > ( macroexpand ( add - 1 32 ) ) (+ 1 32 )
gensym returns a symbol that is guaranteed to be unused .
It takes an optional string argument giving the new symbol name 's prefix .
gensym ?
returns #t if its argument is a symbol created by gensym .
( define - macro ( pop ! sym ) ( let ( ( v ( gensym ) ) ) `( let ( ( , v ( car , sym ) ) ) ( set ! , sym ( cdr , sym ) ) , v ) ) )
As in define* , the starred forms give optional and keyword arguments :
> ( define - macro * ( add - 2 a ( b 2 ) ) `(+ , a , b ) ) add - 2 > ( add - 2 1 3 ) 4 > ( add - 2 1 ) 3 > ( add - 2 :b 3 :a 1 ) 4
A macro is a first - class citizen of s7 .
You can pass it as a function argument , apply it to a list , return it from a function , call it recursively , and assign it to a variable .
You can even set its setter ! > ( define - macro ( hi a ) `(+ , a 1 ) ) hi > ( apply hi ' ( 4 ) ) 5 > ( define ( fmac mac ) ( apply mac ' ( 4 ) ) ) fmac > ( fmac hi ) 5 > ( define ( fmac mac ) ( mac 4 ) ) fmac > ( fmac hi ) 5 > ( define ( make - mac ) ( define - macro ( hi a ) `(+ , a 1 ) ) ) make - mac > ( let ( (x ( make-mac ) ) ) ( x 2 ) ) 3 > ( define - macro ( ref v i ) `( vector - ref , v , i ) ) ref > ( define - macro ( set v i x ) `( vector - set ! , v , i , x ) ) set > ( set ! ( setter ref ) set ) set > ( let ( ( v ( vector 1 2 3 ) ) ) ( set ! ( ref v 0 ) 32 ) v ) #( 32 2 3 ) To expand all the macros in a piece of code : ( define - macro ( fully - macroexpand form ) ( list ' quote ( let expand ( ( form form ) ) ( cond ( ( not ( pair ? form ) ) form ) ( ( and ( symbol ? ( car form ) ) ( macro ? ( symbol - > value ( car form ) ) ) ) ( expand ( apply macroexpand ( list form ) ) ) ) ( ( and ( eq ? ( car form ) ' set ! ) ; look for ( set ! ( mac ... ) ... ) and use mac 's setter ( pair ? ( cdr form ) ) ( pair ? ( cadr form ) ) ( macro ? ( symbol - > value ( caadr form ) ) ) ) ( expand ( apply macroexpand ( list ( cons ( setter ( symbol - > value ( caadr form ) ) ) ( append ( cdadr form ) ( copy ( cddr form ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( else ( cons ( expand ( car form ) ) ( expand ( cdr form ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
This does not always handle bacros correctly because their expansion can depend on the run-time state .
A bacro is a macro that expands its body and evaluates the result in the calling environment .
( define setf ( let ( ( args ( gensym ) ) ( name ( gensym ) ) ) ( apply define - bacro `( ( , name . , args ) ( unless ( null ? , args ) ( apply set ! ( car , args ) ( cadr , args ) ( ) ) ( apply setf ( cddr , args ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The setf argument is a gensym ( created when setf is defined ) so that its name does not shadow any existing variable .
Bacros expand in the calling environment , and a normal argument name might shadow something in that environment while the bacro is being expanded .
Similarly , if you introduce bindings in the bacro expansion code , you need to keep track of which environment you want things to happen in .
Use with - let and gensym liberally .
stuff.scm has bacro - shaker which can find inadvertent name collisions , but it is flighty and easily confused .
The calling environment itself is ( outlet ( curlet ) ) from within a bacro , so ( define - bacro ( holler ) `( format * stderr * " ( ~S ~ { ~S ~ S ~ ^~} ) ~ % " ( let ( (f ( * function * ) ) ) ( if ( pair ? f ) ( car f ) f ) ) ( map ( lambda ( slot ) ( values ( symbol - > keyword ( car slot ) ) ( cdr slot ) ) ) ( reverse ( map values , ( outlet ( curlet ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( f1 a b ) ( holler ) (+ a b ) ) ( f1 2 3 ) ; prints out " ( f1 :a 2 :b 3 ) " and returns 5 Since a bacro ( normally ) sheds its define - time environment : ( define call - bac ( let ( ( x 2 ) ) ( define - bacro ( m a ) ` (+ , a , x ) ) ) ) > ( call - bac 1 ) error : x : unbound variable A macro here returns 3 .
But do n't be hasty !
The bacro can get its define - time environment ( its closure ) via funclet , so in fact , define - macro is a special case of define - bacro !
We can define macros that work in all four ways : the expansion can happen in either the definition or calling environment , as can the evaluation of that expansion .
In a bacro , both happen in the calling environment if we take no other action , and in a normal macro ( define - macro ) , the expansion happens in the definition environment , and the evaluation in the calling environment .
Here 's a brief example of all four : ( let ( (x 1 ) ( y 2 ) ) ( define - bacro ( bac1 a ) `(+ , x y , a ) ) ; expand and eval in calling env ( let ( ( x 32 ) ( y 64 ) ) ( bac1 3 ) ) ) ; ( with - let ( inlet 'x 32 'y 64 ) (+ 32 y 3 ) ) -> 99 ; with - let and inlet refer to environments ( let ( (x 1 ) ( y 2 ) ) ; this is like define - macro ( define - bacro ( bac2 a ) ( with - let ( sublet ( funclet bac2 ) :a a ) `(+ , x y , a ) ) ) ; expand in definition env , eval in calling env ( let ( ( x 32 ) ( y 64 ) ) ( bac2 3 ) ) ) ; ( with - let ( inlet 'x 32 'y 64 ) (+ 1 y 3 ) ) -> 68 ( let ( (x 1 ) ( y 2 ) ) ( define - bacro ( bac3 a ) ( let ( (e ( with - let ( sublet ( funclet bac3 ) :a a ) ` (+ , x y , a ) ) ) ) `( with - let , ( sublet ( funclet bac3 ) :a a ) , e ) ) ) ; expand and eval in definition env ( let ( (x 32 ) ( y 64 ) ) ( bac3 3 ) ) ) ; ( with - let ( inlet 'x 1 'y 2 ) (+ 1 y 3 ) ) -> 6 ( let ( (x 1 ) ( y 2 ) ) ( define - bacro ( bac4 a ) ( let ( ( e `(+ , x y , a ) ) ) `( with - let , ( sublet ( funclet bac4 ) :a a ) , e ) ) ) ; expand in calling env , eval in definition env ( let ( (x 32 ) ( y 64 ) ) ( bac4 3 ) ) ) ; ( with - let ( inlet 'x 1 'y 2 ) (+ 32 y 3 ) ) -> 37 Backquote ( quasiquote ) in s7 is almost trivial .
Constants are unchanged , symbols are quoted , " , arg " becomes " arg " , and " , @arg " becomes " ( apply values arg ) " — hooray for real multiple values !
It 's almost as easy to write the actual macro body as the backquoted version of it .
> ( define - macro ( hi a ) `(+ 1 , a ) ) hi > ( procedure - source hi ) ( lambda ( a ) ( list- values '+ 1 a ) ) > ( define - macro ( hi a ) `(+ 1 , @a ) ) hi > ( procedure - source hi ) ( lambda ( a ) ( list - values '+ 1 ( apply - values a ) ) ) list - values and apply - values are quasiquote helper functions described below .
There is no unquote - splicing macro in s7 ; " , @( ... ) " becomes " ( unquote ( apply - values ... ) ) " at read - time .
There should n't be any unquote either .
In Scheme the reader turns , x into ( unquote x ) , so : > ( let ( , 'a ) unquote ) a > ( let ( , ( lambda ( x ) (+ x 1 ) ) ) , , , , '3 ) 7 comma becomes a sort of symbol macro !
I think I 'll remove unquote ; , x and , @x will still work as expected , but there will not be any " unquote " or " unquote - splicing " in the resultant source code .
Just to make life difficult : > ( let ( ' 1 ) quote ) 1 but that translation is so ingrained in lisp that I 'm reluctant to change it .
The two unquote names , on the other hand , seem unnecessary .
s7 macros are not hygienic .
For example ,
> ( define - macro ( mac b ) `( let ( ( a 12 ) ) (+ a , b ) ) ) mac > ( let ( (a 1 ) (+ *) ) ( mac a ) ) 144
This returns 144 because '+ ' has turned into '*' , and ' a ' is the internal ' a ' , not the argument ' a ' .
We get (* 12 12 ) where we might have expected (+ 12 1 ) .
Starting with the ' +' problem , as long as the redefinition of '+' is local ( that is , it happens after the macro definition ) , we can unquote the +:
> ( define - macro ( mac b ) `( let ( ( a 12 ) ) ( , + a , b ) ) ) ; ,+ picks up the definition - time + mac > ( let ( (a 1 ) (+ *) ) ( mac a ) ) 24 ; (+ a a ) where a is 12
But the unquote trick wo n't work if we have previously loaded some file that redefined '+' at the top - level ( so at macro definition time , + is * , but we want the built - in + ) .
Although this example is silly , the problem is real in Scheme because Scheme has no reserved words and only one name space .
> ( define + *) + > ( define ( add a b ) (+ a b ) ) add > ( add 2 3 ) 6 > ( define ( divide a b ) ( / a b ) ) divide > ( divide 2 3 ) 2/3 > ( set ! / -) ; a bad idea — this turns off s7's optimizer - > ( divide 2 3 ) - 1
Obviously macros are not the problem here .
Since we might be loading code written by others , it 's sometimes hard to tell what names that code depends on or redefines .
We need a way to get the pristine ( start - up , built - in ) value of '+'.
One long - winded way in s7 uses unlet :
> ( define + *) + > ( define ( add a b ) ( with - let ( unlet ) (+ a b ) ) ) add > ( add 2 3 ) 5
But this is hard to read , and we might want all three values of a symbol , the start - up value , the definition - time value , and the current value .
The latter can be accessed with the bare symbol , the definition - time value with unquote ( ' , ' ) , and the start - up value with either unlet or # _ < name > .
That is , # _+ is a reader macro for ( with - let ( unlet ) + ) .
> ( define - macro ( mac b ) `( #_let ( ( a 12 ) ) ( # _+ a , b ) ) ) ; #_+ and # _let are start - up values mac > ( let ( (a 1 ) (+ *) ) ( mac a ) ) 24 ; (+ a a ) where a is 12 and + is the start - up + ; ;; make + generic ( there 's a similar C - based example below ) > ( define (+ . args ) ( if ( null ? args ) 0 ( apply ( if ( number ? ( car args ) ) # _+ # _string - append ) args ) ) ) + > (+ 1 2 ) 3 > (+ " hi " " ho " ) " hiho "
Conceptually , # _< name > could be implemented via *#readers * : ( set ! *#readers * ( cons ( cons #\_ ( lambda ( str ) ( with - let ( unlet ) ( string - > symbol ( substring str 1 ) ) ) ) ) *#readers * ) ) but s7 does n't let you change the meaning of #\_ ; otherwise : ( set ! *#readers * ( list ( cons #\_ ( lambda ( str ) ( string - > symbol ( substring str 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) and now # _ provides no protection : > ( let ( (+ -) ) ( # _+ 1 2 ) ) - 1 #t and #f ( along with their stupid r7rs cousins # true and # false ) are also not settable .
So , now we have only the variable capture problem ( ' a ' has been captured in the preceding examples ) .
This is the only thing that the gigantic " hygienic macro " systems actually deal with : a microscopic problem that you 'd think , from the hype , was up there with malaria and the national debt .
gensym is the standard approach :
> ( define - macro ( mac b ) ( let ( ( var ( gensym ) ) ) `( #_let ( ( , var 12 ) ) ( # _+ , var , b ) ) ) ) mac > ( let ( (a 1 ) (+ *) ) ( mac a ) ) 13 ; ; or use lambda : > ( define - macro ( mac b ) `(( lambda ( b ) ( let ( ( a 12 ) ) ( # _+ a b ) ) ) , b ) ) mac > ( let ( (a 1 ) (+ *) ) ( mac a ) ) 13
I think syntax - rules and its friends try to conjure up gensyms automatically , but the real problem is not name collisions , but unspecified environments .
In s7 we have first - class environments , so you have complete control over the environment at any point :
( define - macro ( mac b ) `( with - let ( inlet 'b , b ) ( let ( ( a 12 ) ) (+ a b ) ) ) ) > ( let ( (a 1 ) (+ *) ) ( mac a ) ) 13 ( define - macro ( mac1 . b ) ; originally `( let ( ( a 12 ) ) (+ a , @b , @b ) ) `( with - let ( inlet 'e ( curlet ) ) ; this 'e will not collide with the calling env ( let ( ( a 12 ) ) ; nor will 'a ( so no gensyms are needed etc ) (+ a ( with - let e , @b ) ( with - let e , @b ) ) ) ) ) > ( let ( (a 1 ) ( e 2 ) ) ( mac1 ( display a ) (+ a e ) ) )
18 ; ( and it displays " 11 " ) ( define - macro ( mac2 x ) ; this will use mac2 's definition environment for its body `( with - let ( sublet ( funclet mac2 ) :x , x ) ( let ( ( a 12 ) ) (+ a b x ) ) ) ) ; a is always 12 , b is whatever b happens to be in mac2's env > ( define b 10 ) ; this is mac2's b 10 > ( let ( (+ *) ( a 1 ) ( b 15 ) ) ( mac2 (+ a b ) ) )
37 ; mac2 uses its own a ( 12 ) , b ( 10 ) , and + (+ ) ; but (+ a b ) is 15 because at that point + is *: (* 1 15 )
Hygienic macros are trivial !
Who needs syntax - rules ?
To avoid the variable capture , avoid local variables in the generated code , or protect them via with - let ; to avoid shadowing of functions and syntax , make the environment explicit ( via # _ for example ) .
s7 's lint.scm will warn you about a problematic macro expansion , so I 'd say just write macros as simply as possible , then let lint tell you that it 's time to do the with - let shuffle .
When that happens , wrap the macro body in a with - let that captures the current environment , and at each use of a macro argument wrap it in a with - let that re-establishes that environment .
( define - macro ( swap a b ) ; assume a and b are symbols `( with - let ( inlet 'e ( curlet ) ' tmp , a ) ( set ! ( e ' , a ) ( e ' , b ) ) ( set ! ( e ' , b ) tmp ) ) ) > ( let ( ( b 1 ) ( tmp 2 ) ) ( swap b tmp ) ( list b tmp ) ) ( 2 1 ) ( define - macro ( swap a b ) ; here a and b can be any settable expressions `( set ! , b ( with - let ( inlet 'e ( curlet ) ' tmp , a ) ( with - let e ( set ! , a , b ) ) tmp ) ) ) > ( let ( ( v ( vector 1 2 ) ) ) ( swap ( v 0 ) ( v 1 ) ) v ) # ( 2 1 ) > ( let ( ( tmp ( cons 1 2 ) ) ) ( swap ( car tmp ) ( cdr tmp ) ) tmp ) ( 2 . 1 ) ( set ! ( setter swap ) ( define - macro ( set - swap a b c ) `( set ! , b , c ) ) ) > ( let ( (a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ( c 3 ) ( d 4 ) ) ( swap a ( swap b ( swap c d ) ) ) ( list a b c d ) ) ( 2 3 4 1 ) ; ; ; but this is simpler : ( define - macro ( rotate ! . args ) `( set ! , ( args (- ( length args ) 1 ) ) ( with - let ( inlet 'e ( curlet ) ' tmp , ( car args ) ) ( with - let e , @( map ( lambda ( a b ) `( set ! , a , b ) ) args ( cdr args ) ) ) tmp ) ) ) > ( let ( (a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ( c 3 ) ) ( rotate ! a b c ) ( list a b c ) ) ( 2 3 1 )
If you want the macro's expanded result to be evaluated in its definition environment :
( let ( ( a 3 ) ) ( define - macro ( mac b ) `( with - let ( inlet 'b , b ( funclet mac ) ) (+ a b ) ) ) ; definition - time " a " , call - time " b " ( define - macro ( mac - 1 b ) `(+ a , b ) ) ; call - time " a " and " b " ( let ( ( a 32 ) ) ( list ( mac 1 ) ( mac - 1 1 ) ) ) )
Here are some variations on " unless " , inspired by the wikipedia hygienic macro page : ( define - macro ( my- unless condition . body ) `( with - let ( inlet ( unlet ) : condition , condition ) ; here unlet protects body ( format below ) ( if ( not condition ) ( begin , @body ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( not ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ( begin 32 ) ( if + ) ( format abs ) ) ( my-unless #t ( format #t " This should not be printed !
" ) ) ( my-unless #f ( format #t " This should be printed !
" ) ) ) ( set ! format abs ) ( let ( ( not ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ) ( my-unless #t ( format #t " This should not be printed !
" ) ) ( my-unless #f ( format #t " This should be printed !
" ) ) ) ( define ( user - defined - operator x ) ( not x ) ) ( define - macro ( my- unless - 1 condition . body ) `( with - let ( inlet ( unlet ) : condition , condition ) ( if ( user - defined - operator condition ) ( begin , @body ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( user - defined - operator ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ) ( my-unless - 1 #t ( format #t " This should not be printed !
" ) ) ( my- unless - 1 #f ( format #t " This should be printed !
" ) ) ) ( define my - unless - 2 ( let ( ( op1 ( lambda ( x ) ( not x ) ) ) ) ( define - macro ( _ condition . body ) `( with - let ( inlet ( unlet ) ( funclet my - unless - 2 ) : condition , condition ) ;; funclet above to get my - unless - 2's version of op1 ( if ( op1 condition ) ( begin , @body ) ) ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( op1 ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ) ( my-unless - 2 #t ( format #t " This should not be printed !
" ) ) ( my- unless - 2 #f ( format #t " This should be printed !
" ) ) ) ( define my - unless - 3 ( let ( ( op1 ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ) ( define - macro ( _ condition . body ) `( with - let ( inlet ( unlet ) : condition , condition : local -env ( curlet ) ) ;; curlet to get run -time local version of op1 ( if ( ( with - let local - env op1 ) condition ) ( begin , @body ) ) ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( op1 ( lambda ( x ) ( not x ) ) ) ) ( my- unless - 3 #t ( format #t " This should not be printed !
" ) ) ( my- unless - 3 #f ( format #t " This should be printed !
" ) ) )
On the subject of *#readers * , say we have : ( set ! *#readers * ( list ( cons #\o ( lambda ( str ) 42 ) ) ; # o... -> 42 ( cons #\x ( lambda ( str ) 3 ) ) ) ) ; #x... -> 3
Now we load a file with : ( define ( oct ) # o123 ) ( let - temporarily (( * #readers * ( ) ) ) ( eval ( with - input - from - string " ( define ( hex ) # x123 ) " read ) ) ) ( define - constant old - readers *#readers * ) ( set ! *#readers * ( ) ) ( define ( oct1 ) # o123 ) ( define ( hex1 ) # x123 ) ( set ! *#readers * old - readers ) ( define ( oct2 ) # o123 ) ( define ( hex2 ) # x123 )
Now we evaluate these functions , and get : ( oct ) : 42 ; oct is not read - time hygienic so # o123 -> 42 ( oct1 ) : 83 ; oct1 is protected by the top - level set , # o123 -> 83 ( oct2 ) : 42 ; same as oct ( hex ) : 291 ; hex is protected by let - temporarily + read ( hex1 ) : 291 ; hex1 is like oct1 ( hex2 ) : 3 ; hex2 is like oct
Here is Peter Seibel 's wonderful once - only macro : ( define - macro ( once - only names . body ) ( let ( ( gensyms ( map ( lambda ( n ) ( gensym ) ) names ) ) ) `( let ( , @( map ( lambda ( g ) ( list g ' ( gensym ) ) ) gensyms ) ) `( let ( , , @( map ( lambda ( g n ) ( list list g n ) ) gensyms names ) ) , ( let ( , @( map list names gensyms ) ) , @body ) ) ) ) )
From the land of sparkling bacros : ( define once - only ( let ( ( names ( gensym ) ) ( body ( gensym ) ) ) ( apply define - bacro `( ( , ( gensym ) , names . , body ) `( let ( , @( map ( lambda ( name ) `( , name , ( eval name ) ) ) , names ) ) , @, body ) ) ) ) )
Sadly , with - let is simpler .
setter
( setter proc ) ( dilambda proc setter )
There are several kinds of setters , reflecting the many ways that set ! can be called .
First are the symbol setters :
> ( let ( (x 1 ) ) ( set ! ( setter ' x ) ( lambda ( name new - value ) (* new - value 2 ) ) ) ( set ! x 2 ) x ) 4
Here the setter is a function that is called before the variable is set .
It can take two or three arguments .
In the two argument case shown above , the first is the variable name ( a symbol ) , and the second is the new - value .
The variable is set to the value returned by the setter function .
When s7 sees ( set ! x 2 ) above , it calls the setter which returns 4 .
So x is set to 4 .
In some cases you need the environment that the variable lives in ( to get its current value for example ) , so you can include that in the setter function parameter list :
> ( let ( (x 1 ) ) ( set ! ( setter 'x ) ( lambda ( name new - value enviroment ) (* new - value 2 ) ) ) ( set ! x 2 ) x ) 4 ( define - macro ( watch var ) ; notification if 'var is set !
`( set !
( setter ' , var ) ( lambda ( s v e ) ( format * stderr * " ~S set ! to ~ S~ A~ % " s v ( let ( ( func ( with - let e ( * function * ) ) ) ) ( if ( eq ? func #< undefined > ) " " ( format #f " , ~ S " func ) ) ) ) v ) ) )
Since symbol setters are often implementing type restrictions , you can use the built - in type checking functions such as integer ?
as a short - hand for a setter that insists the new value be an integer :
> ( let ( (x 1 ) ) ( set ! ( setter ' x ) integer ? ) ( set ! x 3.14 ) ) error : set !
x : 3.14 , is a real but should be an integer ; ; ; use typed - let from stuff.scm to do the same thing : > ( typed - let ( ( x 3 integer ? ) ) ( set ! x 3.14 ) ) error : set !
x : 3.14 , is a real but should be an integer
C - side symbol setters go through s7_set_setter .
There is an example below .
The second case is a function setter .
Almost any function or macro can have an associated setter that is invoked when the function is the target of set !.
In this case , the setter function does the set !
itself ( unlike a symbol setter ) :
> ( setter cadr ) #f ; by default cadr has no setter so ( set ! ( cadr p ) x ) is an error > ( set ! ( setter cadr ) ; add a setter to cadr ( lambda ( lst val ) ( set ! ( car ( cdr lst ) ) val ) ) ) # < lambda ( lst val ) > > ( procedure - source ( setter cadr ) ) ( lambda ( lst val ) ( set ! ( car ( cdr lst ) ) val ) ) > ( let ( ( lst ( list 1 2 3 ) ) ) ( set ! ( cadr lst ) 4 ) lst ) ( 1 4 3 )
In some cases , the setter needs to be a macro :
> ( set ! ( setter logbit ? ) ( define - macro ( m var index on ) ; here we want to set " var " , so we need a macro `( if , on ( set ! , var ( logior , var ( ash 1 , index ) ) ) ( set ! , var ( logand , var ( lognot ( ash 1 , index ) ) ) ) ) ) ) m > ( define ( mingle a b ) ( let ( ( r 0 ) ) ( do ( ( i 0 (+ i 1 ) ) ) ( ( = i 31 ) r ) ( set ! ( logbit ? r (* 2 i ) ) ( logbit ? a i ) ) ( set ! ( logbit ? r (+ (* 2 i ) 1 ) ) ( logbit ? b i ) ) ) ) ) mingle > ( mingle 6 3 ) ; the INTERCAL mingle operator ?
30
dilambda defines a function and its setter without having to set !
the setter by hand :
> ( define f ( let ( ( x 123 ) ) ( dilambda ( lambda ( ) x ) ( lambda ( new - value ) ( set! x new - value ) ) ) ) ) f > ( f ) 123 ; x = 123 > ( set ! ( f ) 32 ) 32 ; now x = 32 > ( f ) 32
Here is a pretty example of dilambda : ( define - macro ( c?r path ) ;; " path " is a list and " X " marks the spot in it that we are trying to access ;; ( a ( b ( ( c X ) ) ) ) — anything after the X is ignored , other symbols are just placeholders ;; c?r returns a dilambda that gets / sets X ( define ( X - marks - the - spot accessor tree ) ( if ( pair ? tree ) ( or ( X - marks - the - spot ( cons ' car accessor ) ( car tree ) ) ( X - marks - the - spot ( cons ' cdr accessor ) ( cdr tree ) ) ) ( and ( eq ? tree ' X ) accessor ) ) ) ( let ( ( body 'lst ) ) ( for -each ( lambda ( f ) ( set ! body ( list f body ) ) ) ( reverse ( X - marks - the - spot ( ) path ) ) ) `( dilambda ( lambda ( lst ) , body ) ( lambda ( lst val ) ( set ! , body val ) ) ) ) ) > (( c?r ( a b ( X ) ) ) ' ( 1 2 ( 3 4 ) 5 ) ) 3 > ( let ( ( lst ( list 1 2 ( list 3 4 ) 5 ) ) ) ( set ! ( ( c?r ( a b ( X ) ) ) lst ) 32 ) lst ) ( 1 2 ( 32 4 ) 5 ) > ( procedure - source ( c?r ( a b ( X ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( lst ) ( car ( car ( cdr ( cdr lst ) ) ) ) ) > (( c?r ( a b . X ) ) ' ( 1 2 ( 3 4 ) 5 ) ) ( ( 3 4 ) 5 ) > ( let ( ( lst ( list 1 2 ( list 3 4 ) 5 ) ) ) ( set ! ( ( c?r ( a b . X ) ) lst ) '( 32 ) ) lst ) ( 1 2 32 ) > ( procedure - source ( c?r ( a b . X ) ) ) ( lambda ( lst ) ( cdr ( cdr lst ) ) ) > ( ( c?r ( ( ( ( ( a ( b ( c ( d ( e X ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) '( ( ( ( ( 1 ( 2 ( 3 ( 4 ( 5 6 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) 6 > ( let ( ( lst '( ( ( ( ( 1 ( 2 ( 3 ( 4 ( 5 6 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( ( c?r ( ( ( ( ( a ( b ( c ( d ( e X ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) lst ) 32 ) lst ) ( ( ( ( ( 1 ( 2 ( 3 ( 4 ( 5 32 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) > ( procedure - source ( c?r ( ( ( ( ( a ( b ( c ( d ( e X ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( lst ) ( car ( cdr ( car ( cdr ( car ( cdr ( car ( cdr ( car ( cdr ( car ( car ( car ( car lst ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
I may remove dilambda and dilambda ?
someday ; they are trivial :
( define ( dilambda get set ) ( set ! ( setter get ) set ) get ) ( define dilambda ? setter )
When a function setter is called , ( set ! ( func ... ) val ) is evaluated by s7 as ( ( setter func ) ... val ) , so the setter function needs to handle both the inner arguments to the function and the new value .
( let ( ( x 123 ) ) ( define ( f a b ) (+ x a b ) ) ( set ! ( setter f ) ( lambda ( a b val ) ( set! x val ) ) ) ( display ( f 1 2 ) ) ( newline ) ; " 126 " ( set ! ( f 1 2 ) 32 ) ( display ( f 1 2 ) ) ( newline ) ) ; " 35 "
A third type of setter handles vector element type and hash - table key and value types .
These are described under typed vectors and typed hash - tables .
Speaking of INTERCAL , COME - FROM : ( define - macro ( define-with-goto-and - come - from name - and - args . body ) ( let ( ( labels ( ) ) ( gotos ( ) ) ( come - froms ( ) ) ) ( let collect - jumps ( ( tree body ) ) ( when ( pair ? tree ) ( when ( pair ? ( car tree ) ) ( case ( caar tree ) ( ( label ) ( set ! labels ( cons tree labels ) ) ) ( ( goto ) ( set ! gotos ( cons tree gotos ) ) ) ( ( come-from ) ( set ! come - froms ( cons tree come - froms ) ) ) ( else ( collect - jumps ( car tree ) ) ) ) ) ( collect - jumps ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ( for -each ( lambda ( goto ) ( let* ( ( name ( cadr ( cadar goto ) ) ) ( label ( member name labels ( lambda ( a b ) ( eq ? a ( cadr ( cadar b ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( if label ( set-cdr ! goto ( car label ) ) ( error ' bad - goto " ca n't find label : ~ S " name ) ) ) ) gotos ) ( for - each ( lambda ( from ) ( let* ( ( name ( cadr ( cadar from ) ) ) ( label ( member name labels ( lambda ( a b ) ( eq ? a ( cadr ( cadar b ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( if label ( set-cdr ! ( car label ) from ) ( error ' bad - come - from " ca n't find label : ~ S " name ) ) ) ) come - froms ) `( define , name - and - args ( let ( ( label ( lambda ( name ) # f ) ) ( goto ( lambda ( name ) # f ) ) ( come - from ( lambda ( name ) # f ) ) ) , @body ) ) ) )
applicable objects , generalized set ! , generic functions
A procedure with a setter can be viewed as one generalization of set !.
Another treats objects as having predefined get and set functions .
In s7 lists , strings , vectors , hash - tables , environments , and any cooperating C or Scheme - defined objects are both applicable and settable .
newLisp calls this implicit indexing , Kawa has it , Gauche implements it via object - apply , Guile via procedure - with - setter ; CL 's funcallable instance might be the same idea .
In ( vector - ref # ( 1 2 ) 0 ) , for example , vector - ref is just a type declaration .
But in Scheme , type declarations are unnecessary , so we get exactly the same result from ( # ( 1 2 ) 0 ) .
Similarly , ( lst 1 ) is the same as ( list - ref lst 1 ) , and ( set ! ( lst 1 ) 2 ) is the same as ( list - set ! lst 1 2 ) .
I like this syntax : the less noise , the better !
Well , maybe applicable strings look weird : ( " hi " 1 ) is #\i , but worse , so is ( cond ( 1 = > " hi " ) ) !
Even though a string , list , or vector is " applicable " , it is not currently considered to be a procedure , so ( procedure ? " hi " ) is # f. map and for - each , however , accept anything that apply can handle , so ( map # ( 0 1 ) ' ( 1 0 ) ) is ' ( 1 0 ) .
( On the first call to map in this case , you get the result of ( # ( 0 1 ) 1 ) and so on ) .
string -> list , vector -> list , and let -> list are ( map values object ) .
Their inverses are ( and always have been ) equally trivial .
The applicable object syntax makes it easy to write generic functions .
For example , s7test.scm has implementations of Common Lisp 's sequence functions .
length , copy , reverse , fill ! , iterate , map and for - each are generic in this sense ( map always returns a list ) .
> ( map ( lambda ( a b ) (- a b ) ) ( list 1 2 ) ( vector 3 4 ) ) ( 5 - 3 9 ) > ( length " hi " ) 2
Here 's a generic FFT : ( define * ( cfft data n ( dir 1 ) ) ; complex data ( unless n ( set ! n ( length data ) ) ) ( do ( ( i 0 (+ i 1 ) ) ( j 0 ) ) ( (= i n ) ) ( if (> j i ) ( let ( ( temp ( data j ) ) ) ( set ! ( data j ) ( data i ) ) ( set ! ( data i ) temp ) ) ) ( do ( ( m ( / n 2 ) ( / m 2 ) ) ) ( ( or (< m 2 ) ( < j m ) ) ( set ! j (+ j m ) ) ) ( set ! j (- j m ) ) ) ) ( do ( ( ipow ( floor ( log n 2 ) ) ) ( prev 1 ) ( lg 0 (+ lg 1 ) ) ( mmax 2 ( * mmax 2 ) ) ( pow ( / n 2 ) ( / pow 2 ) ) ( theta ( complex 0.0 (* pi dir ) ) (* theta 0.5 ) ) ) ( (= lg ipow ) ) ( do ( ( wpc ( exp theta ) ) ( wc 1.0 ) ( ii 0 ( + ii 1 ) ) ) ( ( = ii prev ) ( set! prev mmax ) ) ( do ( ( jj 0 (+ jj 1 ) ) ( i ii (+ i mmax ) ) ( j (+ ii prev ) (+ j mmax ) ) ) ( ( >= jj pow ) ) ( let ( ( tc (* wc ( data j ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( data j ) (- ( data i ) tc ) ) ( set ! ( data i ) (+ ( data i ) tc ) ) ) ) ( set ! wc (* wc wpc ) ) ) ) data ) > ( cfft ( list 0.0 1+i 0.0 0.0 ) ) ( 1+1 i - 1+1 i - 1-1 i 1 - 1i ) > ( cfft ( vector 0.0 1+i 0.0 0.0 ) ) #( 1+1i - 1+1i - 1-1i 1 - 1i )
And a generic function that copies one sequence 's elements into another sequence : ( define ( copy - into source dest ) ; this is equivalent to ( copy source dest ) ( do ( ( i 0 (+ i 1 ) ) ) ( (= i ( min ( length source ) ( length dest ) ) ) dest ) ( set ! ( dest i ) ( source i ) ) ) ) but that is already built - in as the two - argument version of the copy function .
There is one place where list - set !
and friends are not the same as set ! : the former evaluate their first argument , but set !
does not ( with a quibble ; see below ) : > ( let ( ( str " hi " ) ) ( string - set ! ( let ( ) str ) 1 # \a ) str ) " ha " > ( let ( ( str " hi " ) ) ( set ! ( let ( ) str ) 1 # \a ) str ) ;( ( let ( ) str ) 1 # \a ) : too many arguments to set ! > ( let ( ( str " hi " ) ) ( set ! ( ( let ( ) str ) 1 ) # \a ) str ) " ha " > ( let ( ( str " hi " ) ) ( set ! ( str 1 ) # \a ) str ) " ha " set !
looks at its first argument to decide what to set .
If it 's a symbol , no problem .
If it 's a pair , set !
looks at its car to see if it is some object that has a setter .
If the car is itself a list , set !
evaluates the internal expression , and tries again .
So the second case above is the only one that wo n't work .
And of course : > ( let ( (x ( list 1 2 ) ) ) ( set ! ( ( ( ( lambda ( ) ( list x ) ) ) 0 ) 0 ) 3 ) x ) ( 3 2 ) By my count , around 20 of the Scheme built - in functions are already generic in the sense that they accept arguments of many types ( leaving aside the numeric and type checking functions , take for example equal ? , display , member , assoc , apply , eval , quasiquote , and values ) .
s7 extends that list with map , for - each , reverse , and length , and adds a few others such as copy , fill ! , sort ! , object -> string , object -> let , and append .
newLisp takes a more radical approach than s7 : it extends operators such as '>' to compare strings and lists , as well as numbers .
In map and for - each , however , you can mix the argument types , so I 'm not as attracted to making '>' generic ; you can't , for example , (> " hi " 32.1 ) , or even (> 1 0+i ) .
The somewhat non-standard generic sequence functions in s7 are :
( sort ! sequence less ? ) ( reverse ! sequence ) and ( reverse sequence ) ( fill ! sequence value ( start 0 ) end ) ( copy obj ) and ( copy source destination ( start 0 ) end ) ( object - > string obj ) ( object - > let obj ) ( length obj ) ( append . sequences ) ( map func . sequences ) and ( for - each func . sequences ) ( equivalent ? obj1 obj2 )
copy returns a ( shallow ) copy of its argument .
If a destination is provided , it need not match the source in size or type .
The start and end indices refer to the source .
> ( copy ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) ( make - list 2 ) ) ( 1 2 ) > ( copy # ( 1 2 3 4 ) ( make - list 5 ) 1 ) ; start at 1 in the source ( 2 3 4 #f # f ) > ( copy " 1234 " ( make- vector 2 ) ) #(#\1 # \2 ) > ( define lst ( list 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) > ( copy # ( 8 9 ) ( cddr lst ) ) ( 8 9 5 ) > lst ( 1 2 8 9 5 )
reverse ! is an in - place version of reverse .
That is , it modifies the sequence passed to it in the process of reversing its contents .
If the sequence is a list , remember to use set ! : ( set ! p ( reverse ! p ) ) .
This is somewhat inconsistent with other cases , but historically , lisp programmers have treated the in - place reverse as the fast version , so s7 follows suit .
> ( define lst ( list 1 2 3 ) ) ( 1 2 3 ) > ( reverse ! lst ) ( 3 2 1 ) > lst ( 1 )
Leaving aside the weird list case , append returns a sequence of the same type as its first argument .
> ( append # ( 1 2 ) ' ( 3 4 ) ) # ( 1 2 3 4 ) > ( append ( float - vector ) ' ( 1 2 ) ( byte- vector 3 4 ) ) ( float - vector 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 )
sort ! sorts a sequence using the function passed as its second argument :
> ( sort ! ( list 3 4 8 2 0 1 5 9 7 6 ) <) ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 )
Underlying some of these functions are generic iterators , also built - into s7 :
( make - iterator sequence ) ( iterator ? obj ) ( iterate iterator ) ( iterator - sequence iterator ) ( iterator - at - end ? iterator )
make - iterator takes a sequence argument and returns an iterator object that traverses that sequence as it is called .
The iterator itself can be treated as a function of no arguments , or ( for code clarity ) it can be the argument to iterate , which does the same thing .
That is ( iter ) is the same as ( iterate iter ) .
The sequence that an iterator is traversing is iterator - sequence .
If the sequence is a hash - table or let , the iterator normally returns a cons of the key and value .
There are many cases where this overhead is objectionable , so make - iterator takes a third optional argument , the cons to use ( changing its car and cdr directly on each call ) .
When an iterator reaches the end of its sequence , it returns # < eof > .
It used to return nil ; I can't decide whether this change is an improvement .
If an iterator over a list notices that its list is circular , it returns # < eof >. map and for - each use iterators , so if you pass a circular list to either , it will stop eventually .
( An arcane consequence for method writers : specialize make - iterator , not map or for - each ) .
( define ( find - if f sequence ) ( let ( ( iter ( make- iterator sequence ) ) ) ( do ( (x ( iter ) ( iter ) ) ) ( ( or ( eof - object ? x ) ( f x ) ) ( and ( not ( eof - object ? x ) ) x ) ) ) ) )
But of course a sequence might contain # < eof > !
So to be really safe , use iterator - at - end ? instead of eof - object ?.
The argument to make - iterator can also be a function or macro .
There should be a variable named '+ iterator + with a non -#f value in the closure 's environment :
( define ( make - circular - iterator obj ) ( let ( ( iter ( make - iterator obj ) ) ) ( make - iterator ( let ( ( +iterator + # t ) ) ( lambda ( ) ( case ( iter ) ( ( # < eof > ) ( ( set ! iter ( make - iterator obj ) ) ) ) ( else ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The 'iterator ?
variable is similar to the ' + documentation + variable used by documentation .
It gives make - iterator some hope of catching inadvertent bogus function arguments that would otherwise cause an infinite loop .
multidimensional vectors
s7 supports vectors with any number of dimensions .
It is here , in particular , that generalized set ! shines .
make - vector 's second argument can be a list of dimensions , rather than an integer as in the one dimensional case :
( make - vector ( list 2 3 4 ) ) ( make - vector ' ( 2 3 ) 1.0 ) ( vector - dimensions ( make- vector ' ( 2 3 4 ) ) ) -> ( 2 3 4 )
The second example includes the optional initial element .
( vect i ... ) or ( vector - ref vect i ... ) return the given element , and ( set ! ( vect i ... ) value ) and ( vector - set ! vect i ... value ) set it .
vector - length ( or just length ) returns the total number of elements .
vector - dimensions returns a list of the dimensions .

This function initializes each element of a multidimensional vector :
( define ( make - array dims . inits ) ( subvector ( apply vector ( flatten inits ) ) 0 ( apply * dims ) dims ) ) > ( make -array ' ( 3 3 ) ' ( 1 1 1 ) ' ( 2 2 2 ) ' ( 3 3 3 ) ) # 2d ( ( 1 1 1 ) ( 2 2 2 ) ( 3 3 3 ) )
make - int - vector , make - float - vector , and make - byte - vector produce homogeneous vectors holding s7_ints , s7_doubles , or unsigned bytes .
( make - vector length - or - list - of - dimensions initial - value element - type- function ) ( float - vector ? obj ) ( float - vector . args ) ( make - float - vector len ( init 0.0 ) ) ( float - vector - ref obj . indices ) ( float - vector - set ! obj indices [ ...] value ) ( int- vector ? obj ) ( int - vector . args ) ( make - int - vector len ( init 0 ) ) ( int - vector - ref obj . indices ) ( int-vector - set ! obj indices [ ...] value ) ( byte - vector ? obj ) ( byte - vector . args ) ( make - byte - vector len ( init 0 ) ) ( byte - vector - ref obj . indices ) ( byte- vector - set ! obj indices [ ...] byte ) ( byte ? obj ) ( string -> byte - vector str ) ( byte - vector - > string str ) ( subvector vector start end dimensions ) ( subvector ? obj ) ( subvector - vector obj ) ( subvector - position obj )
In addition to the dimension list mentioned above , make - vector accepts optional arguments giving the initial element and the element type .
If the type is given , every attempt to set an element of the vector first calls the type function on the new value .
If the type function is omitted ( or set to #t ) , no type checking is performed .
If the type function is a closure ( rather than a C - defined or built - in function ) , its name must be accessible ; it can't be an anonymous lambda ( the signature and error handlers need this name ) .

To access a vector 's elements with different dimensions than the original had , use ( subvector original - vector 0 ( length original - vector ) new - dimensions ) :
> ( let ( ( v1 # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( v2 ( subvector v1 ) ) ) ; flatten the original ( 1D is the default ) v2 ) ) # ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) > ( let (( v1 # ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) ) ) ( let ( ( v2 ( subvector v1 0 6 ' ( 3 2 ) ) ) ) v2 ) ) # 2d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ( 5 6 ) )
A subvector is a window onto some other vector 's data .
The data is not copied , just accessed differently .
The new - dimensions parameter is a list giving the lengths of the dimensions .
The start and end parameters refer to positions in the original vector .
subvector - vector returns the underlying vector , and subvector - position returns the starting point of the subvector in the underlying data .
subvector 's parameter list changed 8 - Jul - 2020 .
It was ( subvector vect new - length - or - dimension - list start ) , but that conflicts with substring , and is confusing ( the start position follows the length ) .
To translate from the old subvector to the new : ( define ( old - subvector vect len ( offset 0 ) ) ( if ( pair ? len ) ( subvector vect offset (+ offset ( apply * len ) ) len ) ( if ( not len ) ( subvector vect offset ( length vect ) ) ( subvector vect offset (+ offset len ) ) ) ) )

Multidimensional vector constant syntax is modelled after CL : #nd ( ... ) signals that the lists specify the elements of an ' n ' dimensional vector : # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) int-vector constants use #i , float - vectors use #r .
I wanted to use #f , but that is already taken .
Append the " nd " business after the type indication : # i2d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) .
This syntax collides with the r7rs byte - vector notation " #u8 " ; s7 uses " #u " for byte - vectors .
" #u2d ( ... ) " is a two - dimensional byte-vector .
For backwards compatibility , you can use " #u8 " for one - dimensional byte-vectors .
> ( vector - ref # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) 1 2 ) 6 > ( matrix - multiply # 2d ( ( -1 0 ) ( 0 - 1 ) ) # 2 d ( ( 2 0 ) ( - 2 2 ) ) ) # 2d ( ( - 2 0 ) ( 2 - 2 ) ) > ( int- vector 1 2 3 ) # i( 1 2 3 ) > ( make-float-vector ' ( 2 3 ) 1.0 ) # r2d( ( 1.0 1.0 1.0 ) ( 1.0 1.0 1.0 ) ) > ( vector ( vector 1 2 ) ( int- vector 1 2 ) ( float - vector 1 2 ) ) #( # ( 1 2 ) # i( 1 2 ) # r( 1.0 2.0 ) )
If any dimension has 0 length , you get an n-dimensional empty vector .
It is not equal to a 1 - dimensional empty vector .
> ( make-vector '( 10 0 3 ) ) # 3 d ( ) > ( equal ? #( ) # 3 d ( ) ) #f
To save on costly parentheses , and make it easier to write generic multidimensional sequence functions , you can use this same syntax with lists .
> ( let ( ( L ' ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) ) ) ( L 1 0 ) ) ; same as ( list - ref ( list - ref L 1 ) 0 ) or ( ( L 1 ) 0 ) 4 > ( let ( ( L '( ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) ( ( 7 8 9 ) ( 10 11 12 ) ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( L 1 0 2 ) 32 ) ; same as ( list - set !
( list - ref ( list - ref L 1 ) 0 ) 2 32 ) which is unreadable !
L ) ( ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) ( ( 7 8 32 ) ( 10 11 12 ) ) )
Or with vectors of vectors , of course : > ( let ( ( V #( #( 1 2 3 ) # ( 4 5 6 ) ) ) ) ( V 1 2 ) ) ; same as ( vector - ref ( vector - ref V 1 ) 2 ) or ( ( V 1 ) 2 ) 6 > ( let ( ( V # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) ) ) ( V 0 ) ) # ( 1 2 3 ) There 's one difference between a vector - of - vectors and a multidimensional vector : in the latter case , you can't clobber one of the inner vectors .
> ( let ( ( V #( #( 1 2 3 ) # ( 4 5 6 ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( V 1 ) 32 ) V ) #( #( 1 2 3 ) 32 ) > ( let ( ( V # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( V 1 ) 32 ) V ) ; not enough args for vector - set ! : ( # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 4 5 6 ) ) 1 32 ) Using lists to display the inner vectors may not be optimal , especially when the elements are also lists : # 2d ( ( ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( ( 0 ) ) ) ( ( 0 ) 0 ( ( 0 ) ) ) )
The " # ( ) " notation is no better ( the elements can be vectors ) , and I 'm not a fan of " [ ] " parentheses .
Perhaps we could use different colors ?
Or different size parentheses ? # 2D (( ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( ( 0 ) ) ) ( ( 0 ) 0 ( ( 0 ) ) ) ) # 2D (( ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( ( 0 ) ) ) ( ( 0 ) 0 ( ( 0 ) ) ) )
I 'm not sure how to handle vector -> list and list -> vector in the multidimensional case .
Currently , vector -> list flattens the vector , and list -> vector always returns a one dimensional vector , so the two are not inverses .
> ( vector - > list # 2d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) ) ( 1 2 3 4 ) ; should this be ' ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) or '( # ( 1 2 ) # ( 3 4 ) ) ? > ( list -> vector '( # ( 1 2 ) # ( 3 4 ) ) ) ; what about ' ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) ? #( #( 1 2 ) # ( 3 4 ) )
This also affects format and sort ! : > ( format #f " ~{~A~^ ~} " # 2d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) ) " 1 2 3 4 " > ( sort ! # 2d ( ( 1 4 ) ( 3 2 ) ) >) # 2d( ( 4 3 ) ( 2 1 ) ) Perhaps subvector can help : >( subvector ( list -> vector ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) ) 0 4 ' ( 2 2 ) ) # 2d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) > ( let ( ( a # 2d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ) ) ( b # 2d ( ( 5 6 ) ( 7 8 ) ) ) ) ( list ( subvector ( append a b ) 0 8 ' ( 2 4 ) ) ( subvector ( append a b ) 0 8 ' ( 4 2 ) ) ( subvector ( append ( a 0 ) ( b 0 ) ( a 1 ) ( b 1 ) ) 0 8 ' ( 2 4 ) ) ( subvector ( append ( a 0 ) ( b 0 ) ( a 1 ) ( b 1 ) ) 0 8 ' ( 4 2 ) ) ) ) ( # 2d ( ( 1 2 3 4 ) ( 5 6 7 8 ) ) # 2 d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 7 8 ) ) # 2d ( ( 1 2 5 6 ) ( 3 4 7 8 ) ) # 2 d ( ( 1 2 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 3 4 ) ( 7 8 ) ) )
Another question : should we accept the multi-index syntax in a case such as ( # ( " abc " " def " ) 0 2 ) ?
My first thought was that the indices should all refer to the same type of object , so s7 would complain in a mixed case like that .
If we can nest any applicable objects and apply the whole thing to an arbitrary list of indices , ambiguities arise : ( ( lambda ( x ) x ) " hi " 0 ) ( ( lambda ( x ) ( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) ) 1 2 ) I think these should complain that the function got too many arguments , but from the implicit indexing point of view , they could be interpreted as : ( string - ref ( ( lambda ( x ) x ) " hi " ) 0 ) ; i.e. ( ( ( lambda ( x ) x ) " hi " ) 0 ) ( ( ( lambda ( x ) ( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) )
1 ) 2 ) Add optional and rest arguments , and you can't tell who is supposed to take which arguments .
Currently , you can mix types with implicit indices , but a function grabs all remaining indices .
To insist that all objects are of the same type , use an explicit getter : > ( list - ref ( list 1 ( list 2 3 ) ) 1 0 ) ; same as ( ( list 1 ( list 2 3 ) ) 1 0 ) 2 > ( ( list 1 ( vector 2 3 ) ) 1 0 ) 2 > ( list - ref ( list 1 ( vector 2 3 ) ) 1 0 ) error : list - ref argument 1 , # ( 2 3 ) , is a vector but should be a proper list
hash - tables
( make - hash - table ( size 8 ) eq- func typers )
( make - weak - hash - table ( size 8 ) eq- func typers )
( hash - table ... )
( weak - hash - table ... )
( hash - table ? obj )
( weak - hash - table ? obj )
( hash - table - ref ht key )
( hash - table - set ! ht key value )
( hash - table - entries ht )
Each hash - table keeps track of the keys it contains , optimizing the search wherever possible .
Any s7 object can be the key or the key 's value .
If you pass a table size that is not a power of 2 , make - hash - table rounds it up to the next power of 2 .
The table grows as needed .
length returns the current size .
If a key is not in the table , hash - table - ref returns #f .
To remove a key , set its value to #f ; to remove all keys , ( fill ! table # f ) .
> ( let ( ( ht ( make - hash - table ) ) ) ( set ! ( ht " hi " ) 123 ) ( ht " hi " ) ) 123
hash - table ( the function ) parallels the functions vector , list , and string .
Its arguments are the keys and values : ( hash - table 'a 1 'b 2 ) .
Implicit indexing gives multilevel hashes :
> ( let ( ( h ( hash - table 'a ( hash - table 'b 2 'c 3 ) ) ) ) ( h 'a ' b ) ) 2 > ( let ( ( h ( hash - table 'a ( hash - table 'b 2 'c 3 ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( h 'a ' b ) 4 ) ( h 'a ' b ) ) 4
Since hash - tables accept the same applicable - object syntax that vectors use , we can treat a hash - table as , for example , a sparse array : > ( define make - sparse - array make - hash - table ) make - sparse - array > ( let ( ( arr ( make - sparse - array ) ) ) ( set ! ( arr 1032 ) " 1032 " ) ( set ! ( arr - 23 ) " - 23 " ) ( list ( arr 1032 ) ( arr - 23 ) ) ) ( " 1032 " " - 23 " ) map and for - each accept hash - table arguments .
On each iteration , the map or for - each function is passed an entry , '( key . value ) , in whatever order the entries are encountered in the table .
( define ( hash - table -> alist table ) ( map values table ) ) reverse of a hash - table returns a new table with the keys and values reversed .
fill !
sets all the values .
Two hash - tables are equal if they have the same keys with the same values .
This is independent of the table sizes , or the order in which the key / value pairs were added .
The second argument to make - hash - table ( eq - func ) is slightly complicated .
If it is omitted , s7 chooses the hashing equality and mapping functions based on the keys in the hash - table .
There are times when you know in advance what equality function you want .
If it 's one of the built - in s7 equality functions , eq ? , eqv? , equal ? , equivalent ? , = , string= ? , string - ci= ? , char= ? , or char-ci= ? , you can pass that function as the second argument .
In any other case , you need to give s7 both the equality function and the mapping function .
The latter takes any object and returns the hash - table location for it ( an integer ) .
The problem here is that for the arbitrary equality function to work , objects that are equal according to that function have to be mapped to the same hash - table location .
There 's no way for s7 to intuit what this mapping should be except in the built - in cases .
So to specify some arbitrary function , the second argument is a cons : ' ( equality - checker mapper ) .
Here 's a brief example .
In CLM , we have c-objects of type mus-generator ( from s7's point of view ) , and we want to hash them using equal ?
( which will call the generator - specific equality function ) .
But s7 does n't realize that the mus-generator type covers 40 or 50 internal types , so as the mapper we pass mus -type : ( make - hash - table 64 ( cons equal ? mus -type ) ) .
If the hash key is a float ( a non-rational number ) , hash - table - ref uses equivalent ?.
Otherwise , for example , you could use NaN as a key , but then never be able to access it !
To implement read - time hash - tables using #h ( ... ) : ( set ! *#readers * ( cons ( cons #\h ( lambda ( str ) ( and ( string= ? str " h " ) ; #h(... ) ( apply hash - table ( read ) ) ) ) ) *#readers * ) ) ( display #h( :a 1 ) ) ( newline ) ( display #h( : a 1 :b " str " ) ) ( newline )
These can be made immutable by ( immutable ! ( apply ... ) ) , or even better , ( let ( ( h ( apply hash - table ( read ) ) ) ) ( if ( > ( * s7 * ' safety ) 1 ) ( immutable ! h ) h ) ) ( define - macro ( define - memoized name&arg . body ) ( let ( ( arg ( cadr name&arg ) ) ( memo ( gensym " memo " ) ) ) `( define , ( car name&arg ) ( let ( ( , memo ( make - hash - table ) ) ) ( lambda ( , arg ) ( or ( , memo , arg ) ; check for saved value ( set ! ( , memo , arg ) ( begin , @body ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ; set !

The third argument , typers , sets type checkers for the keys and values in the table , much like the third argument to make - vector .
It is a cons of the type functions , ( cons symbol ? integer ? ) for example .
This says that all the keys must be symbols and all the values integers .
> ( define ( 10 | 12 ? val ) ( memv val ' ( 10 12 ) ) ) 10 | 12 ? > ( define hash ( make - hash - table 8 #f ( cons #t 10 | 12 ? ) ) ) ; any key is ok , but all values must be 10 or 12 ( hash - table ) > ( set !

value argument 3 , 32 , is an integer but should be a 10|12 ?
environments
An environment holds symbols and their values .
The global environment , for example , holds all the variables that are defined at the top level .
Environments are first class ( and applicable ) objects in s7 .
( rootlet ) the top - level ( global ) environment ( curlet ) the current ( innermost ) environment ( funclet proc ) the environment at the time when proc was defined ( funclet ? env ) #t if env is a funclet ( owlet ) the environment at the point of the last error ( unlet ) a let with any built - in functions that do not have their original value ( let - ref env sym ) get value of sym in env , same as ( env sym ) ( let - set ! env sym val ) set value of sym in env to val , same as ( set ! ( env sym ) val ) ( inlet . bindings ) make a new environment with the given bindings ( sublet env . bindings ) same as inlet , but the new environment is local to env ( varlet env . bindings ) add new bindings directly to env ( cutlet env . fields ) remove bindings from env ( let? obj ) #t if obj is an environment ( with - let env . body ) evaluate body in the environment env ( outlet env ) the environment that encloses the environment env ( settable ) ( let -> list env ) return the environment bindings as a list of ( symbol . value ) cons 's ( openlet env ) mark env as open ( see below ) ( openlet ? env ) #t is env is open ( coverlet env ) mark env as closed ( undo an earlier openlet ) ( object - > let obj ) return an environment containing information about obj ( let - temporarily vars . body )
> ( inlet 'a 1 'b 2 ) ( inlet 'a 1 'b 2 ) > ( let ( (a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ) ( curlet ) ) ( inlet 'a 1 'b 2 ) > ( let ( ( x ( inlet :a 1 :b 2 ) ) ) ( x 'a ) ) 1 > ( with - let ( inlet 'a 1 'b 2 ) (+ a b ) ) 3 > ( let ( ( x ( inlet :a 1 :b 2 ) ) ) ( set ! ( x ' a ) 4 ) x ) ( inlet 'a 4 'b 2 ) > ( let ( (x ( inlet ) ) ) ( varlet x 'a 1 ) x ) ( inlet 'a 1 ) > ( let ( ( a 1 ) ) ( let ( ( b 2 ) ) ( outlet ( curlet ) ) ) ) ( inlet 'a 1 ) > ( let ( (e ( inlet 'a ( inlet 'b 1 'c 2 ) ) ) ) ( e 'a ' b ) ) ; in C terms , e->a->b 1 > ( let ( (e ( inlet 'a ( inlet 'b 1 'c 2 ) ) ) ) ( set ! ( e 'a ' b ) 3 ) ( e 'a ' b ) ) 3 > ( define * ( make - let ( a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ) ( sublet ( rootlet ) ( curlet ) ) ) make - let > ( make - let :b 32 ) ( inlet 'a 1 'b 32 )
As the names suggest , in s7 an environment is viewed as a disembodied let .
Environments are equal if they contain the same symbols with the same values leaving aside shadowing , and taking into account the environment chain up to the rootlet .
That is , two environments are equal if any local variable of either has the same value in both .
let - ref and let - set !
return # < undefined > if the first argument is not defined in the environment or its parents .
To search just the given environment ( ignoring its outlet chain ) , use defined ?
with the third argument #t before calling let - ref or let - set !:
> ( defined ? ' car ( inlet 'a 1 ) # t ) #f > ( defined ? ' car ( inlet 'a 1 ) ) #t
This matters in let - set ! : ( let - set ! ( inlet 'a 1 ) ' car # f ) is the same as ( set ! car # f ) !
with - let evaluates its body in the given environment , so ( with - let e . body ) is equivalent to ( eval `( begin , @body ) e ) , but probably faster .
Similarly , ( let bindings . body ) is equivalent to ( eval `( begin , @body ) ( apply inlet ( flatten bindings ) ) ) , ignoring the outer ( enclosing ) environment ( the default outer environment of inlet is rootlet ) .
Or better ,
( define - macro ( with - environs e . body ) `( apply let ( map ( lambda ( a ) ( list ( car a ) ( cdr a ) ) ) ,e ) '( , @body ) ) )
Or turning it around ,
( define - macro ( Let vars . body ) `( with - let ( sublet ( curlet ) , @( map ( lambda ( var ) ( values ( symbol - > keyword ( car var ) ) ( cadr var ) ) ) vars ) ) , @body ) ) ( Let ( ( c 4 ) ) ( Let ( (a 2 ) ( b (+ c 2 ) ) ) (+ a b c ) ) )
let - temporarily ( now built - into s7 ) is somewhat similar to fluid - let in other Schemes .
Its syntax looks like let , but it first saves the current value , then sets the variable to the new value ( via set ! ) , calls the body , and finally restores the original value .
It can handle anything settable :
( let - temporarily ( (( * s7 * ' print - length ) 8 ) ) ( display x ) )
This sets s7 's print - length variable to 8 while displaying x , then puts it back to its original value .
> ( define ourlet ( let ( ( x 1 ) ) ( define ( a - func ) x ) ( define b-func ( let ( (y 1 ) ) ( lambda ( ) (+ x y ) ) ) ) ( curlet ) ) ) ( inlet 'x 1 ' a - func a - func ' b - func b- func ) > ( ourlet ' x ) 1 > ( let - temporarily ( ( ( ourlet 'x ) 2 ) ) ( ( ourlet ' a - func ) ) ) 2 > ( ( funclet ( ourlet ' b - func ) ) 'y ) 1 > ( let - temporarily ( ( ( ( funclet ( ourlet ' b - func ) ) 'y ) 3 ) ) ( ( ourlet ' b - func ) ) ) 4
Despite the name , no new environment is created by let - temporarily : ( let ( ) ( let - temporarily ( ) ( define x 2 ) ) (+ x 1 ) ) is 3 .
sublet adds bindings ( symbols with associated values ) to an environment .
It does not change the environment passed to it , but just prepends the new bindings , shadowing any old ones , as if you had called " let " .
To add the bindings directly to the environment , use varlet .
Both of these functions accept nil as the ' env ' argument as shorthand for ( rootlet ) .
Both also accept other environments as well as individual bindings , adding all the argument 's bindings to the new environment .
inlet is very similar , but normally omits the environment argument .
The arguments to sublet and inlet can be passed as symbol / value pairs , as a cons , or using keywords as if in define *.
inlet can also be used to copy an environment without accidentally invoking that environment 's copy method .
Here 's an example : we want to define two functions that share a local variable :
( varlet ( curlet ) ; import f1 and f2 into the current environment ( let ( ( x 1 ) ) ; x is our local variable ( define ( f1 a ) (+ a x ) ) ( define ( f2 b ) ( * b x ) ) ( inlet 'f1 f1 ' f2 f2 ) ) ) ; export f1 and f2
One way to add reader and writer functions to an individual environment slot is :
( define e ( inlet 'x ( let ( ( local- x 3 ) ) ; x's initial value ( dilambda ( lambda ( ) local - x ) ( lambda ( val ) ( set! local -x ( max 0 ( min val 100 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) > ( ( e 'x ) ) 3 > ( set ! ( ( e 'x ) ) 123 ) 100
funclet returns a function 's local environment .
Here 's an example that keeps a circular buffer of the calls to that function :
( define func ( let ( ( history ( let ( ( lst ( make - list 8 # f ) ) ) ( set-cdr ! ( list - tail lst 7 ) lst ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( x y ) ( let ( ( result (+ x y ) ) ) ( set -car !
history ( list result x y ) ) ( set ! history ( cdr history ) ) result ) ) ) ) > ( func 1 2 ) 3 > ( func 3 4 ) 7 > ( ( funclet func ) ' history ) # 1 = ( #f #f #f #f #f #f ( 3 1 2 ) ( 7 3 4 ) . # 1 # )
It is possible in Scheme to redefine built - in functions such as car .
To ensure that some code sees the original built - in function definitions , wrap it in ( with - let ( unlet ) ... ) :
> ( let ( ( caar 123 ) ) (+ caar ( with - let ( unlet ) ( caar ' ( ( 2 ) 3 ) ) ) ) ) 125
Or perhaps better , to keep the current environment intact except for the changed built -ins :
> ( let ( (x 1 ) ( display 3 ) ) ( with - let ( sublet ( curlet ) ( unlet ) ) ; ( curlet ) picks up 'x , ( unlet ) the original ' display ( display x ) ) ) 1
with - let and unlet are constants , so you can use them in any context without worrying about whether they 've been redefined .
As mentioned in the macro section , # _< name > is a built - in reader macro for ( with - let ( unlet ) < name > ) , so for example , #_+ is the built - in + function , no matter what .
( The environment of built - in functions that unlet accesses is not accessible from scheme code , so there 's no way that those values can be clobbered ) .
I think these functions can implement the notions of libraries , separate namespaces , or modules .
Here 's one way : first the library writer just writes his library .
The normal user simply loads it .
The abnormal user worries about everything , so first he loads the library in a local let to make sure no bindings escape to pollute his code , and then he uses unlet to make sure that none of his bindings pollute the library code : ( let ( ) ( with - let ( unlet ) ( load " any-library.scm " ( curlet ) ) ;; by default load puts stuff in the global environment ... ) )
Now Abnormal
User can do what he wants with the library entities .
Say he wants to use " lognor " under the name " bitwise - not - or " , and all the other functions are of no interest : ( varlet ( curlet ) ' bitwise - not - or ( with - let ( unlet ) ( load " any-library.scm " ( curlet ) ) lognor ) ) ; lognor is presumably defined in " any- library.scm "
Say he wants to make sure the library is cleanly loaded , but all its top - level bindings are imported into the current environment : ( varlet ( curlet ) ( with - let ( unlet ) ( let ( ) ( load " any-library.scm " ( curlet ) ) ( curlet ) ) ) ) ; these are the bindings introduced by loading the library
To do the same thing , but prepend " library : " to each name : ( apply varlet ( curlet ) ( with - let ( unlet ) ( let ( ) ( load " any-library.scm " ( curlet ) ) ( map ( lambda ( binding ) ( cons ( symbol " library : " ( symbol - > string ( car binding ) ) ) ( cdr binding ) ) ) ( curlet ) ) ) ) )
That 's all there is to it !
Here is the same idea as a macro : ( define - macro ( let! init end . body ) ;; syntax mimics ' do : ( let! ( vars&values ) ( ( exported - names ) result ) body ) ;; ( let ! ( (a 1 ) ) ( ( hiho ) ) ( define ( hiho x ) (+ a x ) ) ) `( let , init , @body ( varlet ( outlet ( curlet ) ) , @( map ( lambda ( export ) `( cons ' , export , export ) ) ( car end ) ) ) , @( cdr end ) ) )
Well , almost , darn it .
If the loaded library file sets ( via set ! ) a global value such as abs , we need to put it back to its original form : ( define ( safe - load file ) ( let ( (e ( with - let ( unlet ) ; save the environment before loading ( let - > list ( curlet ) ) ) ) ) ( load file ( curlet ) ) ( let ( ( new-e ( with - let ( unlet ) ; get the environment after loading ( let - > list ( curlet ) ) ) ) ) ( for - each ; see if any built - in functions were stepped on ( lambda ( sym ) ( unless ( assoc ( car sym ) e ) ( format ( ) " ~S clobbered ~ A ~ % " file ( car sym ) ) ( apply set ! ( car sym ) ( list ( cdr sym ) ) ) ) ) new -e ) ) ) ) ;; say libtest.scm has the line ( set ! abs odd ? ) > ( safe - load " libtest.scm " ) " libtest.scm " clobbered abs > ( abs - 2 ) 2
openlet marks its argument , either an environment , a closure , a c-object , or a c-pointer as open ; coverlet as closed .
I need better terminology here !
An open object is one that the built - in s7 functions handle specially .
If they encounter one in their argument list , they look in the object for their own name , and call that function if it exists .
A bare - bones example :
> ( abs ( openlet ( inlet 'abs ( lambda ( x ) 47 ) ) ) ) 47 > ( define * ( f1 ( a 1 ) ) ( if ( real ? a ) ( abs a ) ( ( a ' f1 ) a ) ) ) f1 > ( f1 :a ( openlet ( inlet 'f1 ( lambda ( e ) 47 ) ) ) ) 47
In CLOS , we 'd declare a class and a method , and call make - instance , and then discover that it would n't work anyway .
Here we have , in effect , an anonymous instance of an anonymous class .
I think this is called a " prototype system " ; javascript is apparently similar .
A slightly more complex example :
( let * ( ( e1 ( openlet ( inlet 'x 3 '* ( lambda args ( apply * ( if ( number ? ( car args ) ) ( values ( car args ) ( ( cadr args ) ' x ) ( cddr args ) ) ( values ( ( car args ) ' x ) ( cdr args ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( e2 ( copy e1 ) ) ) ( set ! ( e2 ' x ) 4 ) (* 2 e1 e2 ) ) ; (* 2 3 4 ) => 24
Perhaps these names would be better : openlet -> with - methods , coverlet -> without - methods , and openlet ? -> methods ?.
let - ref and let - set ! are problematic as methods .
It is very easy to get into an infinite loop , especially with let - ref since any reference to the let within the method body probably calls let - ref , which calls the let - ref method .
We used to recommend coverlet here , but even that is not enough , so not let - ref and let - set !
are immutable ; they can't be used as methods .
Use let - ref - fallback and let - set - fallback instead , if possible .
object -> let returns an environment ( more of a dictionary really ) that contains details about its argument .
It is intended as a debugging aid , underlying a debugger 's " inspect " for example .
> ( let ( ( iter ( make - iterator " 1234 " ) ) ) ( iter ) ( iter ) ( object - > let iter ) ) ( inlet ' value #< iterator : string > ' type iterator ?
' at - end #f ' sequence " 1234 " ' length 4 ' position 2 )
A c-object ( in the sense of s7_make_c_type ) , can add its own info to this namespace via an object -> let method in its local environment .
snd -marks.c has a simple example using a class - wide environment ( g_mark_methods ) , holding as the value of its ' object -> let field the function s7_mark_to_let .
The latter uses s7_varlet to add information to the namespace created by ( object - > let mark ) .
( define - macro ( value -> symbol expr ) `( let ( ( val , expr ) ( e1 ( curlet ) ) ) ( call - with - exit ( lambda ( return ) ( do ( (e e1 ( outlet e ) ) ) ( ) ( for - each ( lambda ( slot ) ( if ( equal ? val ( cdr slot ) ) ( return ( car slot ) ) ) ) e ) ( if ( eq ? e ( rootlet ) ) ( return # f ) ) ) ) ) ) ) > ( let ( (a 1 ) ( b " hi " ) ) ( value - > symbol " hi " ) ) b
openlet alerts the rest of s7 that the environment has methods .
( begin ( define fvector ?
# f ) ( define make - fvector # f ) ( let ( ( type ( gensym ) ) ( -> float ( lambda ( x ) ( if ( real ? x ) (* x 1.0 ) ( error ' wrong - type-arg " fvector new value is not a real : ~ A " x ) ) ) ) ) ( set ! make - fvector ( lambda * ( len ( init 0.0 ) ) ( openlet ( inlet :v ( make - vector len ( -> float init ) ) : type type : length ( lambda ( f ) len ) : object -> string ( lambda ( f . args ) " #< fvector > " ) : let-set !
( lambda ( fv i val ) ( #_vector - set ! ( fv ' v ) i ( -> float val ) ) ) : let - ref - fallback ( lambda ( fv i ) ( #_vector - ref ( fv 'v ) i ) ) ) ) ) ) ( set ! fvector ?
( lambda ( p ) ( and ( let? p ) ( eq ? ( p ' type ) type ) ) ) ) ) ) > ( define fv ( make - fvector 32 ) ) fv > fv #< fvector > > ( length fv ) 32 > ( set ! ( fv 0 ) 123 ) 123.0 > ( fv 0 ) 123.0
If an s7 function ignores the type of an argument , as in cons or vector for example , then that argument wo n't be treated as having any methods .
Since outlet is settable , there are two ways an environment can become circular .
One is to include the current environment as the value of one of its variables .
The other is : ( let ( ) ( set ! ( outlet ( curlet ) ) ( curlet ) ) ) .
If you want to hide an environment 's fields from any part of s7 that does not know the field names in advance , ( openlet ; make it appear to be empty to the rest of s7 ( inlet ' object - > string ( lambda args " # < let > " ) ' map ( lambda args ( ) ) ' for - each ( lambda args #< unspecified > ) ' let -> list ( lambda args ( ) ) ' length ( lambda args 0 ) ' copy ( lambda args ( inlet ) ) ' open #t ' coverlet ( lambda ( e ) ( set ! ( e ' open ) # f ) e ) ' openlet ( lambda ( e ) ( set ! ( e ' open ) # t ) e ) ' openlet ?
( lambda ( e ) ( e ' open ) ) ;; your secret data here ) )
( There are still at least two ways to tell that something is fishy ) .
Here 's one way to add a method to a closure : ( define sf ( let ( ( object - > string ( lambda ( obj . arg ) " #< secret function ! > " ) ) ) ( openlet ( lambda ( x ) (+ x 1 ) ) ) ) ) > sf #< secret function !>
multiple - values
In s7 , multiple values are spliced directly into the caller 's argument list .
> (+ ( values 1 2 3 ) 4 ) 10 > ( string - ref ( ( lambda ( ) ( values " abcd " 2 ) ) ) ) #\c > ( ( lambda ( a b ) (+ a b ) ) ( ( lambda ( ) ( values 1 2 ) ) ) ) 3 > (+ ( call / cc ( lambda ( ret ) ( ret 1 2 3 ) ) ) 4 ) ; call / cc has an implicit " values " 10 > ( ( lambda * ( ( a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ) ( list a b ) ) ( values :a 3 ) ) ( 3 2 ) ( define - macro ( call - with - values producer consumer ) `( , consumer ( , producer ) ) ) ( define - macro ( multiple - value - bind vars expr . body ) `(( lambda , vars , @body ) , expr ) ) ( define - macro ( define - values vars expression ) `( if ( not ( null ? ' , vars ) ) ( varlet ( curlet ) ( ( lambda , vars ( curlet ) ) , expression ) ) ) ) ( define ( curry function . args ) ( if ( null ? args ) function ( lambda more - args ( if ( null ? more - args ) ( apply function args ) ( function ( apply values args ) ( apply values more - args ) ) ) ) ) )
multiple - values are useful in a several situations .
For example , ( if test (+ a b c ) (+ a b d e ) ) can be written (+ a b ( if test c ( values d e ) ) ) .
There are a few special uses of multiple - values .
First , you can use the values function to return any number of values , including 0 , from map 's function application : > ( map ( lambda ( x ) ( if ( odd ? x ) ( values x (* x 20 ) ) ( values ) ) ) ( list 1 2 3 ) ) ( 1 20 3 60 ) > ( map values ( list 1 2 3 ) ( list 4 5 6 ) ) ( 1 4 2 5 3 6 ) ( define ( remove - if func lst ) ( map ( lambda ( x ) ( if ( func x ) ( values ) x ) ) lst ) ) ( define ( pick - mappings func lst ) ( map ( lambda ( x ) ( or ( func x ) ( values ) ) ) lst ) ) ( define ( shuffle . args ) ( apply map values args ) ) > ( shuffle ' ( 1 2 3 ) # ( 4 5 6 ) ' ( 7 8 9 ) ) ( 1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9 ) ( define ( concatenate . args ) ( apply append ( map ( lambda ( arg ) ( map values arg ) ) args ) ) )
Second , a macro can return multiple values ; these are evaluated and spliced , exactly like a normal macro , so you can use ( values '( define a 1 ) ' ( define b 2 ) ) to splice multiple definitions at the macro invocation point .
If an expansion returns ( values ) , nothing is spliced in .
This is mostly useful in reader - cond and the # ; reader .
> ( define - expansion ( comment str ) ( values ) ) comment > (+ 1 ( comment " one " ) 2 ( comment " two " ) ) 3
At the top - level ( in the REPL ) , since there 's nothing to splice into , you simply get your values back : > ( values 1 ( list 1 2 ) (+ 3 4 5 ) ) ( values 1 ( 1 2 ) 12 )
But this printout is just trying to be informative .
There is no multiple - values object in s7 .
You ca n't ( set ! x ( values 1 2 ) ) , for example .
The values function tells s7 that its arguments should be handled in a special way , and the multiple - value indication goes away as soon as the arguments are spliced into some caller 's arguments .
There are two helper functions for multiple values , apply - values and list - values , both intended primarily for quasiquote where ( apply - values ... ) implements what other schemes call unquote - splicing ( " , @... " ) .
( apply - values lst ) is like ( apply values lst ) , and ( list- values ... ) is like ( list ... ) except in one special case .
It is common in writing macros to create some piece of code to be spliced into the output , but if that code is nil , the resulting macro code should contain nothing ( not nil ) .
apply - values and list - values cooperate with quasiquote to implement this .
As an example : > ( list - values 1 2 ( apply - values ) 3 ) ( 1 2 3 ) > ( define ( supply . args ) ( apply - values args ) ) supply > ( define ( consume f . args ) ( apply f ( apply list - values args ) ) ) consume > ( consume + ( supply 1 2 ) ( supply 3 4 5 ) ( supply ) ) 15 > ( consume + ( supply ) ) 0
It might seem simpler to return " nothing " from ( values ) , rather than #< unspecified > , but that has drawbacks .
First , ( abs - 1 ( values ) ) , or worse ( abs ( f x ) ( f y ) ) is no longer an error at the level of the program text ; you lose the ability to see at a glance that a normal function has the right number of arguments .
Second , a lot of code currently assumes that ( values ) returns # < unspecified > , and that implies that ( apply values ( ) ) does as well .
But it would be nice if ( ( lambda * ( ( x 1 ) ) x ) ( values ) ) returned 1 !
Since set !
does not evaluate its first argument , and there is no setter for " values " , ( set ! ( values x ) ... ) is not the same as ( set ! x ... ) . ( string - set ! ( values string ) ... ) works because string - set !
does evaluate its first argument .
(( values + 1 2 ) ( values 3 4 ) 5 ) is 15 , as anyone would expect .
One problem with this way of handling multiple values involves cases where you can't tell whether an expression will return multiple values .
Then you have , for example , ( let ( ( val ( expr ) ) ) ... ) and need to accept either a normal single value from expr , or one member of the possible set of multiple values .
In lint.scm , I 'm currently handling this with lambda : ( let ( ( val ( ( lambda args ( car args ) ) ( expr ) ) ) ) ... ) , but this feels kludgey .
CL has nth - value which appears to do " the right thing " in this context ; perhaps s7 needs it too .
A similar difficulty arises in ( if ( expr ) ... ) where ( expr ) might return multiple values .
CL ( or sbcl anyway ) treats this as if it were wrapped in ( nth- value 0 ( expr ) ) .
Splicing the values in , on the other hand , could lead to disaster : there would be no way to tell from the code that the if statement was valid , or which branch would be taken !
So , in those cases where a syntactic form evaluates an argument , s7 follows CL , and uses only the first of the values ( this affects if , when , unless , cond , and case ) .
call - with - exit , with - baffle and continuation ?
call - with - exit is call / cc without the ability to jump back into the original context , similar to " return " in C .
This is cleaner than call / cc , and much faster .
( define - macro ( block . body ) ;; borrowed loosely from CL — predefine " return " as an escape `( call - with - exit ( lambda ( return ) , @body ) ) ) ( define - macro ( while test . body ) ; while loop with predefined break and continue `( call - with - exit ( lambda ( break ) ( let continue ( ) ( if ( let ( ) , test ) ( begin ( let ( ) , @body ) ( continue ) ) ( break ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define - macro ( switch selector . clauses ) ; C- style case ( branches fall through unless break called ) `( call - with - exit ( lambda ( break ) ( case , selector , @( do ( ( clause clauses ( cdr clause ) ) ( new - clauses ( ) ) ) ( ( null ? clause ) ( reverse new - clauses ) ) ( set ! new - clauses ( cons `( , ( caar clause ) , @( cdar clause ) , @( map ( lambda ( nc ) ( apply values ( cdr nc ) ) ) ; doubly spliced ! ( if ( pair ? clause ) ( cdr clause ) ( ) ) ) ) new - clauses ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( and - for - each func . args ) ;; apply func to the first member of each arg , stopping if it returns #f ( call - with - exit ( lambda ( quit ) ( apply for - each ( lambda arglist ( if ( not ( apply func arglist ) ) ( quit #< unspecified > ) ) ) args ) ) ) ) ( define ( find - if f . args ) ; generic position - if is very similar ( call - with - exit ( lambda ( return ) ( apply for - each ( lambda main - args ( if ( apply f main - args ) ( apply return main - args ) ) ) args ) ) ) ) > ( find - if even ? # ( 1 3 5 2 ) ) 2 > (* ( find - if > # ( 1 3 5 2 ) ' ( 2 2 2 3 ) ) ) 6
The call - with - exit function 's argument ( the " continuation " ) is only valid within the call - with - exit function .
In call / cc , you can save it , then call it later to jump back , but if you try that with call - with - exit ( from outside the call - with - exit function 's body ) , you 'll get an error .
This is similar to trying to read from a closed input port .
The other side , so to speak , of call - with - exit , is with - baffle .
Sometimes we need a normal call / cc , but want to make sure it is active only within a given block of code .
Normally , if a continuation gets away , there 's no telling when it might wreak havoc on us .
with - baffle blocks that — no continuation can jump into its body :
( let ( ( what 's - for - breakfast ( ) ) ( bad - dog ' fido ) ) ; bad - dog wonders what 's for breakfast ?
( with - baffle ; the syntax is ( with - baffle . body ) ( set ! what 's - for - breakfast ( call / cc ( lambda ( biscuit ? ) ( set! bad - dog biscuit ? ) ; bad - dog smells a biscuit ! ' biscuit ! ) ) ) ) ( if ( eq ? what 's - for - breakfast ' biscuit ! ) ( bad - dog ' biscuit ! ) ) ; now , outside the baffled block , bad - dog wants that biscuit !
what 's - for - breakfast ) ; but s7 says " No ! " : baffled ! ( " continuation ca n't jump into with - baffle " )
continuation ?
returns #t if its argument is a continuation , as opposed to a normal procedure .
I do n't know why Scheme has n't had this function from the very beginning , but it 's needed if you want to write a continuable error handler .
Here is a sketch of the situation :
( catch #t ( lambda ( ) ( let ( ( res ( call / cc ( lambda ( ok ) ( error ' cerror " an error " ok ) ) ) ) ) ( display res ) ( newline ) ) ) ( lambda args ( when ( and ( eq ? ( car args ) ' cerror ) ( continuation ? ( cadadr args ) ) ) ( display " continuing ... " ) ( ( cadadr args ) 2 ) ) ( display " oops " ) ) )
In a more general case , the error handler is separate from the catch body , and needs a way to distinguish a real continuation from a simple procedure .
( define ( continuable - error . args ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( continue ) ( apply error args ) ) ) ) ( define ( continue - from - error ) ( if ( continuation ? ( ( owlet ) ' continue ) ) ; might be # < undefined > or a function as in the while macro ( ( ( owlet ) ' continue ) ) ' bummer ) )
format , object -> string
object -> string returns the string representation of its argument .
Its optional second argument can be #f or : display ( use display ) , #t or : write ( the default , use write ) , or : readable .
In the latter case , object -> string tries to produce a string that can be evaluated via eval - string to return an object equal to the original .
The optional third argument sets the maximum desired string length ; if object -> string notices it has exceeded this limit , it returns the partial string .
> ( object -> string " hiho " ) " \" hiho\ " " > ( format #f " ~S " " hiho " ) " \" hiho\ " "
s7's format function is very close to that in srfi-48 .
> ( format #f " ~A ~D ~ F " ' hi 123 3.14 ) " hi 123 3.140000 "
The format directives ( tilde chars ) are :
~ % insert newline ~& insert newline if preceding char was not newline ~~ insert tilde ~
( tilde followed by newline ) : trim white space ~{ begin iteration ( take arguments from a list , string , vector , or any other applicable object ) ~} end iteration ~^ ~| jump out of iteration ~* ignore the current argument ~C print character ( numeric argument = how many times to print it ) ~ P insert 's ' if current argument is not 1 or 1.0 ( use ~@P for " ies " or " y " )
~ A object -> string as in display ~S object -> string as in write ~ B number -> string in base 2 ~ O number -> string in base 8 ~D number -> string in base 10 ~ X number -> string in base 16 ~E float to string , ( format #f " ~E " 100.1 ) -> " 1.001000e+02 " , ( %e in C ) ~F float to string , ( format #f " ~F " 100.1 ) -> " 100.100000 " , ( %f in C ) ~G float to string , ( format #f " ~G " 100.1 ) -> " 100.1 " , ( % g in C ) ~T insert spaces ( padding ) ~N get numeric argument from argument list ( similar to ~ V in CL ) ~W object -> string with : readable ( write readably ; s7 is the intended reader )
The eight directives before ~W take the usual numeric arguments to specify field width and precision .
These can also be ~N or ~n in which case the numeric argument is read from the list of arguments :
( format #f " ~ND " 20 1234 ) ; => ( format " ~20D " 1234 ) " 1234 "
( format #f ... ) simply returns the formatted string ; ( format #t ... ) also sends the string to the current - output - port . ( format ( ) ...) sends the output to the current - output - port without returning the string ( this mimics the other IO routines such as display and newline ) .
Other built - in port choices are * stdout * and * stderr * .
Floats can occur in any base , so : > #xf.c 15.75
This also affects format .
In most Schemes , ( format #f " ~X " 1.25 ) is an error .
In CL , it is equivalent to using ~ A which is perverse .
But > ( number -> string 1.25 16 ) " 1.4 " and there 's no obvious way to get the same effect from format unless we accept floats in the " ~X " case .
So in s7 , > ( format #f " ~X " 21 ) " 15 " > ( format #f " ~X " 1.25 ) " 1.4 " > ( format #f " ~X " 1.25+i ) " 1.4+1.0i " > ( format #f " ~X " 21/4 ) " 15/4 " That is , the output choice matches the argument .
A case that came up in the Guile mailing lists is : ( format #f " ~ F " 1/3 ) .
s7 currently returns " 1/3 " , but Clisp returns " 0.33333334 " .
The curly bracket directive applies to anything you can map over , not just lists : > ( format #f " ~{~C ~ ^ ~} " " hiho " ) " h i h o " > ( format #f " ~{~{~C~^ ~}~^...~} " ( list " hiho " " test " ) ) " h i h o ...t e s t " > ( with- input - from - string ( format #f " ( ~{~C~^ ~} ) " ( format #f " ~B " 1367 ) ) read ) ; integer -> list ( 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 )
Since any sequence can be passed to ~{~} , we need a way to truncate output and represent the rest of the sequence with " ... " , but ~^ only stops at the end of the sequence .
~| is like ~^ but it also stops after it handles ( * s7 * ' print - length ) elements and prints " ... " .
So , ( format #f " ~{~A~| ~} " # (0 1 2 3 4 ) ) returns " 0 1 2 ... " if ( * s7 * ' print - length ) is 3 .
I added object -> string to s7 before deciding to include format .
format excites a vague disquiet — why do we need this ancient unlispy thing ?
We can almost replace it with : ( define ( objects - > string . objects ) ( apply string - append ( map ( lambda ( obj ) ( object - > string obj # f ) ) objects ) ) )
But how to handle lists ( ~ {...~} in format ) , or columnized output ( ~T ) ?
I wonder whether formatted string output still matters outside a REPL .
Even in that context , a modern GUI leaves formatting decisions to a text or table widget .
( define - macro ( string - > objects str . objs ) `( with - input - from - string , str ( lambda ( ) , @( map ( lambda ( obj ) `( set ! , obj ( eval ( read ) ) ) ) objs ) ) ) ) format is a mess .
It is trying to cram two different choices into its first ( " port " ) argument .
Perhaps it should be split into format -> string and format -> port .
format -> string has no port argument and returns a string .
format -> port writes to its port argument ( which must be an output port , not a boolean ) , and returns #f or maybe < unspecified > .
Then : ( format #f ... ) -> ( format -> string ... ) ( format ( ) ... ) -> ( format -> port ( current - output - port ) ... ) ( format #t ... ) -> ( display ( format -> string ... ) ) ( format port ... ) -> ( display ( format -> string ... ) port ) and the currently unavailable choice , format to port without creating a string : ( format - > port port ... ) .
hooks
( make - hook . fields ) ; make a new hook ( hook - functions hook ) ; the hook 's list of ' body ' functions
A hook is a function created by make - hook , and called ( normally from C ) when something interesting happens .
In GUI toolkits hooks are called callback - lists , in CL conditions , in other contexts watchpoints or signals .
s7 itself has several hooks : * error - hook * , * read - error - hook * , * unbound- variable - hook * , * missing-close-paren -hook * , * rootlet - redefinition - hook * , * load - hook * , and * autoload - hook * .
make - hook is :
( define ( make - hook . args ) ( let ( ( body ( ) ) ) ( apply lambda * args '( let ( ( result #< unspecified > ) ) ( let ( (e ( curlet ) ) ) ( for -each ( lambda ( f ) ( f e ) ) body ) result ) ) ( ) ) ) )
So the result of calling make - hook is a function ( the lambda * that is applied to args above ) that contains a list of functions , ' body .
Each function in that list takes one argument , the hook .
Each time the hook itself is called , each of the body functions is called , and the value of ' result is returned .
That variable , and each of the hook 's arguments are accessible to the hook 's internal functions by going through the environment passed to the internal functions .
This is a bit circuitous ; here 's a sketch :

variable info
( documentation obj ) ; old name : ( procedure - documentation obj ) ( signature obj ) ; old : ( procedure - signature obj ) ( setter obj ) ; old : ( procedure - setter obj ) ( arity obj ) ; very old : ( procedure - arity obj ) ( aritable ? obj num-args ) ( funclet proc ) ( procedure - source proc )
funclet returns a procedure 's environment .
> ( funclet ( let ( ( b 32 ) ) ( lambda ( a ) (+ a b ) ) ) ) ( inlet 'b 32 ) > ( funclet abs ) ( rootlet )
setter returns or sets the set function associated with a procedure ( set - car ! with car , for example ) .
procedure - source returns the procedure source ( a list ) :
( define ( procedure - arglist f ) ( cadr ( procedure - source f ) ) )
documentation returns the documentation string associated with a procedure .
This used to be the initial string in the function 's body ( as in CL ) , but now it is the value of the ' + documentation + variable , if any , in the procedure 's local environment :
( define func ( let ( ( +documentation + " helpful info " ) ) ( lambda ( a ) a ) ) ) > ( documentation func ) " helpful info "
Since documentation is a method , a function 's documentation can be computed at run-time :
( define func ( let ( ( documentation ( lambda ( f ) ( format #f " this is func 's funclet : ~ S " ( funclet f ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( x ) (+ x 1 ) ) ) ) > ( documentation func ) " this is func 's funclet : ( inlet 'x ( ) ) "
arity takes any object and returns either #f if it is not applicable , or a cons containing the minimum and maximum number of arguments acceptable .
If the maximum reported is a really big number , that means any number of arguments is ok .
aritable ?
takes two arguments , an object and an integer , and returns #t if the object can be applied to that many arguments .
> ( define * ( add - 2 a ( b 32 ) ) (+ a b ) ) add - 2 > ( procedure - source add - 2 ) ( lambda * ( a ( b 32 ) ) (+ a b ) ) > ( arity add - 2 ) ( 0 .
2 ) > ( aritable ?
add - 2 1 ) #t
signature is a list describing the argument types and returned value type of the function .
The first entry in the list is the return type , and the rest are argument types .
#t means any type is possible , and 'values means the function returns multiple values .
> ( signature round ) ( integer ? real ? ) ; round takes a real argument , returns an integer > ( signature vector - ref ) ( #t vector ? .
# 1 = ( integer ? . # 1 # ) ) ; trailing args are all integers ( indices )
If an entry is a list , any of the listed types can occur :
> ( signature char- position ) ( ( boolean ? integer ? ) ( char? string ? ) string ?
integer ? )
which says that the first argument to char- position can be a string or a character , and the return type can be either boolean or an integer .
If the function is defined in scheme , its signature is the value of the ' + signature + variable in its closure :
> ( define f1 ( let ( ( +documentation + " helpful info " ) ( + signature + '( boolean ? real ? ) ) ) ( lambda ( x ) ( positive ? x ) ) ) ) f1 > ( documentation f1 ) " helpful info " > ( signature f1 ) ( boolean ? real ? )
We could do the same thing using methods :
> ( define f1 ( let ( ( documentation ( lambda ( f ) " helpful info " ) ) ( signature ( lambda ( f ) '( boolean ? real ? ) ) ) ) ( openlet ; openlet alerts s7 that f1 has methods ( lambda ( x ) ( positive ? x ) ) ) ) ) > ( documentation f1 ) " helpful info " > ( signature f1 ) ( boolean ? real ? )
signature could also be used to implement CL's ' the :
( define - macro ( the value - type form ) `(( let ( ( + signature + ( list , value - type ) ) ) ( lambda ( ) , form ) ) ) ) ( display (+ 1 ( the integer ? (+ 2 3 ) ) ) )
but the optimizer currently does n't know how to take advantage of this pattern .
You can obviously add your own methods :
( define my - add ( let ( ( tester ( lambda ( ) ( if ( not ( = ( my- add 2 3 ) 5 ) ) ( format #t " oops : ( myadd 2 3 ) -> ~ A ~ % " ( my-add 2 3 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( x y ) (- x y ) ) ) ) ( define ( auto - test ) ; scan the symbol table for procedures with testers ( let ( ( st ( symbol - table ) ) ) ( for -each ( lambda ( f ) ( let* ( ( fv ( and ( defined ? f ) ( symbol - > value f ) ) ) ( testf ( and ( procedure ? fv ) ( ( funclet fv ) ' tester ) ) ) ) ( when ( procedure ? testf ) ; found one ! ( testf ) ) ) ) st ) ) ) > ( auto - test ) oops : ( myadd 2 3 ) -> -1
Even the setter can be set this way :
( define flocals ( let ( (x 1 ) ) ( let ( ( + setter + ( lambda ( val ) ( set! x val ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( ) x ) ) ) ) > ( flocals ) 1 > ( setter flocals ) #< lambda ( val ) > > ( set ! ( flocals ) 32 ) 32 > ( flocals ) 32
( define ( for - each - subset func args ) ;; form each subset of args , apply func to the subsets that fit its arity ( let subset ( ( source args ) ( dest ( ) ) ( len 0 ) ) ( if ( null ? source ) ( if ( aritable ? func len ) ; does this subset fit ?
( apply func dest ) ) ( begin ( subset ( cdr source ) ( cons ( car source ) dest ) (+ len 1 ) ) ( subset ( cdr source ) dest len ) ) ) ) )
eval
eval evaluates its argument , a list representing a piece of code .
It takes an optional second argument , the environment in which the evaluation should take place .
eval - string is similar , but its argument is a string .
> ( eval '(+ 1 2 ) ) 3 > ( eval - string " (+ 1 2 ) " ) 3
Leaving aside a few special cases , eval - string could be defined :
( define - macro * ( eval - string x e ) `( eval ( with - input - from - string , x read ) ( or ,e ( curlet ) ) ) )
IO and other OS functions
Besides files , ports can also represent strings and functions .
The string port functions are :
( with - output - to - string thunk ) ; open a string port as current - output - port , call thunk , return string ( with - input - from - string string thunk ) ; open string as current - input - port , call thunk ( call - with - output - string proc ) ; open a string port , apply proc to it , return string ( call - with - input - string string proc ) ; open string as current - input - port , apply proc to it ( open- output - string ) ; open a string output port ( get - output - string port clear ) ; return output accumulated in the string output port ( open- input - string string ) ; open a string input port reading string ( open- input - function function ) ; open a function input port ( open- output - function function ) ; open a function output port
> ( let ( ( result # f ) ( p ( open- output - string ) ) ) ( format p " this ~A ~C test ~ D " " is " # \a 3 ) ( set ! result ( get- output - string p ) ) ( close - output - port p ) result ) " this is a test 3 "
In get - output - string , if the optional ' clear ' argument is #t , the port is cleared ( the default in r7rs I think ) .
Other functions :
read - byte and write - byte : binary IO
read - line : line - at - a - time reads , optional third argument #t to include the newline
read - string ( r7rs )
current - error - port , set - current - error - port
port - filename and port - line - number ( input ports )
port - position ( input port , settable )
port-file
Use length to get the length in bytes of an input port 's file or string .
port - line - number is settable ( for fancy *#readers * ) .
port-position is the position in bytes of the reader in the port .
It is settable .
port - file is intended for use with the * libc* library .
It returns a c-pointer containing the FILE * pointer associated with the file port ( except in Windows ) :
( call - with- input - file " s7test.scm " ( lambda ( p ) ( with - let ( sublet * libc* : file ( port - file p ) ) ( fseek file 1000 SEEK_SET ) ) ) )
The variable ( * s7 * ' print - length ) sets the upper limit
Chicago
AFTER waiting nearly a week as an Icelandic volcano spewed turbine - mangling ash into the atmosphere  thwarting flights into , out of or through Europe  the airlines are supposed to begin flying passengers again on Tuesday .
Governments , businesses and most travelers , irritated by disrupted itineraries and worried about lost productivity , are delighted to see planes back in the sky .
But I , for one , wish this blessedly jet - free interlude could have continued a little longer .
In the eccentric , ground - level adventures of some stranded passengers  700 - mile taxi rides through Scandinavia , for instance , perhaps a horse - drawn stagecoach over the Alps if things got really desperate 
I ’m reminded of the romance we trade away each time we shuffle aboard an airplane .
In the five decades or so since jets became the dominant means of long - haul travel , the world has benefited immeasurably from the speed and convenience of air travel .
But as Orson Welles intoned in “ The Magnificent Ambersons , ” “ The faster we ’re carried , the less time we have to spare . ”
Indeed , airplanes ’ accelerated pace has infected nearly every corner of our lives .
Our truncated vacation days and our crammed work schedules are predicated on the assumption that everyone will fly wherever they ’re going , that anyone can go great distances and back in a very short period of time .
So we are condemned to keep riding on airplanes .
Which is not really traveling .
Airplanes are a means of ignoring the spaces in between your point of origin and your destination .
By contrast , a surface journey allows you to look out on those spaces  at eye level and on a human scale , not peering down through breaks in the clouds from 35,000 feet above  from the observation car of a rolling train or the deck of a gently bobbing ship .
Surface transport can be contemplative , picturesque and even enchanting in a way that air travel never will be .
Official Army photographer Ron Haeberle traveled with Charlie Company into My Lai on March 16 , 1968 .
The Company was told that dozens of Viet Cong troops were passing through the area , retreating from battle after the Tet Offensive .
Captain Ernest Medina had told his men that all Vietnamese remaining in My Lai after their arrival would be Viet Cong members or sympathizers .
Following the massacre , during which between 347 and 504 civilians were killed , the story remained largely out of the public eye until the media published Haeberle 's photographs in November 1969 .
These photographs would became key evidence in the Army 's five - month investigation led by General William R. Peers .
The following gallery showcases a selection of Ron Haeberle 's images from the My Lai Massacre as they were used in the Peers investigation .
Many of the images are violent and graphic in nature .
Rachel points out the bizarre unsolicited letter that Koch Industries to Talking Points Memo Koch Industries : We Don't Fund Tea Parties ( Except For The Tea Parties We Fund ) :
Koch Industries , a major backer of myriad right - wing causes , issued an unsolicited statement last night in advance of Tax Day claiming it has never provided funding " specifically to support the tea parties . "
But when TPMmuckraker followed up , a spokeswoman acknowledged that Koch funds one of the most prominent national groups that organizes ... tea parties .
" Because you have covered tea parties in the past and we imagine you will cover tomorrow 's Tax Day Tea Party in DC , we want to reiterate some important facts , " wrote Melissa Cohlmia , the company 's director of communication , in the email Wednesday evening .
" Koch companies value free speech and believe it is good to have more Americans engaged in key policy issues .
That said , Koch companies , the Koch foundations , Charles Koch and David Koch have no ties to and have never given money to FreedomWorks .
In addition , no funding has been provided by Koch companies , the Koch foundations , Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties .
Thanks for your consideration . "

No country has embraced the movement toward commercialized , prepackaged food as much as the United States .
Americans eat 31 percent more packaged food than fresh food , and they consume more packaged food per person than their counterparts in nearly all other countries .
A sizable part of the American diet is ready - to - eat meals , like frozen pizzas and microwave dinners , and sweet or salty snack foods .
" Americans tend to graze rather than sit down and eat a full meal , so the food is tailored for convenience , " said Mark Gehlhar , who has studied global food consumer preferences at the Economic Research Service of the Agriculture Department .
" And Americans do not seem to be as discerning about quality . "
T. Colin Campbell , a nutritionist at Cornell University , said that " there is a lot of money tied up in the industry because it is profitable for companies to make these foods . "
He added that " Processed foods contain large amounts of fat , salt and sugar , and Americans have become addicted to them . "
Yellowstone cutthroate trout ( Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri ) .
The unintentional but tragic loss of freshwater fish during water diversions - otherwise known as fish entrainment - has become a big problem in many parts of the world - particularly in the Western U.S .
The Trout Conservancy based in Missoula , Montana recently released an interesting and useful report titled Trout Entrainment in Montana : Status and Solutions .
While the report specifically addresses the trout entrainment problems in the Big Sky state , the issues and recomendations discussed will likely apply to other fish in other geographic settings .
We interviewed John Zelazny , Executive Director of the Trout Conservancy , about the report and the challenging issue of fish entrainment .
CM : Can you describe how fish entrainment specifically occurs ?
JZ : Fish entrainment is a pretty simple process .
In essence , whenever people divert stream , river , pond or lake water , the opportunity is created for fish to follow the flow of diverted water and become entrained .
In Montana , what generally happens is that trout ( and other fish ) move into irrigation systems ; when irrigation ceases in the fall , fish are stranded and die .
CM : How big of a problem is trout entrainment in Montana and what are the ecological consequences ?
JZ : The entrainment problem in Montana is both substantial and complicated .
Very few diversions have been studied to quantify seasonal entrainment problems , but , of those that have , analysis indicates several thousand trout ( and tens of thousands of other fish species ) per season are entrained by each diversion , and there are almost 180 thousand known diversions in Montana .
The math indicates that hundreds of thousands of trout ( and much larger numbers of other fish species ) are entrained each year and consequently lost to reproducing populations .
The complications arise from having big introduced populations of trout ( mostly rainbows , browns and brook trout ) in Montana watersheds for over a century .
These non-natives now are self - reproducing ( as opposed to being regularly stocked ) , and apparently suffer little harm at the population level from entrainment , despite the large annual losses , as is indicated by regular population surveys .
Many of the wild trout entrained annually in Montana are young fish , and normal mortality among this age group is so high as to often completely mask the effects of entrainment - at least among non-native populations .
Populations of native trout species ( Yellowstone and westslope cutthroat trout , bull trout , and arctic grayling ) , on the other hand , are in decline , and these losses ( especially for migratory populations ) are often considered to be a big problem by fisheries managers .
Entrainment in these situations is generally mitigated by approaches like fish screens .
CM : What is the goal of your report with respect to the trout entrainment issue in Montana and the larger issue of fish entrainment in general ?
JZ : The goal of the report is to help prevent the needless loss of wild trout in Montana ( regardless of whether they are native or introduced populations ) to irrigation diversions .
Wild trout only exist in certain regions of the United States , and as such possess intrinsic value .
Economically , wild trout are an important attraction in Montana , generating hundreds of millions of dollars in tourism and fishing activity by virtue of their presence .
From these perspectives , it is wasteful and foolish to allow large numbers of wild trout to be annually lost to entrainment in Montana , and , in the case of native species , wantonly destructive to the point of causing extinction .
CM : Can you outline the different sections of the report ?
JZ : The first section describes the how's and why 's of trout entrainment in Montana - including the influences of trout biology , water law , climate change and the design of diversions .
The second section describes ( and illustrates ) different types and designs of fish screens ( the most common remedy for preventing entrainment ) .
The third section identifies some known entraining diversion sites in Montana .
The fourth and final section describes some funding sources available for fish screens and other remedies for those interested in preventing entrainment in Montana ( funding assistance is often key , because fish screens generally cost $ 10,000 or more for every cubic foot per second of water diverted ) .
CM : preventing fish entrainment .
How effective are screens in addressing the issue and what are some considerations that managers should keep in mind when using them ?
JZ : Fish screens ( structures which screen fish , but not water , from entering diverted flows ) have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing entrainment for trout and salmon - provided that the correct design is used , and that regular maintenance is done to ensure proper screen function .
Maintenance is a key issue - unless a regular and routine long - term maintenance program is part of any installation , fish screens should not be used .
In all cases , only an experienced professional should determine the type of fish screen , the installation and use , and the maintenance required .
Also , fish screens are generally the remedy of last resort for entrainment , even in states with well - funded screening programs ( such as Idaho ) , owing to the problematic issues of fish screen operations and the lasting benefits of ( and often far less complicated ) approaches like retiring or reducing diversions .
CM : To what extent is the report applicable to entrainment issues with other types of fish in other geographic areas ?
JZ : Entrainment affects all species of fish wherever surface flows are diverted for human use .
A prime example are delta smelt , which have declined precipitously in the Sacramento River Delta of California due to enormous intra-state diversions for agricultural , industrial and domestic human uses .
Hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent to mitigate entrainment impacts to delta smelt , with questionable success .
In other regions of the west coast of the United States , vast amounts of money have been spent to reduce entrainment impacts to anadromous salmon and steelhead stocks - again with questionable results .
Entrainment remedies like fish screens are not the sole answer to the survival problems faced by many fish species , and big entrainment programs in places like the Pacific region states are largely supported by federal subsidy ( which is not necessarily a secure thing ) .
However , we still advocate fish screening as preferable to the unfettered diversion of surface waters . ﻿

It ’s one of the NHL ’s strangest curses : no player drafted by the Ottawa Senators has ever won the Stanley Cup . *
Despite being in the NHL since 1992 , participating in 18 drafts , and selecting 161 players , none of them have won the Cup .
The Senators came close in 2006 - 07 when they lost in the Finals to the Anaheim Ducks .
Marian Hossa came closer , infamously falling short in back - to - back seasons with two different teams .
Others never made it that far .
But regardless of when they played and who they played for , the one thing that ties them all together is that because they were drafted by the Ottawa Senators , they ’re cursed .
It ’s now the 2010 playoffs and 11 teams have Senators draftees on their rosters .
We know that the Senators themselves are the most cursed of all and wo n’t win the Cup , but what of the other 10 teams ?
Do any of them have a shot at breaking the curse once and for all ?
Silver Seven investigates .
Atlanta Thrashers
Christoph Schubert # 16 / Defenseman / Atlanta Thrashers Height : 6 - 3 Weight : 230 Born : Feb 05 , 1982 Contract : Pending UFA
2009 - 10 : F
Missed playoffs because Ilya Kovalchuk won the team goal - scoring title by 7 goals despite being traded to New Jersey in early February .
Long - term : unknown
It ’s doubtful that Schubert will return after another poor season .
Injuries , pathetic point production ( he had more points in his rookie season ) , and an " I know I ’m better as a forward , but do n’t you dare make me play anything but defence " attitude will probably negate any incentive for the Thrashers to re-sign him .
With a shot as hard as his , you would expect more than 2 goals in over 40 games .
He holds the record for second - hardest shot in Ottawa Senators history , yet Atlanta did n’t see fit to put him on the power play for more more than 219 seconds all season .
If by some miracle he re-signs , this becomes a D- .
If he re-signs and Don Waddell is fired , this becomes a D .
Carolina Hurricanes
Tim Gleason # 6 / Defenseman / Carolina Hurricanes Height : 6 - 0 Weight : 217 Born : Jan 29 , 1983 Contract : 2 years ( UFA )
2009 - 10 : F
Missed playoffs because Cam Ward ’s 2 - 9 - 3 record by November 6 was worth exactly 7 points in the standings .
Long -term : C +
The Hurricanes are traditionally a flip - flopping team , alternating between amazing seasons with deep playoff runs and awful seasons where they do n’t make the playoffs at all .
Gleason ’s a pretty good player - heck , he was an Olympic silver medalist - and the Hurricanes are primed for another run in the 2010 - 2011 playoffs .
Their grade is weakened by the very real chance that the Hurricanes will play the way they look on paper , which is n’t very good .
Philadelphia Flyers
Ray Emery # 29 / Goalie / Philadelphia Flyers Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 196 Born : Sep 28 , 1982 Contract : Pending UFA
2009 - 10 : D
Does anyone really expect Brian Boucher to be " just good enough " to pull this off ?
Long - term : unknown
Ray Emery is a UFA this summer , is coming off major surgery , and his career may very well be over .
However , this is the Philadelphia Flyers and Ray Emery is a goalie .
Expect the unexpected .
If Emery is healthy and re-signs , this becomes a D+.
Why so low ?
Because no team obeys Murphy ’s Law like the Philadelphia Flyers .
Tampa Bay Lightning
Andrej Meszaros # 14 / Defenseman / Tampa Bay Lightning Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 218 Born : Oct 13 , 1985 Contract : 4 years ( UFA )
Brandon Bochenski # 27 / Right Wing / Tampa Bay Lightning Height : 6 - 1 Weight : 187 Born : Apr 04 , 1982 Contract : Pending UFA
2009 - 10 : F
Missed playoffs because Steven Stamkos only had points on 45 % of the team ’s goals .
Long-term : C -
New , less crazy ownership .
Do n’t underestimate how much a cleaning out of the old staff is going to improve this team .
Unfortunately for them , they still have $ 4 M of their cap dedicated to the talent erosion that is Andrej Meszaros .
The presence of pre-season all - star Brandon Bochenski did little to bolster their offence , but he did produce the same number of points per game as Alex Tanguay .
Neither will be missed .
Stamkos and Hedman bump this grade up from a D+.
Washington Capitals
Brooks Laich # 21 / Center / Washington Capitals Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 200 Born : Jun 23 , 1983 Contract : 1 year ( UFA )
Alexandre Giroux # 33 / Center / Washington Capitals Height : 6 - 3 Weight : 201 Born : Jun 16 , 1981 Contract : Pending UFA
2009 - 10 : B +
I ’m not going to lie , they may be cursed but they ’re one scary team .
You do n’t average over half a goal per game more than the next best team without threatening to do some serious damage .
Alexandre Giroux has spent most of the season in the minors , but he finished second in AHL scoring with 103 points , and if the Hershey Bears get knocked out ( unlikely , but possible ) , Giroux could potentially be a nice addition to the Capitals ’ taxi squad .
Long-term : A-
Laich only has one more year left , but assuming he is n’t traded he will be a part of a likely even more potent offence next season .
The Capitals are the best hope for breaking the curse .
Chicago Blackhawks
Marian Hossa # 81 / Right Wing / Chicago Blackhawks Height : 6 - 1 Weight : 210 Born : Jan 12 , 1979 Contract : 11 years ( UFA )
2009 - 10 : F
Marian Hossa .
Long -term : F
See above .
Columbus Blue Jackets
Antoine Vermette # 50 / Left Wing / Columbus Blue Jackets Height : 6 - 1 Weight : 197 Born : Jul 20 , 1982 Contract : 5 years ( UFA )
2009 - 10 : F
Missed playoffs because of Steve Mason .
Long-term : B -
The Blue Jackets have a goalie who should be able to carry the team for years , unless he turns into the second coming of Andrew Raycroft .
With another top five pick coming and a Nikita Filatov who really wants to play in the NHL , the Blue Jackets should be good for years to come .
They also have leadership in spades .
Specifically , they have six alternate captains .
Also , did you know that ( alternate captain ) Antoine Vermette finished second in team scoring , only two points less than Rick Nash ?
Pretty good for a guy who was labeled " speedy with hands of stone " by Senators fans .
Detroit Red Wings
Patrick Eaves # 17 / Right Wing / Detroit Red Wings Height : 6 - 0 Weight : 191 Born : May 01 , 1984 Contract : Pending RFA
2009 - 10 : B +
They 're the Detroit Red Wings .
Long - term : unknown
If they retain Eaves , this turns into a B .
If not , they no longer qualify for the curse .
Minnesota Wild
Martin Havlat # 14 / Right Wing / Minnesota Wild Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 217 Born : Apr 19 , 1981 Contract : 5 years ( UFA )
Greg Zanon # 6 / Defenseman / Minnesota Wild Height : 5 - 11 Weight : 201 Born : Jun 05 , 1980 Contract : 2 years ( UFA )
2009 - 10 : F
Missed playoffs because Guillaume Latendresse was acquired at the end of November instead of October .
Long -term : D +
Despite his newfound ability to stay healthy , presumably because he now coats his body in kevlar before each game , Martin Havlat just plain is n’t worth the money and the Wild do n’t scare anyone in the Western Conference .
Of course , that might be because the team is nicknamed the Minnesota Mild , but regardless of that it ’s still Havlat ’s fault .
They do n’t pose a threat for the foreseeable future .
Vancouver Canucks
Sami Salo # 6 / Defenseman / Vancouver Canucks Height : 6 - 3 Weight : 212 Born : Sep 02 , 1974 Contract : 1 year ( UFA )
Pavol Demitra # 38 / Center / Vancouver Canucks Height : 6 - 0 Weight : 200 Born : Nov 29 , 1974 Contract : Pending UFA
2009 - 10 : B -
Although they have a relatively healthy Sami Salo , usually a walking china doll , the rest of the Canucks ’ defence is either already decimated by injury or very fragile .
Roberto Luongo is also having a rough season , which is n’t helping matters at all .
Pavol Demitra has been outclassed by an Austrian kid nicknamed Grabby that many figured would n’t even stick around the big club .
They were also picked to be the Stanley Cup champions by many pundits at the start of the season , doubly cursing them .
They ’re still better off than most teams on this list , but they ’ve got some heavy odds against them .
Long -term : B
A healthier , possibly improved defence .
Better goaltending .
Some seriously good young talent at forward that should easily offset the " loss " of Demitra .
Salo ’s only on the books for one more year , but as long as nobody picks them to win it all , they just might pull it off .
In the small town of Shuckton , Ontario , which has just placed a bid to host the 2028 Summer Olympics , its mayor , Larry Bowman , is found murdered .
As the authorities investigate , other townsfolk with a personal history to the deceased mayor conduct their own unofficial investigations to see if they can discover who committed the murder .
Life in Shuckton continues under the leadership of the new mayor who has her own agenda , and under the watchful eye of the local news team , who not only have more news to cover than usual but who are dealing with their own internal issues .
But as life continues , so does Death , he who has some more names on his list and some old scores to settle .

A Norman man who sued to get " IM GAY ” on his car tag has died .
Keith Kimmel , 28 , was found dead Wednesday morning at a friend ’s apartment in Norman , police reported .
Police detectives were investigating .
The gay activist ’s lawsuit gained him national attention in February .
He dropped the Oklahoma County lawsuit two weeks after filing it .
He said he was changing attorneys and intended to file it again in federal court .
" I want to tell people who I am and what I am .
I ’m proud of it .
I ’m openly gay .
I ’m not hiding , ” he said in February .
His friend , Kerri Logsdon , told The Oklahoman she found Kimmel ’s body in a chair in front of her computer in the apartment ’s living room around 7:45 a.m. Wednesday .
In a posting Monday on his Internet blog , Kimmel wrote , " I am done trying to love a world that has no love for me .
I am done trying to believe redeeming things about people who have nothing redeeming about them . ”
An autopsy will be done to determine the cause and manner of death , a spokeswoman for the medical examiner ’s office said .
His death came days after a run-in with Tulsa police officers outside a gay club .
Kimmel told The Oklahoman Monday he was the victim of gay bashing .
He said he mailed a police brutality complaint to Tulsa police internal affairs officers .
In the complaint , he wrote officers abused him physically and verbally outside The End Up club then dumped him at a hospital emergency room for treatment .
He complained officers at one point hit his head on a patrol car ’s door frame several times as they tried to stuff him into the car .
He wrote he was drinking at the club Friday night and police were called after he was involved in a fight .
Kimmel applied a year ago to the Oklahoma Tax Commission for the " IM GAY ” car tag .
He was turned down because of an internal Tax Commission rule against special license tags that " may be offensive to the general public . ”
He sued the state Feb. 10 , asking an Oklahoma County judge to order tax officials to grant his request .
He argued his free speech rights had been violated .
He dismissed the lawsuit Feb. 26 .
Kimmel in February said he was a student at Oklahoma City Community College but his friend said he dropped out .
Logsdon said she was letting him stay with her a few days so he did n’t have to sleep in his car .
" He was loud and gregarious , but he had a soft heart .
Deep inside , he was a good guy , ” said Logsdon , 40 .
On his blog , Kimmel wrote at length Monday about his anger over a breakup with a new boyfriend , a dancer at the Tulsa gay bar .
He wrote he was writing about it as a purging process .
" It relieves pain .
Some people cut themselves , others take drugs , I write and — and sometimes take drugs , too . ”
State Sen. Steve Russell , the Oklahoma City Republican , in December proposed the idea of keeping his state out of the Matthew Shepard Act .
Yesterday , enough of his colleagues joined him in affirming such legislation , giving state law enforcement the right not to turn over files to federal authorities :
“ Under the new provisions of Senate Bill 1965 , reports that were collected during investigations of possible hate crime that did not end in a conviction would be destroyed or kept by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation .
Russell said the bill is meant to prevent the federal law enforcement officials from taking over a case and applying different standards when local law enforcement has already investigated a case .
Only a few senators questioned Russell about the contents of his proposed amendment .
The measure passed 39 - 6 and now heads to the House for consideration .
Russell said his bill is meant to protect speech of all kinds .
‘ We just do n’t want the pendulum to swing too far the other way , ’ he said .
‘ This protects people to do or say whatever they want , as long as it complies with local ordinances . ' ”
And if police and district attorneys do n’t work with the FBI on hate crimes cases ?
They could be facing their own federal charges : obstruction of justice .
Rock , meet stupid place .
The bill now heads to the House .

Apple 's computers have exclusively used Intel CPUs for four years , but some rumors suggest that may be about to change .
Apple 's partnership with Intel has led to a major change in the computing landscape since Apple started moving away from PowerPC about four years ago .
According to a post on AppleInsider , things may be poised to change again if the Cupertino - based computer giant is really considering adopting AMD processors .
The post suggests a couple of reasons for this possibility , both believable .
First , that Apple wants to " increase its flexibility and broaden its competitive options . "
And second that Intel 's own schedules and goals — the former for the timely release of processors ( particularly for notebooks ) , the latter involving partnering with Nvidia on a standardized chipset for its full line of products — may not be compatible with Apple 's own .
A move to AMD could mean lower prices — AMD 's CPUs are cheaper than Intel 's almost across the board , though they do n't always offer equivalent performance — and easier - to - arrange access to the video technologies AMD acquired when it bought ATI in 2006 .
The AppleInsider story further speculates :
" Given word of the ongoing discussions and briefings , Apple may also now have access to new information about competitive products AMD has in the pipeline .
The company may also have original design specifications that AMD may be more willing to adopt than Intel just to obtain Apple 's high profile business .
Similar to how Apple optimized the A4 ARM SoC used by iPad , Apple may be planning to develop customized x64 CPUs for its Macs that AMD could be interested in building specifically for use by Apple . "
Whether the discussions are serious negotiations or just a bargaining , Apple remains highly in demand — the iPad certainly is n't hurting — and could continue to set the pace for the rest of the computing industry .
Apple gave Intel a significant boost four years ago , and that 's kept Intel at the forefront of both innovation and people 's minds .
Would Apple 's influence do the same for AMD ?
Time will tell , but it will be interesting to see if Apple 's magic can — and wants to — strike twice .
Do you think Apple will adopt or move to AMD ?
Do you think Apple should ?

The past few weeks have seen some pretty big news for Library Linked Data .
On April 7th the Hungarian National Library announced that its entire library catalog , digital library holdings , and name / subject authority data are now available as Linked Data .
Then just a bit more than a week later , on April 16th the German National Library announced that it was making its name and subject authority files available as Linked Data .
This adds to the pioneering work that the Royal Library of Sweden has already done in making all of its catalog and authority data available , which they announced almost two years ago now .
Add to this that OCLC is also publishing the Virtual International Authority File as Linked Data , and that the Library of Congress also makes its subject authority data available as Linked Data and things are starting to get interesting .
About 16 months ago at the Dublin Core Conference in Berlin Alistair Miles predicted that we ’d see several implementations of Linked Data at major libraries within the year .
I must admit , while I was sympathetic to the cause , I was also pretty skeptical that this would come to pass .
But here we are , just a bit past a year and two national libraries and a major library data distributor have decided to publish some of their data assets as Linked Data .
Hey Al , crow never tasted so good …
So now it ’s starting to feel like there ’s enough extant library Linked Data to start looking at patterns of usage , to see if there are any emerging best practices we could work towards .
In particular I think it would be interesting to take a look at :
What vocabularies are being used , and is there emerging consensus about which to use ?
What licenses ( if any ) are associated with the data ?
How much linking and interlinking is going on ?
What sorts of mechanisms does the publisher offer for getting the data : sitemap , feeds , SPARQL , bulk download ?
What is the quality of the data : granularity , link integrity , vocabulary usage .
What approaches to identifiers for “ real world things ” have publishers taken : hash , slash , 303 , PURLs , reuse of traditional identifiers , etc .
What are the relative sizes of the pools of library linked data ?
How are updates being managed ?
Tomorrow I ’m meeting with some folks at the Metadata Research Center at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina to talk about their HIVE project .
Barbara Tillett and Libby Dechman of LC are also here to talk about the use of LCSH , VIAF and RDA .
I ’m hoping to convince some of the folks at the MRC that answering some of these questions about the use of Linked Data in libraries could be valuable to the library research community .

World leaders are heading for Washington to discuss what Barack Obama has described as " the most immediate and extreme threat to global security " - the risk that terrorists could acquire a nuclear bomb .
But how likely is this scenario ?
A former investigator with the CIA and the US department of energy , Rolf Mowatt - Larssen , says there are three headlines that keep him awake at night : • Pakistani ' loose nukes ' in the hands of terrorists • North Korea supplies terrorists with nuclear bombs • Al - Qaeda launches nuclear attack
The good news is that he thinks " the odds are stacked against " terrorists acquiring a nuclear bomb .
But the low probability , he argues , has to be weighed against the awfulness of the consequences .
In today 's unpredictable world , he writes in an article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , " a probability - based approach to managing risk " makes less sense than one " focused on mitigating threats in descending order of their possible consequences " .
It 's an argument that Barack Obama was making long before his election .
" Instead of taking aggressive steps to secure the world 's most dangerous technology , [ the US has ] spent almost $ 1 trillion to occupy a country in the heart of the Middle East that no longer had any weapons of mass destruction , " he said in a speech at Purdue University , Indiana , in July 2008 .
Three months later , a commission set up by the US Congress warned that without decisive action it was " more likely than not " that a terrorist attack involving WMD would occur by the end of 2013 .
Pakistan
In Rolf Mowatt - Larssen 's view , there is " a greater possibility of a nuclear meltdown in Pakistan than anywhere else in the world " .
The region has more violent extremists than any other , the country is unstable , and its arsenal of nuclear weapons is expanding .
Once a new plutonium reactor comes on line in the near future " smaller , more lethal plutonium bombs will be produced in greater numbers " , he says .
Pakistan has taken serious measures to protect the crown jewels of its national security , but it lives in a perilous time
Bruce Riedel , Brookings Institution
The possibility of a Taliban takeover is , he admits , a " worst - case scenario " .
But the Taliban and al - Qaeda are not the only shadows on the Pakistani landscape .
There is also the Lashkar - e - Taiba militant group , which is accused of carrying out the Mumbai attack in November 2008 , and like the Pakistani officer corps , recruits mostly in the Punjab .
" As one senior Pakistani general once told me , " wrote Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution last week , " the relationship between the army and the Lashkar - e - Taiba is a family affair " .
He went on : " Pakistan has taken serious measures to protect the crown jewels of its national security , but it lives in a perilous time .
If there is a nightmare nuclear security scenario in Pakistan today it is probably an inside - the - family - job that ends up in a nuclear armageddon in India . "
The point is echoed by Ian Kearns of the British American Security Information Council ( Basic ) , who writes of the danger that states could use terrorist groups to attack adversaries " by proxy " , engineering nuclear security breakdowns to facilitate terrorist access to weapons or materials .
BBC correspondents say there is every indication that the Pakistani military is in total control of the country 's nuclear facilities .
North Korea
The reason North Korea keeps Rolf Mowatt - Larssen awake at night is connected with the mysterious site at al - Kibar in Syria , destroyed by Israeli missiles in 2007 .
How confident can the international community be that there is not a long - running ' AQ Kim ' network in North Korea ?
Rolf Mowatt - Larssen ,
Harvard University
It 's his view that North Korea was helping Syria build a reactor there and that the outside world only found out because of a " windfall of intelligence " .
" Taking into account the sobering reality that Kim Jong - il came close to providing Syria with the building blocks for nuclear weapons ... how confident can the international community be that there is not a long - running ' AQ Kim ' network in North Korea that is analogous to the AQ Khan rogue state nuclear supplier network in Pakistan ? " he asks .
The episode showed , in his view , that it is hard enough for the intelligence community to spot state - related clandestine nuclear activity , let alone clandestine nuclear trafficking of non-state actors , which would have a much smaller footprint .
North Korea 's " erratic and irresponsible behaviour " makes it a leading potential source for terrorists seeking to acquire nuclear - related technologies and materials , he says .
Al - Qaeda
Though he now works in academia , Rolf Mowatt - Larssen led US efforts to determine whether al - Qaeda possessed a nuclear bomb , in the wake of 9/11 .
It is a stark and worrying fact , therefore , that nuclear materials and weapons around the world are not as secure as they should be
Ian Kearns , British American Security Information Council
He does n't believe it does .
But " the group 's long - held intent and persistent efforts to acquire nuclear and biological weapons represent a unique means of potentially fulfilling their wildest hopes and aspirations , " he writes .
Al - Qaeda 's experience on the nuclear black market has taught its planners that its best chance lies in constructing an " improvised nuclear device ( IND ) , " he says .
For this they would need either a quantity of plutonium or 25 kg - 50kg of highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) , the size of one or two grapefruits .
HEU is held in hundreds of buildings in dozens of countries .
" Security measures for many of these stocks are excellent , but security for others is appalling , " according to a report published in 2008 by the Nuclear Threat Initiative .
The IAEA registered 15 confirmed cases of unauthorised possession of plutonium or HEU between 1993 and 2008 , a few of which involved kilogram - sized quantities .
In most cases the quantity was far lower but in some cases the sellers indicated there was more .
( If there was , it has n't been traced . )
There is no global inventory of either material , so no - one can be sure how much has gone missing over the years .
Neither are there agreed international standards for security and accounting of these materials .
UN Security Council Resolution 1540 merely calls for " appropriate and effective " measures , without defining this in detail .
" It is a stark and worrying fact , therefore , that nuclear materials and weapons around the world are not as secure as they should be , " writes Ian Kearns , in his Basic report .
The main goal of the Washington summit is to make progress on this issue .

A veterans advocacy organization is raising the alarm about staggering unemployment rates among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and is pressing Congress for help .
The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America estimates that unemployment rate of new veterans is 14.7 percent , much higher than the overall 9.7 percent announced Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
ADVERTISEMENT
While the Friday report indicated the economy added 162,000 new jobs in March , that was n’t a relief for the group , which has made veterans employment its top legislative agenda this year .
“ It 's unforgivable that new veterans are bearing the brunt of the economic downturn , ” Paul Rieckhoff , IAVA Founder and Executive Director , said in a statement Friday .
“ This is no way to welcome a new generation of heroes home .
America can and must do better .
” IAVA plans to work with Sen . ( D - Mont. ) , the chairman of the Finance Committee , to introduce a jobs bill for new veterans .
After a meeting with Baucus in February , IAVA announced that the Finance chairman plans to move with legislation that would create a hiring credit which rewards employers that hire veterans that have recently left military service .
Meanwhile , Sen . ( D- Wash . ) , who serves on the Veterans Affairs Committee , told a veterans ’ roundtable last week that she also plans to propose legislation helping veterans ' employment efforts , according to the Seattle Times .
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are not statistically more likely to be unemployed than their civilian peers , according to IAVA , but veterans leaving the active - duty military service do have a higher rate of unemployment .
Because of the tough economic times , many decide to reenlist in the military rather than face long - term unemployment , the group states .
Unemployment rates for new veterans have risen significantly over the last two years , according to IAVA .
In 2009 , the average unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans was 10.2 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2007 and 7.3 percent in 2008 .
The unemployment rate of reservists and National Guardsmen , who often leave behind civilian jobs when they deploy , has more than quadrupled since 2007 , and now rival that of veterans recently discharged from the military .
The jobless rate for reservists and the Guard stands at 10.6 percent compared to the 13.8 percent for recently - discharged veterans , according to IAVA .
National Guardsmen and Reservists , who typically serve in the military part - time , are seeing their civilian lives disrupted by multiple combat tours .
Many reservists returning from combat are not immediately reemployed and do not receive the pay and benefits that they are entitled to , according to IAVA .
For the veterans who retire from active duty the biggest roadblock appears to be the lack of understanding in the civilian world for the skills veterans acquired in the military .
“ These veterans , like me , who have spent years in the military gaining unparalleled leadership experience , are facing civilian employers that often do n't understand our skill set , ” said Tom Tarantino , IAVA ’s legislative assistant .
“ I spent 10 years in the Army , 12 months in Iraq , and when I left the military , I was surprised by a civilian world that rewarded service with unemployment checks and a frustrating job search .
" Many veterans also face a stigma associated with psychological injuries and mental health treatment .
Almost one in three troops who test positive for a mental health problem worry about the effect it will have on their career and even veterans not receiving mental health treatment fear that stereotyping of returning veterans may limit their employment opportunities , according to IAVA .
The federal government already has several programs tailored for helping veterans with employment .
Among those programs are the Veterans Affairs ’ Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment service ; the Department of Labor ’s veterans employment and training service , REALlifelines and America ’s Heroes at Work ; and the Defense Department ’s Operation War Fighter and the Transition Assistance program .
Of Europe 's basket case financial economies ( though we 'll point out that the U.S. could soon fall into the basket case category as well ) , Greece still sticks out like a sore thumb .
Just look at this comparison of each PIIGS nations ' twin deficits :
Or CDS spreads :
While it is pretty well known by now that Greece is in definite trouble , Europe 's other teetering economies could easily fall like dominoes if a Greek crisis is mishandled according to Goldman .
Goldman :
The twin deficits provide some guidance to the relative vulnerabilities ( Chart 1 ) , and in terms of comparisons of public - sector debt sustainability , these other countries all require medium - term primary surpluses that are only a fraction of Greece ’s to stabilize their debt ratios for the same growth rate and real interest rate .
That said , the entire Euro - zone periphery faces large financing needs and , to contain the cost of this financing , governments have started to outline fiscal measures to be implemented this year .
Table 1 summarizes the key macro financial indicators for the Euro - zone periphery .
Contagion across Southern Europe will be a function of the policy reaction in Greece , the timing and extent of non-commercial financial support ( if it turns out to be necessary ) , ECB policies and policy actions in the individual countries .
So focus on Greece , and hope the Eurozone gets it right .
Because the stakes are huge :
If contagion from Greece engulfs other countries , then up to 20 % - 30 % of Euro - zone GDP could be under severe stress .
Were a major financial instability event to develop , we would expect the ECB to pause in its exit strategy , and then , if needed , reverse course and reinstate longer - term financing .

During the Hackathon in Edinburgh last year , Benedikt Huber and I worked hard on adding a new feature to cabal - install .
It eventually made its way into the codebase and has now been a part of cabal - install since version 0.8.0 .
However , it seems that lots of people still do n’t know about it , so I thought I ’d write a quick post about it .
What do you do when you want to create a new Cabalized package ?
If you ’re like me , in the past you ’ve probably copy - and - pasted the .cabal file from a different project and edited it .
And the first .cabal file you ever made , you probably copy - and - pasted from someone else ’s project .
This works fine up to a point , but it ’s annoying , and you never end up learning about great new features that Cabal now supports , or about things you ’ve been doing that are now deprecated .
Would n’t it be great if the initial setup for a Cabal project could be generated for you ?
The solution is a new mode for the cabal command line tool , cabal init , which interactively prompts you for some information and creates a default .cabal file and related package stuff for you .
Without further ado , let ’s see it in action !
$ mkdir myproject $ cd myproject $ cat >

Boing Boing partner John Battelle was on a WiFi - enabled flight last night , and wanted to say bedtime - goodnight to his kids using videochat .
Lots of parents tuck their kids into bed over video when they 're far from home .
What gentler , more loving example of the power of the internet could there be ?
Nope .
A United Airlines flight attendant told John that this was prohibited because terrorists could use this to coordinate attacks .
So what 's a curious guy to do ?
To the Internet !
Which is exactly what I did .
Responses starting pouring in .
Including one from a pal at the State Department , who echoed my basic goal :
To use video chat to tuck my kids into bed is n't a crime .
Or at least , should n't be .
The flight attendant just showed me the United policy manual which prohibits " two way devices " from communicating with the ground .
However , the PLANE HAS WIFI .
To combat this , not unlike China , United and other airlines have blocked Skype and other known video chat offenders .
Apparently , they missed Apple iChat .
Oops .
An FAA guidebook says inflight video chat is to be discouraged because it can be annoying to seatmates , but that 's very different than banning something because it's a terrorist weapon .

George Weigel , once a staunch defender of cultist and multiple child - rapist Marcial Maciel , a man protected by both Woytila and Ratzinger for years , now blames gay former archbishop , Rembert Weakland , and Laurie Goodstein of the New York Times for airing the hideous story of how a Catholic priest was able to rape countless deaf children in Milwaukee for decades .
All of it is now a liberal media conspiracy against the church :
[ T ]he crisis of sexual abuse and episcopal malfeasance has been seized upon by the Church ’s enemies to cripple it , morally and financially , and to cripple its leaders .
That was the subtext in Boston in 2002 ( where the effort was aided by Catholics who want to turn Catholicism into high - church Congregationalism , preferably with themselves in charge ) .
And that is what has happened in recent weeks , as a global media attack has swirled around Pope Benedict XVI , following the revelation of odious abuse cases throughout Europe .
In his native Germany , Der Spiegel has called for the pope ’s resignation ; similar cries for papal blood have been raised in Ireland , a once - Catholic country now home to the most aggressively secularist press in Europe .
But it was the New York Times ’ front page of March 25 that demonstrated just how low those determined to bring the Church down were prepared to go .
Notice how Weigel still blames the revelation of child abuse in Boston on the Globe , rather than , say , Cardinal Law , who was rewarded for covering up and enabling the rape of children by a sinecure in Rome and a right to elect the current Pontiff .
Yes , he 's still there , sitting pretty .
And , although Weigel concedes some errors in the church , he argues in the case of the rapes of deaf children for decades in Wisconsin , that the current Pope had nothing to do with ignoring this case of abuse , even though it was referred directly to his office in 1996 :
The New York Times made available on its own website the supporting documentation for the story .
In those documents , Cardinal Ratzinger himself does not take any of the decisions that allegedly frustrated the trial .
Letters are addressed to him ; responses come from his deputy .
So it was the deputy 's fault .
Ratzinger never signed anything .
Even though Weakland went directly to Rome , he never actually got to meet Ratzinger .
The future Pope kept his distance , but did n't actively shut down any investigation ; his deputy merely recommended suspending it because of Murphy 's illness and age .
Case closed for the theocons .

The chief scientist in Israel 's ministry of education , Gavriel Avital , " sparked a furor " by questioning the reliability of evolution and global warming , leading to calls for his dismissal , according to Haaretz ( February 21 , 2010 ) .
" If textbooks state explicitly that human beings ' origins are to be found with monkeys , I would want students to pursue and grapple with other opinions .
There are many people who do n't believe the evolutionary account is correct , " he was quoted as saying .
" There are those for whom evolution is a religion and are unwilling to hear about anything else .
Part of my responsibility , in light of my position with the Education Ministry , is to examine textbooks and curricula . "
Hava Yablonka of Tel Aviv University told Haaretz that Avital 's statements were tantamount " to saying that space should be given in textbooks to the view that the earth is flat and the sun revolves around it .
It 's astonishing that the chief scientist of a government ministry can say such bizarre things . "
Similarly , Lia Ettinger , a biologist at the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership in Tel Aviv , called for Avital 's resignation , commenting , " It 's clear that given the nature of science , there is never complete consensus , and that disputes bring us closer to the truth .
But this has nothing to do with the things Avital said .
If these are his positions , he cannot promote the kind of education necessary for the environment and sustainable ecology . "
A subsequent article in Haaretz ( February 22 , 2010 ) quoted Yehoshua Kolodny , a professor emeritus at Hebrew University who recently won the Israel Prize — the country 's highest civilian honor — for his contributions to the earth sciences , as saying , " Denying evolution is like denying science itself . "
Kolodny added , " When a top scientist ignores these things , it 's a cultural calamity ...
There are no disagreements among scientists regarding evolution .
Catholics and Protestants long ago ended their war against evolution , and Avital is for all intents and purposes joining the radical fringe of evangelicals in the United States . "
Jonathan Erez , a professor at Hebrew University 's Earth Sciences Institute , told Haaretz , " it is clear that Avital is not fit for the job . "
In a February 23 , 2010 , editorial , Haaretz called on the minister of education , Gideon Sa'ar , to sack Avital , describing him as " an obscurantist Orthodox zealot who casts doubt on the validity of scientific research and rejects both evolution and global warming " and commenting , " His proposals that curricula undergo religious censorship to cast doubt on evolution are reminiscent of the notorious ' monkey trial ' that saw a teacher in Tennessee put on trial in the 1920s for teaching evolution . "
The editorial concluded , " Sa'ar should immediately get rid of Avital , whose appointment has made a mockery of the minister 's lofty promises , and replace him with a true scientist . "
Avital 's academic background is in aerodynamic engineering — when appointed as chief scientist in December 2009 , he was the head of aeromechanics at Elbit Systems and a lecturer in aerodynamics at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology — and his appointment was controversial since , as Haaretz ( December 1 , 2009 ) reported , it was " apparently the first time the ministry 's chief scientist has not come from one of the universities ' education schools . "
A former chief scientist at the ministry told the newspaper , " A chief scientist do[e ] s not have to know everything about education , but he should at least have extensive knowledge of the field .
This is one of the most important posts in the ministry . "
Unfortunately , Avital 's views on evolution may be shared by a sizable segment of the Israeli public .
A 2006 survey of public opinion in Israel by the Samuel Neaman Institute found that " a minority of only 28 % accepts the scientific theory of the evolution [ sic ] , while the majority ( 59 % ) believes that man was created by god , " while according to the 2000 International Social Survey Programme , a total of 54 % of Israeli respondents described " Human beings developed from earlier species of animals " as definitely or probably true , placing Israel ahead of the United States ( 46 % , in last place ) for its public acceptance of evolution , but behind twenty - three of the twenty - seven countries included in the report .

A growing number of Chinese men are seeking wives from Vietnam because they cannot find a suitable partner in their own country .
Guo Shuhan and Erik Nilsson report
After 100 failed dates with Chinese women , Dai Wensheng decided to cast his eyes southward in his search for the ideal bride .
Like a growing number of men in his position , the 43 - year - old Nanjing native found his perfect match , A Yin , in Vietnam , last August .
" I knew she was different from other women when I tried to hold my umbrella above her to shield her from the scorching sun , " Dai recalls .
" She grabbed it and held it over my head instead . "
The couple married two months later and A Yin is now one - month pregnant .
She 's adapting well , having learned basic Chinese and also acclimated to Nanjing 's cold .
Dai says her pleasant demeanor has helped him cultivate business relationships , because potential partners are more likely to trust a man with a good wife .
But Dai did n't stop at joining the swelling ranks of Chinese looking for love across its southern border .
Since September , he has been organizing " marriage tours " for men like him to seek Vietnamese spouses .
More than half of these prospective suitors are from Beijing or Shanghai , have at least a bachelor 's degree , and are aged between 35 and 45 .
A third are mid-level or top executives at multinational companies .
These potential grooms travel to Vietnam where they go on blind speed dates with about 10 women , aged 18 to 25 , a day .
An older woman in Vietnam , colloquially known as an " adopted mother " , picks the women who have at least a high school education .
The result , Dai says , has been nearly 50 " matches made in heaven " .
While it 's a relatively new trend on the mainland , nearly 87,000 Vietnamese married men from Taiwan between January 1987 and March 2008 , an online report by the Asia Cross - border Marriage Network says .
It 's difficult to determine the number of Vietnamese brides on the mainland , because couples can register in either country .
Several factors are giving momentum to the emergent phenomenon on the mainland , says Deng Weizhi , a cross - border marriage expert at Shanghai University .
One is Chinese women 's rising social and economic status .
Another is a ratio of 114 men for every 100 women in coastal areas and a larger disparity in central and western regions , he explains .
China is a particularly appealing place for Vietnamese women , because the two cultures share similar customs and festivals , he says .
For men , " It 's Vietnamese women 's mild dispositions and traditional respect for husbands that makes the prospect desirable , " Deng says .
A Shenzhen native who runs the " Vietnam Blind Dating " website www.ynxnw.com, surnamed Zhou , agrees .
He says that while he can't explain all his clients ' motivations , one feeling resonates with many : " I 'm sick of Chinese women 's snobbery . "
The 40 - year - old has a Vietnamese girlfriend and also runs matchmaking tours to the country , taking about three men twice a month .
He refuses men in their 20s , because they might not be serious about marriage .
The idea for the service came from his experience operating an import - and - export business in Vietnam .
Dai never thought of seeking a bride across the border until 2008 , when he stumbled upon an online article about Chinese marrying Vietnamese .
His own 2 - year dating history with Chinese women kept leading him back to the same point .
" I really had a growing feeling the women I was meeting just wanted to marry into money and have a higher social status , " Dai says .
After three months ' preparation , Dai set out for Vietnam last August to hunt for the ideal woman .
He chronicled his month - long quest on his blog .
Every post garnered many comments , mostly from well - wishers and other men who expressed an interest in following in his footsteps .
Some of these men , such as a Beijing native , surnamed Zhao , would later find the love of his life with Dai 's help .
The 39 - year - old website manager was shy around women .
His romantic problems were n't helped by the fact they thought he should be doing better in his career and earning more .
He first joined the tour in February to experience Vietnam 's culture .
This month , with his parents ' blessing , he returned to seek a wife and found love .
He and his potential bride are awaiting her parents ' approval .
" Vietnamese women have a totally different set of requirements ( from Chinese women ) , " Zhao says .
" All they want is a considerate , honest and filial husband , and a loving , happy family . "
Hopeful husbands - to - be pay 35,000 yuan ( $ 5,128 ) to take the marriage tour .
Some spend 5,000 yuan for an introductory trip to experience the country .
Dai selects at most 10 men from among 100 applications per month .
Because about 50 percent of the potential grooms are divorced , Dai interviews them to flush out any undesirable motives .
He says he chooses men with an above average income because the women are dependant on their husbands .
This is because of the language barrier , making it difficult for them to find a job .
Also they are not eligible for social welfare in the first five years , after which they can become naturalized .
While many of the couples experience love at first sight , winning over the parents can prove tricky .
Many men end up having to return to Vietnam for a second or third time .
Dai ' wife , A Yin , was keen to get married , he says , because her elder sisters , who married men in Hong Kong and Taiwan , had created for her an image of Chinese husbands as caring and trustworthy .
The businessman , who also operates a media company based in Nanjing with offices in Hong Kong and Canada , arranges regular get - togethers for Vietnamese wives in Shanghai .
He has also set up an Internet chat group for the husbands to discuss various issues , such as the children 's nationalities .
The businessman has already posted arrangements for next month 's tour to Vietnam .
" I enjoy every trip and am pleased to see every happy union , " he says .
But he warns applicants to bear in mind challenges , such as the language barrier , cultural differences and the expense of educating their children .
" Anyway , you need to be a good husband to have a good wife , " Dai says .
DONG FUTU VILLAGE , CHINA — It was a spring day , as Feng Caishan recalls .
Here , in this farming community on China ’s Loess Plateau — a jagged , golden landscape of shifting sands tucked into an elbow of the Yellow River — 70 or 80 officials assembled in a local meeting hall .
They ’d been summoned to a lecture , which seemed routine enough .
But what Professor Liang Zhongtang told them that day , 25 years ago , astonished them : Every rural household in Yicheng County , he said , would now be allowed to have two children .
“ I could n’t believe my ears , ” says Feng , then a local Communist Party official and now retired .
Neither could anyone else .
Everyone knew that China ’s parents were allowed only one child .
The government policy , started in 1979 , was strictly enforced to curb overpopulation .
Those who violated the policy were ordered to have abortions and faced heavy fines .
It was the law .
Now , suddenly — here in Yicheng at least — that policy was about to change .
“ At first I was afraid , ” says Feng , now 65 .
“ I thought if people had two children , they ’d want three .
Then everything would spin out of control . ”
But Professor Liang explained to the gathering that the new , two - child policy for Yicheng was an experiment approved by the central government .
As a social scientist , he wanted to see how people would respond if they had the freedom to choose — what would the overall impact on the population be ?
The officials sat in rapt silence .
There were a few rules , however , Liang went on : Under the plan , people would be required to marry later — men at 25 instead of 22 ; women at 23 instead of 20 — have their first child a year later , and , after an interval of five or six years , they ’d be allowed a second child .
Liang , then teaching at the Communist Party School of Shanxi province , had designed the plan himself .
He ’d written directly to then Communist Party Secretary Hu Yaobang to win permission .
One other detail :
There was to be no reporting of the experiment in the media .
The government wanted the plan kept as quiet as possible .
Later when local people in Yicheng learned of the plan in a door - to - door canvass , they were ecstatic .
People applauded , officials recall .
In no time at all the experiment was a resounding success : abortions plummeted , fines for violators declined , and Yicheng ’s population growth actually fell beneath the national average .
While across China parents were resisting the one - child national policy by having two , three or more children , here in Yicheng , some parents happily had two , others happily chose one .
But almost no one exceeded the limit .
Equally important : Local officials no longer had to use a heavy hand to enforce a policy no one liked .
“ It made our jobs easier , ” says Feng , who went on to become the county ’s family planning commissioner .
“ The people were so happy we ended up calling the experiment the ‘ Loving the People policy , ’ because that ’s the way people felt about it . ”
Yicheng ’s experiment has never ended .
Here in this rural county about 1,000 kilometres south of Beijing , it continues to this day .
But so does China ’s one - child policy .
There are exceptions :
In cities , for example , if one parent is from a minority group , or if both parents are themselves single children , a second child might be allowed .
In rural areas , a second child might be permitted , but only if the first child is a girl .
After that , parents must stop .
In this small piece of China , however , a second child is allowed without any restrictions or qualifications .
Statistics show that 63 per cent of Chinese parents are still controlled by the one - child policy : 35 per cent are urban dwellers while the remaining 28 per cent are mainly rural parents who had a boy as their first child and , as a result , were required to stop .
The state employs 400,000 family planning officials to oversee strict compliance .
The lessons of Yicheng , it seems , have yet to be applied .
But a growing number of demographers say they should be .
They point to Yicheng as clear evidence that the one - child policy should be abolished .
A national debate is heating up .
“ The Yicheng experiment gives us hope , ” says Gu Baochang , professor of population and development studies at Beijing ’s Renmin University of China .
“ It refutes the belief that if people are allowed to have two , they ’ll want three or more , and eventually China ’s population will explode .
“ With Yicheng , those worries have been shown to be groundless , ” he says .
“ The ( one - child ) policy should be changed . . . and its abolition should be the ultimate goal . ”
Momentum for change is building .
Only last week the research arm of the popular newspaper China Youth Daily published a poll of more than 6,000 people showing that 78 per cent preferred to have two children , if only the state would allow it .
Here in Yicheng County it ’s common .
Here you can see siblings set off to school together , and even behold that rarest of sights in tradition - rooted China , where male children are still highly prized : the two - son family .
“ I always wanted to have a girl , ” confesses 47 - year - old Liu Yunqing , a mother who bore two boys under the plan .
“ But on our second try it was a boy again ! ” she says with humour - laced exasperation .
“ You know I ’m not the only one on this street with two boys , ” she adds , seated in her spotlessly clean home in the county ’s Dong Futu Village .
“ Just a few houses down Dr. Kong Delan also has two . ”
Yicheng County might not be as rich as Shanghai , or as powerful as Beijing .
But it has a strong sense of community and functions well — an example of what President Hu Jintao says all Chinese should strive to build , namely , “ a harmonious society . ”
But it was n’t always this way , acknowledges 83 - year - old An Dousheng , the county ’s family planning commissioner when professor Liang ’s plan was launched .
Smartly dressed in a black pea jacket and dapper grey cap ,
An says relations between the people and officials under the one - child policy were “ very tense . ”
When he heard Liang was looking for a place to conduct his experiment , he offered Yicheng .

He was confident the new plan would work .
“ At the time , the one - child policy was so far from what the people wanted and they were putting up strong resistance .
They did n’t want to be limited to just one child . ”
Some would leave the county to bear a child , then return to face unbearably heavy fines .
“ People had very little money back then , ” he says .
After five years of remarkable success under the new plan , authorities in Shanxi ’s provincial capital were so impressed they asked An to go to Beijing , report on the program and ask permission to expand it into the larger region of Linfen .
An remembers China ’s then national family planning director being impressed by two key results : first , abortions had sharply declined ; second , gender ratios between boy babies and girl babies were normal — strongly suggesting that if parents were legally allowed two children , they ’d quit pursuing boy children and value girls just as much .
“ Girls were no longer discriminated against under the new plan , ” says An . “ Gender ratios were normal . ”
A later , detailed study confirmed that .
Normal gender ratios are between 106 to 108 boys born for every 100 girls in China .
But in 2000 , the national rate soared to 117.8 boys for every 100 girls .
Social scientists say parents were aborting girls to try again for boys .
But in Yicheng that was n’t the case .
Its gender rate remained solid at 106.1 .
Still , Beijing balked .
Despite the program ’s success , the bid to expand it was given a chilly reception .
The one - child policy had by then become a top guiding principle , and that very same year , 1991 , the government announced that local officials ’ promotions across the country would be based on how well they carried out the policy .
“ We returned home and just carried on , ” says An . “ But you know , personally , I still believe it would work in Linfen . ”
It still works in Yicheng , peacefully and harmoniously .
Local family planning officials say they ’re free to focus on service rather than management .
They hold seminars for expectant mothers , hand out birth control pills and anti-conception devices , and ensure abortion is available on demand .
Local mom Li Hongye was a model citizen under the new plan : she married at 23 as required , had her first child at 24 , and after an interval had her second at 32 , both girls .
But Li took an extra step .
After her second child she voluntarily went in for a tubal ligation , ending her childbearing years , and for doing so , the government pays her and her husband 50 Chinese yuan each per month ( about $ 7.60 per parent ) .
When they turn 60 they ’ll be paid 720 yuan per parent annually ( $ 110 each ) .
Officials say the cash rewards are an added incentive to discourage parents from continuing to pursue boy children .
“ Having two children makes sense for the simple fact that the kids can keep each other company , ” says Li , who works part - time at an insurance agency .
“ When my girls grow up they ’re both going to college , ” she adds .
But demographers say it will be a far , far different China by then .
For as China still works feverishly to suppress births , lowering the national fertility rate to somewhere between 1.6 and 1.8 births per 1,000 , it ’s also experiencing the fastest rise in life expectancies in modern times .
When Mao Zedong took control of China in 1949 , the average Chinese person was expected to live to just 35 .
Today that number has soared past 73 .
Those two forces — declining births and rising life expectancies — are working at cross purposes : as China ’s labour pool shrinks , the number of retirees is about to balloon , setting the stage for demographic disaster .
By 2050 , demographers say , China will have 335 million retirees , a nation of pensioners the size of the United States , or 10 times the size of Canada .
“ Over the next 10 years alone , the number of people in China ’s labour force between the ages of 20 and 24 will drop by 50 per cent , ” says demographic expert Dr. Wang Feng of the University of California at Irvine , who has studied population trends in China for years .
“ The fact is , ” says Wang , “ today ’s China is headed down a very steep slope .
And instead of putting on the brakes , it ’s actually stepping on the gas pedal . ”
The country , he says , “ is sitting on a ticking time bomb . ”
A change in policy is “ inevitable ” he says , but given the guarded nature of governance in China , no one can predict when .
Renmin University ’s Gu Baochang says the government here faces an enormous task : how to persuade a nation to alter its thinking after telling it for decades that China has “ too many people .
“ People still continue to think the old way , ” says Gu , “ but the situation has fundamentally changed .
“ People need to know , ” he says .
“ Otherwise , China is looking at huge development problems down the road . ”

About the Design
Recently , I found myself out shopping – browsing the racks for spring ’s newest styles .
Before I realized what was happening I found myself face - to - face with a pair of pink and purple acid washed jeans .
Needless to say , they were horrific , but I found it hard to deny the paint splattered - like artistry behind their design .
Thus , inspiration was born .
I scoured the web for paint splatters and came across a beautiful pack of extremely hi-res textures from mediamilitia.com .
These are absolutely gorgeous and the possibilities are really endless when it comes to cropping to get different looks and adjusting hue / saturation in Photoshop to get just the color scheme you ’re looking for .
The type face featured is Engravers Gothic .
Happy April !

I 'm happy to say that the Colorado State Judiciary Committee has " indefinitely postponed " the Religious Bill of Rights for public schools .
Yay !
They said , and I quote :
After consideration on the merits , the Committee recommends the following : SB10 -089 be postponed indefinitely .
That is essentially their way of killing the motion .
What 's interesting to me is this statement ( emphasis mine ) :
FINAL VOTE - Moved a substitute motion to postpone Senate Bill 10-089 indefinitely .
The motion passed on a 4 - 3 roll call vote .
Curious , I looked up the parties of the committee members .
Can you guess who voted how ?
Yup .
The Democrats all voted to kill the bill , and the Republicans all voted not to kill it .
Shocker , given this was clearly an attempt by the far - right religious groups to once again wedge their foot in the door , trying to make the government a theocracy .
They lost this time , but by a narrow margin .
Had this gone to the floor -- and extrapolating from the fact that this was voted on strict party lines in the committee -- the bill would have lost anyway , since the party ratio is 21 to 14 Democrat to Republican .
Still and all in this country , as we 've learned we 're always one election away from change .
I certainly hope that , in this case , change is something we do n't have to believe in .

The White House escalated its response Thursday to the growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , and a local official said the massive slick is projected to reach the Louisiana coast late Thursday .
In an afternoon appearance in the Rose Garden , President Barack Obama promised to use " every single available resource " of government to help with the spill , which could be one of the largest in U.S. history .
The U.S. military began mobilizing for what could be a major effort to prevent environmental damage to Louisiana and other states .
The oil " is already in state waters " and will reach the Pass - a - Loutre Wildlife Management Area , near the southernmost tip of the state later Thursday , Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said after a meeting with council members and a congressman to discuss the emergency .
The prospects for slowing the spread of the oil appear dim , and the slick threatens to cause significant environmental damage and disruption to business along the Gulf Coast .
In Louisiana , Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday to aid state response and asked the Coast Guard and BP PLC to deploy more resources to the state .
It appears that the oil well , damaged after a Transocean Ltd. rig hired by BP exploded and sank last week , is leaking 5,000 barrels of oil a day , five times the rate thought earlier this week , officials said .
The slick spans about 600 square miles .
" If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS , there should be scientific documents which either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact , at least with a high probability .
There is no such document . "
Dr. Kary Mullis , Biochemist , 1993 Nobel Prize for Chemistry .
" Up to today there is actually no single scientifically really convincing evidence for the existence of HIV .
Not even once such a retrovirus has been isolated and purified by the methods of classical virology . "

Is HIV really the cause of AIDS ?
For more than 25 years , thinking people have been reevaluating the HIV=AIDS hypothesis .
The number of biomedical scientists saying that the cause of AIDS is still unknown has been growing fast since the initial HIV discovery announcement in April 1984 .
Either scientists do not see evidence for a lethal virus called HIV -- saying that it has never really been isolated -- or they assert that the virus is harmless .
In any case , it is helpful to remember that , in science , correlation is not causation .

So this year ?
It ’s been fulla brisket .
It started at New Years , with the Southwestern Pulled Brisket that made me a brisket person .
And also a slow - cooker person .
But mostly a brisket in the slow - cooker person because together , magic happens .
Sidebar : Last month , Alex and I were eating leftover brisket for dinner , or trying to , but these gigantic eyes , staring down our forks as went from plate to mouth and back again were making it difficult .
Alex : Jacob , this is n’t for you .
You need teeth to eat brisket .
Deb : AHEM .
Alex :
But not your mother ’s !
[ P.S. Jacob has decided that spelt / oat / barley cereal is an excellent stand - in , but I think it ’s just because he does n’t know better . ]
The Year of the Brisket continued , fittingly , with our first Passover seder this week and people , not only do you not need teeth for this brisket , you did n’t even need a knife ; you just tapped a slice of it with the side of your fork and it exhaled into a pile of rich , flavorful confetti .
And I ’m going to tell you a secret , which is if you use the slow - cooker in the method I describe below , it barely matters which brisket recipe you use , brisket magic will be made .
Of course , humbly , I suggest the one I hacked from Emeril this week — though believe me , I ’ve heard them all , like that one with the bottle of cola and those with the packets of onion soup mix and the other one with a can of cranberry sauce or a bottle of Kraft salad dressing .
I would never make this stuff up .
Good Jewish brisket usually comes down to an element of sweet , salty , sour and tangy and my people have found endless crafty ways to get there .
I do not judge .
The ingredients here , though still bottle - and jar - heavy , are a little less scary but I warn that if you very strictly follow Passover rules you ’ll want to look for ketchup and chili sauce without corn syrup in them .
Nevertheless , if you ’ve been felled by brisket recipes in the past — those that produced leaden , leathery slabs your guests politely choked down bites of while burying the rest under piles of charoset — let this recipe be your brisket vindication , your brisket salvation … your brisket Elijah ?
Ahem , perhaps I ’m getting a little carried away .
Good brisket has that effect on me .
And it makes the dreamiest leftovers .
( Over egg noodles .
You know , if you ’re reading this next week . )

Tangy Spiced Brisket
Adapted ( er , overhauled ) from Emeril Lagasse
Sure , I ’ve pretended that I adapted this from an Emeril recipe but I am pretty sure Emeril would n’t recognize what I did with it , from changing every single measurement to ditching steps ( like studding the brisket with garlic ; I like my brisket uninterrupted ) to not straining the sauce ( I know !
I always thought I was more the sauce straining type too ! ) because the bits were too tasty to making it in a slow - cooker and deciding browning it had no effect on the final dish and also greatly simplifying the cooking process .
So yeah ; mostly I just made this recipe up .
And it ’s wonderful — not just the buckets of flavorful sauce ( no dry brisket here ! ) but the slow - cooker to fridge to oven technique ( adapted from my mother - in - law ) , which produces flawless brisket every single time .
Serves 8 to 10 servings
3 large onions , sliced
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 garlic cloves , peeled and halved
1 teaspoon paprika
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/4 teaspoons black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne ( adjust to your heat preference )
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 cups beef stock ( unsalted or low salt )
1 cup ketchup *
1 cup chili sauce *
( I ’m realizing from comments that there are many many types ; I used Heinz , which is not exactly spicy )
1 cup brown sugar ( light or dark )
8 to 10 pound brisket
Prepare the sauce :
Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and sauté onions in vegetable oil , stirring occasionally , until caramelized and most of liquid has evaporated , about 15 minutes .
Add halved garlic cloves and saute for 3 minutes more .
Stir in spices and seasoning ( paprika , salt , garlic and onion powders , black pepper , cayenne , oregano and thyme ) and cook for 2 minutes .
Set aside .
In a large bowl , stir together the beef stock , ketchup , chili sauce and brown sugar .
Do n’t worry if your brown sugar is lumpy ( mine always is ) , the acidity of the ingredients will quickly break it down .
If baking in oven : Preheat oven to 350 degrees .
Place brisket in a baking dish or casserole , spread onion mixture over the top , then pour sauce mixture over the entire dish .
Cover tightly with foil bake until very tender but not falling apart , about 3 to 4 hours .
If making in a slow cooker ( which I highly , highly recommend ) :
Place brisket in a slow cooker , spread onion mixture over the top , then pour sauce mixture over the entire dish .
Cover with the lid and cook it on LOW for 10 hours .
( I like to start it before I go to bed , and process it in the morning to rest over the course of the day in the fridge . )
For both methods , rest the dish :
When the brisket is cooked but still hot , use a spoon to scrape off any large fat deposits adhered to the top and bottom of the brisket .
( This part is easiest to do when hot .
The sauce will be de-fatted after it has chilled . )
If you ’re using a slow cooker , transfer the brisket and all of its sauce to a baking dish .
If you ’ve baked it in the oven , you can continue in that same dish .
Chill entire dish in the fridge for several hours and up to one day ; this resting time will significantly enhance the flavor and texture of the meat .
An hour before you ’re ready to serve it : Preheat your oven to 300 °F , and remove the dish from the fridge .
Remove all of the fat that has solidified with a slotted spoon for a less oily finish .
Carefully remove the meat from its sauce and place on a large cutting board .
Cut the brisket into 1/2 - inch slices .
If you like a smoother sauce ( I do ) this is a good time to run it through a blender or literally just smash up the onion and garlic strands with a wooden spoon .
They ’ll be so soft , that ’s all it takes .
Carefully place the sliced meat ( moving it in large sections with a spatula helps keep it together ) back into the sauce and spoon the sauce over the meat .
Replace the lid or cover the dish tightly with foil and reheat in the oven until it is bubbling at the edges — this usually takes up to to 30 minutes .

Strikeforce 's April 17 card in Nashville did n't quite deliver the excitement that many had hoped .
However , it did introduce a new entrant to this list while striking down another .
Jake Shields has remained unbeaten for five years and counting .
Over 14 victories , he has beaten the likes of Yushin Okami Robbie Lawler , Jason " Mayhem " Miller and now Dan Henderson .
Shields ' rousing upset victory over Henderson to retain the Strikeforce middleweight title solidified him as one of the sport 's elite , creating a serious question as to whether the Cesar Gracie standout will remain with the San Jose - based promotion or if the near future will see him in the Octagon .
Meanwhile , in his stateside debut , Shinya Aoki was unable to dazzle the American audience the way that he'd done for crowds on the other side of the Pacific .
The Dream lightweight champion was soundly dominated from bell to bell by Gilbert Melendez , who easily won every round against the typically slick grappler .
The rush of activity for these pound - for - pounders is not over : Saturday night in Sacramento , both Jose Aldo and Mike Thomas Brown will be in action at WEC 48 , looking to further stake their places in the 145 - pound division and perhaps move toward a rematch in the future .
Nearly two weeks removed and with Strikeforce 's in - cage brawl in Nashville now being MMA 's primary flak magnet , Silva has managed to escape further criticism stemming from his UFC 112 performance against Demian Maia .
We also know what 's next for " The Spider , " as Dana White was quick to announce that the middleweight kingpin would be back in action in August , defending his title against trashtalking political candidate Chael Sonnen .
Though it is a far cry from the fight with Georges St. Pierre that was teased prior to the Maia debacle , it is a bout that will assuredly draw its fair share of hype courtesy of Sonnen 's gift of gab .
It is the kind of nitpicking that can only result when a fighter is as dominant as St. Pierre .
After another complete performance at UFC 111 , with his UFC welterweight title up for grabs , one would anticipate that GSP ’s crushing of Dan Hardy would have impressed onlookers .
Instead , in spite of particularly vicious armbar and kimura attempts that contorted the arm of “ The Outlaw , ” MMA ’s welterweight king has been disparaged as a safety - first top- position wrestler who is content to do just enough to win fights .
Critiques aside , the constant stream of elite challengers will not stop for St. Pierre , whether they come from the ever - deep 170 - pound division or courtesy of a move to 185 pounds .
Emelianenko was supposed to embark on his next conquest for Strikeforce in April , this after he had wiped out Brett Rogers in thrilling fashion in the promotion ’s November CBS debut .
However , a contract impasse between Strikeforce and M - 1 , Emelianenko ’s representation , put the breaks on his appearance .
Now his next bout looks more likely for June or July .
In some ways , the delay may be a blessing in disguise .
It will not buy Strikeforce a world of time , but if Emelianenko had fought and knocked off Fabricio Werdum as anticipated , it would have left the Russian with one last obvious foil -- Alistair Overeem -- as we entered the summer .
Now the obvious end of Strikeforce ’s short heavyweight gallery is further off .
After ripping through Thiago Silva and Rashad Evans in consecutive bouts in 2009 , Machida had already ignited complaints about the inability of other light heavyweights to challenge him before he even defended the UFC title .
His October bout with Mauricio “ Shogun ” Rua vividly showed once again the folly of proclaiming any MMA fighter unbeatable , as Machida ’s unanimous decision victory became the most debated and unpopular decision of the year .
With the Rua rematch slated for May 8 at UFC 113 and a growing number of highly gifted 205 - pound prospects in MMA , Machida ’s road to dominating the light heavyweight division has quickly become a much taller task than previously anticipated .
Since his World Extreme Cagefighting debut in June 2008 , Aldo is 6 - 0 with six stoppages , including four in 2009 alone .
It is little wonder that the hottest thing out of the Amazon jungle was Sherdog.com ’s “ Fighter of the Year ” for 2009 .
However , Aldo ’s brilliant campaign last year leads to a harder road from here on out .
Aldo will be tasked with defending his title against the top featherweight challengers the WEC has to offer , fight in and fight out .
It starts with former champion Urijah Faber at WEC 48 on April 24 in front of a highly partisan Sacramento , Calif. , crowd that will want him to lose and lose badly .
If Aldo is truly set to become MMA ’s first featherweight superstar , we will find out shortly .
With a straightforward and prosaic fighting style , Fitch is not as close to another crack at the UFC welterweight title as he would like to be .
However , the former Purdue University wrestling captain still sports a staggering 12 - 1 record in the UFC , and in one of MMA ’s greatest divisions .
Even if his dream fight is a rematch with Georges St. Pierre , the high - stakes bout for Fitch in the interim will be his rematch with Thiago Alves .
After two previous delays , a fight between the former title challengers is slated for UFC 115 in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , on June 12 , with the winner locking up second fiddle status in the ever - deep welterweight division .
The world has fallen so deeply in love with Jose Aldo that Brown ’s featherweight reign seems like five years ago , not five months ago .
While it will be the man Brown conquered twice in his biggest wins , Urijah Faber , who next challenges Aldo for the 145 - pound throne , Brown will find a home on the same WEC 48 card .
In order to rise back up the ladder for a chance to regain the WEC crown , Brown will have to deal with fellow UFC veteran Manny Gamburyan , who owns a 2 - 0 mark since dropping to the more physically appropriate 145 - pound division .
At UFC 112 in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates , Edgar scored the most significant win of 2010 so far by dethroning lightweight kingpin B.J. Penn and taking the UFC 155 - pound title .
Though it was not exactly a popular decision , Edgar took all three judges ’ scorecards on the back of his aggressive combination punching and stellar movement .
However , the new surprise champion will have to replicate his feat in order to earn unanimous consideration as the sport 's top lightweight , as the wheels are in motion for an August rematch between he and Penn in Boston .
From one controversy to another , Penn lost his UFC lightweight title and MMA 's 155 - pound mantle on April 12 with his shocking upset to Frankie Edgar .
While debate still rages over the bout 's outcome , Penn has started his book tour to promote his eye - opening biography .
The book has drawn the particular ire of UFC boss Dana White for its anecdotes of the Hilo native 's past dealings with the company .
Brouhahas notwithstanding , " The Prodigy " will get his chance for redemption and to regain top status at 155 pounds in August , when he figures to rematch Edgar at UFC 118 in Boston .
There was a time just a few short years ago when Shields was reviled for being one of MMA 's most loathsome fighters to watch .
However , over the last five years , the Cesar Gracie product has transformed from a drab , peripheral contender to one of the sport 's elite .
With his dominant April 17 upset over Dan Henderson , the Strikeforce middleweight champion now boasts a 14 - bout winning streak and top - five credentials in two separate divisions .
The serious question surrounding Shields now is simply whether he will remain a Strikeforce commodity or if his future lies in the Octagon against a deeper roster of competition .
The Challenges of a Full - Pressure Suit in Freefall , although a full - pressure suit is essential for survival at high altitudes , such " space " suits have never been qualified for the kind of controlled freefall that Felix Baumgartner must execute to safely return to Earth from the edge of space .
The challenges include : ?
Restricted mobility : Skydivers are trained to use their bodies to control freefall , making subtle midair positioning adjustments to significantly affect flight .
Control is especially critical at high altitude , where rapid spinning is a potentially lethal possibility .
The pressurized suit makes some physical adjustments difficult and others impossible . ?
Restricted vision :
The helmet that protects Felix 's head also restricts his vision , a challenge that can be exacerbated if the atmospheric conditions , or perspiration , cause fogging or icing .
If Felix can't see , he wo n't be able to launch the jump . ?
Reduced tactile sensation : Felix 's hands must be enclosed in pressurized gloves .
In his full - pressure suit , Felix will find it more difficult not only to see critical components of his equipment -- like parachute handles or tangled lines -- but also to even feel them .
Thanks to its pioneering work in air and space crew protective equipment design , David Clark Company was able to model the Red Bull Stratos full - pressure suit and helmet on suits already in use by pilots of high - altitude reconnaissance aircraft .
However , Felix 's PPA was custom made to his measurements and special modifications , including enhanced flexibility , have been incorporated to accommodate freefall demands .
Felix 's suit will serve as the prototype for next - generation pressure suits .
Mike Todd , the Red Bull Stratos Life Support Engineer , describes Felix 's PPA as " an artificial atmosphere . "
The suit 's exterior is made of a material that is both fire - retardant and an insulator against extreme cold .
Inside , the " bladder " ( which will be filled with gases to provide pressurization before Felix exits the capsule ) , is composed of a selectively permeable material surrounded by link netting .
When the bladder is inflated , it will provide pressure at 3.5 pounds per square inch -- sufficient to prevent the expansion caused by ebullism .
An integrated control valve , the " brain " of the suit , maintains pressure automatically at various altitudes .
The shell of the helmet is molded from composite materials .
Its visor , which is distortion free in the critical vision area , has an integrated heating circuit that must warm it enough to avert fogging and icing , yet not melt it -- a function doubly challenged by ( 1 ) a stratospheric environment that lacks air to draw away heat and ( 2 ) a potentially supersonic freefall that will encounter rapid changes in temperature .
The helmet will also supply Felix with 100 percent oxygen ( from cylinders he 'll wear ) , and it includes a microphone and earphones for communication with the Mission Control Center .
Initial Pressure Suit Findings , " Every time someone jumps a system like this , there 's something to learn , " says Daniel R. McCarter , Program Manager for David Clark Company .
Initial tests conducted in wind tunnels , low - pressure chambers and 25,000 - foot skydives indicate that while it 's important to assess the pressure suit itself , the key to optimizing its functionality lies in seeing how the suit works with the other mission components , including the parachute rig . ?
Low - pressure chamber :
The integrity of the personal life support system was confirmed ; but , like many astronauts and aviators , Felix found the near sensory deprivation of the suit unsettling and had to accustom himself to a feeling of isolation . ?
Wind - tunnel tests :
The team was strongly encouraged to learn that when Felix maneuvered to the streamlined " delta " position he will use in his stratospheric freefall , instability minimized and airflow smoothed , despite the unaccustomed bulk of the suit .
?
25,000 - foot helicopter jumps :
It was found that , due to the suit 's sensory limitations , Felix could n't easily distinguish the handles of his parachutes -- a potentially dangerous situation .
The parachute rig has since been modified to make the handles distinguishable by touch even through the pressure suit fabric , and mirrors have been added to Felix 's gloves to enable him to see his equipment despite restricted vision in the helmet .
" This is why test jumps are so valuable , because you are always discovering new things , " Felix notes .
" On the ground , everything looks cool , but the picture changes when you 're in freefall .
Especially when you 're the one in the pressure suit . "
Red Bull Stratos is a mission to the edge of space .
Pilot Felix Baumgartner will ascend to the stratosphere in an attempt to launch a freefall jump that would see him become the first person to break the speed of sound with the human body .
The data captured by this mission and its team of world - leading scientists promises new standards in aerospace safety , expanding the boundaries of human flight .
An exclusive , all - access documentary about the Red Bull Stratos project is being produced by the BBC together with National Geographic .
A few weeks after the jump in 2010 , the feature - length film , " SPACE DIVE , " will premiere on BBC2 in the UK and National Geographic Channel in the US .
It will be aired across the rest of the world soon after .
" SPACE DIVE , " the 90 - minute documentary about Red Bull Stratos , is being globally licensed and distributed to broadcasters by BBC Worldwide .
David Clark Company has pioneered air and space crew protective equipment design , development and infrastructure since 1941 , with products ranging from anti-G suits to space suits .
David Clark Company 's tradition of providing crew protective equipment for leading - edge , manned aerospace programs continues into the future , as their designers apply their expertise to present and foreseeable needs , particularly in the areas of acceleration and high - altitude protection .

Of all the weak , ill - informed , and misleading pieces written on the “ resolution authority ” – a central tenet of the Dodd bill – by far the most disappointing is the Washington Post editorial in Sunday ’s paper .
I fully appreciate that these are complex issues and I understand that journalists frequently write under great time pressure .
But honestly , if you do n’t know the answer to a question – you should really just call Treasury , the White House or Senator Dodd ’s people .
What even they will tell you , in my experience – if you press them hard enough ( i.e. , do n’t fall for the initial spin ) is that it is incorrect , or at least significantly incomplete and misleading , to say that the Dodd bill will create :
“ an executive - branch resolution process for systemically important firms that is separate from bankruptcy and therefore allows officials to move swiftly to resolve a troubled institution in a crisis . ”
This statement is wrong for a simple reason : the Dodd resolution authority would not help resolve ( i.e. , shut down in an orderly manner ) large cross - border financial firms , because the authority is U.S. and not international ( or cross - border ) .
Do not misunderstand me :
The resolution authority in the bill is a fine idea and worth supporting – it will help create a clear legal framework for the resolution of bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies ( i.e. , it would extent the FDIC - type resolution process , which is far from being a bailout ) .
But the Dodd resolution authority simply will not work for the cross - border megabanks ; this is not my opinion , this is an incontrovertible fact that is true by definition .
A domestic resolution authority does not give you the right to manage the failure process in other countries or across borders – for that you would need an international resolution authority and this is not in the cards now or in the foreseeable future ( and the Dodd bill does not change that fact in the slightest ) .
The Dodd bill has some good pieces , including its domestic resolution authority , but it does not go far enough – and that is the point of the Brown - Kaufman amendment ( mentioned but apparently not at all understood by the Post ) .
Given that the Washington Post still has a large staff of excellent journalists working around the world , they could try asking G20 deputies about this in detail – or even just consult with top regulators in the UK who can lay this all out for them .
And while they are at it , it would be worth writing a story on why there is no G20 - level process to establish a cross - border resolution mechanism – and no likelihood of such a mechanism for the next 20 years .
Or the Post could even talk to the people at the top of the megabanks – just do n’t take their general word at face value regarding claims that the resolution authority will help ; ask them to spell out in detail how it would be applied to the cross - border issues at JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , or Goldman Sachs .
This is not a random topic that has sprung unexpected on editorial writers in the past week .
This issue has been hotly debated in public for at least a year .
How could the Washington Post , of all newspapers , put its name – at this stage in the game – behind such manifestly inaccurate and misleading statements ?
The Post should immediately issue a correction not just on this specific point , but also on their entire editorial position relative to this issue – because once they accept this error ( hard I know , but they will be hearing about this a lot ) , the logic of their existing position crumbles completely .
This is a supplement to the luminosity sequence .
In this comment , I mentioned that I have raised my happiness set point ( among other things ) , and this declaration was met with some interest .
Some of the details are lost to memory , but below , I reconstruct for your analysis what I can of the process .
It contains lots of gooey self - disclosure ; skip if that 's not your thing .
In summary : I decided that I had to and wanted to become happier ; I re-labeled my moods and approached their management accordingly ; and I consistently treated my mood maintenance and its support behaviors ( including discovering new techniques ) as immensely important .
The steps in more detail :
1. I came to understand the necessity of becoming happier .
Being unhappy was not just unpleasant .
It was dangerous : I had a history of suicidal ideation .
This had n't resulted in actual attempts at killing myself , largely because I attached hopes for improvement to concrete external milestones ( various academic progressions ) and therefore imagined myself a magical healing when I got the next diploma ( the next one , the next one . )
Once I noticed I was doing that , it was unsustainable .
If I wanted to live , I had to find a safe emotional place on which to stand .
It had to be my top priority .
This required several sub-projects :
I had to eliminate the baggage that told me it was appropriate or accurate to feel bad most of the time .
I endorse my ability to react emotionally to my environment ; but this should be acute , not chronic .
Reacting emotionally is about feeling worse when things get worse , not feeling bad when things are bad for months or years on end .
( Especially not when feeling bad reduces the ability to make things less bad . )
Further , having a lower set point did not affect my emotional range except to shrink it ; it reduced the possible impact of real grief , and was n't compatible with the " react emotionally " plan .
The low set point also compromised my ability to react emotionally to positive input , because it was attached to a systematic discounting of such positivity .
I had to eliminate the baggage that told me it was not possible to cognitively change my mood .
Moods correspond to thoughts , and while it can be hard to avoid thinking about things , I can decide to think about whatever I want .
A decade of assorted antidepressants had wreaked no discernible change on my affect , which constituted strong evidence that chemicals were not my problem .
And it was easy to see that my mood varied on a small scale with things under my complete or partial control , like sleep , diet , and activity .
It did not seem outrageous that long - term , large - scale interventions could have similar effects on my overall mood .
I had to decide , and act on the decision , that my happiness was important and worth my time and attention .
I had to pay attention , and note what helped and what hurt .
I had to put increasing the helping factors and decreasing the hurting factors at the top of my list whenever it was remotely feasible , and relax my standards around " remote feasibility " to prevent self - sabotage .
And I had to commit to abandoning counterproductive projects or interactions , at least until I 'd developed the stability to deal with the emotions they generated without suffering permanent setbacks .
2 . I re-labeled my moods , so that identifying them in the moment prompted the right actions .
When a given point on the unhappy - happy spectrum - let 's call it " 2 " on a scale of 1 to 10 - was labeled " normal " or " set point " , then when I was feeling " 2 " , I did n't assume that meant anything ; that was the default state .
That left me feeling " 2 " a lot of the time , and when things went wrong , I dipped lower , and I waited for things outside of myself to go right before I went higher .
The problem was that " 2 " was not a good place to be spending most of my time .
I had to label the old set - point as subnormal , a problem state that generated a need for immediate action from me to fix it .
It was like telling myself that , unbeknownst to me , my left foot was in constant pain and needed medicine at once : kind of hard to swallow , given that my left foot always felt pretty much the same unless I 'd just stubbed a toe or received a massage .
But eventually , I attached urgency to the old set point .
It was not just how things were normally ; it was a sign that something was wrong .
I had to make sure that I had many accessible , cheap excuses to cheer up , so I did n't ever fall into the trap of " just this once " leaving myself at a " 2 " state instead of acting .
I designated a favorite pair of socks and wore them whenever I woke up on the wrong side of the bed ; I took up the habit of saving every picture of a cute animal I found on the Internet so I could leaf through the collection whenever I wanted ; I threw myself into developing the skill of making friends on purpose so I 'd have lots and if I happened to log onto my IM client , someone would be there who would talk to me ; I became very acquisitive of inexpensive goods like music and interesting websites .
When one of these interventions failed to work , I forced myself to try something else , rather than falling into the self - talk disaster of " well , that did n't help ; I guess something must really be wrong and I should feel like this until it goes away by itself . "
I also harnessed my tendency to feel better after a night 's sleep - if I felt suboptimal close to bedtime , I 'd turn in early and reasonably expect to wake up improved .
I stopped tolerating the minor injuries to my affect that I identified as most consistent and , therefore , most likely to contribute to my poor set point .
For instance , I noticed that I always slept better when I did n't go to bed expecting to awaken to the sound of an alarm , so I aggressively rearranged my schedule to give me morning leeway , and found alarm software that would wake me more gently when an early start was absolutely necessary .
I identified people with whom interaction was frustrating and draining , and I limited interaction with them both by reducing opportunities to start , and by dropping my standards for abandoning the exchange midway through so I could leave before things got very bad .
I practiced , in general , " writing things off " and rehearsed internal monologues about how I no longer needed to worry about [ thing X ] .
( " I can not control the speed of the bus .
I caught it , and it will get there when it gets there .
There is no point in further fretting about being late until I 'm moving under my own power again - so I 'll stop .
To manage my strong , intrusive desire to be on time , I will start thinking about how to choose an efficient path to walk once I get off the bus . " )
I labeled my new desired set point - a safe spot on the spectrum , call it " 5 " , which was ambitious yet felt attainable - as " normal " .
When asked how I was in this state , I consciously chose to say that I was " fine " or " okay " instead of something more enthusiastic , like " great " , that I might have said before - the energy I felt at " 5 " was no longer to be considered extra .
Similarly , these were not suitable occasions to do displeasing things .
I did n't have happiness to burn at " 5 " - I waited until I was even better before I relaxed my emotional avarice .
Instead , " 5 " was a good place from which to undertake more expensive entertainments that offered net improvement .
( More difficult than choosing a specific pair of socks to wear is starting a D&D game , or walking around and exploring a new location , or working on a piece of artwork or fiction ; the lag time and effort makes them poor " cheer up " activities , but excellent ways to get from " 5 " to " 6 " or " 7 " . )
I made a point of noting non-sadness deficiencies in my status like boredom , hunger , tiredness , or annoyance .
These were n't directly related to the set point I was trying to affect , but they could exacerbate a bad influence or limit the power of a good one .
Additionally , at the level of luminosity I then had to work with , they could also mask moods that were actually sadness , in much the same way that sometimes one can feel hungry when in fact just thirsty .
3 . I treated my own mood as manageable .
Thinking of it as a thing that attacked me with no rhyme or reason - treating a bout of depression like a cold - did n't just cost me the opportunity to fight it , but also made the entire situation seem more out - of - control and hopeless .
I was wary of learned helplessness ; I decided that it would be best to interpret my historically static set point as an indication that I had n't hit on the right techniques yet , not as an indication that it was inviolable and everlasting .
Additionally , the fact that I did n't know how to fix it yet meant that if it was going to be my top priority , I had to treat the value of information as very high ; it was worth experimenting , and I did n't have to wait for surety before I gave something a shot .
Enhanced F Scale for Tornado Damage
An update to the the original F - scale by a team of meteorologists and wind engineers , implemented in the U.S. on 1 February 2007 .
FUJITA SCALE DERIVED EF SCALE OPERATIONAL EF SCALE F Number Fastest 1/4 - mile ( mph ) 3 Second Gust ( mph ) EF Number 3 Second Gust ( mph ) EF Number 3 Second Gust ( mph ) 0 40-72 45-78 0 65-85 0 65-85 1 73-112 79-117 1 86-109 1 86-110 2 113-157 118-161 2 110-137 2 111-135 3 158-207 162-209 3 138-167 3 136-165 4 208-260 210-261 4 168-199 4 166-200 5 261-318 262-317 5 200-234 5 Over 200
*** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ENHANCED F-SCALE WINDS :
The Enhanced F - scale still is a set of wind estimates ( not measurements ) based on damage .
Its uses three - second gusts estimated at the point of damage based on a judgment of 8 levels of damage to the 28 indicators listed below .
These estimates vary with height and exposure .
Important :
The 3 - second gust is not the same wind as in standard surface observations .
Standard measurements are taken by weather stations in open exposures , using a directly measured , " one- minute mile " speed .
New York assemblyman Richard Brodsky is trying to pass a law that will change the way we indicate whether we want to donate our organs or not .
Right now , we check a box if we want to become organ donors — if Brodsky gets his way , we'd have to check a box if we do n't want to donate our organs .
This reminds me of a recent conversation I had with neuroscientist Read Montague , who uses multiple synchronized fMRIs to study social interactions and decision - making , i.e. how people make choices based on how choices are made available and what other people are doing .
Here 's a snippet from an interview I did with him in Oxford a couple of weeks ago :
When you have a driver 's license , you can often designate whether you want to be an organ donor , so if you 're lying dead on the highway or a vegetable in the hospital they can decide to harvest your organs .
When organ donations are a check box on a form where you opt into it , the rates of opting in are 25 - 30 % .
There 's an asymmetry here .
If you start where the default is to opt out , then the organ donor percentage is 85 - 90 % .
We 're not sure why , but it 's completely different .
It 's opting in versus opting out ; in - group out - group distinctions .
Should laws push for organ donation ?

Remember , Joe Biden happens to be the greatest defense of the status quo , because his administration created Obamacare .
Second , I did n't hear anything that made me feel that the banks , long - time punching bags of the Democratic party , did n't even merit a whisper .
No wonder that group just ignited with Discover , the credit card company , and the one - time pinata , Goldman Sachs , leading the way .
Having a machine watch you while you sleep may seem a bit creepy , but it might be the best way to help you get the Zzzz you need .
Massachusetts based Zeo , Inc is selling a system that monitors brain activity while you rest and then gives you detailed information about how the night went for you .
The Zeo Personal Sleep Coach uses a headband ( measuring brain activity through skin surface electrical signals ) and a bedside monitor that looks like an alarm clock to track how long you spent in REM , light , and deep sleep .
The system allows you to critique your sleep habits and even gives you a score ( called your “ ZQ ” ) rating how you slept .
Zeo PSG comes with online analytical tools to help you further decide the best way to improve your rest .
Best of all , the Zeo bedside monitor can wake you up at the time that coincides with your natural cycle , hopefully avoiding that groggy morning feeling .
Price tag starts at $ 250 , with extra online coaching available at $ 8 per month ( or $ 80 / year or $ 100 lifetime service ) .
It ’s a pretty neat device , and another example of how continuous health monitoring will improve the way we live in the future .
Check out the promotional video from Zeo below .
Health monitoring has started to come into its own in recent years .
Toumaz Technologies and WIN both have wearable vital sign monitoring devices that transmit information wirelessly .
GE is even developing a portable ultrasound machine the size of a mobile phone .
These tools will allow individuals to personally track their own health 24/7/365 .
That information feed will help us detect serious illnesses before they happen as well as fine tune our bodies day to day .
The Zeo PSG is unique among these devices by focusing on our sleep .
Of course , I ’m pretty sure most of us already know when we have n’t gotten a good night ’s rest , and I ’m not sure the sleep journals , ZQ scores , and guided coaching it offers can actually improve your sleep once you realize how bad it is .
Still , the more information you have at your disposal the more likely you will be to pinpoint those things you can change to help you snooze better .
The most promising feature I can see in this system is the SmartWake application – the program that improves upon a traditional clock alarm by waking you up when you ’re out of deep sleep .
I ’d like to see more technology like this .
Maybe a system that generates white noise when it detects ambient sounds that might make you lose deep sleep .
Or a program that plays interesting sounds and lights while you ’re in REM to affect your dreams .
No matter how Zeo improves upon its system , it ’s going to serve as another data feed we can use to guide our health habits .
Hopefully the future will see all these different health monitoring devices combined into one super monitor that tracks all the pertinent medical data at once .
That sort of diagnostic tool will help convert our bodies from mysteries into free floating sources of digital information .
When that happens , expect doctors ( or implants , or computer programs ) to guide your health in real time .
Yep , with all this data to analyze the future ’s going to be awful busy .
Better make sure to get some sleep .

The theory of gravity proposed by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago can explain the dance of galaxies around one another just as well as it can model the motion of planets around the sun , according to a new study .
The finding suggests that the invisible substance called dark matter and the even more mysterious force known as dark energy are not just figments of physicists ' imaginations .
For centuries Isaac Newton 's law of universal gravitation worked well enough to explain gravity on Earth .
But astronomers eventually saw discrepancies in the way larger objects such as planets interacted .
Einstein 's general theory of relativity , published in 1916 , proposed that gravity works on large scales because matter warps the fabric of space and time , also known as space - time .
( See " Einstein and Beyond " in National Geographic magazine . )
This notion has been used to successfully explain phenomena in our solar system , such as the slight alterations in Mercury 's orbit around the sun , which Newton 's gravity could n't account for .
The existence of dark matter and dark energy is based on the assumption that Einstein 's gravity is affecting galaxies billions of light - years from Earth in the same way that it affects objects in our solar system .
Based on general relativity , for example , scientists think dark matter exists because some cosmic objects behave as if they have more mass than we can see .
But until now , tests of general relativity on galactic scales have been inconclusive .
Einstein's Gravity and Galaxy Clusters
For the new study , appearing this week in the journal Nature , astrophysicist Reinabelle Reyes and colleagues looked at data gathered from more than 70,000 bright , elliptical galaxies .
The team found that the galaxies , located up to 3.5 billion light - years from Earth , are clustered together in precisely the way that general relativity predicts .
" From the galaxies ' positions , we can tell how clustered they are .
That gives us information about how gravity acts , because that 's what gravity does — it pulls things together , " said Reyes , of Princeton University in New Jersey .
By combining measurements of the galaxies ' clustering with other properties — such as the galaxies ' movements relative to one another and the way they bend each other 's light —
Reyes 's team calculated EG , a quantity physicists use when looking at objects ' expected interactions .
General relativity predicts that EG should be around 0.4 .
The value of EG measured in the study was 0.39 .
Still Greater Distances to Probe
The new findings validate the current popular model of cosmology , said David Spergel , a theoretical astrophysicist also at Princeton .
" It looks like things are okay , " Spergel said .
" It would have been more exciting if they saw deviations [ from general relativity ] , but their results are important as well . "
The study authors also note that their work casts serious doubt on some alternative theories of gravity , such as tensor - vector - scalar gravity , or TeVeS , which attempts to explain how gravity might work differently on large cosmic scales .
TeVeS predicts that EG should be around 0.22 — much lower than the observed value .
It 's still possible , however , that TeVeS takes over at even larger distances not yet explored .
" There 's always a possibility that things are breaking down where you have n't probed yet , " Spergel said .
NASA 's recently launched Solar Dynamics Observatory , or SDO , is returning early images that confirm an unprecedented new capability for scientists to better understand our sun 's dynamic processes .
These solar activities affect everything on Earth .
Some of the images from the spacecraft show never - before - seen detail of material streaming outward and away from sunspots .
Others show extreme close - ups of activity on the sun 's surface .
The spacecraft also has made the first high - resolution measurements of solar flares in a broad range of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths .
" These initial images show a dynamic sun that I had never seen in more than 40 years of solar research , " said Richard Fisher , director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" SDO will change our understanding of the sun and its processes , which affect our lives and society .
This mission will have a huge impact on science , similar to the impact of the Hubble Space Telescope on modern astrophysics . "
Launched on Feb. 11 , 2010 , SDO is the most advanced spacecraft ever designed to study the sun .
During its five - year mission , it will examine the sun 's magnetic field and also provide a better understanding of the role the sun plays in Earth 's atmospheric chemistry and climate .
Since launch , engineers have been conducting testing and verification of the spacecraft 's components .
Now fully operational , SDO will provide images with clarity 10 times better than high - definition television and will return more comprehensive science data faster than any other solar observing spacecraft .
SDO will determine how the sun 's magnetic field is generated , structured and converted into violent solar events such as turbulent solar wind , solar flares and coronal mass ejections .
These immense clouds of material , when directed toward Earth , can cause large magnetic storms in our planet 's magnetosphere and upper atmosphere .
SDO will provide critical data that will improve the ability to predict these space weather events .
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , built , operates and manages the SDO spacecraft for the agency 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .

" I 'm so proud of our brilliant work force at Goddard , which is rewriting science textbooks once again . " said Sen. Barbara Mikulski , D - Md. , chairwoman of the Commerce , Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee that funds NASA .
" This time Goddard is shedding new light on our closest star , the sun , discovering new information about powerful solar flares that affect us here on Earth by damaging communication satellites and temporarily knocking out power grids .
Better data means more accurate solar storm warnings . "
Space weather has been recognized as a cause of technological problems since the invention of the telegraph in the 19th century .
These events produce disturbances in electromagnetic fields on Earth that can induce extreme currents in wires , disrupting power lines and causing widespread blackouts .
These solar storms can interfere with communications between ground controllers , satellites and airplane pilots flying near Earth 's poles .
Radio noise from the storm also can disrupt cell phone service .
SDO will send 1.5 terabytes of data back to Earth each day , which is equivalent to a daily download of half a million songs onto an MP3 player .
The observatory carries three state - of the - art instruments for conducting solar research .
The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager maps solar magnetic fields and looks beneath the sun 's opaque surface .
The experiment will decipher the physics of the sun 's activity , taking pictures in several very narrow bands of visible light .
Scientists will be able to make ultrasound images of the sun and study active regions in a way similar to watching sand shift in a desert dune .
The instrument 's principal investigator is Phil Scherrer of Stanford University .
HMI was built by a collaboration of Stanford University and the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory in Palo Alto , Calif .
The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly is a group of four telescopes designed to photograph the sun 's surface and atmosphere .
The instrument covers 10 different wavelength bands , or colors , selected to reveal key aspects of solar activity .
These types of images will show details never seen before by scientists .
The principal investigator is Alan Title of the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory , which built the instrument .
The Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment measures fluctuations in the sun 's radiant emissions .
These emissions have a direct and powerful effect on Earth 's upper atmosphere -- heating it , puffing it up , and breaking apart atoms and molecules .
Researchers do n't know how fast the sun can vary at many of these wavelengths , so they expect to make discoveries about flare events .
The principal investigator is Tom Woods of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado , Boulder .
LASP built the instrument .
" These amazing images , which show our dynamic sun in a new level of detail , are only the beginning of SDO 's contribution to our understanding of the sun , " said SDO Project Scientist Dean Pesnell of Goddard .
SDO is the first mission of NASA 's Living with a Star Program , or LWS , and the crown jewel in a fleet of NASA missions that study our sun and space environment .
The goal of LWS is to develop the scientific understanding necessary to address those aspects of the connected sun-Earth system that directly affect our lives and society .
Reddit Online Community Helps Family Bring Long -Lost Music to Life
Matt L'Italien 's grandparents had written two love songs , but years after their deaths , no one in the family could perform the music .
So he took his plea to Reddit.com , where he was overwhelmed by the kindness of strangers .
You will be too -- check out this amazing story and the beautiful renditions of his grandparents ' songs .
Matt L’Italien ’s grandparents , David Rosenthal , a psychologist , and Marcia Kensinger Rosenthal , a nurse , married in 1950 , and were deeply in love throughout their lives , even though the odds were stacked against them .
“ My grandfather was Jewish and she was not , so it made things pretty difficult for them to get together , ” L’Italien , a 21 - year - old college student from Boston , told Gimundo .
David Rosenthal died of Alzheimer ’s disease in 1996 , after 46 years of marriage .
L’Italien never knew him , but remembers his grandmother as “ a phenomenal woman . ”
When he was eight years old , she developed Alzheimer ’s as well , and passed away several years later .
But recently , his aunt , Amy Rosenthal , came across a few remarkable , long - lost pieces of the couple ’s history .
The family was thrilled when she discovered an old love letter between the pair , which had been stuck for years on top of a chest of drawers .
“ It was amazingly adorable , ” says L’Italien .
Along with it , Rosenthal found two more love letters , of sorts : the carefully preserved piano and lyrics sheet music for two songs that they had written together decades ago , entitled “ In and Out of Love ” and “ I ’ll Never Regret ( Loving You ) . ”
L’Italien ’s grandparents had played music as a hobby for many years , but had never recorded any of their music , to his knowledge .
His family members longed to hear the songs performed , but none of them were able to play piano well enough to do them justice .
So L’Italien had an idea .
He often frequents Reddit.com , a large online community where “ Redditors ” can converse , share links , and ask for and provide help to one another .
His college roommate , who also uses the site , had recently received $ 100 from an anonymous stranger on Reddit , who simply asked him to pay it forward in some way .
“ Reddit really is a place of benevolence , ” he says .
“ They actively want to help their fellow man . ”
So L’Italien knew it was the perfect place to find someone to help fulfill his family ’s wish .
On April 11th , he created a post on the site : “ My family recently found two songs on sheet music written by my late grandparents .
Would anyone like to play them for us , so that we may hear them ? ” he wrote in the thread ’s subject line , including scanned copies of the two pieces of music in the body .
Then he sat back and waited for a response .
L’Italien had expected that a couple of amateur musicians might take an interest in his plea for help , but the response he received was beyond his wildest dreams .
“ Within a couple of hours , it was number one on the site , ” he says .
The post has since received over 3,700 upvotes , and 900 comments — and in the space of hours , amateur and professional musicians alike had already begun to share links to their renditions of the songs .
At least a dozen have been posted to date : some are instrumental , some are vocals - only , others include both .
One musician converted one of the songs to a guitar performance , and posted his tablatures so that other guitarists could play along .
Some of the site ’s community members have even collaborated , building a vocal performance on top of another Redditor ’s piano recording .
For L’Italien , who was just a child when Alzheimer ’s disease robbed his grandmother of her memories , these strangers ’ renditions of her songs have brought her back to life in some small way .
“ It was really sad to have my last memories be of her in such a debilitated state , ” he says .
“ I ’m really happy that I can look back at this music she produced and really bring back that element of character and wit and brilliance that she had . ”
After receiving such an outpouring of support and assistance from the Reddit community , L’Italien sent an email to his mother and aunt , sharing some of the comments and videos he ’d received .
“ They do n’t really understand how many people took this up , but they ’re incredibly grateful to hear the music that their mother played , ” he says .
“ My aunt who had the sheet music , it ’s her birthday , and she said it was the best birthday she could ever imagine . ”
Here ’s a sampling of the wonderful recordings created by Redditors .
( CNN ) --
He never told a lie , as the story goes .
So maybe if he were alive today , President George Washington could tell a New York City library what he did with two books he checked out 221 years ago .
The two books -- weighty discourses on international relations and parliamentary debates -- were checked out on October 5 , 1789 .
They were due on November 2 , 1789 , but were n't brought back .
Since then , they 've been steadily collecting a fine of a few cents each day , adding up to more than $ 4,000 by the New York Society Library 's informal estimate .
" I 'm sorry , math is not my thing at all , " said Jane Goldstein , the assistant head librarian when asked to hazard a guess .
The fine at the time was 2 pence a day .
Now , it 's 15 cents -- " It 's really gone up , has n't it ? " she quipped .
One of the librarians , Matthew Haugen , guessed the fine to be in the region of 3,000 British pounds , or about $ 4,577 .
" He stuck with the pence concept , " Goldstein said .
The library first learned of the missing books when it discovered a yellowed ledger in its basement
It listed all the people who had checked out books from the city 's oldest library between July 1789 and April 1792 .
Next to the works " Law of Nations " and the 12th volume of " Common Debates " was the name of the person who checked them out : " President . "
At the time , New York was the capital of the United States , and the library was the only one in town .
Soon after , the capital was relocated to Philadelphia and then Washington D.C .
The New York library , a subscription library that was New York 's first library open to the public , has known about the missing books since the 1930s .
The matter came up again recently because the library is capturing the ledgers in digital form to preserve the records .
Library officials cross-checked the books mentioned in the ledger with the ones in their collection .
" Volume 12 ( of " Common Debates " ) was still missing , " as was the other book , Goldstein said .
The library is not so concerned about the fine as it is about each book .
" We do n't know where it is , " she said .
" We have tried to find it and we can 't , " she said .
When the Army Uses “ Enhanced Interrogation ” on an American Soldier
I had been covering veterans ’ issues for several years and thought I ’d developed a thick skin .
But the pain on the other end of the telephone line was difficult to stomach .
Sergeant Chuck Luther , now back from Iraq , was describing his journey to hell and back .
The worst part , he said , was n’t battling insurgents or even the mortar blast that tossed him to the ground and slammed his head against the concrete — it was the way he was treated by the U.S.
Army when he went to the aid station and sought medical help .
In gruesome detail , Luther described what happened to him at Camp Taji ’s aid station .
He thought he would receive medical care .
Instead he was confined to an isolation chamber and held there for over a month , under enforced sleep deprivation , until he agreed to sign papers saying that he was ill before coming to Iraq and thus not eligible for disability and medical benefits .
“ They wanted me to say I had a ‘ personality disorder , ' ” Luther told me .
Luther ’s call did not come out of the blue .
For two years I had been investigating this personality disorder scandal : how military doctors were purposely misdiagnosing soldiers , wounded in combat , as having this pre-existing mental illness .
As in the civilian world , where people can be locked out of the insurance system if they have a pre-existing condition , soldiers whose wounds can be attributed to a pre-existing illness can be denied disability benefits and long - term medical care .
My reporting began with the case of Specialist Jon Town , who was wounded in Iraq , won a Purple Heart and was then denied disability and medical benefits .
Town ’s doctor had concluded that his headaches and hearing loss were not caused by the 107 - millimeter rocket that knocked him unconscious but by a pre-existing personality disorder .
The spotlight on Town prompted military doctors to step forward and talk about being pressured by their superiors to purposely misdiagnose wounded soldiers .
One doctor spoke of a soldier who returned from Iraq with a massive chunk missing from his right leg .
The doctor quit after he was pressured to diagnose that soldier as having personality disorder .
Since 2001 more than 22,600 soldiers have been discharged with personality disorder ( PD ) , saving the military billions in disability and medical benefits .
My articles on the scandal sparked a Congressional hearing , a Law and Order episode , and before leaving office , President Bush signed a law requiring the Pentagon to investigate PD discharges .
In the wake of those developments , I was flooded with calls from soldiers who had fractured bones and been pierced by grenade shrapnel , only to be told that their wounds came from a problem with their personality — a pre-existing illness that had somehow gone undetected with each military screening and only popped up now , after they returned wounded from combat .
Luther was one of thousands severely wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan now facing a lifetime without medical care .
I had spoken to dozens of soldiers in his shoes .
But his call haunted me .
He sent me photos of the isolation chamber .
It was the size of a walk - in closet and was crammed with cardboard boxes , a desk and a bedpan .
Armed guards monitored him 24 hours a day .
Luther told me how they stopped him from sleeping , keeping the lights on and blasting heavy metal music at him all through the night : Megadeth , Saliva , Disturbed .
When he rebelled , Luther was pinned down and injected with sleeping medication .
“ This was an aid station , ” he said , “ but it felt a lot more like enhanced interrogation than medical care . ”
After a month , Luther was willing to sign anything — and did .
Soon after he signed his name to a personality disorder discharge , he was whisked back to Fort Hood and informed about a PD discharge ’s disastrous consequences .
No disability pay , no long - term medical care , and because he did n’t serve out his contract , he ’d have to pay back a portion of his signing bonus .
“ They told me I now owed the Army $ 1,500 . ”
I would spend the next two years investigating Luther ’s case : reading the stacks of medical records written by Luther ’s doctors , which document his confinement ; talking with a fellow soldier who visited Luther during his month in the aid station ; and interviewing his commander , who confirmed all the details .
In case you were wondering what he's up to , Samuel Joesph Wurzelbacher , aka " Joe the Plumber , " is teaming up with Tea Party Express , to endorse Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle in Nevada .
Wurzelbacher recorded this video , which was unveiled at a TPE press conference this morning in New Orleans ( Wurzelbacher was not present ) :
Wurzelbacher has previously spoken on stage at several TPE rallies , where the bus tours have stopped .

For the first time in Russian history , Andrzej Wajda‘s [ ENG ] “ Katy ń ” ( 2007 ) has been aired on Russian public television channel “ Kultura ” [ ENG ] provoking online discussions on Stalin regime , historical truth , humanism and Russian - Poland relations .
The Katyn massacre [ ENG ] , a deliberate execution of almost 22,000 Polish officers by the Russian NKVD officers [ ENG ] in 1940 remains the main unresolved historical issue between contemporary Russia and Poland .
Throughout almost 50 years official Soviet propaganda said that Katyn had been a Nazi war crime until in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev recognized the NKVD murders .
Russian government 's position on the issue was far from straightforward since that .
In 1990 , the Russian Prosecutor 's Office started investigation of the horrible incident .
In 1992 , Russian president Boris Yeltsin shared a part of the secret archives containing evidence of the NKVD executions .
But in 2004 ( already under Putin ) , the case was closed due to the death of the guilty ( executors ) .
Polish officers shot in Katyn along with thousands of Soviet political prisoners were neither rehabilitated nor recognized as repressed .
While in Poland Katyn massacre became one of the new nation - building symbols of martyrdom , there 's no common view on the issue in the Russian society as there 's a group of historians promoting Soviet point of view [ ENG ] backed up by communist party together with some veterans of NKVD .
The Soviet version is still transmitted in popular newspaper like “ Pravda , ” [ RUS ] and by some popular bloggers like Russian intellectual Anatoliy Wasserman .
Followed by a serious worsening of relations between the two countries in 2005 - 2007 ( Meat trade dispute [ ENG ] , Missile dispute , etc. ) , things started to change in 2007 .
The prime - ministers of Poland and Russia launched the Commission on Difficult Issues [ RUS ] , which mission was to settle down a large number of historical issues between the countries .
The Katyn massacre stood as a central point of the debate .
Most experts agree [ RUS ] that the appearance of “ Katyń ” on Russian public TV was due to the work of the commission and upcoming commemoration of the Katyń massacre .
“ Katy ń ” was aired during Friday prime - time ( 19:40 – 21:30 ) with the discussion after the show .
It was claimed that the Channel One ( Russian leading TV channel ) simultaneously Oscar - winning “ Hurt Locker ” on purpose but that turned out to be inaccurate ( “ Katyn ” ended at 21:30 , while “ Hurt Locker ” began at this very time ) .
Interesting feature of the TV - discussion that followed the movie was that none of the Polish representatives was invited .
The online discussion of the movie gathered more than 2100 blog posts [ RUS ] and became # 5 topic in the Yandex discussion rating .
Bloggers were divided in their opinions .
Some completely denied the version of NKVD murders ( claimed to be the Goebbels ’ version as the Nazis were the first to announce Katyn massacres ) .
Among those who recognized the NKVD murders , opinions were n't uniform either .
Despite some bloggers ’ claims “ Katy ń ” was “ market - oriented , ” “ Anti- soviet on purpose , ” “ too outlined , ” “ made to order , ” the majority of Runetizens said they were deeply touched by the movie .
Most bloggers denounced the myth of the movie 's hidden russophobia ( anti-russian sentiment ) .
kir_mgd , for example , wrote :
Я , честно говоря , не воспринял фильм как русофобский хоть в какой - то мере .
Что -то там действительно трафаретно и прямолинейн о( флаг на портянки ) , но не примитивно и злопамятно .
Впечатление очень сильное производит .
For me , frankly speaking , this film did n't seem russophobic at all .
Something was a cliche and way too straightforward ( tearing flag for socks ) , but not primitive or rancorous .
I 'm under very strong impression .
Moderator of the ru_katyn community dassie2001 wrote :
Никто другой в Польше не сделал бы НЕантироссийского ( НЕрусофобского ) фильма на тему Катыни .
Вайде – удалос ь
Nobody else in Poland could make no-antirussian ( non-russophobic ) movie on the Katyn topic .
But Wajda managed to do that .
One of the main current of those discussions was the search for the reason of the mass murders .
“ Usual ” ( in this kind of discussions ) versions like “ strategic necessity , ” “ revenge for 16,000 - 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war who died in the Polish camps after Soviet - Polish war “ [ ENG ] and others were offered .
LJ user Yasko repeated deputy Kosachev 's explanation [ ENG ] of the massacre in terms of the essential blood - lust of the faceless totalitarian regime :
Совершенно гениально пан Вайда показал нам , что это работала именно машина уничтожения людей .
А то , что эта машина – порождение именно западной мысли , западной цивилизации , это тема выходящая уже за пределы темы Катыни , в том ей масштабе , в котором надо было её сегодня раскрыть , что А. Вайда и сделал .
Mr.Wajda absolutely ingeniously showed us that it was a human - killing machine .
And the thing is that this machine is a child of the Western thought , Western civilization – this topic is much broader than the topic of Katyn in the given scale it should be revealed today .
And this is what Wajda did .
Not everyone accepted the notion of faceless machine .
LJ user Maxilla_k wrote :
Однако , хватит врать , автор у этой “ машины ” безусловно есть , и он в фильме показан .
“ Эффективный менедже р ” смотрит со стены в сцене приговора “ тройк и ” генералу польских войск .
Зачем он то делал , – не знаю .
However , let 's stop lying , there 's a definite author of this “ machine ” and he 's shown in the movie .
“ The Effective Manager ” [ a reference to Stalin 's description in the new Russian teacher 's manual – GVO ] looks from the wall in the episode of the verdict given by “ troika ” to the Polish general .
Why did he do that – I do n't know .
The humanism topic was raised by popular movie critic kinanet :
Подлинная опасность лент ы Вайды , которой испугались в нынешне й
России многие перестраховщики , заключается как раз в человеческом измерении политической трагедии , не заканчивающейся выяснением всех обстоятельств случившегося в Катыньском лесу .
…
Мы ж привыкли поклоняться лживым кумирам , фальшивым идеалам , а главное – любить не отеческие гробы , а могилы вождей и их прихлебателей на Красной площади .
И потому пребываем в тоске по прежнему величию , которое тоже было дутым , поскольку имело своей основой кровь и насилие .
Так люди ли мы , человеки ли ?
The true danger of Wajda 's movies , which frightened contemporary Russian overcautious politics , is in the human dimension of the political tragedy , which does n't end with the investigation of all circumstances in the Katyn forest .
…
We got used to worshiping false idols , false ideals , and most importantly – to love not fathers ’ graves but the tombs of leaders and their spongers at the Red Square .
And this is why we miss the former grandeur , which was overrated , because it 's basement was built on blood and violence .
So are we humans ?
It seems that the movie had an effect .
After viewing it , Yelena Tokareva , editor - in - chief of the tabloid “ Stringer , ” publicly said she was [ RUS ] sorry for the negative reviews that were published in her magazine .
The effect was especially significant for those Russians who were not aware of the issue .
If not in a historical but at least in a moral way .
As eli_prophet put it :
Я был приятно обрадован тем , что хоть и спустя 3 года после выхода , хоть бы и не по самому центральному каналу , но этот фильм был показан на государственном телеканале в пятницу ( и не простую , а страстную пятницу ) , в самый прайм - тайм .
Это не огромный шаг , но шаг достойный уважения .
И мне кажется важным , чтобы как можно больше людей в нашей стране получили возможность посмотреть на событи я
Второй мировой войны другими глазами , с другого ракурса .
I was quite pleased that even after three years after the official release , even if not on a very popular channel , it was showed on the public TV on Friday ( and not every Friday but Easter Friday ) during prime - time .
This is n't a huge step , but a step worth of respect .
And it seems important to me that as many people in our country would have a possibility to look at the events of the World War II with the naked eye , from a new angle .
A Well - Informed Populace Is Vital To The Operation Of A Democracy
Noam Chomsky

If America is to have any hope of one day becoming a true democracy , its populace must be better informed .
And if this is to happen , the media must do their part by providing citizens with a more balanced , carefully considered view of the issues .
It is a misguided notion that the populace is too busy watching football and soap operas to care about matters of true import , or that the apparent complacency of the citizenry stems from simple apathy .
Many Americans read newspapers .
And most of these readers are interested in the front page , as well as the sports page .
But a complex web of corporate interests , along with a trend toward fewer companies owning more communications holdings , contributes to a narrowing of views expressed in the papers of record .
If GE owns NBC , and GE stands to make a huge profit from the sale of war machines , can we count on unbiased coverage of a U.S. war from NBC ?
Of course not .
But it is just such unbiased coverage that we desperately need if we as citizens are to enjoy a true democracy .

Those who trumpet the supremacy of democracy forget that it is merely one of many systems that govern the decisions affecting our lives .
Capitalism , our economic system , exerts an equally profound influence , perhaps greater .
What stricter , more hierarchical system exists than the modern corporation ?
No medieval fiefdom of serfs and lords could match the modern corporation in its rigorous control of the populace .
And though the people sometimes stay quiet , the corporations never do .
They hire lobbyists , fresh from government service , to find the ears of policymakers .
To counter the overbearing influence of corporations , the populace must engage in a vigilant fight with itself to remain educated and vocal .
But they cannot do it alone :
The media bear a heavy responsibility to make the interests of the people — not parent companies such as GE — their priority when making decisions regarding coverage .

An unenlightened democracy , ignored by an ill - informed populace grazing blindly in corporate pastures , is a democracy in name only .
Dixie Chicks Fever Sweeps America !

Move over , Shania , country 's got a new queen .
Make that three .
Their names are Emily Erwin , Natalie Maines and Martie Seidel , but to millions of rabidly devoted fans across America , they 're the blonde and bodacious trio known as the Dixie Chicks .
Tearing it in up in three - part harmony with their own special , no -holds - barred brand of country , the sexy Chicks just might be Nashville 's answer to The Spice Girls .
But unlike the British bod squad , the Dixie Chicks are definitely still flying high .

What ?
You say you have n't caught Dixie Chicks fever yet ?
Well , you 're in rapidly dwindling company .
Because with seven million copies of their debut album Wide Open Spaces sold to date , the Chicks are hotter than Natalie 's granddaddy 's famous barbecued ribs .
What 's more , the Chicks ' first three singles off Spaces all quickly soared into the country Top 10 , earning them the distinction of best - selling country group of 1998 .
Not bad for a group that played its first show on a Dallas street corner for spare change .

Even music lovers who 've never followed the country scene are lining up to catch the sultry Texas trio in concert .
Not your average Southern set , this sass - spiked , tradition - busting threesome has tossed aside the usual country rhinestones and is wowing crowds across America with a sleek and sophisticated style that 's all glitz — and all Chicks .
But lest you think the Chicks are just a bunch of pretty faces , rest assured :
These gals sound every bit as good as they look .
The strong vocal stylings of Maines , front and center on such platinum chart - toppers as " I Can Love You Better " and " There 's Your Trouble " are electrifying when paired with the spirited performances of Erwin and Seidel on fiddle , guitar , mandolin , dobro—even banjo .
Longtime D.C. fans and new converts alike can't help but be swept away by the group 's unique blend of country , honky - tonk , blues and folk .

It 's been nearly 10 years since its debut on that street corner in Dallas , but America 's newest country sensation is still going strong , consistently delivering hits packed with sweetness and attitude .
And with two CMA Awards — Group Of The Year and the Horizon Award for best new country talent — already under their collective belt , one thing 's for sure :
The Dixie Chicks wo n't be playing for spare change again anytime soon .
On the morning of Saturday , April 10th , Polish President Lech Kaczynski , his wife Maria , and 94 other members of Poland 's government and clergy were on a flight to Russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre .
Their airplane , a Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154 M , crashed in apparently heavy fog , clipping an antenna and breaking apart in a forest less than a mile from the airfield , killing all passengers and crew .
Although observances took place around the world over the weekend , Poland today begins an official week - long period of mourning for the victims .
President Lech Kaczynski will be buried alongside his wife on Saturday , according to Polish state television .

Neal Stephenson , Greg Bear and several very talented friends ( including one of the neatest hackers I know and somene whom I 'm reliably assured could lay claim to the title of " World 's Greatest Swordsman " ) have announced their new project : an online interactive fiction thinggum called The Mongoliad .
The Mongoliad will consist of a series of linked stories written by different writers , a Wikipedia - style concordance , and " an ongoing stream of nontextual , para - narrative , and extra-narrative stuff which we think brings the story to life in ways that are pleasingly unique , and which can't be done in any single medium . "
What 's more , you , the reader , will be explicitly encouraged to improve and extend the Mongoliad canon with your own fiction and supplementary fan media .
There have been a few very good shared worlds online , from the venerable alt.cyberpunk.chatsubo to the contemporary Shadow Unit .
But it really looks like the Mongoliad folks are looking to push the boat out here , taking things further than anyone before , and doing so in a way that is inherently web - like , impossible to translate to paper .
I saw a demo of the Mongoliad over dinner the other night and it was some very exciting media .
There 's not much for public consumption as yet , but I 'll keep you updated .

In situations like these , the details are what matter .
Consider the following :
Hutton was found to be twice the legal limit for blood alcohol content
The police pulled him over while he was driving the car
Upon laying down the law , the judge in question said , " " The vehicle is not even capable of doing the speed of a mobility scooter and could be outrun by a pedestrian "
Hutton on the subject : " Originally , it was a pink Barbie car .
I put larger wheels on it , but it 's not fast . "
He has also admitted to being " a complete twit "
The car , naturally , was pink ; Hutton had been working on it as part of a project with one of his sons
The car was impounded by the police , but Hutton wants it back .
Good man , Paul Hutton .
Good man .
I mean , really , who has n't been there ?

Editor 's note : Eddie S. Glaude is the chair of the Center for African - American Studies and the William S. Tod Professor of Religion and African - American Studies at Princeton University .
Princeton , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
All around the world this weekend , Christians are celebrating Easter .
For them , this holiest of days announces that death does not have the final word and that eternal life awaits those who would just believe .
Sunday also marks the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s death .
Forty - two years ago , an assassin 's bullet took his life as he struggled to secure the promises of American democracy for the children of slaves .
His sacrifice , along with countless others , helped usher in a new chapter in American life -- one that prepared the way for the election of our nation 's first African - American president .
Every now and again , the convergence of significant historical moments occasions a time for serious reflection .
How might we think about the significance of the resurrection of Jesus and the martyrdom of Martin Luther King , Jr. to the lives we currently live as Americans ?
What lessons does Easter hold for us ?
And what does remembering King 's death teach us ?
On April 27 , 1957 , Dr. King delivered an Easter sermon titled , " Questions that Easter Answers . "
For him , Easter settled the mystery of death and secured for us the importance of living a life in light of those forces that go beyond our physical experience .
We are not simply biological processes .
Instead , King argued , Easter cries out to us about the importance of the unseen and of the personality , those " spiritual forces that are eternal and not merely these material things that we look about and see . "
We matter .
Our hopes and aspirations , our joys and triumphs matter .
Not because of something we have actually done , but rather , because of an inheritance borne on a cross on Calvary .
King understood Easter 's answer to the significance of human action in the world .
" There is a faith , there is love , there is hope , there is something beyond the external that will stand through the ages . "
This view holds off the notion that life has no meaning or is doomed to end in shipwreck .
The fact that so many have lost their jobs , their homes , their dreams in these difficult times confirms for us that life carries with it a ' Good Friday ' experience -- that darkness and disappointment can be constant companions .
" But thank God the crucifixion was not the last act in that great and powerful drama , " King preached .
" There is another act .
And it is something that we sing out and cry and ring out today .
Thank God a day came when Good Friday had to pass . "
For King , Easter teaches us that death does not have the last word ; that invisible forces are more real than the shadows that we currently inhabit ; and that the darkness of Good Friday may be necessary but will eventually pass away .
Easter ultimately demonstrates that " love is the most powerful force in the universe , " said King .
And this insight reaches beyond Christians to all of us , no matter what we believe .
Here , love is n't some sentimental notion ; instead , it involves risks , daring and growth -- a surrender to that feature of human personality that can cause us to sacrifice our lives in defense of it .
Love conquers cowardice .
It shatters hubris and crushes the illusions of death .
It fortifies the soul amid the darkness of the hour ; it calls us to bear witness and to suffer , if necessary , the consequences .
The mindless chatter of today distracts us from the power of love .
Instead , we are mired in the sundry politics of Washington , or we are content to spew venom at our opponents .
Mean - spiritedness carries the day .
But Easter , if I understand King correctly , teaches us to love and to witness the miracle of the resurrection before the powers that be , no matter the consequences .
" It says to us , " King preached , " that love is the most durable power in the world " and is stronger " than all of the military giants , all of the nations that base their way on military power . "
Such a conviction led him on April 4 , 1967 , a year before he was killed , to condemn the Vietnam War and to say that America was " the greatest purveyor of violence in the world . "
The fact that Easter falls this year on the anniversary of Dr. King 's death highlights the true lesson of this holiest of days .
We are not to sit idly by because Easter proclaims the victory .
Too many Christians take comfort in the wrong - headed idea that all is settled because Jesus rose from the dead .
Martin Luther King , Jr's death suggests otherwise .
His was a life given in love and in devotion to justice .
Are we , Christian or not , as committed ?
To stopping war ?
To ending poverty ?
To fighting for the most vulnerable among us ?
Or , are we content to rest in the illusion that salvation is guaranteed ?
Our lives , if we are to be saved , must stand as a testament to that legacy which , beyond our doing , is inescapable .
Cowardice and complicity must die in us .
And we must rise again to " love " a new world into existence .

CASUAL ACCUSATIONS OF TREASON ….
Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana , a relatively obscure Republican freshman lawmaker , published a piece this week on the Obama administration ’s nuclear policies and counter - proliferation efforts .
Fleming , apparently , is n’t impressed , and rehashed a variety of tired right - wing cliches and demonstrably false claims .
In particular , Fleming repeatedly urged President Obama to be more like Reagan , which made his opinion piece “ dishonest and nonsensical , ” given Reagan ’s support for nuclear disarmament and treaties like the one Obama signed in Prague this week .
But Fleming ’s conclusion is what stood out for me .
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee , I work daily to ensure our men and women have the resources they need to protect this country , and I continue to be dismayed by the national security policies coming out of this White House .
Simply put , President Obama is disadvantaging the United States one step at a time and undermining this country ’s national defense on purpose .
Whether he is catering to the anti-war leftists or truly doing what he thinks is best for our security , the president is leading this nation down a very dangerous path .
[ emphasis in the original ]
Now , most of the piece is boilerplate garbage .
Fleming , or someone on his staff , wrote an op - ed without bothering to understand the details of the policy it seeks to critique .
It ’s the kind of superficial , misleading , and uninformed “ analysis ” we ’ve come to expect from congressional Republicans .
And if Fleming had simply characterized the approach endorsed by the president , the Pentagon , and the Joint Chiefs as misguided , and even potentially dangerous , it ’d hardly be worth mentioning .
But note that one line that the congressman italicized — he believes the White House is “ undermining this country ’s national defense on purpose . ”
Ignorance is commonplace .
Belligerence is routine .
Stupidity has become habitual throughout much of the caucus .
But let ’s not overlook the fact that Fleming spoke directly to President Obama ’s motives .
Fleming argued that the president is n’t just mistaken , but rather , is deliberately trying to make the United States less safe and more vulnerable .
In other words , Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana effectively accused the President of the United States — the Commander in Chief during two wars — of treason .
For Fleming , Obama is choosing to betray the nation , in his words , “ on purpose . ”
I write a lot about the excesses of Republican rhetoric , in part because I find GOP remarks illustrative of a party gone mad , and in part because of the impact the rhetoric has on the larger political culture / discourse .
Most of the time , the temptation is to mock the absurdities .
But once in a while , we find a case like this one , in which a sitting member of the House of Representatives — not a Fox News personality , not a host of right - wing radio show — suggests , in print , that the president is a traitor .
Is nothing beyond the pale for Republican officials in 2010 ?
Must there be no difference between GOP lawmakers and unhinged right - wing activists ?
Are we to believe that we should simply expect and tolerate the casual accusations of treason against American patriots ?
Last month , Senegalese Energy Minister Samuel Sarr slipped off to a conference in Paris for an extraordinary announcement :
His country is hoping to enrich uranium and build shimmering Homer Simpson - style cooling towers over a landscape where erratic power outages have long forced homes and businesses to rely on generators and candles .
Senegal is hoping to do it by 2020 .
And the former French colony has company .
Today , South Africa 's two nuclear power reactors stand alone on the continent , but by the end of the decade , that could very well change .
Several less - developed African nations are speeding up plans to modernize their economies through heavy reliance on nuclear power .
Beyond transformers and electrical grids , however , nuclear power requires the less - tangible infrastructure of workplace safety regulation , government oversight , anticorruption measures , stable governance , and antiterrorism controls – all things that many African nations are infamous for not having .
" It is not a technical challenge , " says Igor Khripunov , associate director for the Center for International Trade and Security in Athens , Ga . " Building nuclear power is a nationwide challenge . "
Ten African countries pursuing nukes
In February , Nigerian authorities pursued talks with Iran for an exchange of nuclear know - how .
The oil giant is joined by Uganda , which passed nuclear laws in 2008 and hopes to have a plant by 2020 , and by Kenya , whose government is seeking $ 1 billion for its own plant .
Algeria , Tunisia , Morocco , and Egypt have pledged to go nuclear by 2020 and are considered the likeliest to do so .
Ghana 's cabinet had vowed to bring a plant on line by 2018 , until the new government scrapped the plans .
And Niger – the country whose bountiful uranium has powered the nuclear age abroad and funded civil war at home – was soliciting South African support for its own plant , before February 's coup spiked the idea .
The energy conundrum
For Africa , energy is not a problem easily solved .
Much of the continent lacks the rail infrastructure or the regional integration to haul in coal , or the purchasing power to consistently provide fuel to oil - or natural - gas - fired power plants .
But once a costly nuclear plant is built , the uranium costs are comparatively minor .
Western groups often push Africa to move toward wind , solar , and hydro power , but Africa 's leaders are looking for significantly more firepower .
" I think it 's immoral for certain first - world countries to propose wind and solar solutions to Africa as if they 're going to be industrially important , " says Kelvin Kemm , CEO of a South African energy consultancy .
" Imagine losing 10 percent of your country 's power if it does n't rain .
There 's no modern economy that can look toward developing on the basis of that . "
Fission presents its own problems , however .
For one , it would double the total wattage of a grid like Kenya 's – something the planning section of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) strongly warns against .
It 's a fiscal challenge , too , incurring high credit costs , upfront financing , and steep maintenance costs .
' An absolutely lunatic idea '
" It is an absolutely lunatic idea , " says a nuclear physicist and energy analyst for an international think tank , who asked not to be named because he did n't want to be contacted about his comments .
He calls Senegal 's nuclear power project a " prestige undertaking . "
Nuclear braggadocio is off the menu at Senegal 's Energy Min­istry , where spokesman Malick Ndaw is quick to play down the endeavor .
After all , Senegal is also building wind farms , solar plants , a hydropower dam , and two coal - fired plants .
Mr. Ndaw says they 'll need them all – plus the nuclear plant – to prevent a lack of power from crippling the country 's development .
" All of our industries are in an energy crunch , without exception , " he says – words that resonate with Bara Gueye , chief engineer for Senegal 's Ciments du Sahel .
Like many African industrialists , the cement manufacturer has to provide his own electricity , which explains why , according to industry analysts , energy prices gobble up 15 to 20 percent of manufacturing costs , inviting cheaper imports .
The new nuclear market
France may help finance Senegal 's project .
Europe 's storied nuclear state is " always available to help " a former colony , Ndaw says , though he wo n't say how .
South Korea is exporting more nuclear technology , as is Japan .
Russian designs for offshore nuclear plants may prove compelling for African countries .
So , too , may South Africa 's pebble bed reactors , small - scale nuclear plants still being developed .
" Then , China looms large on the horizon , " adds Mr. Khripunov of the Center for International Trade and Security .
With so many new players competing , analysts say Africa may become the growth market for nuclear power exporters – even if not by the deadline of Mr. Sarr , the Senegal energy minister .
" Twenty years from now , many of these countries may be ready for it , " says Holger Rogner , head of the IAEA 's planning section .
" But you have to start now to get there . "
According to Chinese tech blog Expreview.com , citing " reliable sources " , Nvidia is preparing a lower - end addition to its GeForce GTX 400 lineup that could come as soon as June 1 -- just in time for Computex .
The third Fermi - based offering will reportedly bear the GeForce GTX 460 name and should go against AMD's Radeon HD 5850 in terms of price and performance .
It is said to utilize the same PCB as the GeForce GTX 470 , but featuring 1GB of GDDR5 memory connected via a 256 - bit bus and presumably cuts specs across the board .
By comparison , the GTX 470 has 1,280MB of GDDR5 RAM and a 320 - bit memory interface .
Interestingly , Expreview claims there will be no formal reference design for the GTX 460 , with each partner free to make a slightly different version .
Previous rumors suggest that other cheaper Fermi derivatives based on new silicon could arrive around June as well .
These include a GeForce GTS 450 , 440 , and 430 -- all of them based on the 40nm GF104 core and priced under $ 200 .

Brisbane 's ugliest duckling is about to get a $ 2.5 million facelift .
Burnett Lane , which runs parallel to the Queen Street Mall between Albert and George Streets , will be lit and street - scaped to encourage people to use it as a new inner-city thoroughfare .

Last year , it was an embarrassing mess of rubbish bins , upside - down signs and garbage strewn across the roadway .
Today , in the week before the transformation begins , Burnett Lane might be a little neater , but it is still a nightmare of inner-city neglect .
Whether spawned by an atomic blast , discovered on a long - lost island or ripped from the pages of mythology , these oversize beasts trample the scenery in our favorite creature features .
King Kong turns 77 Wednesday .
In honor of the Depression - era primate , here ’s a look at the unruly spawn that followed in the giant ape ’s thunderous wake .
Out - sized freaks of nature — or , often , mutants created by man ’s folly during the atomic age — these monsters peaked in the ’50s and ’60s during the golden age of sci- fi , but their influence lives on in modern films like Cloverfield .
Many were created by stop- motion pioneer Ray Harryhausen and by Japan ’s Toho Company , known for its kaiju ( monster ) and tokusatsu ( special effects ) flicks .
These are some of our favorite giant movie monsters .

Nato 's top civilian official in Afghanistan warns of further deaths in ' very tough year ' for British and other foreign troops
British and other foreign troops deployed in Afghanistan face a " very tough " time ahead and can expect to be engaged in a combat role for three or four more years , Nato 's most senior civilian official in the country said today .
Mark Sedwill , a former UK ambassador to Afghanistan , warned of further troop deaths in the region , saying : " We can not allow judgment of success to be the absence of casualties . "
Speaking on the margins of a Royal United Services Institute conference in London , Sedwill laid out crucial steps towards ending the conflict , to be taken over the next few months .
A " critical test " would be the imminent operation in Kandahar designed to improve security and governance in the Taliban 's heartland , he said .
That operation was not primarily a military one , Nato insists .
However , as more troops are engaged in counter - insurgency operations in southern Afghanistan , it was inevitable there would be more casualties , Sedwill said .
He said the " bumper sticker " message for the next British government had to be that " a stable Afghanistan is a safer world " .
The stability of Pakistan was also at stake , he said , as was that of other places vulnerable to al - Qaida - inspired extremists .
The message to these countries had to be : " We stand by you . "
There was a gap between public opinion , with polls reflecting growing sceptism about Nato - led operations in Afghanistan , and the political leadership in Nato countries , Sedwill said .
Casualties among British and other Nato troops have increased significantly over recent years .
More than 100 UK troops were killed and over 150 seriously wounded in Afghanistan last year , more than double the numbers for 2008 .
Thirty - three have been killed so far this year .
" Expect 2010 to be again a very tough year " , Sedwill said .
British and other Nato troops could be expected to be engaged in combat roles for " another three or four years " , he said .
Thereafter , they could be expected to remain in Afghanistan , training and mentoring local forces , for a further 10 to 15 years .
Barack Obama has indicated that the number of US troops in Afghanistan – still rising – will begin to fall from July 2011 .
However , Sedwill suggested that the number of UK forces would not start to shrink at the same time as they would be needed to train Afghan troops .
Senior Nato officials say they are seriously concerned about the shortage of experienced troops to train local forces .
The aim was to announce the first handover to local forces of responsibility for security in a number of Afghan provinces at the Nato summit in Lisbon in November , Sedwill said .
But it was important , he added , not to expect an end of violence to be a precondition for a handover .
The questions were what was an an acceptable level of violence in Afghanistan and , as important , the degree to which Afghans felt that their security and institutions of government were improving .
As Nato and Afghan forces prepare for their Kandahar operation , the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , is due to visit Washington on 10 May .
Later that month he is due to preside over a peace jirga of tribal and community leaders , designed to boost a much - discussed reconciliation and reintegration process .
In order to benefit from the process , leaders had to accept the existing Afghan constitution and renounce violence as a political weapon , said Sedwill .
Although the emphasis now was on the political , governmental , and economic , development of Afghanistan , " military pressure " still played a key role .
That , he said , was important in what he called " draining the fuel out of the insurgency " .
Three - quarters of the insurgents were " allied with the Taliban rather than fighting for it " , Sedwill said , implying that the large majority were not ideologically motivated .
He described corruption as a " symptom of abuse of power " , an issue between Afghans rather than one between Afghans and the international community .
Quarterback Brady Quinn will get a chance to start over in Denver .
Whether he 'll get to start is up to the Broncos .
The Broncos acquired the former first - round draft pick from the Cleveland Browns for fullback Peyton Hillis , a 2011 sixth - round draft pick and a conditional pick in 2012 .
Ostensibly , Quinn will compete with Kyle Orton for the Broncos ' starting job , although coach Josh McDaniels was unavailable Sunday to comment on the trade , according to a team spokesman .
Orton told the Denver Post that he was willing to work with Quinn .
" We 've made a lot great moves this offseason and this is another one , '' Orton told the newspaper .
" He 's a great player and I 'll be happy to work with him . ''
However , Orton said he expects to be the Broncos ' starting quarterback again this season .
Orton said he spoke with McDaniels about Quinn before the trade was completed .
" I will keep [ the conversation with McDaniels ] private but I do have total confidence that I 'm the guy there , '' Orton told the newspaper .
" Just like every year I 'm going in to try and earn my starting job .
I do n't think I have anything to fret . ''
The teams announced the trade Sunday and said the deal is pending physicals .
" Obviously there are things that are out of my control .
It 's a great opportunity for me to play under a great coach [ McDaniels ] , " Quinn told the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
" It will be a fresh start for me and great opportunity with a very talented team and it should be a lot of fun . "
" At this point , I 'm just looking to create a role for myself on the team , " Quinn told the Plain Dealer .
" Anytime you 're in a situation like this , that 's all you can really do is just go in there and learn the system , get to know your teammates and coaches , everyone else , and that 's really my focus right now .
All of those things will take care of themself in the end . "
Quinn 's departure comes one day after the Browns agreed to terms with free agent Jake Delhomme on a two - year contract .
Quinn went 3 - 9 in 12 starts for Cleveland , which drafted him with the 22nd pick in the first round in 2007 out of Notre Dame .
From Dublin , Ohio , he was embraced by Browns fans as the quarterback of the future .
But the pairing never panned out for either the franchise or the player .
" I appreciate everything Brady did for us last year and in his three seasons with the Cleveland Browns , " coach Eric Mangini said in a statement .
" He is professional in the way he goes about doing his job and worked extremely hard at every aspect of his game .
I wish him the best of success in Denver . "
Why Spanish Accents Can Be So Different
Accents speak to variety of Hispanic world
The confusion is partly political — the Spanish - speaking world is very diverse .
Spanish is the language of 19 separate countries and If after years of Spanish classes , some people still find it impossible to understand some native speakers , they should not worry .
This does not necessarily mean the lessons were wasted .
Millions of Spanish speakers use neither standard Latin American Spanish nor Castilian , which predominate in U.S. schools .
The confusion is partly political — the Spanish - speaking world is very diverse .
Spanish is the language of 19 separate countries and Puerto Rico .
This means that there is no one standard dialect
Latin American Spanish
While each country retains its own accents and has some unique vocabulary , residents of countries such as Colombia , The most common Spanish dialect taught in the U.S. is standard Latin American .
It is sometimes called " Highland " Spanish since it is generally spoken in the mountainous areas of Latin America .
While each country retains its own accents and has some unique vocabulary , residents of countries such as Mexico Peru , and Bolivia generally speak Latin American Spanish , especially in urban centers .
This dialect is noted for its pronunciation of each letter and its strong " r " sounds .
This Spanish was spoken in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , and was brought to the Americas by the early colonists .
Castilian
Another difference is the use of the word " vosotros " ( you all , or you guys ) as the informal form of " ustedes " in Spain .
Castilian sounds to Latin Americans much like However , the Spanish of Madrid and of northern Spain , called Castilian , developed characteristics that never reached the New World .
These include the pronunciation of " ci " and " ce " as " th . "
In Madrid , " gracias " ( thank you ) becomes " gratheas " ( as opposed to " gras - see - as " in Latin America . )
Another difference is the use of the word " vosotros " ( you all , or you guys ) as the informal form of " ustedes " in Spain .
Castilian sounds to Latin Americans much like British English sounds to U.S. residents .
French , on other hand , is a highly centralized language , with the Parisian accent setting the standard for the world .
If other French - speaking political entities had risen to rival France , the situation might be different .
If for instance , Quebec had remained a separate country , or if Haiti had been a larger country , then perhaps other French dialects might have become more accepted .
The settlers and traders of southern Spain took this dialect with them to the Caribbean and other coastal areas .
Today Caribbean or " Lowland " Spanish is characterized by its relative informality , its rapid pace , and the dropping of " s " sounds , allowing people to talk more quickly .
The third major type of Spanish is spoken in the Caribbean , coastal areas of Latin America , and in some cases in southern Spain .
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the accent in Seville Cádiz , and other cities in Andalusia , in Southern Spain , began to change .
Speakers began to drop the final " s " on words .

Selling off the public ’s transportation infrastructure to pay off government debt has no “ ideological opposition ” in London today , if a recently published report is to be believed .
A plan to privatize the UK ’s motorway network , giving toll firms access to large swaths of road , would take place under the guise of paying down the government ’s debt , British media reported Tuesday , citing a number of key officials who support the scheme , proposed to all major political parties by NM Rothschild , one of the world ’s oldest , most influential and little discussed investment banks , founded by the Rothschild family .
ADVERTISEMENT
Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said over a week ago that the scheme would be Britain ’s way forward .
Business Secretary and UK Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable , quoted by The Daily Mail , said he was open to the idea .
“ ‘ There is no ideological opposition to asset sales , ” he said , the paper reported .
“ If we can get good value for money for something , then we will look at it .
There is undoubtedly potential for releasing an income stream from government assets .
There are no inhibitions ; we want value for money and we want income . ”
“ Last year , Gordon Brown began the process of a fresh round of privatisations , announcing asset sales of Ã ‚Â £ 16 billion , including the Tote , the Dartford Crossing and the student loan book , ” the Mail added .
Instead of drawing the tolls directly from motorists pocketbooks , the firms would draw up formulas that estimate the total number of drivers , which the government would then pay for in regular increments .
Critics call the idea a “ shadow toll , ” though it is seen as preferential compared to building new toll roads and electronic payment systems .
The so - called “ shadow toll ” would also appear to be a possible route for deflecting the full brunt of an almost - certain public backlash .

Cable called the Rothschild plan “ using assets more creatively , ” according to the Mail .
Media reports estimated the sale of Britain ’s motorway to private interests would generate some Ã ‚Â £ 100 billion for the government .
Politicians are also considering an electronic tracking system that charges drivers based on distance driven .
“ A spokesman at the Department for Transport said : ‘ It is not unusual for organisations to suggest ideas to government departments but ultimately all policy is decided by ministers and there are no plans to sell off a stake in the Highways Agency , ' ” the Times - Online added .
“ Rothschild declined to comment .
The paper continue : “ The bank was behind many of the key privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s , including British Steel , British Gas and British Coal .
It has close links to the Conservatives , having employed several senior Party figures including Lord Lamont , John Redwood and Lord Wakeham .
Oliver Letwin , the former shadow chancellor , works there part - time . ”

The Rothschilds , a bane to many a conspiracy theorist ’s existence , are a centuries - old European banking dynasty that has exerted tremendous influence over European history and global economic affairs .
Many critics of global banking institutions view the family as the driving force behind central banks that oversee the economies of virtually every modern industrialized nation on Earth .
The Twilight of the Western Oil Majors
Brazil is home to one of the last major oil frontiers in the world — and a case study for how the balance of power in the international oil industry is shifting .
In 2007 , 10 years after the Brazilian government opened its oil industry to foreign investment , the state oil company Petrobras struck one of the richest oil veins in decades .
Western oil companies such as Chevron , Total , and BP , thrilled by the rare prospect of a new exploration opportunity , lined up eagerly to invest .
But the outsiders have been stymied .
Brazil , generally one of Latin America ’s most investment - friendly countries , is now boosting the state ’s role in developing its vast new oil reserves .
And it ’s doing so with help from China , which has recently provided Petrobas with a massive loan , making the old titans of Big Oil increasingly superfluous .
This situation is not unique to Brazil .
It ’s just the latest example of a new form of collaboration between China and other national governments with oil resources worldwide that is completely reshaping the industry .
Petrobras ’s discovery centered on the Tupi field , part of an enormous oil - rich zone called the presalt , which lies up to 10,000 feet below the sea ’s surface under a layer of salt thousands of feet deep .
Petrobras refuses to put a figure on total reserves , but independent analysts estimate the presalt region holds roughly 50 billion to 70 billion barrels of reserves .
The government reacted to the news by proposing major new reform legislation that won approval in the lower chamber of parliament earlier this year and is now making its way through the Senate .
The legislation would make Petrobras operator of all presalt oil fields , giving it control over day - to - day investment decisions , such as when and where to drill wells .
Another measure would give veto power over investments in presalt blocks to Petrosal — a new 100 percent state - owned oil company to be created alongside Petrobras , which is publicly traded on the Sao Paulo and New York stock exchanges .
Private oil companies with interests in Brazil are now voicing concern that the new regulatory model would render them passive investors in oil projects , devoid of power to make operational decisions .
The oil majors argue that excluding their expertise and technology will delay development of the complicated oil fields .
French oil firm Total , for example , boasted last year that its technical expertise could " bring something new " to presalt development .
One oil executive in Brazil said recently that the proposed legislation " is not in the interest of the [ state ] company .
It ’s not in the interest of the government recovering taxes or the industry as such . "
This argument is based more on self - interest than fact .
Petrobras , perhaps the most competent deepwater operator in the world , insists it has the technical and project management skills to develop the presalt singlehandedly .
" Being operator in all presalt blocks will give Petrobras new strength , " CFO Almir Barbassa recently told investors in New York .
The bigger concern , say Petrobras officials and analysts , is the company ’s ability to fund the massive project .
Despite Petrobras ’s good credit rating and access to cheap loans through the Brazilian Development Bank , it remains unclear how the company will secure financing for such a large investment portfolio in the long term .
In March , Petrobras announced a huge five - year investment plan of up to $ 220 billion .
Petrobras is projecting 2010 capital expenditures of $ 47 billion — some 60 percent higher than Exxon Mobil or Royal Dutch Shell , the biggest spenders among the major private oil firms .
Senior Petrobras executives have been traveling the globe , from New York to London , as part of a campaign aimed at assuring shareholders , bondholders , and credit analysts that investing in the company is a good long - term bet .
Wall Street analysts , expressing skepticism about the energy reform legislation , have been unconvinced :
They fear that an excess of government intervention could ruin investment opportunities .
Meanwhile , Chinese investors seem to have no such qualms and their deep pockets have helped keep Petrobras ’s spending plans on track .
Last year , the state - owned China Development Bank agreed to lend Petrobras up to $ 10 billion — over one - third of the total debt the company raised in 2009 .
The initial agreement between China and Brazil was formed during Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping ’s visit to South America last year and was finalized on April 15 , when President Hu Jintao met with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
The loan can be repaid in cash but also included an " option to offset the debt with the export of oil … in a volume to be defined in the future . "
Petrobras simultaneously pledged to increase exports to China .
It agreed to start delivering 150,000 barrels per day to Chinese state company Sinopec in 2009 , an amount that will rise to 200,000 barrels daily over the next nine years .
Imports of Brazilian crude have risen from an average of 81,500 barrels a day last year to 187,000 barrels a day in the first two months of 2010 , according to Chinese customs data .
The agreement also establishes a framework for further partnerships between Petrobras and Chinese companies in the oil industry , and for Chinese firms to supply services , materials , and equipment to Petrobras .
Separately , Petrobras signed a deal with China National Petroleum Corp ( CNPC ) , increasing oil exports to 40,000 to 60,000 barrels per day .
China ’s loan gives Petrobras some financial breathing room and reduces its need to seek private capital to develop Brazil ’s costly oil reserves .
This further sidelines the U.S. and European companies that have traditionally dominated private investment in Brazil ’s oil industry .
With financial support from China , Brazil has no need to hand its reserves over to international oil companies .
" The government is keen to keep most of the presalt area in Petrobras ’s hands , " notes an industry observer .
China is using all the tools at its disposal , including abundant cash and political influence , to secure long - term oil supplies around the world .
In addition to Brazil , China offered a total of $ 50 billion in loan - for - oil deals last year to Venezuela , Angola , Russia , and Kazakhstan .
The allure for China ’s partners is cash with no strings attached — in the case of Brazil , China is not requesting an equity stake in the presalt oil blocks , as Western companies nearly always do .
Rather than a straightforward business deal , these agreements represent broader political alliances among developing nations pursuing policies of state - led economic growth .
As a result , national oil companies like CNPC are unseating the Exxons and BPs of the world .
The Chinese , awash with cash and keen to outbid competitors , have picked up a large share of Kazakhstan ’s onshore production .
In Angola , loans have helped to lock in assets for its state oil companies .
In 2004 , for example , the Angolan government obstructed India ’s state - owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp .’s efforts to buy a 50 percent stake in an oil block and later awarded it to Sinopec .
China is not along in pursuing this strategy .
Russia ’s government , for example , has negotiated bilateral energy deals that give its state companies access to oil reserves in politically friendly nations .
As these countries spend big to drive profits , Big Oil may be forced to accept contract terms that would have once been considered unacceptable .
In Iraq , another of the most important new oil frontiers in the world , majors like Exxon , Shell , and BP accepted service contracts rather than an equity stake for fees of $ 2 per barrel or lower — terms that are unlikely to generate big cash returns — in Iraq ’s postwar bid rounds .
Once the Brazilian government starts awarding new exploration licenses , most Western oil majors will still be able to grab a stake of the presalt resources .
But that prize may be a pale substitute for the returns to which they have become accustomed .

Many companies encourage workers to put in long hours or even pull all - nighters — but they might as well promote showing up to work inebriated , according to sleep researchers .
" We would never say , ' This person is a great worker !
He 's drunk all the time ! ' " says Harvard sleep expert Charles Czeisler , who 's found that 24 hours without sleep or a week of 5 - hour sleep nights is equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent .
Here 's a brief guide to the costs of sleep deprivation :
Why is it bad to work without sleep ?
Sleepy employees get sick more often , make more mistakes , and are less productive — for practical purposes , they equivalent to drunks .
Not surprisingly , the results are often deadly : Many big industrial disasters — Exxon Valdez , Three Mile Island , Chernobyl — can be traced to mistakes by sleep - deprived workers ; one in 20 first - year medical residents make fatal fatigue - related errors , and about one fifth of serious car accidents involve driver sleepiness .
Is there a quantifiable cost ?
One recent study of four U.S. companies found that sleep deprivation cost them $ 1,967 per employee per year in lost productivity — a figure that rises to $ 3,556 for employees with frequent insomnia .
Who 's most likely to be sleep - deprived ?
Corporate executives , according to one new study .
Lawyers are also disproportionately sleepy , as are long - haul truckers , doctors , and pilots .
Why are we working more and sleeping less ?
Part of it is " sleep machismo , " says Czeisler , which " glorifies sleeplessness in the way we once glorified people who could hold their liquor . "
There 's also a drive to be more productive , which sleep researchers say is actually defeated by giving up sleep for work .
And increasingly , we just can't sleep — Canadian and U.S. surveys show that between 10 percent and 50 percent of workers report insomnia .
Other than getting a better night 's sleep , what can workers do ?
Some high - end spas are offering " sleep retreats , " but the best solution might be to take 20 - to 45 - minute midday naps .
Some companies , including Nike and Pizza Hut , have created nap breaks and nap rooms , and one entrepreneur started a chain of MetroNaps " nap centers . "
Japanese workers take catnaps , often at their desks , and Spain is trying to reintroduce the siesta .
How much does a nap really help ?
A study for NASA found that a quick nap can boost worker output by 34 percent .
" Which person do you want on the job ? " asks Mark Rosekind , who conducted the study .
" The one with 34 percent better performance and 100 percent more alert — or the other guy ? "

Callin ' out around the world : are you ready for a brand new beat ?
Summer 's here and the time is right for duelin ' in the streets .
The tradition of dueling first appeared among the Germanic tribes and was , in its early form , a mostly judicial matter .
Conflict between to parties was settled and right and wrong were established under the belief that a higher power would protect the party in the right by allowing them to win and survive .
These duels of justice would evolve into duels of chivalry in the Middle Ages and then duels of honor " “ private affairs being settled in an " honorable "  manner " “ around the mid 16th century .
During the middle of the 18th century , just as dueling was falling out of favor in Europe and being outlawed in many places * , it also made its way to colonial North America .
After the Revolutionary War , dueling would find a strong enough foothold in the United States that it would stay alive and well , mostly in the southeastern states , well into the 19th century and count numerous congressmen , senators , two presidents and a signer of the Declaration of Independence ( the forgettable Button Gwinnett ) among its practitioners .
Two hundred and four years ago yesterday , the seventh president of the United States shot and killed a horse breeder over an insult .
In remembrance of this duel and the heady days of early America when you could kill a man in a heavily codified shootout if he called you a chicken , here 's the highlight reel ( subjective selections , not an exhaustive list ) of some of the more notable duels ( and near - duels ) in American history .
Jackson vs. Dickinson
Before he became president , Jackson was a horse breeder in Tennessee .
When Charles Dickinson , a rival breeder , called Jackson a " coward "  and an " equivocator "  and referred to Jackson 's wife Rachel as a " bigamist " 
( her earlier divorce was n't complete when she married Jackson ) , Jackson challenged him to a duel .
Dickinson chose pistols , and so , two hundred and four years ago , the two men met at Harrison 's Mills in Logan County , Kentucky , at seven in the morning ( dueling was illegal both in Kentucky and Tennessee , but they decided to meet across state lines since they were both well known in their home state ) .
Dickinson got off the first shot and hit Jackson just inches above the heart .
Old Hickory remained standing and pulled the trigger .
The pistol misfired , so he tried again and hit Dickinson in the gut .
Dickinson would spend the rest of the day bleeding to death and expire that night .
Jackson would spend the rest of his life dealing with a ball of lead lodged in his chest and the fallout of his " dishonorable "  action of not stopping the duel when he misfired .
Hamilton vs. Burr
The most famous duel in American history was perhaps the logical conclusion to a personal and political battle that Vice President Burr and former Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton had been waging for years .
Their conflict began in 1791 when Burr beat Hamilton 's father - in - law , who would have supported Hamilton 's Federalist policies as Secretary of the Treasury , for a Senate seat .
When Burr and Thomas Jefferson tied for the presidency with 73 electoral votes each in the election of 1800 and the choosing of a president fell to the House of Representatives , Hamilton 's maneuvering in the House led to Jefferson 's victory and Burr taking the position of VP .
Four years later , Burr ran for governor of New York when he realized he would be dropped from Jefferson 's ticket and Hamilton campaigned against him and endorsed Morgan Lewis , who beat Burr .
The tension between the two men continued to simmer until , upon hearing rumors that Hamilton had been saying " despicable "  things about him , Burr issued a formal challenge to duel and Hamilton accepted .
Hamilton and Burr arrived by rowboat the morning July 11 , 1804 , at the Heights of Weehawken in New Jersey , a popular dueling ground where Hamilton 's son had been killed just two years earlier ( the same guns were used in both duels as well ) .
The duel was held in New Jersey because the practice had n't been outlawed there yet , but a number of safety measures were still implemented to keep anyone from being prosecuted .
The dueling pistols were transported in a suitcase so the rowers could say under oath that they had not seen any pistols and the seconds ( the representative of each dueling party , who were responsible for determining a location for the duel , checking that the weapons were equal and that the duel was fair ) stood with their backs to Hamilton and Burr so that they could honestly say they saw no shots fired .
First - hand accounts of the duel agree that two shots were fired , but conflict over who fired first .
It was probably Hamilton and he apparently fired high and missed Burr completely , though it 's not clear if this was intentional .
Burr 's return fire hit Hamilton in the abdomen just above the right hip and caused extensive damage to his liver and diaphragm .
Hamilton collapsed and died the following morning .
Burr may have survived , but like Jackson , he paid for it politically .
He was indicted for murder in both New York and New Jersey , but never brought to trial , and was so harshly criticized for his involvement in the duel that he ended his political career early and went into exile .
Clay vs. Randolph
John Randolph was an angry man .
He fought his first duel at 18 over a fellow student 's mispronunciation of a word .
As a Congressman , he regularly labeled his colleagues " vile , "  Â " slanderers , "  " traitors "  and " contemptible and degraded beings . " 
His anger caught up with him when he accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of " crucifying the Constitution and cheating at cards "  on the House floor .
Clay challenged him to a duel .
Assaulting his character was one thing , but Randolph did not want to assault Clay 's body and rob his family of a father and husband .
Days before the duel , Randolph confided in a friend that he would instead purposefully aim high and miss at the duel , in order to preserve his honor while sparing Clay 's life .
The men met on the field of honor on April 8 , 1826 , and as preparations were being made , Randolph accidentally fired his gun at the ground .
Clay accepted that the misfire was an accident and allowed the duel to proceed , so both men marched the agreed upon number of steps , turned and fired .
Â Randolph , humiliated by his misfire , made no effort to aim high and away , but still missed Clay , barely striking his coat .
Clay also missed and , unsatisfied , demanded another attempt .
Clay missed again and Randolph followed through on his intent to spare Clay and fired into the air .
Â
Clay was moved by this and met Randolph at midfield to end the duel and shake his hand , where Randolph noted that he owed the Secretary a new coat .
Lincoln vs. Shields
During his time as a Whig representative in the Illinois legislature , Abraham Lincoln ( who opposed dueling ) wrote a series of satirical letters , under the pseudonym Rebecca , poking fun at State Auditor James Shields .
When some of the letters wound up published in a local newspaper , Shields wrote a letter demanding that Lincoln retract them .
Lincoln took offense at both Shields ' tone and his assumption that Lincoln had written all of the letters that appeared in the paper ( some of the letters were believed to have been written by Mary Todd , Lincoln 's future wife , and a friend ) .
When Shields asked for at least a retraction of the letters he knew were Lincoln's , Lincoln refused unless Shields withdrew his letter , demanding an apology for the demanding of an apology , in other words .
Shields grew tired of the stalemate and challenged Lincoln to a duel .
As the challenged party , Lincoln had the choice of weapons and other certain conditions .
Instead of the usual pistols , he chose cavalry broadswords and decided that the duel would be fought in a pit 10 feet wide and 12 feet deep with a large wooden plank in the middle that neither man was allowed to step over .
These conditions , the long armed , 6 ' 4 " 
Lincoln hoped , would give him enough of an advantage that Shields would withdraw the challenge .
If the duel were to go on , Lincoln though he would at least have an opportunity to disarm Shields without either man getting hurt .
Lincoln was n't the only one trying to make the duel a bloodless one .
Both men's seconds took matters into their own hands and arranged a truce , agreeing that a note in which Lincoln admitted authorship of his letters and asserted " no intention of injuring [ Shields ' ] personal or private character or standing as a man or gentleman "  would satisfy all parties .
Afterwards , Lincoln and Shields forged a friendship and political alliance that would last for the rest of their careers .
Twain vs. Laird
For a time , Samuel Langhorne Clemens , better known as Mark Twain , was living in Virginia City , Nevada , and writing editorials for The Territorial Enterprise .
When Twain erroneously accused his rival paper , The Virginia City Union , of reneging on a pledge to charity , the Union 's publisher , James Laird , raised such a fuss that Twain challenged him to a duel .
When Twain went to practice shooting with his second , it became apparent that his pen was mightier than his sword and that his pistol was downright awful .
There was no way he 'd survive the duel .
As Laird and his second approached the field of honor , Twain 's second grabbed a bird and shot its head off .
When Laird arrived , Twain and his second were admiring the corpse and the second explained to Laird that Twain had shot the bird from thirty yards .
That night , Laird called off the duel , but the fact that a one had been challenged and accepted still brought Twain in conflict with Nevada Territorial laws .
Since the local authorities were n't fans of Twain 's writing anyway , Twain took the opportunity to leave Nevada and headed to California where he worked for another newspaper and wrote The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County .
Button Gwinnett vs Lachlan McIntosh
As a representative of Georgia at the Continental Congress , Button Gwinnett was the second of the signatories on the United States Declaration of Independence .
He was also the bitter rival of Brigadier General Lachlan McIntosh .
Their conflict started when McIntosh was appointed as commander of Georgia 's Continental Battalion over Gwinnett .
Gwinnett took the appointment as a slight and took out his wrath on McIntosh and his family .
He had McIntosh 's brother George arrested and charged with treason against the revolution .
As governor , he took an active role in military matters , causing dissension in the ranks and undermining McIntosh 's leadership .
When Gwinnet ordered one of McIntosh 's subordinates to lead a poorly planned expedition into British Florida , the disastrous operation led to Gwinnett and McIntosh blaming each other for the failure .
The public sparring grew vicious when McIntosh denounced Gwinnett as a " scoundrel and lying rascal . " 
The governor challenged him to a duel to restore his honor .
The two met to duel with pistols on May 16 , 1777 , in a field a few miles east of Savannah .
After marching twelve paces , they turned and fired almost simultaneously .
Gwinnett took a shot to the hip and McIntosh took one to the leg .
Gwinnett died three days later and George Washington feared that Gwinnett 's allies would take revenge on the surviving McIntosh , so he ordered him to report to Continental Army headquarters .
McIntosh spent the winter of 1777 - 1778 with the Continental Army at Valley Forge , Pennsylvania and later commanded several regiments of North Carolina troops in the Revolutionary War .
Gwinnett maintains a small amount of fame today for having the most valuable historical autographs in America .
Since he was not well known before signing the Declaration of Independence and died shortly after , people attempting to collect the autographs of all 56 signers of the Declaration have autograph paid as much as $ 150,000 for Gwinnet 's signature .
* As late as 1829 , however , England 's prime minister , the Duke of Wellington , challenged the Earl of Winchelsea to a fight to the death over an insult about the duke 's supposed softness toward Catholics .
Soon behind the wheel , maybe
LIKE all police forces , Saudi Arabia 's Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice , better known as the Mutaween , performs a range of tasks .
Armed with long beards and short sticks , its agents are most notorious for two particular jobs : enforcing the separation of sexes in public places and herding people into mosques at prayer times .
How shocking , then , that one of its most senior officers is challenging both missions .
Ahmed al - Ghamdi , who is the head of the vice squad in the holy city of Mecca , argues that there is no Muslim prohibition against innocently mixing the sexes and that , since the five daily prayers can be performed anywhere , by individuals as well as in groups , there is no need to force shops to close at prayer times .
Since Mr Ghamdi started airing such views in newspaper columns and television debates last November , rumours of his impending dismissal have abounded .
Such expectations rose earlier this month , when the kingdom's most senior cleric , the Grand Mufti , told Mr Ghamdi to keep his opinions to himself , saying that anyone who questioned the need for communal prayers was leading Muslims to hell .
Few were surprised when , on April 25th , the state news agency announced his replacement .
Yet just two hours later the item was removed , apparently after some senior princes had intervened .
Mr Ghamdi remains in office , unrepentant .
The embarrassing flip - flop not only exposed ideological rifts inside one of the kingdom 's chief citadels of orthodoxy .
It reflected a broader groundswell of debate that is beginning to erode the religious conservatives ' long - uncontested control .
Saudi Arabia 's beleaguered liberals had placed high hopes in King Abdullah , who succeeded to the throne in 2005 with a reputation for reformist tendencies .
But the 85 - year - old monarch has proved wary of provoking a conservative backlash .
It is only now that slow , gentle pressure from the top is producing inklings of change .
Vroom , ladies !
Vroom !
Another issue that Mr Ghamdi has weighed in on , for example , is Saudi Arabia 's prohibition , unique among Muslim - majority countries , against women drivers .
Though Saudis frequently scoff at what they regard as foreigners ' obsession with the driving ban , it is a perennial topic of private argument .
To date , the ban 's supporters have carried the day , citing supposed religious principles , local tradition and professed fears for Saudi women 's safety .
Yet with younger clerics such as Mr Ghamdi doubting the scriptural grounds for making women rely on male drivers , other arguments are looking flimsier .
Many Saudi observers took note earlier this month when one of the kingdom's best - selling dailies , Al - Riyadh , devoted a long article to exploring how to implement a lifting of the driving ban .
One expert , for instance , proposed testing liberalised driving laws in one city at a time .
Another suggested that before Saudi women can get licences the public could be conditioned by allowing female foreign residents , including household servants , to drive .
This would answer the common complaint , voiced even by conservatives , that the driving ban risks increasing the bigger danger of Saudi women mixing with unrelated men who may not even be Muslims .
Other people interviewed simply said the ban was a silly anachronism and should be dropped forthwith .
Such outspokenness is partly because Saudi women are becoming a lot more prominent .
They account for 60 % of university students and a growing if relatively small part of the workforce .
It also reflects exposure to nearby countries such as Kuwait , where women not only drive but are elected to parliament .
Last month in nearby Abu Dhabi a Saudi woman drew cheers at a televised poetry contest , reciting impassioned verses against religious bigotry .
Earlier this month , audiences in the emirate flocked to watch Faten al - Helw , a lion - taming Egyptian grandmother , put her big cats through flaming hoops .
Saudi Arabia 's conservatives are not so cowed .
One elderly cleric recently issued a fatwa on his website , decreeing that anyone who advocated mixing sexes was an enemy of Islam and should be killed .
But the website was quietly shut down .
King Abdullah has said nothing about the fatwa .
But he did invite cameras to record a cosy private meeting between himself and Sheikha Mozah , the elegantly dressed and unveiled wife of the emir of Qatar .
The spectrum of pulse trains from a mode - locked laser consists of a sequence of optical frequencies that are evenly spaced .
Pairs of frequencies formed from two ' teeth ' on the comb have a definite phase relationship with one another and the pair can control a spin qubit on a trapped ion via a stimulated Raman process .
Physicists have now extended this capability to any frequency by splitting the pulses and shifting each with an acousto - optic modulator .

Physicists at the University of Maryland have found a way to turn a precision measurement device into a versatile tool for manipulating quantum bits ( qubits ) .
The researchers adapted a device known as an optical frequency comb in their novel approach to performing the sorts of quantum data operations that will be vital for future quantum computers .
The research appears in this week 's issue of Physical Review Letters and is described in a Viewpoint article by Boris Blinov ( University of Washington ) in the current edition of APS Physics .
Conventional methods for manipulating qubits typically require pairs of lasers with closely coordinated outputs and high power levels .
Optical frequency combs produce a rainbow of light that 's made up of discrete , precisely defined frequencies .
Because the light originates from a single source , rather than two separate sources , the output frequencies in an optical comb are automatically coherent .
As a result , two frequencies from a single optical comb can take the place of a pair of lasers in manipulating a qubit .
Despite the convenience the optical frequency comb offers in coherence , tailoring the output for specific applications generally involves physically adjusting the components that produce a comb .
The new research demonstrates a technique that solves the problem by effectively using the " teeth " ( individual frequencies in a comb output ) of one comb to produce coherent pairs of teeth in another comb .
This allows the researchers to electronically shift frequencies to the specific values they need , rather than being constrained by the fixed choices that a single comb provides .
The flexibility of the technique should be applicable to many types of qubits .
In addition , closely related techniques are proving useful for a host of other applications that involve the manipulation and control of atoms with light .

Hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles will soon be notified that they must shut down in June , when the city 's medical marijuana ordinance will take effect .
The City Council decided Friday to approve fees that dispensaries will be required to pay to register , the last piece of the long - delayed ordinance .
When those fees are effective , which is expected to be around June 4 , city officials will send cease - and - desist letters to illegal dispensaries .
The city 's medical marijuana ordinance allows only dispensaries that registered under the city 's 2007 moratorium to continue to operate under its new law .
" It was the wild , wild West for weed in Los Angeles for some time , and we are going in the direction to finally take control of the situation , " said Councilman Jose Huizar , who helped draft the medical marijuana ordinance .
" This is a very significant step . "
Operators of the dispensaries that will be forced to shut down have been weighing their legal options , which include suing the city to challenge the ordinance .
Though scientists argue that the emerging technology of spintronics may trump conventional electronics for building the next generation of faster , smaller , more efficient computers and high - tech devices , no one has actually seen the spin -- a quantum mechanical property of electrons -- in individual atoms until now .
In a study published as an Advance Online Publication in the journal Nature Nanotechnology , physicists at Ohio University and the University of Hamburg in Germany present the first images of spin in action .
The researchers used a custom - built microscope with an iron - coated tip to manipulate cobalt atoms on a plate of manganese .
Through scanning tunneling microscopy , the team repositioned individual cobalt atoms on a surface that changed the direction of the electrons ' spin .
Images captured by the scientists showed that the atoms appeared as a single protrusion if the spin direction was upward , and as double protrusions with equal heights when the spin direction was downward .
The study suggests that scientists can observe and manipulate spin , a finding that may impact future development of nanoscale magnetic storage , quantum computers and spintronic devices .
" Different directions in spin can mean different states for data storage , " said Saw - Wai Hla , an associate professor of physics and astronomy in Ohio University 's Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute and one of the primary investigators on the study .
" The memory devices of current computers involve tens of thousands of atoms .
In the future , we may be able to use one atom and change the power of the computer by the thousands . "
Unlike electronic devices , which give off heat , spintronic - based devices are expected to experience less power dissipation .
The experiments were conducted in an ultra-high vacuum at the low temperature of 10 Kelvin , with the use of liquid helium .
Researchers will need to observe the phenomenon at room temperature before it can be used in computer hard drives .
But the new study suggests a path to that application , said study lead author Andre Kubetzka of the University of Hamburg .
To image spin direction , the team not only used a new technique but also a manganese surface with a spin that , in turn , allowed the scientists to manipulate the spin of the cobalt atoms under study .
" The combination of atom manipulation and spin sensitivity gives a new perspective of constructing atomic - scale structures and investigating their magnetic properties , " Kubetzka said .
The research , which was carried out at the University of Hamburg , was supported by the German Research Foundation and a Partnership for International Collaboration and Education ( PIRE ) grant from National Science Foundation .
The research is the result of a collaboration among three research teams : a spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy group of Professor Roland Wiesendanger led by Kubetzka at the University of Hamburg , Germany ; Hla , an expert in atom manipulation at Ohio University ; and two theorists , Professor Stefan Heinze and Paolo Ferriani , now at the Christian - Albrechts - Universität Kiel , in Germany .
There 's no way in and no way out .
The road is blocked by an upturned car , makeshift barricades of wood and rocks , and an exhausted soldier , standing in the rain .
He waves his rifle menacingly at anyone who swings in to sight .
Beyond the roadblock lies Tivoli Gardens , the centre of the small war that has enveloped Jamaica 's capital , Kingston , this week .
Somewhere in its maze , a woman called Margaret is beginning to have her doubts .
The man she saw as the saviour of her family and community has brought death and terror to the streets , and she is uncertain now who to blame .
Last week , Margaret was marching in support of Christopher " Dudus " Coke – variously portrayed as the real power in Jamaica , as some kind of messiah and as the head of a criminal empire that reaches to Europe and North America – even though her elderly mother told her to stay home .
Some of her fellow protesters held up handwritten placards in protest at the government 's plan to extradite Coke to the US to stand trial for drug trafficking .
One read : " Jesus died for us .
We will die for Dudus . "
Now though – after a three - day battle during which the Jamaican military hunted for Coke in Tivoli Gardens , his Kingston stronghold – Margaret is more concerned about what has happened to the father of her young daughter .
" If I go out , they kill me , I 'm sure , " she says by phone .
" The soldiers are everywhere .
They are shooting everywhere .
All the men have disappeared .
They take them away .
The women and the children are here but we have no food .
There was so much shooting , my daughter , she is terrified .
There are guns .
There are bombs . "
The allegations of indiscriminate shooting and beatings by the army have been made by others among the thousands trapped in Tivoli Gardens and other Kingston neighbourhoods under assault .
" Dudus has been good to us , " says Margaret , who will not give her second name for fear of reprisals .
" He look after us .
Everyone .
He is the government here ( in Tivoli Gardens ) because the government do n't care about us , the poor .
The government betrayed him . "
She never expected the violence , though .
" We did n't need this war .
It would be better if they fight somewhere else , " she says .
Margaret remains trapped in a part of Tivoli Gardens still under lockdown , but in another area that became accessible for the first time only yesterday , the evidence of heavy fighting is everywhere .
Buildings are heavily pockmarked by bullets and hand - grenades , and there is blood on the floors .
At one entrance to the area , soldiers have a handful of young men spreadeagled against a wall .
But mostly only women and children remain and , while it is finally safe to step out of their houses , they do not venture far up the street .
As a line of soldiers on patrol passes on a street called Bustamente Highway , some of the women jeer and shout abuse .
Paula
Grey gesticulates toward the soldiers and accuses them of hauling off her 15 - year - old son , Horrace , three days ago .
She has n't seen him since .
" I do n't know where he is .
He 's gone .
I hope they did n't do what they did to a man across the street .
They walked into that house , " she says , pointing to a building opposite the Faith and Hope Deliverance ministry , " and they shot him .
Point blank .
He did n't have a gun . "
The wreckage of burned - out cars and barricades of tyres and barbed wire has been pulled to the roadside here by the army .
But a few blocks on , the area is sealed off .
There , the barricades remain in place , and the soldiers are hunched down with their rifles pointed up the street .
So far , 500 or more men have been taken away by the military , and the " dons " of the gangs that rule the streets of parts of Kingston have been captured or surrendered .
The one person the government has n't caught is Coke , the 42 - year - old don at the alleged head of the Shower Posse gang – so called because of its tactic of showering its enemies and hostile communities with bullets – that has been a feature of Jamaican life , and politics , for as long as women such as Margaret can remember .
Jamaica 's former national security minister , Peter Philips , recently described Coke , who is popularly known as " the president " , Shortman and Bossy , as probably the most powerful man in the country .
When the government announced that Coke would be extradited to New York , some of that power became evident : whole communities were mobilised .
His supporters threw up barricades .
Some used barbed wire connected to power lines .
Then the gangs launched attacks on police stations to demonstrate their contempt for the authorities .
On Darling street , the century - old British - built police station has been razed .
It was firebombed in broad daylight , then looted as the police fled .
All this prompted the declaration of a state of emergency in the capital and the biggest security - force mobilisation in Jamaica 's history .
Hundreds of soldiers and much of the Kingston police force were brought in .
Since then – with thousands of people still trapped in the areas of fighting – the police say they have seized the kind of equipment that could arm an insurgency : ammunition , military fatigues and body armour .
However , they have yet to lay their hands on the much - feared Grizzly Big Boar rifle – a weapon used by American military snipers that uses armour piercing bullets – that they claim forces protecting Coke possess .
In fact , they appear to have seized few guns of any kind .
Officially , the death toll stands at 44 , but this is bound to rise .
There are a lot of questions the information minister , Daryl Vaz , ca n't or wo n't answer .
How many armed men have the security forces been confronting ?
Has the government been in contact with Coke ?
Have troops raided his home ?
And , above all , who are the dead ?
Earl Witter , Jamaica 's public defender , an official independent role , has raised questions about the relatively high number of civilians killed compared with the small number of weapons seized .
" The security forces have their own explanation .
If they do n't find it particularly curious , I certainly do , " he said .
The Jamaican press , meanwhile , have reported that two men were found with tags which indicated they had been shot by Coke 's supporters for refusing to fight on his behalf .
Coke 's own life has been racked by violence .
Two brothers and a sister have been shot dead .
His father , Lester , who was a former leader of the Shower Posse , died in 1992 in a fire in his prison cell .
He was in jail awaiting extradition to the US on drug trafficking and murder charges .
Coke 's lawyer was , until the extradition order , Tom Tavares - Finson , who is also a Jamaican senator .
Tavares - Finson has described his client as " just an ordinary Jamaican going about his everyday business " .
" Nobody has heard of him being involved in any criminal activity , " he told the Jamaica Observer in December .
" [ He is ] trying to improve the lot of his children , his family and his community , with a recognition that he has an influence , and he takes his influence very seriously , and that influence is what is propelling the transformation of western Kingston . "
Tavares - Finson said it is not Coke 's fault if people want to turn him into " a mythical character " .
" That is not his doing .
Left to his own devices , he would not be on the front page of any newspaper , " he said .
That much is true .
Coke – unlike some of the more showy dons such as the now imprisoned Donald " Zekes " Phipps , who loved to pose for the television cameras and boast about his power – largely sought to stay out of the limelight .
Even in Jamaica 's raucous nightclubs he was known for sitting in the corner – albeit surrounded by scantily clad women – while other dons drew attention to themselves on the dance floor .
Even Coke 's supporters recognise that it may be criminal activity that has earned him the vast sums that allow him to wield the power he does .
But then they regard all Jamaica 's leaders as crooks , and say that at least Coke looks after them .
And this he certainly does .
Coke sends the children of the poor to school .
He buys their families food .
Above all , he is seen to be loyal to his own people in a way that the island 's politicians are not .
" There 's no job here , " says Margaret .
" There 's enough money for one thing but not the other .
For food but not clothes .
And if the child gets sick , who pays ? "
Until now , Coke and the Shower Posse did .
Thanks to Coke , the residents of this area of Kingston – known as a " garrison " – pay no rent .
No one 's power is cut off for non-payment .
The gang maintained a form of law and order on the streets they controlled .
Tellingly , many of Coke 's supporters are women grappling with the daily struggle of raising a family in poverty .
They care little if he makes his money from Americans buying drugs .
This is a strategy that has won favour for drug lords and armed groups from Colombia to Gaza .
Pablo Escobar , who once oversaw the mighty Medellin cartel , was a Robin Hood figure to many of that city 's poor .
He built whole streets for the near destitute , along with football pitches , churches and simply giving away cash .
In return , the population were his lookouts and when Escobar needed someone to murder police officers , there was no shortage of volunteers .
In the process he turned Medellin into the murder capital of the world .
But with Coke it seems to go further .
The Reverend Earlmont Williams was shocked to see women marching with signs comparing Coke to Jesus .
" It is obvious that the perception held of their leader by many residents of garrisons is built on their understanding of Jesus ' life and mission , " he wrote in the Jamaica Observer .
" What bothers me is that their messiah theology is articulated in the reverse , in that rather than the garrison ' messiah ' dying for his people , they are willing and ready to die for him . "
If nothing else , Jamaicans admire Coke 's energy .
Until this latest spot of trouble , he ran everything from registered companies such as Incomparable Enterprise , which received millions of dollars in government contracts , to Presidential Click , which stages weekly street dances as well as the popular Champions In Action dance - hall event .
And while doing all this , if the charges against him are to be believed , Coke was managing a sprawling organised crime network that reaches from Jamaica to Britain and North America .
The US indictment against Coke says he has controlled Tivoli Gardens for close on two decades .
It describes the area as guarded by gunmen .
" These gunmen act at Coke 's direction .
Coke arms them with firearms he imports illegally , via a wharf located adjacent to Tivoli Gardens .
Coke also distributes firearms to other area leaders of other sections of Kingston , Jamaica , " the indictment says .
" Organisation members in the United States routinely seek Coke 's advice and approval for various matters relating to the sales of narcotics , including how to resolve conflicts with other Organisation members .
The members of the Organisation commonly send cash and goods , including clothing and electronics to Coke as ' tribute ' payments , in recognition of his leadership and his assistance . "
It is more than just gang members in New York who have spent years paying tribute to Coke .
Tivoli Gardens is one of the neighbourhoods known as " garrisons " because they were built by one of Jamaica 's two political parties during their rotations of power , and could be relied on to deliver up the vote accordingly .
But with that political control developed criminal organisations that were key to the parties maintaining their grip on the vote .
Tivoli Gardens happened to be built by the Jamaica Labour party and the man Coke has been delivering the vote for is the local MP , Bruce Golding .
He is also now the prime minister and Coke 's would - be jailer .
To many of the poor that smacks of betrayal and hypocrisy .
For nine months , Golding did in fact resist US pressure to extradite Coke .
The government said that the evidence against him had been obtained illegally by the Americans .
The Jamaican prime minister even hired a lobby firm in Washington to try to get the US authorities to drop the extradition request .
Only when that was made public , and Golding looked to the entire country as if he had been bought and sold by Coke , did the prime minister change his mind and move against the Shower Posse leader .
Meanwhile the business community , so long a target for the dons ' rackets , is egging the government on .
" Extortion from businesses has been one of their main sources of funding , " says Milton Samuda , a lawyer and president of the chamber of commerce .
" We 're heartened to hear that the operation wo n't be confined to West Kingston , and we 'll be pressing for it .
It 's our intention to ensure that this is the commencement of a process . "
But Samuda recognises that the violent purging of gangs from Tivoli Gardens and other garrison communities will not address the core reasons for their support .
" There has to be a break between the historic ties between criminality and politics .
But separate from that , part of the reason that these gangs are able to take over communities is because they supplant the state , " he says .
" If the gangs are paying school fees and clothing people and ensuring people get medical attention , then those who receive will be beholden .
There 's a cultural shift that will have to take place , which means that when you get rid of them you have to have the social services coming right in behind until people are able to fend for themselves . "
But are the politicians taking that seriously ?
" We 're past the stage of caring whether they take it seriously .
It 's going to have to be done and we 're going to agitate for it , " says Samuda .
Already some in Jamaica are declaring that the pact between the criminals and the state has been broken .
The next election will demonstrate if there is any truth to that .
In the meantime , Coke is still on the run , only adding to the myth .
In his absence , rumours are sweeping the streets .
He has fled Jamaica .
He is negotiating his surrender .
He never left Kingston .
" It would be better if they never find him , " says Margaret .
Jamaica 's leaders may secretly agree .
CNet Co-Founder Tops California ’s List of Tax Infamy
Technology entrepreneur Halsey Minor has earned the dubious distinction of being named by California ’s tax authorities as the state ’s biggest tax delinquent .
A list published by the California Franchise Tax Board on Friday says Minor–the co-founder of Internet media site CNet Inc. and several other companies–and his wife , Shannon Minor , owe $ 13.1 million in personal income taxes to the state .
That ’s nearly $ 5 million more than the next biggest tax delinquent in the state .
In an email message , Minor said he had cash - flow issues that stem from moves by a lender to put liens on all his liquid assets , actions that he said are illegal and that he is now fighting in court .

Judas Priest In “ Toy Story 3 ” ?
Almost .
Last week I visited Pixar Animation Studios outside of San Francisco to watch a nearly completed version of the highly anticipated Toy Story 3 .
A few shots were not quite finished and a temp soundtrack ( mostly music from the past two movies ) was in place , but that did not matter .
This sequel proved to be a worthy addition to the franchise , and it ’s actually a bit darker than the other movies , which suits me just fine .
We ’re not allowed to discuss the plot , but I hate spoilers anyway .
One thing that astonished me while watching the 2D version of the movie , and which was later confirmed when given a chance to see the opening in 3D the next day , was the inclusion of “ Electric Eye ” by Judas Priest .
All I ’ll say is that the song ’s classic opening riff is used twice for a few seconds at the start of the film , blaring from a sports car .
Naturally , I was the only journalist who noticed this , and when I brought it up the next day to director Lee Unkrich and producer Darla K. Anderson , they were amused and impressed that that caught my ear .
Unkrich told me that unfortunately the song would not make the final film , although they ’d use something with “ the same feeling ” .
( I was also told by a Disney representative that it wo n’t surface in any advance public test screenings due to music rights issues .
This was a private press event . )
When I asked Unkrich and Anderson if they were metal fans , the latter replied , “ We are for that sequence . ”
So close , yet so far .
Still , this is not the first time a Disney / Pixar - metal connection has emerged .
Back in 2008 , I attended a Disney presentation in NYC and was shown some footage from the direct - to - DVD movie Tinker Bell .
Afterward I met director Bradley Raymond at the bar and asked when Tink would go through her punk phase and dye her hair purple .
He then professed that he was a big Iron Maiden fan , which lead to a fifteen - minute discussion about classic metal bands .
And last weekend I met Pixar employee Edward Robbins ( official title : Technical Director , Characters ) , who is a fan of Kreator and Slayer .
The second big event in Washington this week is the jostling over a financial reform bill .
One might have thought that one of the lessons of this episode was that establishments are prone to groupthink , and that it would be smart to decentralize authority in order to head off future bubbles .
Both N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard and Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations have been promoting a way to do this :
Force the big financial institutions to issue bonds that would be converted into equity when a regulator deems them to have insufficient capital .
Thousands of traders would buy and sell these bonds as a way to measure and reinforce the stability of the firms .
But , alas , we are living in the great age of centralization .
Some Democrats regard federal commissions with the same sort of awe and wonder that I feel while watching LeBron James and Alex Ovechkin .
The premise of the current financial regulatory reform is that the establishment missed the last bubble and , therefore , more power should be vested in the establishment to foresee and prevent the next one .
If you take this as your premise , the Democratic bill is fine and reasonable .
It would force derivative trading out into the open .
It would create a structure so the government could break down failing firms in an orderly manner .
But the bill does n’t solve the basic epistemic problem , which is that members of the establishment herd are always the last to know when something unexpected happens .
If this were a movie , everybody would learn the obvious lessons .
The folks in the big investment banks would learn that it ’s valuable to have an ethical culture , in which traders ’ behavior is restricted by something other than the desire to find the next sucker .
The folks in Washington would learn that centralized decision - making is often unimaginative decision - making , and that decentralized markets are often better at anticipating the future .
But , again , this is not a Hollywood movie .
Those lessons are not being learned .
I ca n’t wait for the sequel .
The time when PC - gamers would receive content updates free of charge appears to be nearing its end , as the Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 “ Stimulus Package ” apparently will cost $ 15 for PC - users as well .
Paid DLC has been common on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 for several years , but if similar content made it to the PC , gamers on this platform would generally receive it free of charge .
Similar map packs for previous Call of Duty installments were free for PC - users , while console users were charged for the same content .
The Stimulus Package , which will be released for Playstation 3 and PC on May 4th will cost $ 15 , but is currently available with a 10 % discount on Steam .
The package includes 5 new maps , two of which are remakes of Call of Duty : Modern Warfare - classics .
The content was already launch for the Xbox 360 on March 30th .

In The Imitation Game : Part 1 we looked at the early work of Alan Turing about universal computing machines , the limits of what computers can do , and whether computers could ever successfully imitate human brains .
In this post we look at Turing ’s work doing codebreaking at Bletchley Park during the Second World War , and the similarities and differences with codebreaking today .
The material in this post is based on a talk given by Dr Tom Leinster from the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh , as part of an event called The Maths of the Imitation Game at the Filmhouse cinema .
Bletchley Park , otherwise known as Station X , was a mansion in Milton Keynes that was used during World War 2 as the base for the Government Code and and Cypher School ( GC&CS ) .
( Earlier this year it was reopened as a museum , and I ’m told it ’s very good ! )
One of its main purposes was to decipher German messages , which were being encrypted using a device called the Enigma machine .
It was thought that Enigma was unbreakable , and so it might have been were it not for Turing ’s brilliance and subtle mistakes made by the German operators .
In a simple substitution cipher , each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter of the alphabet .
For example , if we had S-> F , H->U , E->R and P ->Y , the word SHEEP would be encoded as FURRY .
Such a code is easily breakable using frequency analysis : if E is the most common letter in the English language and R is the most common letter in the message , it ’s likely that E has been encoded as R. The Enigma machine is much cleverer than that .
In a standard Enigma machine there are 3 rotors .
Each rotor has each of the 26 letters of the alphabet inscribed around it , and each is set to an arbitrary position at the beginning of the day .
When the operator types a letter on the keyboard , the signal from that key is sent through wiring to the first rotor , which encodes it as a new letter .
It is then sent through wiring to the second rotor , which changes it again , and finally it is sent to the third rotor , which changes it again .
The signal then goes around some fixed wiring ( called a reflector ) and then it returns through each of the rotors , finally lighting up a new letter on the lampboard which the operator writes down .
Here ’s the clever bit : after each new letter is entered , the rotors turn .
Therefore , if you had typed S the first time and got an F , you could type S again and get a Z .
The same letter is encoded differently every time it is pressed .
The message itself is part of the encoding .
There are 3 different rotors , which the operator could choose out of a possible 5 .
This gives 5x4x3=60 options already for the initial setup .
Then , each rotor can start out in any one of 26 different positions .
This gives 26x26x26=17,576 options .
So far , this is only about a million combinations .
It sounds like a lot , but this is at a level where , with a little ingenuity , you could simply brute force all the possibilities .
To make Enigma unbreakable a final layer of encryption was added : the plugboard .
This used cables to pair up letters .
For example , if E was paired with Q , then if E was typed then the machine would interpret this as a Q before transmitting it through the rotors .
With this additional scrambling , the number of combinations of an Engima machine was over 159 million million million .
There was no way they could ever hope to check all possible settings in a reasonable amount of time .
And , to make matters worse , the Germans changed their settings each day , meaning that there was only 24 hours to figure out each code before everything changed .
What Turing did to crack Enigma was to build a machine capable of doing logical calculations that would eliminate a vast number of the possible settings .
This was called the bombe and built on earlier work by Polish cryptanalysists .
Basically it could try different rotor settings in turn , and look for logical contradictions that would show the settings to be impossible .
( For an analogy , think of doing a sudoku puzzle where you might postulate that a 6 goes in a box , but that would result in two 3s in another row which ca n’t happen , so therefore it ca n’t be a 6 . )
Such contradictions might include :
Deciding that a letter was encoded as itself .
This was impossible due to the way the signals through Enigma were sent round the reflector .
Having an asymmetry in the plugboard .
If the B is connected to the N , then the N must also be connected to the B .
Having a letter in the plugboard connected to its neighbour .
Operators were told not to do this .
Having plugboard settings that were used the previous day .
Operators had to change all the settings every day .
There were many more contradictions like these .
There were also sloppy practices among the operators .
They would often not set the rotors to a truly random initial position , but would use their names ( e.g. “ BOB ” ) or would simply turn the rotors a few places from the day before .
There were also common phrases in messages , e.g. the word “ ein ” appeared in 90 % of messages , and “ Heil Hitler ” also appeared often .
Wikipedia has a fascinating description of the methods used to crack Enigma , as well as the methods the Germans used to make Enigma even harder to crack .
Nowadays , encryption of information is done using mathematical algorithms rather than mechanical machines .
The most commonly used is called RSA , and relies on the difficulty of factorising large numbers into primes .
Just as in Turing ’s time , codebreakers rely on having a large amount of information to help them look for patterns , and on computers to do the decryption .
The big difference between then and now , according to Tom Leinster , is that during the war the government was spying on the Nazis ; today they are spying on us .
Earlier this year it was revealed that the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) and the USA ’s National Security Agency ( NSA ) had been systematically monitoring all of our emails , phonecalls , texts , web browsing and bank transactions .
Their goal was to “ collect all of the signals , all of the time ” , regardless of whether or not anybody had done anything suspicious .
And , just as in the film , the codebreakers often had complete autonomy over the information they collected , with even the highest in command being unaware of what they were doing .
Just as in the film , this codebreaking was only possible because of errors in the encryption of the data .
The information leaked by Snowdon showed that the NSA had inserted a secret back door into the world ’s most widely used cryptosystem , allowing it to break the encryption .
Alan Turing was a homosexual at a time when homosexuality was illegal , and his conviction and subsequent chemical castration were what led to his suicide in 1954 .
Today it is legal in the UK for two men to have sex , and even get married .
This change in our law has come about because of campaigning and activism , but it is always dangerous to be an activist , speaking out for something that is considered against the law .
It is easily argued that such campaigning is even more dangerous today , with the government carrying out mass surveillance of everyone in the population .
I shall end this post with the question asked by Tom Leinster in a piece he wrote for New Scientist in April : is it ethical for mathematicians to work for government intelligence agencies like GCHQ ?
I look forward to hearing your comments !

Oil giant BP , as a devotee of British understatement might say , has something of an image problem .
Its environmentally devastating spill in the Gulf of Mexico — and new questions about risky decisions it made in an effort to cut corners and save money — have led to congressional hearings , federal investigations and a 25 % drop in the company ’s stock price .
The crisis has also prompted worldwide derision , demonstrations and fury .
All perfectly understandable under the circumstances .
But there ’s something not quite cricket about the growing calls for a more extreme form of protest — a boycott of BP gas stations .
Public Citizen , the consumer - advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader , has an online petition calling for a three - month BP boycott , and a Facebook group has thousands of members who promise to bypass BP stations .
There are far better and more effective outlets for public outrage .
Before the gulf spill , BP was considered among the most environmentally responsible oil companies in the world .
Granted , that ’s not saying much .
BP ’s campaign to market itself as a protector of endangered species and a promoter of renewable energy has accurately been dubbed “ greenwashing . ”
But it has invested more in renewable power than other oil companies , and it has taken strong steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its operations .
We have to wonder where people who are boycotting BP stations are going to fill up — at stations branded by Exxon Mobil , one of the nation ’s biggest polluters ?
Will they turn to Chevron , which is fighting ferociously to deny responsibility for its role in an environmental catastrophe in the Amazon ?
In the oil business , nobody has clean hands .
There ’s also the fact that BP stations are independently owned , so a boycott hurts individual retailers more than London - based BP .
And the fact that boycotts of oil companies seldom have an impact on their bottom lines .
But the larger point is that human error can lead to disaster on any oil rig , owned by any company , at any time .
That ’s why expanding offshore drilling , as President Obama and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle propose to do , is such a bad idea .
It ’s not surprising that people want to take action to express their despair over the ruin of one of the country ’s richest coastal ecosystems , but attacking BP is n’t the answer .
Obama has rightly suspended offshore lease sales , but he continues to promote a deeply counterproductive energy policy — on Thursday , during a news conference discussing the administration ’s response to the spill , he touted a Senate climate bill that would provide massive financial incentives to states that open their coasts to drilling , thus making a repeat of the spill more likely .
Those provisions have to go .
It ’s in Washington , not London , where protesters should make their voices heard .
Numerous questions have been raised as to how a car accident lawyer can help you .
An auto accident typically brings about harm to at least one of the vehicle occupants .
In a severe accident , such injuries can occur even if the driver and passenger are wearing seatbelts .
An auto accident lawyer can help an injured driver to find a physician who is aware of the significance of a clear but reasonable complaint .
The injured driver will receive a more just settlement if he or she is seen by a doctor who ’s familiar with the injuries usually due to a car accident .
Submitting an injury claim is a course that many people do n’t follow , simply because they ’re worried or nervous about taking legal action .
However , in the event that you ’ve been in an automobile accident you should know your legal rights and one of them is the legal right to hire an automobile accident attorney .
Insurance carriers are n’t concerned about your own interests ; they are more interested in their financial well being .
An experienced car accident attorney can make sure that your legal rights are fully secured and assist you in getting the compensation you are entitled to .
Additionally , they could take some of the load off from you and let you focus on recovering your emotional and physical well - being .
A reputable car accident lawyer could negotiate with your insurance carrier to lessen your insurance premium tactfully soon after a vehicle accident .
They ’re really authorities at compelling insurance companies to disclose the actual level of insurance protection coverage that may be claimed by their purchasers .
From time to time your insurance policy coverage might have undisclosed procedures which will assist you to claim a greater sum .
The automobile accident attorney can help you to get compensated for the health care expenses and the income lost in the automobile accident .
But you must provide the valid documents in this regard which are then shown by your lawyers in the court of law .
A number of states even impose a statute of limitations that provides a deadline of just two years for you to submit your case .
It ’s understandable that you ’re going through an extremely difficult time .
But it ’s a time for you to be strong and when you most require the advice of an attorney to examine your alternatives .
Aside from the medical bills , you might not also be able to report for work , perform physical things that you would ’ve been able to perform before the crash and have your quality of life reduced to a very significant level .
It ’s a dreadful situation that nobody would want to be in .
Therefore , it is crucial to hire a car accident lawyer who ’s well versed with all the details and formalities of vehicle accidents to work it out to your advantage .
They ’re reputed for acquiring substantial compensation and even vehicle repairs from the other party .
Locating the right car accident lawyers is now very easy by making use of the Internet .
There are many internet sites nowadays that will provide you with a full list of vehicle accident lawyers in your area .

The Times and Sunday Times newspapers will start charging to access their websites in June , owner News International ( NI ) has announced .
Users will pay £ 1 for a day 's access and £ 2 for a week 's subscription .
The move opens a new front in the battle for readership and will be watched closely by the industry .
NI chief executive Rebekah Brooks said it was " a crucial step towards making the business of news an economically exciting proposition " .
Both titles will launch new websites in early May , separating their digital presence for the first time and replacing the existing , combined site , Times Online .
ANALYSIS
By Torin Douglas , BBC media correspondent News International says its new pricing policy is simple and affordable .
That will be for readers to judge .
Many of its rivals still believe charging for content will only work for specialist publications , such as the Financial Times or Wall Street Journal .
Privately , executives admit the two papers are likely to lose thousands of regular online readers - and millions of more casual ones - because there 'll still be plenty of news and comment on other websites , free of charge .
But they hope £ 2 a week is a small enough sum to entice many readers over the paywall .
There 's likely to be a huge marketing campaign to change people 's habits and perceptions .
We can expect comparisons with the price of a cup of coffee ( by which standard , newspapers remain astonishingly good value ) .
Subscribers to the print versions of the newspapers will get online access thrown in .
There 'll also be new apps , adapting the content for phones , tablets and other devices .
As Rebekah Brooks of News International says , " This is just the start " .
The whole industry will be watching intently .

The two new sites will be available for a free trial period to registered customers .
And payment will give customers access to both sites .
With newspaper sales in decline , companies have been searching for a business model that will make money from their websites .
Risk
But with so much news content available for free on the internet , NI 's decision to charge is seen by many people as a high risk strategy .
Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corp owns NI , has led a fierce campaign against internet sites which distribute news content from his companies .
He has criticised Google in particular .
James Harding , editor of The Times , agreed that NI 's paywall strategy was a risk .
" But it 's less of a risk than just throwing away our journalism and giving it away from free , " he told the BBC .
He likened the news industry to the music industry of four years ago .
" People said the game is up for the music industry because everyone is downloading for free .
But now people are buying from download sites . "
Mrs Brooks said the decision to charge came " at a defining moment for journalism ...
We are proud of our journalism and unashamed to say that we believe it has value " .
Just the start
And she hinted that two other News International publications , The Sun and the News of the World , would also go behind a paywall .
" This is just the start .
The Times and The Sunday Times are the first of our four titles in the UK to move to this new approach .
We will continue to develop our digital products and to invest and innovate for our customers . "
Privately , executives admit the two papers are likely to lose thousands of regular online readers - and millions of more casual ones - says BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas .
But they hope £ 2 a week is a small enough sum to entice many readers over the paywall .
We can expect marketing campaigns to make comparisons with the price of a cup of coffee , " by which standard , newspapers remain astonishingly good value , " our correspondent says .
PAYWALLS ' PROGRESS
In December , Johnston Press began a paywall trial for six local weekly papers , charging users £ 5 for three months .
Johnston has yet to report on the trial 's success
In the US , the large daily Newsday charged $ 5 a week for access to its website .
By mid-January , three months after charging began , just 35 subscribers had signed up The Financial Times charges readers on a " metered " model , under which readers get access to some articles for free , but must pay for more .
The system is generally regarded as a success ' Dreamland '
The media industry uses a general yardstick that about 5 % of visitors to news websites are likely to pay for content .
Latest figures show that The Times and Sunday Times had 1.22 m daily users .
However , Claire Enders , of media research company Enders Analysis , says that anyone who believes the Times papers will get a 5 % conversion is in " dreamland " .
" This is not just about adding subscribers , but also strengthening the relationship with loyal readers of the website and papers .
If you are going to try this [ charging ] then the model they have chosen is the best way , " she said .
News Corp owns the Wall Street Journal , which has one of the most successful paid - for sites with about 407,000 electronic subscribers .
But some analysts point out that the WSJ offers specialist content , and that charging for general news is a different business model .
The editor - in - chief of the Guardian , Alan Rusbridger , is a leading sceptic of paywalls and has vowed to keep most of the content of his newspaper free online .
In January he described the move towards paywall business models as a " hunch " .
Unlike some commentators , Ms Enders does not expect any of the major UK newspaper groups to follow suit quickly .
Nor does she believe that Mr Murdoch 's strategy represents the last throw of the dice for some of his loss - making papers .
" If it fails , Murdoch will think of something else .
He has been supporting his loss - makers for years . "

Senator Tom Coburn confused at least some of his supporters over the weekend when he seemed to take a shot at Fox News ’ coverage of the health - care debate , while at the same time defending Nancy Pelosi .
“ I ’m 180 degrees in opposition to the Speaker , ” Coburn told the audience at a hall meeting in Oklahoma .
And yet , he said , “ she ’s a nice lady . ”
When that comment drew jeers , Coburn dug in : “ Come on now , she is nice .
How many of you all have met her ? ”
Has the famously ferocious conservative from Muskogee gone soft ?
When reached by the Daily Caller on Wednesday , Coburn explained his comments this way : “ What I had was a group of very conservative people that only get their information from one source .
If we ’re gonna win things , we have to look at other side .
There was no one more adamant on opposition to the health - care bill than myself , and not many people more conservative than I on fiscal issues .
But if we ’re going to win debates we have to win on facts and caring attitudes , not demonize people . ”
Coburn used the example of an MSNBC anchor to make his point : “ Look at Rachel Maddow .
She comes at me on the basis of emotion .
She demonizes me .
I do n’t want conservatives to win on the basis of emotion .
If we lower ourselves to the level they operate on , we hurt ourselves and our arguments . ”
True to his word , Coburn ’s latest legislative effort is rooted in math rather than sentiment .
Coburn has promised to block any spending bill in the Senate that is n’t expressly paid for by cuts to other programs .
Last month , he blocked an extension of unemployment benefits after Democrats rejected a Republican effort to pay for the $ 10 billion in benefits with unspent money from the $ 787 billion stimulus bill .
In an interview with the Daily Caller , Coburn explained that for too long legislators have avoided the “ hard choice of selecting priorities ” , choosing instead to transfer their debt to future generations .
“ We ’re at the point , have to start doing that , ” Coburn said .
“ If we do n’t , there ’s no way we ’re going to get out of hole we ’re in .
I ’m going to use every tactic I can use to raise the issue with the American people that we ’re not making choices you sent us up here for . ”
Coburn went on to criticize Democrats for failing to comply with the PAYGO principles they recently adopted , which require any spending bill be paid for before passage .
Democrats have argued that extensions of unemployment benefits are emergency spending and therefore not subject to PAYGO rules .
“ It ’s what gives people a lack of confidence in Washington .
If you pass a statute called PAYGO then violate it four times in a row , what does that say ? ” Coburn asked .
“ It says you want to say something but do something different .
I ’m saying it ’s time for actions to match words . ”
E-mail Gautham and follow him on Twitter
It ’s 4:30 P.M. and I ’m inside NBC ’s 30 Rock building feverishly posting a photo to facebook with the caption : “ I ’ve got a golden ticket . ”
And , it ’s true .
That ’s exactly how I feel waiting to get into the taping of “ Late Night With Jimmy Fallon ” to see Phish perform .
Everyone wanted to get into this show .
Questlove even tweeted that he “ Never got a “ absolutely 0 guests ” memo for a show b4 .
But it ’s understandable : its friggin Phish ! # rollingstonesweek . ”
The guy behind me , Matt , works at NBC and is clearly stoked to be here .
He ca n’t wait to rub it in to his 41 - year - old brother , who used to hang at The Wetlands , that he scored a way to get in .
Behind him a curly mop top interrupts to ask if we ’ve heard anything about a rumored surprise Phish gig .
He swears it ’s happening –it ’s all over the web boards and Phantasy Tour .
He ’s convinced , without a doubt that this is definitely happening .
We burst out laughing .
I tell him I ’ll see him at Roseland later .
We file into the studio an hour later .
There ’s a beautiful buzz all around us .
Is everyone here a Phish fan ?
I spot taper Mike Salvo , who I met on Mike Gordon ’s March tour , sitting on the second to last bench .
It ’s not one of the original ( and recycled ) red and cushion -y Radio City Music
Hall chairs , but he ’d get to move to the Band Bench , which would put him spitting distance to Fishman for the performance .
Another friend , Keith , is also back there and would give me a fist bump as he made his way down the aisle .
We ’re warned pretty frequently by the NBC pages and suits with rainbow peacock pins to “ Turn your cell phones off !
No cameras !! ” and there are plenty of them to enforce the law and direct people to their seats .
The studio is smaller than expected .
Maybe 200 phans ?
Sweet , this is my smallest Phish show ever .
Wait , does this count as a show ?
My stats .
The warm - up guy ca n’t believe his luck .
He ’d get to rib us on every hippy connotation he could muster .
“ How many of you are here to see Phish ? ” he says with an all - knowing nod .
80 % of the crowd hoots and hollers and basically goes nuts–but politely quiets back down .
“ You guys were here early , right ?
Out in the parking lot . ”
Yeah , yeah , we all agree and someone yells “ Shakedown . ”
Warm - up guy clues us in that Fallon will come into the studio audience for some crowd participation .
If Fallon picks on the guy in front of you , “ do n’t put your ugly mug in the shot and say ‘ hey , yeah man … I look good ’ cause , guess what ?
You ’re ruining the shot ! ! ”
We ’re pumped .
It ’s time for Jimmy Fallon to come out .
His desk is straightforward to my left , a big open space in the middle of the floor , and to my right are The Roots .
Since it ’s Stones week on Jimmy Fallon they ’ve hosted some killer sit-ins .
Our special guest , and we ’re quickly told there will be more , is New Orleans zydeco - boogie woogie - blues - and sweet jelly roll styl -y piano player Dr. John .
Between segments he and the Roots totally jam out “ Right Place Wrong Time . ”
All the lead ins and outs of the segments are done by the Roots and Dr. John and they ’re pretty smokin’ .
There are hi-def screens everywhere and we can watch along with the taping .
I count at least six audience mics hanging and the sound in the studio is really good .
In the very back of the studio behind us a DJ spins tracks off of “ Exile ” but quickly skipped past “ Loving Cup ” at the end of the night .
Fallon is totally on the level with the demographic of his audience .
When it ’s time for him to announce the evening ’s musical performance for Stone ’s week the word PHISH is barely audible over all the CHEERING .
It ’s deafening .
We ’re ridiculous .
Someone starts pounding their feet on the floor and we all follow suit .
It ’s a RUMBLE and Fallon ’s eyes totally light up .
We ’ve impressed him .
The Roots have never reckoned with a flock like us .
This is going to be fun .
I turn to my friend Melissa and say , “ We get to see Phish ! ” I almost forgot that there would be an actual performance still to come .
There were some do - overs .
A few of them of course .
Sam Rockwell came out at least three times because Fallon was tripping up .
“ Can we do that again ?
It ’s like a riddle , ” he said referring to the Broadway show “ Behanding in Spokane , ” that both Rockwell and Christopher Walken are in .
Actually , on the third try–and the take that aired –Rockwell came out and busted a few moves with Fallon on the floor …. and ended up in a split .
Now the order of guests that we saw , was different than the one that was aired .
LL Cool J came first , then Sam Rockwell , and then the ultimate of surprise guests for the evening , Keith Richards .
From my perch in the third row I could see producers Lorne Michaels strolling in and out–checking in on what has probably been the biggest and most publicized week and show for Jimmy Fallon .
During one break , and there were quite a few , Seth Myers came out and gave a high - five to a guy sitting diagonal from me .
The seat was definitely saved for this VIP , and if I had to guess I would say that he was a writer .
Total guess tho .
FINALLY it was time for PHISH .
The curtain pulls back , the Crew pushes all the gear forward .
Page , Fish , Mike , and Trey file out and wave to the audience .
One camera is on Fallon and Keith Richards — they are standing off to the left in front of a screen and Phish is ready and armed with their instruments .
They start off “ Loving Cup ” a little bit faster than usual — but it ’s a celebration .
Could be the happiest of the LC ’s that I ’ve seen , they absolutely nailed it with the look of total professionalism .
Well , everyone but Fish …he traded his signature donut dress for a Ren and Stimpy shirt .
Classic !!
What the home TV audience did n’t see and we were privy to , was the extra song , “ Kill Devil Falls . ”
After a quick onstage discussion with the stage manager Fallon announced that he would be right back after changing his suit and tie .
The crowd was obviously stoked that another song was on the way .
Once back , Fallon announced that Phish start their summer tour in Chicago on June 11th — and he held up the cover of Joy for the camera .
We were such a good audience that Fallon delivered on his promise to have munchies for us–bags of Funyons were waiting for us as we exited the studio .
He made sure to mention more than once or twice that we were awesome ( aww , thanks Jimmy !
Feeling ’s mutual ! ) .
Well , almost everyone was awesome … two girls got kicked out at the very end for yelling ( while the tape was rolling ) SHOW US YOUR FALLON !!
Oh wait , that ’s totally awesome !!
We win anyway !!

THE nation 's most powerful shopping centre owners are trying to stop the expansion of US discount warehouse chain Costco , claiming a planned multi-million dollar development is illegal .
In a raft of objections , the group - which includes Westfield , AMP and the Shopping Centre Council of Australia – says the proposed store is in breach of existing state planning laws , is “ inappropriate ” and that to create any special exemptions would be " anti-competitive " for other retailers .
The $ 60 m development , in an industrial area of Auburn in Sydney ’s west , takes in a vast 463sq km " main trade area " and hopes to follow Costco ’s successful opening in Melbourne ’s Docklands last year , achieved with the help of the Victorian Government .
Costco ’s local managing director Patrick Noone admitted the proposal did not fit into existing New South Wales planning laws but the company hoped to get approval by re-defining itself as a " bulk goods retailer " .
" We 're a new type of retailer , we do n’t fit into most planning laws , " Mr Noone said .
" You have to be a supermarket or department store .
We 're none of that , but we 're all of that . ”
In submissions to the NSW Planning Department the company says : " The Costco business model ... is that of a ' retail warehouse ' which is not recognised as an individual form of development under the Standard Instrument definitions .
" Whilst Costco cannot be properly characterised as ' Bulky Goods Retailing ' the Costco wholesale and retail warehouse shares many structural and operational characteristics with bulky goods retailing but equally can not be considered to solely be a traditional retail centre development . "
The company adds : " Whilst we acknowledge that the proposed use is prohibited , the Parramatta Road corridor is changing in nature to become more of a large format retail destination . "
Competitors hit out at Costco
Westfield has told the NSW Government the development would be a " prohibited use under the current planning legislation " and that having a " major out - of - centre retail outlet " would cause major traffic congestion .
The Shopping Centre Council of Australia - which has 19 shopping centre owners amongst its membership – also says the site is inappropriate for a " big box " retailer and has concerns about traffic in the surrounding streets and roads .
AMP , which through its AMP Capital arm has two centres within Costco 's trading area , also added its voice to the traffic concerns .
Some of these issues have also been raised by government bodies in separate submissions .
Costco opened its first Australian store in Melbourne 's Docklands last August and within four months more than 52,000 people had paid between $ 55 and $ 60 for the privilege of shopping there .
Costco ’s research says the 28 existing rival shopping centres in the Sydney catchment would lose a collective $ 61.7 million worth of sales .
The analysis , done by consultants Essential Economics , says Westfield Burwood and Westfield Parramatta alone would lose $ 15 million in sales but customers would benefit from lower prices .
Independent analysis by Macquarie Research has said that Costco prices were up to 15 per cent below competitors .
Mr Noone said based on overseas experience a city like Sydney could take up to five stores but it would take another 12 months after the application was approved before the Auburn store would be ready for business .
" It 's been a very successful opening for us , " Mr Noone said .
" Better than other new countries that we 've launched .
" In the past we were planning on opening one a year , we may now open two or more a year .
" Melbourne can take another one , Sydney can take several Costco .
" I think Brisbane Adelaide and Canberra are ( also ) good cities to invest in . "
Costco has responded to all of the issues raised during the public consultation process and the NSW Planning Department is now making a recommendation about whether it believes the project should go ahead .
" The Department is currently promptly finalising its assessment of the proposed Costco development at Auburn , " NSW Department of Planning media officer Tahria Sheather said .
" As part of this assessment , the Department considers all submissions lodged during the public exhibition period , along with the proponent 's response to submissions . "
Legitimate concerns - Shopping Centre Council
AMP 's shopping centres team at AMP Capital declined to comment .
The Shopping Centre Council of Australia referred news.com.au to its submission to the NSW Planning Department .
In a newsletter to its member the Council says : " While we strongly welcome the arrival of Costco in Sydney , and the additional retail competition this will bring , we have serious and legitimate planning concerns about the proposed site . "
Westfield had asked for the Costco development to be determined by the NSW Minister for Planning , Tony Kelly , said corporate affairs manager , Julia Clarke .
" This would allow the Costco application to proceed on its merits , but without the potential for any decision to create a precedent under which multiple retail sites could be approved in adjoining areas with inadequate public transport and other critical infrastructure . "
Ms Clarke also noted : " Westfield routinely makes submissions both for and against various developments and has done so often over its 50 - year history . ”
She said the reason for lodging submissions was often to support long - standing Government policy of retail development in appropriately zoned locations , usually in or near town centres well - served by transport and other infrastructure .
Costco 's proposed Auburn store :
14,000 sq m of shopping area - four to five times the average Coles or Woolworths supermarket
4000 different products versus more than 20,000 different products in an average Coles or Woolworths
800 car parks
First year sales $ 97.5 million with an average purchase of $ 155 per visit

One that leaves one of the game 's stars , Madison Page , completely naked .

He says that following the love scene between Ethan and Madison in " On The Loose " , in which he declined the kiss but ended up triggering the sequence anyways , he reloaded his save game later and bam .
There was Madison .
Playable , and naked .

Seeing as a fully naked model of Madison exists in the game already , from her shower scene earlier in the story , this is definitely something that 's within the realms of possibility .
Be thankful the glitch did n't affect Scott .

" Solution to the Dark Energy Problem " .
My result calls into question almost all of the work done on quantum gravity , since the discovery of quantum mechanics .
For gravity , there is no longer necessity for a graviton .
In the case of string theory , the principal motivation for the profound and historical suggestion by Scherk and Schwarz that string theory be reinterpreted , not as a theory of the strong interaction , but instead as a theory of the gravitational interaction , came from the natural appearance of a massless graviton in the closed string sector .
I am not saying that string theory is dead .
What I am saying is , that string theory cannot be a theory of the fundamental gravitational interaction , since there is no fundamental gravitational interaction .
I read with interest and excitement a very lightweight preprint on the Cornell preprint arxiv this afternoon .
Although I usually skip reading papers on subjects I know little about ( Cosmology ) , the title startled me enough to plunge into it : Single author , Paul Howard Frampton .
Hmmm .
A thought crossed my mind at the very start .
Was this the work of a crackpot , sneaked into the arxiv while nobody was looking ?
The tentative answer , before reading the text , was " No " .
Professor Frampton is a distinguished scientist with an excellent record , and although I know at least one distinguished scientist who has apparently lost his mind , this did not appear to be the case .
But wait .
What was the date of publication ?
April first ?
No , April 11th .
Okay , it looked like I would need to read the article to find out !
Fortunately , the paper is just 9 pages long , and it contains a mere seven ( 7 ) formulas - not even quite hard to decypher !
For a paper allegedly solving a long - standing puzzle in contemporary physics and cosmology , this must be a record .
But let me discuss the contents , with the explicit caveat that I am not an expert and my judgement is as good as yours .
The paper is extremely colloquial and simple to read .
The author start with a brief section containing a description of the problem of the accelerated expansion of the universe .
This effect is with us since 1998 , when it was recognized by the scientific community that the distant stars producing type - 1A supernova explosions were increasingly receding from us as a function of their distance .
Type - 1A supernovae are like " standard candles " , because the mechanism that ignites them guarantees that they have all the same intrinsic luminosity : thus their systematic study in distant galaxies provided the necessary input .
The evidence for an accelerated expansion of the universe was later confirmed by independent observations .
One may be thus led to speculate that a sort of " negative pressure " pervades the universe , causing it to expand at an increasing rate .
This works out easily like an addendum to the equations governing the universe expansion .
Frampton explains clearly how a solution of the problem can be worked out adding a " dark energy " to the energy density in the Friedmann equation .
Section two is titled " Solution to the Dark Energy Problem " .
And since the statement of the problem took five formulas in section one , we are left with two formulas ...
Enough of a task to make a theorist 's nerves stretch beyond the breaking point .
But let us follow Frampton - section two is only two pages long ! , so we can afford to be analytical .
He starts with the holographic principle : all the information about the universe is encoded in its two - dimensional surface .
If this is so , it allows us to consider the universe in a different light .
A dimensionful parameter of importance in cosmology is the Schwarzschild radius of a body : it is the radius which constitutes the event horizon for the mass possessed by the body .
Most heavenly bodies have a Schwarzschild radius much smaller than their real dimensions : for instance , the sun has a radius of 800,000 kilometers , but its Schwarzschild radius is of just 3 km .
When the physical radius is much larger , objects are quite different from black holes .
If one considers the whole visible universe , on the other hand , one gets a visible mass equal to about 10 ^ 23 solar masses .
Its Schwarzschild radius is thus of 30 billions of light years , while its physical size is of 48 billions of light years .
The universe does not seem much different from a black hole !
The above observation provides the hint to Frampton 's solution of the problem of dark energy .
Quite simply , a relation can be written between the temperature at the event horizon ( the second - to - last equation ) and the acceleration ( last equation ! ) , and this agrees with experimental measurements of the expansion rate of the universe .
Thus the apparent dark - energy effect may be just interpreted as a thermodynamical effect for this giant black hole .
Frampton discusses the results in a separate section .
I can only quote a most meaningful statement : I confess that my understanding of the whole picture is too sketchy to allow me anything but the above summary - no insight , no extrapolations , no comment .
For the little I know about the matter , I found no flaws in the reasoning described in the paper .
So , before I leave the debate to the experts , all I can say is that the very concept of an accelerated expansion driven by a negative energy density has always looked a real stretch to me , and I never believed in the " official " explanation of the cosmological evidences that have piled up in the last dozen years .
I am now eager to read more about this article elsewhere .
I will add links here if I find anything worth reading !

A survey reveals how Chinese scientists could be affected by the stand - off between their government and the search - engine giant .
Many in China are already mourning the potential loss of their favourite search engine .
V. THIAN / AP PHOTO
" Research without Google would be like life without electricity , " says Xiong Zhenqin , an ecologist at Nanjing Agricultural University in Jiangsu province .
Xiong is not alone in thinking that Google is indispensable .
Its search engine is a powerful tool for helping scientists to find academic papers and details of conferences or identify potential collaborators .
And for most researchers around the world , access to Google — and all its related products , including the literature search Google Scholar — is as unfettered as their access to heat or light .
But that 's not the case for China 's roughly 380 million Internet users .
Results from Google 's main search engine , Google.com , are censored by the Chinese government , and the local Chinese site Google.cn is voluntarily filtered by Google itself .
Researchers ' access to Google was threatened further when , on 12 January , Google 's senior vice - president and chief legal officer David Drummond said that the company may pull out of China altogether .
He explained that after a spate of cyber attacks on Google Mail , believed to come from within China , the company was no longer willing to censor results from Google.cn .
He added that the company would discuss with the Chinese government " the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law , if at all " , and that " we recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn .
If Google — or the Chinese government — acts on this threat , how would scientists in China be affected ?
To find out , Nature surveyed Chinese researchers about how they use Google 's products , and how integral it is to their research .
Of the 784 scientists who responded , more than three - quarters said they use Google as the primary search engine for their research .
Click for larger image .
More than 80 % use the search engine to find academic papers ; close to 60 % use it to get information about scientific discoveries or other scientists ' research programmes ; and one - third use it to find science - policy and funding news ( see ' What do you use your search engine for ? ' ) .
They also rely heavily on other Google products : more than half use Google Scholar , for example , and Google 's mapping and e-mail applications are also popular ( see ' Which Google products do you use ? ' ) .
" The findings are very typical of most countries in the world , " says David Bousfield , London - based vice - president and lead analyst of Outsell , an information and publishing consultancy .
" Google and Google Scholar have become indispensable tools for scientists . "
Science in China would not come to a halt without Google , adds David Nicholas , an Internet researcher at University College London .
But Google " has transformed information - seeking behaviours in academic communities " , and losing such an important research tool would significantly compromise scientists ' efficiency , he says .
Do n't be evil
Operating through a server in mainland China , Google.cn was launched in January 2006 amid intense international criticism .
Its agreement to censor search results that were considered politically sensitive by the Chinese government was seen as contradicting the company 's ' Do n't be evil ' motto .
One of the motivations for creating Google.cn was that although Google.com is accessible in China , it is at the mercy of the mighty Chinese firewalls , which block many overseas websites .
“ Google 's presence has helped the development of civil society in China . ”
If Google.cn is shut down , many fear that the Chinese government may periodically block Google.com itself — as it did before 2006 — or even shut off access to the website completely , if that were deemed politically necessary .
Indeed , after a major riot in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region last July , the government closed down the Internet in the entire province for most of the rest of the year .
Similar restrictions already apply to websites such as Facebook , YouTube and Twitter .
Immensely popular in other parts of the world , they " are irrelevant in China because they are blocked early and thoroughly " , says Gong Li , chairman and chief executive of Mozilla Online , the Beijing - based subsidiary of the Mozilla Corporation , which has its headquarters in Mountain View , California .
This is already hampering the growing number of scientists who use social networking sites to maintain relationships with collaborators .
As one survey respondent wrote , the lack of these sites " has a negative impact on my contact with colleagues all over the world " .
For Chinese scientists seeking out academic papers , there are other options .
According to one respondent : " It does n't matter whether we have Google for science — we have PubMed . "
PubMed , provided by the US National Library of Medicine , is one of many services for searching content in academic databases ; others include the Web of Science from Thomson Reuters and Scopus and ScienceDirect , both run by Elsevier .
However , " many researchers prefer Google as their primary search tool because they can get a large amount and a large variety of information indexed by Google which they can't get easily from any other sources " , says Bousfield .
When ScienceDirect opened its content to Google in March 2007 , for example , the proportion of traffic channelled from Google rose to more than 40 % in the space of a few months , says Nicholas .
" We live in an information era and Google is the key to the door of the global village , " he says .
" Not having Google would be a huge disadvantage , especially for young academics . "

Indeed , 84 % of the scientists who responded to Nature 's survey say that losing Google would " somewhat or significantly " hamper their research ( see ' How much would your research be hampered if you lost access to Google ? ' ) ; 78 % say that international collaborations would be affected to the same degree .
Scientists in the 25 – 34 - year age range were most likely to say that losing Google would " significantly " — rather than " somewhat " — hamper their research .
Nearly half of the survey respondents say that if they lost access to Google 's search engine , they would switch to Baidu , a domestic search engine .
Many non-scientists in China are happy with Baidu and do n't really care whether Google stays or goes .
" Google has little advantage over Baidu on search algorithms for Chinese - language content , " says Guo Liang , an Internet researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing .
But it is much less useful for academics doing English - language searches for material outside China .
Guo 's research shows that , despite Baidu 's dominance in China , Google is much more popular among academics and other highly educated people .
Nature 's survey also found that only 17 % of the respondents use Baidu as their primary search engine .
Searching for answers
Since Drummond 's announcement , both Google China and the Chinese government have remained largely silent on the search engine 's future in China , and both declined to provide comment for this article .
As Nature went to press , The Wall Street Journal reported that discussions would resume this week between Google representatives and Chinese officials , but that any resolution would be weeks away .
Opinions in the Chinese media range from assertions that the row will blow over , to suggestions that Google will be forced out because the government would never allow an unfiltered search engine to operate in China .
Some scientists in Nature 's survey think the government would be justified in shutting down Google .
" I do n't like the Internet policy of our country , " wrote one respondent , " but the sovereignty and authority of our country are more important to me .
Google must obey the laws of China if they want to do business in China . "
Others , including Gong , think that Google will be the one to pull the plug on its Chinese search engine , because the limited profit from the Chinese market is simply not worth jeopardizing its reputation as a trustworthy and ethical corporation .

But Guobin Yang , an Internet researcher at Barnard College in New York City , argues that Google.cn has a responsibility to stay .
" People have been largely focusing on how the filtered content has limited access to certain information , " he says .
" But Google 's presence has also helped the development of civil society in China " because it equips citizens with the information they need to be more politically active .
As one of the survey respondents put it : " If I lose Google , it will [ be ] just like a man without his eyes . "

The Michigan Messenger happened upon a vendor selling " Straight Pride " T - shirts at a rally of the Tea Party Express in Lansing , Michigan :
" The person selling the t- shirts told the Michigan Messenger that his company — the name of the company could not be made out on the tape due to a loud blast of noise , but it ended in ' free media ' — was an official sponsor and financial supporter of the Tea Party Express , saying that they typically give 10 - 15 percent of their sales to the organization .
He wore a button saying ' official sponsor . ' …
Gay advocacy groups say the shirts are reminiscent of the ' white pride ' slogan adopted by racist groups who oppose equality .
' It ’s like white supremacy , ' says Penny Gardner , president of the Lansing Association for Human Rights , a Lansing area lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights group .
' It ’s as if they are saying the idea of supremacy is some how the American way .
The American way is about equality , and equality is all we ’re looking for . ' "
Said Marilyn Vogler , spokesperson for the Democratic Party ’s LGBTA Caucus : “ It is clear from events at the April 10 Tea Party Express rally on our capitol steps in Lansing that homophobia and racism are alive and well in Michigan .
The day was hi-lighted by stark black and white ’ straight pride ’ shirts , calls to impeach Obama , a poster with a black hand holding a knife stabbing the Statue of Liberty .
Certainly , Tea Party folk have a right to express their opinions , but homophobia and racism should not be tolerated , least of all by our elected officials . ”

Not all polyps will turn into cancer A brief one - off screening test could prevent thousands of people dying from bowel cancer every year , a study published in the Lancet suggests .
There are now calls for the test to be rolled out across the UK after results from 200,000 people aged 55 - 64 found it cut deaths by 43 % over 10 years .
Cancer Research UK described the results from the Imperial College , London , study as a " rare breakthrough " .
Independent advisers will consider the test , the Department of Health says .
The independent bowel cancer screening committee will discuss whether it would be cost - effective to incorporate the procedure - known as sigmoidoscopy - into the UK 's screening programmes .
Scientists from Imperial College , London , who carried out the research , argue the costs would be outweighed by the savings generated through reducing the incidence of the disease , the UK 's second biggest cancer killer .
Simple test Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The current screening method for bowel cancer looks for traces of blood in the stools , one of the key symptoms of colorectal cancer .
If this is found , the patient is referred for further investigation .
This test - using a flexible scope little wider than a pen to find and remove polyps , the precursors to cancer - is believed to reduce the death rates from the disease by 25 % for those who use it .
But by finding and removing polyps - the mainly symptomless growths which can become cancerous - a sigmoidoscopy could stop the disease developing in the first place in the lower bowel .
Two thirds of colorectal cancers occur here .
Easier to conduct than a colonoscopy , which is not suitable for the general population because it requires sedation and can be a lengthy process because the entire bowel must be examined , a sigmoidoscopy can be carried out by a nurse and does not require any pain relief .
Laxatives are taken in advance to clear the bowel .
A one - off examination of over 40,000 men and women aged between 55 and 64 in which any polyps were detected and removed reduced the number of cases of the disease by one third , and deaths by 43 % , when compared with a group who received no intervention .
It seems likely to reduce colon cancer mortality considerably if it is made widely available
Professor Jon Rhodes
British Society of Gastroenterology
They were followed for an average of 11 years , and lead researcher Professor Wendy Atkin said the results showed people would only need one test in a lifetime .
Combined with the existing blood test to detect any cancers developing further up the colon , " thousands of lives could be saved " , she said .
Some 16,000 people die from bowel cancer every year .
If the results of this study were extrapolated , about 3,000 would be saved .
Researchers calculate that one life would be saved for every 400 people screened , which compares favourably with breast cancer screening - where the figures are 500 mammograms for every life saved .
The main cost would be recruiting the specialist nurses needed to carry out the examination .
" We do n't often use the word breakthrough , but there is a tremendous opportunity to use this procedure to push bowel cancer back down the league table of cancer cases in the UK , " said Harpal Kumar , head of Cancer Research UK , which helped fund the research .
" Cancer Research UK is calling on the next government to add the test to the existing national bowel screening programme as one of its first priorities .
" Such a programme , backed by all UK governments , would save thousands of lives , whilst also saving the NHS money . "
Bowel Cancer UK has also called for the test to be added to the existing screening programme .
And Professor Jon Rhodes , of the British Society of Gastroenterology , described the results as " very exciting " .
The British Society of Gastroenterology would welcome the establishment of early pilot centres to establish further data on service delivery and uptake in routine NHS practice , " he said .

Grab your peanuts and steroids , it ’s Opening Day of baseball season .
And as tradition dictates , the President tossed the first pitch .
As one might have guessed , his throw went left — way left — and it was uglier than Don Mossi :
And in honor of Opening Day , The Daily Caller presents this hilarious chain email we received some time ago comparing the pitching styles of President George W. Bush and President Barack H. Obama .
It has a couple strikes against it what with the spelling errors .
Otherwise , however , the comparison is a homerun .
We know President Obama takes a lot of abuse for his throwing arm , so kudos to him for continuing the presidential tradition … even if it makes us cringe .
When most of us last saw Wesley Snipes , he was n’t in his usual position as a hero on a movie screen .
Instead , he was inhabiting a far less savory role , starring as both a news headline and late - night punch line .
Back in 2006 , Snipes was brought up on enough tax - related charges to keep a fleet of IRS agents busy for years : conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government , aiding and abetting the making of a fraudulent claim for payment and willfully failing to file a number of tax returns .
He was acquitted on all felony counts but found guilty on several misdemeanor charges and sentenced to three years in jail ; he is currently appealing , and is out on bail and free to travel for work .
But one of Hollywood ’s most compelling subjects is now attempting a comeback -- in the peculiar way that only he can -- with “ Brooklyn ’s Finest , ” a bloody ensemble crime drama directed by Antoine Fuqua ( “ Training Day ” ) .
In the Overture Films release , which hits theaters Friday , Snipes plays Cassanova Valentine , a former drug kingpin who ’s trying to go straight but whom the feds are determined to bust anyway , using an undercover cop ( Don Cheadle ) to do the deed .
“ Part of what makes the character work is that it ’s immediately identifiable in the arc of my career , ” Snipes says .
“ And in the arc of my life . ”
IRS controversies aside , the Cassanova role serves as a bookend of sorts to Snipes ’ iconic Nino Brown character from “ New Jack City ” ( 1991 ) .
The difference is that instead of the megalomaniacal crime lord he played in that urban classic , Snipes ’ new character sits at the other end of the pipe , a man who ’s lived too hard and seen too much to want anything but out .
It ’s a small part , but one that illustrates the movie ’s twin themes of redemption and one ’s inability to escape the past .
The Cassanova part is Snipes ’ first mainstream theatrical movie in six years .
But in his inimitably quirky way , the 47 - year - old actor says he is n’t necessarily using his turn in the film , or the curiosity factors about the parallels to his own life , to land studio parts .
Instead , his grand ambition these days is to become a . . .
Web animation producer ?
On an unseasonably warm February day at a beach - side restaurant in Santa Monica , Snipes is n’t exactly dressed for a dip in the pool .
Dressed in a hat that ’s cocked Andre 3000 - style , a black sweater and bespoke leather coat , Snipes bites into a hearty meal of sausage and eggs , though , since this is Wesley Snipes , there is an unexpected touch as he drinks the very un-action hero beverage of hot chocolate .
Snipes ’ story would be improbable enough even if the last four years did n’t happen .
A classically trained theater actor who made his early mark two decades ago in comedies such as “ Major League ” and “ White Men Ca n’t Jump , ” Snipes got a boost from Spike Lee , who cast him in " " Jungle Fever ” and “ Mo’ Better Blues , ” then won a professional golden ticket as Hollywood made him a go - to action star in studio vehicles such as “ Passenger 57 , ” “ Rising Sun ” and eventually the “ Blade ” trilogy .
Then , four years ago , it all went south .
After his high - profile tax troubles , Snipes became an unlikely poster - child for the anti-tax movement and was essentially ostracized by Hollywood .
Fuqua acknowledged in an interview that casting Snipes in “ Brooklyn ’s Finest ” was a struggle because some financiers were worried about his legal status .
But the director says he was determined to put Snipes in the film because while watching the television reports of his tax trouble he was struck by how “ it paralleled so perfectly ” what happens to the Cassanova character .
“ I did n’t want a guy who yells and screams .
I wanted someone you feel fear but also sympathy , ” Fuqua says .
“ And then I saw Wesley going through what he was going through and I thought ‘ This is a guy who ’s living it right now . ’ ”
So it ’s probably not surprising that Snipes sounds a little aggrieved with how the last few years have gone .
But his tone is more complex , at once penitent and defiant , humble and grandiose .
He bows at the end of the interview , like a martial - arts fighter -- which , oh yes , he also happens to be -- and thanks a reporter for his time .
“ You try to be liquid , try to be like water , like Bruce [ Lee ] says , ” when asked how he ’s been coping with the criticism .
“ Some things you just let flow around you , some things you just redirect back . ”
Then he sharpens the knives .
“ Sometimes you just sit and be patient and wait , and if you sit by the river long enough sometimes you see the bodies of your enemies floating by . ”
Thoughtful , articulate and flagrantly theatrical , Snipes is too savvy to place blame on anyone but himself .
But it ’s clear that he feels Hollywood was too quick to judge him and still believes the government made an example of him .
In a gesture at once sincere and conscious , he shoulders the blame -- sort of .
“ Going through the trial woke me up to the significance of what I do , ” he says .
" [ The government ] said it was the largest and biggest and most important tax case .
And I thought ‘ Really ?
What am I missing here ?
Why would you say that , just because I make movies ? ’
That was a wake - up call . ”
Snipes tried not to let those troubles get in the way of work , though the kind of work he ’s been doing wo n’t get him invited to the Oscars any time soon .
Snipes has been off in Africa and Asia making movies for people who , in some cases , in Snipes ’ words , “ use filmmaking like they ’re selling toasters , toothbrushes or henna on the beach .
You read some of what the fans are saying , things like ‘ Why is he now doing the B - movies ? ’ and I was like ‘ My man .
That ’s not my preference .’ ”
Fuqua decided to take a chance on him as a drug dealer opposite a host of cops in “ Brooklyn ’s Finest . ”
Snipes is part of the interlocking puzzle that has Richard Gere as a burnt - out cop on the verge of retirement , Ethan Hawke as a desperate officer trying to pilfer cash from an arrest to help his family and Cheadle ’s undercover officer trying to attain a promotion ( and thrust into the morally questionable position of ratting out Snipes ’ Cassanova despite the pair ’s long - standing friendship ) .
With the part , Snipes says , “ it ’s good to be welcomed home . ”
And Cheadle said in an interview that Snipes has “ got a real good soul , and he should get more shots ” because of this film .
But Snipes said he is n’t really that interested in studio parts .
Instead , he ’s developing a series of Web animation shorts called “ Omandi Mech 5 " that he “ wants to scale out like ‘ Transformers ’ or ‘ Star Wars , ’ ” although , after watching one , those comparisons feel like a bit of a stretch .
Turning to his personal life , Snipes can sound almost monkish .
“ I ’m at a really good place .
I ’ve reduced a lot of the stress in my life .
I ’ve gotten rid of a lot of things .
The light was turned on and a lot of the cockroaches started spinning .
I swept them out the door .
And sometimes you just have to throw things out because they carry a certain energy .
Reboot .
It ’s time to reboot . ”

COLUMBIA , Missouri ( Reuters ) - Robert Kremer , a U.S. government microbiologist who studies Midwestern farm soil , has spent two decades analyzing the rich dirt that yields billions of bushels of food each year and helps the United States retain its title as breadbasket of the world .
Missouri corn and soybean farmer Neal Bredehoeft shows a sample of BioTech seed corn , which is sold by the kernel instead of the sack , bushel or pound at his century - old family farm outside Blackburn , Missouri April 8 , 2010 .
Each sack contains more than 80,000 kernels .

Kremer ’s lab is housed at the University of Missouri and is literally in the shadow of Monsanto Auditorium , named after the $ 11.8 billion - a- year agricultural giant Monsanto Co..
Based in Creve Coeur , Missouri , the company has accumulated vast wealth and power creating chemicals and genetically altered seeds for farmers worldwide .
But recent findings by Kremer and other agricultural scientists are raising fresh concerns about Monsanto ’s products and the Washington agencies that oversee them .
The same seeds and chemicals spread across millions of acres of U.S. farmland could be creating unforeseen problems in the plants and soil , this body of research shows .
Kremer , who works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) , is among a group of scientists who are turning up potential problems with glyphosate , the key ingredient in Monsanto ’s Roundup and the most widely used weed - killer in the world .
“ This could be something quite big .
We might be setting up a huge problem , ” said Kremer , who expressed alarm that regulators were not paying enough attention to the potential risks from biotechnology on the farm , including his own research .
Concerns range from worries about how nontraditional genetic traits in crops could affect human and animal health to the spread of herbicide - resistant weeds .
Biotech crop supporters say there is a wealth of evidence that the crops on the market are safe , but critics argue that after only 14 years of commercialized GMOs , it is still unclear whether or not the technology has long - term adverse effects .
Whatever the point of view on the crops themselves , there are many people on both sides of the debate who say that the current U.S. regulatory apparatus is ill - equipped to adequately address the concerns .
Indeed , many experts say the U.S. government does more to promote global acceptance of biotech crops than to protect the public from possible harmful consequences .
“ We do n’t have a robust enough regulatory system to be able to give us a definitive answer about whether these crops are safe or not .
We simply are n’t doing the kinds of tests we need to do to have confidence in the safety of these crops , ” said Doug Gurian - Sherman , a scientist who served on a FDA biotech advisory subcommittee from 2002 to 2005 .
“ The U.S. response ( to questions about biotech crop safety ) has been an extremely patronizing one .
They say ‘ We know best , trust us , ’ ” added Gurian - Sherman , now a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , a nonprofit environmental group .
CALL FOR CHANGE
The World Health Organization has not taken a stand on biotech crops generally , simply stating “ individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case - by - case basis . ”
And while many scientists around the world cite research they say shows health and environmental risks tied to GMOs , many other scientists say research proves the crops are no different than conventional types .
With a growing world population and a need to increase food production in poor nations , confidence in the regulatory system in the leading biotech crop country is considered critical .
“ One of the things that we think is important to do is to have regular reviews and updates of our strategies for regulating products of biotechnology , ” said Roger Beachy , a biotech crop supporter who was appointed last year as director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture .
“ We want to look carefully to see that they are logical and science - based but still maintain the confidence of the consumer to ensure that the projects that are developed and released have the highest level of oversight , ” added Beachy .
So far , that confidence has been lacking .
Courts have cited regulators for failing to do their jobs properly and advisers and auditors have sought sweeping changes .
Even Wall Street has taken note .
In January , shares in Monsanto fell more than 3 percent amid a rush of hedging activity during a morning trading session after a report by European scientists in the International Journal of Biological Sciences found signs of toxicity in the livers and kidneys of rats fed the company ’s biotech corn .
Monsanto has said the European study had “ unsubstantiated conclusions , ” and says it is confident its products are well tested and safe .
Indeed , farmers around the world seem to be embracing biotech crops that have been altered to resist bugs and tolerate weed - killing treatments while yielding more .
According to an industry report issued in February , 14 million farmers in 25 countries planted biotech crops on 330 million acres in 2009 , with the United States alone accounting for 158 million acres .
REGULATORY ODDITIES
A common complaint is that the U.S. government conducts no independent testing of these biotech crops before they are approved , and does little to track their consequences after .
The developers of these crop technologies , including Monsanto and its chief rival DuPont , tightly curtail independent scientists from conducting their own studies .
Because the companies patent their genetic alterations , outsiders are barred from testing the biotech seeds without company approvals .
Unlike several other countries , including France , Japan and Germany , the United States has never passed a law for regulating genetically modified crop technologies .
Rather , the government has tried to incorporate regulation into laws already in existence before biotech crops were developed .
The result is a system that treats a genetically modified fish as a drug subject to Federal Drug Administration oversight , and a herbicide - tolerant corn seed as a potential “ pest ” that needs to be regulated by USDA ’s Animal Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) before its sale to farmers .
The process is also costly and time - consuming for biotech crop developers , which might need to go through three different regulators before commercializing a new product .
Nina Fedoroff , a special adviser on science and technology to the U.S. State Department , which promotes GMO adoption overseas , said even though she is confident that biotech crops are ultimately safe and highly beneficial for agriculture and food production , an improved regulatory framework could help boost confidence in the products .
“ We preach to the world about science - based regulations but really our regulations on crop biotechnology are not yet science - based , ” said Fedoroff in an interview .
“ They are way , way out of date .
In many countries scientists are much better represented at the government ranks than they are here . ”
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , a former governor of top U.S. corn producing state Iowa , also said he recognizes change is needed .
The USDA is in fact developing new rules for regulating genetically modified crops but the process has dragged out now for more than six years amid heavy lobbying from corporate interests and consumer and environmental groups .
“ There is no question that our rules and regulations have to be modernized , ” Vilsack told Reuters .
“ The more information you find out , the more you have to look at your regulations to make sure they are doing what they have to do .
There are some issues we are still grappling with . ”

UNDER ATTACK
Fourteen years after commercialization of the world ’s first biotech crop , the trio of U.S. regulatory agencies charged with overseeing biotech crops -- USDA , the Environmental Protection Agency , and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- are under attack on several fronts .
The USDA is most directly in the line of fire after a string of federal court decisions found its officials acted illegally or carelessly in approving some biotech crops .
In one recent case , a federal court banned the sale of a herbicide - tolerant alfalfa engineered by Monsanto until the government more thoroughly evaluates its safety .
U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer of the Northern District of California ruled that the USDA violated federal law in allowing unrestricted commercial planting of “ Roundup Ready ” alfalfa -- a key livestock fodder -- without a solid review .
Breyer ordered the USDA to prepare an environmental impact statement that explores potential negative consequences that critics say could include contamination of non-GMO alfalfa fields .
The spread of herbicide - tolerant weeds is also a concern and is a mounting problem that has been reported across the United States in many key farming areas .
Monsanto has appealed the ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case on April 27 , marking the first time the high court has taken up biotech crop concerns .
Meanwhile , the USDA recently completed its Environmental Impact Statement and took public comments on the report through early March .
The department has yet to issue a final report .
In a similar case , a federal court found that sugarbeets altered to be “ Roundup Ready ” were approved without adequate USDA evaluation .
U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey
White said the government ’s decision to deregulate Roundup Ready sugar beets “ may significantly affect the environment ” and he encouraged growers to “ take all efforts , going forward , to use conventional seed . ”
Judge
White declined to immediately ban all GMO sugarbeet plantings , but said he would consider a permanent injunction at a hearing on July 9 .
Andrew Kimbrell , executive director of the Center for Food Safety , which filed the sugarbeet lawsuit , said the court actions should be a “ wakeup call ” for the U.S. government .
“ They will not be allowed to ignore the biological pollution and economic impacts of gene - altered crops .
The courts have made it clear that USDA ’s job is to protect America ’s farmers and consumers , not the interests of Monsanto , ” he said .
The USDA , EPA and FDA say they work hard to ensure that crops produced through genetic engineering ( GE ) for commercial use are properly tested and studied to make sure they pose no significant risk to consumers or the environment .
But a November 2008 report by the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress , cited several problems .
Among the shortcomings mentioned in the report is a lack of a coordinated program to determine whether the “ spread of genetic traits is causing undesirable effects on the environment , non -GE segments of agriculture , or food safety . ”
The GAO took the FDA to task for not requiring companies like Monsanto and other GMO developers to notify the agency before selling new products , relying on only voluntary notice .
It recommended the FDA publicize the results of food safety assessments of genetically engineered crops and advised the three agencies to develop a risk - based strategy to monitor use of GE crops .
But more than a year later , most of the recommendations remain unimplemented , according to Lisa Shames , director of the natural resources and environment arm of the GAO .
“ We can only influence agencies to take action .
We ca n’t compel them to , ” she said .
OVERHAUL EYED AMID PROTESTS
Since 1987 , the USDA has overseen genetically modified organisms through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service .
APHIS ’s Biotechnology Regulatory Services ( BRS ) regulates GE organisms based on “ plant pest risk . ”
Monsanto and other biocrop developers must petition APHIS to grant their genetically altered organisms “ nonregulated status ” -- that is , permission to grow these plants without official oversight .
To win approval , the companies must demonstrate that their tests show the new varieties do not pose a risk to plant health .
“ APHIS grants nonregulated status only when it determines that the new genetically engineered variety is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk , ” said USDA spokesman Michael Pina , who labeled the current regulatory system “ strong . ”
USDA has said it wants to make changes that ensure safety while making the process more transparent to the public , and more efficient and easier for the companies developing the technologies to navigate .
Still , the USDA has been formally debating regulatory changes for more than six years and issued proposed new rules in fall 2008 , allowing public comment through last summer , as it must under the law .
The proposed overhaul drew more than 15,000 comments , many of them expressing fears that the regulatory changes as laid out would not address key concerns .
In one public comment , physician Amy Dean , a board member for the research and education group American Academy of Environmental Medicine which is seeking a moratorium on GM food , said the proposed changes would “ significantly weaken or eliminate oversight of GM crops . ”
And Robert Peterson , a Montana State University scientist and leader of the university ’s “ biological risk assessment ” program , told regulators that while he agreed with some of the proposed regulatory changes , he thought the agency ’s risk assessment protocols were “ fundamentally flawed . ”
“ Recent research reveals that the approach advocated by APHIS is not scientifically sound and can lead to bad decisions , ” Peterson said .
At the FDA , genetically engineered organisms are treated much the same as foods from all other plant varieties .
GE developers are not required to consult with FDA on safety issues , and the agency sees no need now for risk - based monitoring efforts for GE crops because there are no current safety concerns , FDA spokeswoman Rita Chappelle said .
The agency stressed that the burden for ensuring safety lies with the companies .
“ Manufacturers have an obligation to ensure that their products continue to be safe each and every day , ” Chappelle said .
At the EPA , officials also say the burden of proof is with the corporate developers of the technology .
And they say they have at least 20 scientists conducting comprehensive analyses for the products that come before the agency , such as BT corn and BT cotton , which are altered to protect the plants against pests .
The agency also routinely seeks outside advice from experts who sit on its scientific advisory panels .
Over the last several months , the EPA has also started allowing more public input into its review of new products .
“ Transparency and open government is a major priority of the Obama administration .
We are adding a significant amount of public participation , ” said Keith Matthews , acting director of the U.S. Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division .
Further to its mission of environmental protection , EPA officials said the agency reviews products every 15 years for adverse effects .
EPA senior policy advisor Bill Jordan said glyphosate , the popular weed - killing chemical , could come under review soon .
“ We have an ongoing responsibility to make sure products that are in the marketplace continue to meet the safety standards of the pesticide law , ” he said .
“ We have a program called registration review .
Sometime soon we ’ll be getting to glyphosate .
I would expect that we would look at emerging research on its environmental effects and see whether that leads us to change the terms and conditions of registration or limit its use in some way . ”
Concerns about genetically altered crops and the lack of broad testing hit a boiling point last year .
In February 2009 , 26 leading academic entomologists -- scientists specializing in insects -- issued a public statement to the Environmental Protection Agency complaining that they were restricted from doing independent research by technology agreements Monsanto and other companies attach to every bag of biotech seed they sell .
The agreements disallow any research that is not first approved by the companies .
“ No truly independent research can be legally conducted on many critical questions regarding the technology , ” the scientists said in their statement .
University of Minnesota entomologist Ken Ostlie , who co-authored the statement , said some of the concerns involve corn engineered to resist corn rootworm pests .
Biotech corn crops in Minnesota , Iowa , and parts of Wisconsin and South Dakota harvested last fall showed damage and disease , and some fear the biotech corn could sicken livestock .
“ We do n’t know if something is going on with the plant and the technology or with the insect .
We just know things did n’t work the way they were supposed to , ” said Ostlie .
“ It would be nice to have independently verifiable information going into EPA ’s decision - making beyond just what the company provides . ”
Christian Krupke , an entomologist at Purdue University , said the technology engineered into the plants has many benefits , but more research is needed on effects .
“ We are all fans of this technology .
The problem is we are not getting access to ask the questions that need to be asked that maybe the companies do n’t want to ask , ” Krupke said .
BACKLASH ABROAD
A backlash against biotech crops has swept many countries .
India became one of the latest hot spots in February when biotech opponents created such an uprising that the Environment Minister , Jairam Ramesh , blocked the release of a genetically modified eggplant made by Monsanto .
India already allows planting of altered cotton , but Ramesh said there was not enough public trust to support the introduction of a GM food crop until more research was done .
Among the critics of the engineered eggplant was Tiruvadi Jagadisan , a former managing director of Monsanto ’s India operations .
In an interview with Reuters , Jagadisan , who worked with Monsanto for 18 years , said he believed there were “ very many legitimate concerns about the safety of GM food crops for humans , animals and the environment . ”
He said Monsanto did not give “ accurate information to the public ” about its eggplant .
“ No extensive tests have been done to assess the effect of consuming GM crops on future generations , ” Jagadisan said , an assertion common among critics , but one Monsanto has repeatedly denied .
Monsanto called Jagadisan ’s assertions “ baseless ” and said India ’s regulatory regime requires “ extensive and rigid crop safety assessments , following strict scientific protocols . ”
The state department ’s Fedoroff , a supporter of Monsanto ’s technology , called the incident “ one little setback ” to gaining worldwide acceptance of biotech crops .
She said with rising food prices and population growth , biotech crop technology will become increasingly important , and criticisms of Monsanto and its technology were unfair .
“ They ’ve certainly made mistakes but they ’ve done a whole lot more good than harm .
They are investing more in crop improvements than our government is , ” she said .
SEEKING ANSWERS
Back in his USDA laboratory , Kremer ’s assigned government work is focused on general soil quality .
As a side project in support of that research , he has spent the last several years studying soil and plant growth tests that appear to show ravaged root systems in biotech “ Roundup Ready ” plants .
The crops have been subjected to glyphosate applications and on the surface appear to be impervious to the weed - killing treatments as the genetic alteration allows .
But the roots seem to tell a different story .
“ This is supposed to be a wonderful tool for the farmer ... but in many situations it may actually be a detriment , ” Kremer said .
“ We have glyphosate released into the soil which appears to be affecting root growth and root - associated microbes .
We need to understand what is the long - term trend here , ” he said .
The development of crops engineered to tolerate glyphosate spurred a surge in use of the chemical -- an extra 383 million pounds were sold from 1996 to 2008 , according to a report released by The Organic Center ( TOC ) , the Union for Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) and the Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) .
Monsanto says the chemical binds tightly to most types of soil , is not harmful and does not harm the crops .
But some scientists say there are indications of increased root fungal disease as well as nutrient deficiencies in Roundup Ready crops .
They say manganese deficiency in soybeans in particular appears to be an issue in key farming areas that include Indiana , Michigan , Kansas and Wisconsin .
Outside researchers have also raised concerns over the years that glyphosate use may be linked to cancer , miscarriages and other health problems in people .
Monsanto says extensive research shows glyphosate is safe for humans and the environment , and has an entire section on its website devoted to refuting the reports .
Monsanto says extensive investigation of questions about changes in soil micro-organisms has found no long - term ill effects .
Peering into his petri dishes , Kremer is n’t so sure .
“ Science is not being considered in policy setting and deregulation , ” said Kremer .
“ This research is important .
We need to be vigilant . ”

A block of 86 lines of C# code is creating a buzz online following claims it may make BitTorrent downloads untraceable .
The code , sweetly named SeedFucker , is actually an exploit discovered last November that would allow a BitTorent user to fake the IP address of a server from where a file could be downloaded .
It could also be used to flood a BitTorrent with dozens of fake peers .
The sudden interest in the exploit follows measures in a new UK law , passed last week , where ISPs may be obliged to provide IP addresses to the authorities of files that are said to be infringing copyright .
Since the Digital Economy Bill passed in a heavily criticised “ wash - up ” process in the final Parliamentary session before a general election , coders have been working hard on developing a new generation of download software that will make it impossible even for ISPs to identify where files are being stored .
It is unlikely that SeedFucker in its current form would achieve that goal , but the exploit itself has coders excited about the possibilities of a truly anonymous downloading system .
Of course , this is not the first time that heavy - handed action on the part of the authorities has caused a rapid evolution in software used to spread files around the Internet .
Most famously , Napster was shutdown by the music industry because it allowed people to share and download music files .
The weak point in that case was Napster ’s own servers which made the connections between users and files .
No sooner had Napster been taken down than a new method of file sharing , BitTorrent , was rapidly adopted .
BitTorrent allows people to share files held on their hard drives across the Internet in very small pieces , with every person downloading each piece also becoming a source for download so long as they maintain an Internet connection .
( The Napster shutdown also led to a big increase in size of the so - called Dark Net where private Internets are set up and taken down outside the view of any authorities ) .
The BitTorrent iteration led to extensive efforts to shut down websites that held the initial seed files needed to start a download , with mixed success .
The Pirate Bay became the target of international pressure after it thumbed its nose at both the music and film industries after broadband speeds made the exchange of video files a practical reality .
The organization ’s website was briefly taken down after a raid by the Swedish authorities .
With companies now determinedly lobbying governments to force the providers of Internet access themselves – ISPs – to provide details of exchanged files , coders are working on ways to further anonymize the process .
How successful that approach will be , or whether it is an inevitability given enough time , we shall have to see , but watching the enthusiasm surrounding SeedFucker , it is certain that if a solution is found it will rapidly make a mockery of the laws hurriedly passed without sufficient democratic review last week .
And after that , where then ?
Legally enforced requirements for software to use specific port numbers ?
Mandatory use of iPads so only Steve Jobs can decide what you can use the Internet for ?
Who knows ? ®
While pruning a tree on the grounds of a hotel where he worked , Peter Aspinall , 64 , sawed off the branch that his ladder was leaning on .
He fell and suffered injuries that required surgery .
Now he 's sued the hotel .
From The Telegraph :
He took the action after health and safety inspectors concluded the hotel failed to carry out a risk assessment on the dangers of pruning .
They also said that his employer should have given him training on where to place the ladder …
David Walton , mitigating , said the hotel owner , Jan Hampton , was not on the premises at the time and would have ensured the task was carried out by specialist tree surgeons if she had been .
" They proceeded to cut the branch that the ladder was leaning against .
It is an unusual accident .
Laurel and Hardy do this sort of thing , " he said .
Earth Day ’s 40th Celebration
Al Gore is a noted politician and a dedicated environmentalist who is dedicated to the cause of the environmental degradation .
He is associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , for which he has even won the Nobel Prize for Peace .
An Inconvenient Truth was a documentary movie on the issue of climate change due to a number of natural and anthropogenic factors .
The movie became an instant success and brought up the issue of climate change to the forefront .
For this reason Al Gore became extremely famous as he was directly involved in the making of the movie .
Al Gore became the champion for the cause of saving the environment from further degradation .
The film An Inconvenient Truth became a roaring success in the United States .
The average American citizen became bothered about issues like carbon footprint , consumption , and new terms like sustainable development , and ozone hole entered into the average citizen ’s vocabulary .
Al Gore is also associated with his own association , the Alliance for Climate Protection .
The 40th anniversary of Earth Day is fast approaching , on April 22nd , 2010 .
For this occasion , the Alliance for Climate Protection , headed by ex U.S Vice President Al Gore is encouraging videos related to environmental causes in the form of Video Volunteers on YouTube which is a free video streaming and video sharing website .
People are being encouraged to take videos and post them on Video Volunteers on YouTube .
Videos should ideally be short in length , inspiring , and obviously , be related to climate change .

A few months ago , while trying to troubleshoot a failing hard drive in my girlfriend 's computer , I inadvertently reversed the power connector to it .
There was a popping sound , accompanied by a spark and then the smell of acrid smoke .
I had managed to explode one of the integrated controller chips !
Here you can see the chunk that blew out of the chip as well as the burned trace and melted solder point .
Whoops .

Published : Apr 5 , 2008
Conservationists in Kenya have warned that the country 's endangered population of lions could be wiped out unless the authorities start paying cattle herders in the area more money .
Masai tribesmen are threatening to kill the lions that are attacking their cattle - when herds have already been decimated by drought .
Peter Greste reports .
Andrey Ternovskiy , an eighteen - year - old high - school dropout from Moscow , has a variety of explanations for why he created the Web site Chatroulette.com .
According to one story , he got bored talking to people he already knew on Skype ; according to another , it was a fund - raising ploy for a bike trip from Moscow to Amsterdam .
The most reliable version , however , centers on a shop called Russian Souvenirs .
It is an upscale outfit owned by Ternovskiy ’s uncle Sasha , who hired his nephew to work there as a salesman during the summer of 2008 , five days a week , eleven hours a day .
Ternovskiy was supposed to show foreign tourists around the shop , pulling various nesting dolls , lacquered boxes , and kitschy Soviet paraphernalia from the bright vitrines .
The job was easy but exhilarating .
“ I was really excited to work there , because I met , like , hundreds of different nations in a day , ” Ternovskiy said recently at a coffee shop near his mother ’s apartment , in the far reaches of northwestern Moscow .
He is thin and nervous , with light sprays of acne on his cheeks and a fuzz of dark - blond hair .
He has a hard time making eye contact and learned English by spending thousands of hours chatting online , but he says that his passion is talking with people and “ exploring other cultures . ”
Selling souvenirs to foreign tourists was an ideal job for Ternovskiy .
He worked tirelessly , and began to learn German , Spanish , Italian , French , and even some Turkish .
He memorized the numbers and some key phrases .
By the second week , he could size up a customer ’s nationality and address him in his own tongue .
He did n’t , however , take quite as well to the business side of things .
He would talk and joke with the tourists , but he did n’t push them to buy anything .
If someone asked for a discount , he happily obliged .
This rankled his uncle , but Ternovskiy did n’t see the problem .
“ I could n’t just make people pay the money , ” he says , laughing .
“ I just could n’t feel the value of the money . ”
He was fired within a month .
The following summer , Ternovskiy holed up at home and began to toy with the code for a new site that would re-create the atmosphere of the store .
It took him three days to construct a basic version .
A few months later , it was one of the most talked - about social - networking sites in the world .
The idea is simple .
When you log on to Chatroulette.com , you see a sparse white window with two boxes .
One box shows your own image , courtesy of your Webcam ; the other is for the face of what the site calls , somewhat ambiguously , a “ partner . ”
When Partner appears , you can stay and talk using your voice or your keyboard , or you can click “ Next , ” which whips you on to someone new .
The point is to introduce you to people you ’d never otherwise meet and will never see again — the dancing Korean girls , the leopard - printed Catman , the naked man in Gdansk .
More than a million people , most of them from the United States , clog Chatroulette ’s servers daily .
To “ next ” someone has become a common transitive verb .
Catman is an Internet celebrity , as is Merton the improvising pianist .
Brooklyn bars throw Chatroulette parties , an indie band has used the site to début an album , and the Texas attorney general has warned parents to keep their children far , far away .
Hundreds of articles and blog posts have asked whether Chatroulette is a fad or a good investment , and if it will change Internet culture forever .
“ The Daily Show ” ’s Jon Stewart attempted to take his pants off for the NBC anchor Brian Williams while Chatrouletting on the air .
A visit to Chatroulette usually begins with a few rushed clicks of the “ Next ” button , either out of a sense of danger — do you really want to engage with that empty - eyed guy lounging in bed ?
— or out of curiosity about what ’s around the corner .
The site can be especially hard on men .
The majority of Chatroulette users are male and under thirty - five , and many of them are trolling for girls , so they “ next ” each other at barbaric rates .
When you do decide to stop and engage , things can get a little awkward .
On one of my first Chatrouletting attempts , I found myself talking to a man from Lyons , who had muted the sound .
We watched each other typing and reacting to the words that scrolled next to our images , co-stars in a postmodern silent film .
There are some unsavory things on Chatroulette : copulating couples , masturbators , a man who has hanged himself ( it ’s fake ) .
When the actor Ashton Kutcher was in Moscow in February , as part of a U.S. State Department technology delegation , he berated Ternovskiy for what his stepdaughter had seen on the site .
“ You ’ve got to clean this up ! ” he said .
( Within twenty - four hours , Ternovskiy made it vastly easier for the site to cut off offensive users . )
But the YouTube videos that people have recorded of their trips through the Chatroulette vortex also show a lot of joy .
There is , for example , the video of the dancing banana , crudely drawn on lined paper , exhorting people to “ Dance or gtfo ! ” ( Dance or get the fuck out . )
The banana ’s partners usually respond with wiggling delight .
There ’s also something liberating in the protection that the “ Next ” button provides .
Striking up a conversation with the person next to you on the subway is risky , and potentially time - consuming .
On Chatroulette you can always just disappear .
“ People are , from a gut , instinctual level , so interested in finding each other .
You see the lonely in people , ” says Scott Heiferman , the founder of Meetup , a site that facilitates in - person meetings for people with common interests .
His site is the antithesis of Chatroulette , yet he finds something deeply compelling in the idea of a blank screen , behind which lies a crowd of strangers waiting to talk to you .
“ It ’s really strange , ” Heiferman says .
“ I have employees I ’ve never had a conversation with , but there I am sitting in my office , dicking around with Chatroulette . ”
The technology behind Chatroulette is fairly basic and not particularly new .
But by combining video - chatting technology and randomization Ternovskiy has bucked a decade - long trend that has made the Internet feel progressively more organized , pleasant , and safe .
Google ( founded in 1998 ) makes sure you pull up less flotsam when you search .
Social networks like Friendster ( 2002 ) , MySpace ( 2003 ) , and Facebook ( 2004 ) let you stay in touch with a network of people you already know .
Privacy settings keep out the ones you do n’t .
Twitter ( 2006 ) feeds you information from sources you choose to follow .
Now Chatroulette has come along and showed us that we want chaos , too .
The best way to talk to Ternovskiy is through some kind of digital intermediary .
Shy and evasive in person , he fills with a wry swagger when he is just a stream of text .
“ They have no business no money blablablabla , ” he typed to me one afternoon , feigning phlegmatic unconcern with the financial woes of an advertiser he ’d been negotiating with — his only one .
Like much of his generation , Ternovskiy has an online persona far more developed than his real one .
He was born on April 22 , 1992 , less than four months after the collapse of the Soviet Union , and grew up in a tidy apartment in a typically dingy Moscow high - rise .
His mother , Elena , is a talented mathematician who works on differential equations at the élite Moscow State University .
His father , Vladimir , is an associate professor of mathematics at the same university , and dabbles in cybernetics .
Their household was loving but turbulent .
The couple fought and frequently separated , and Vladimir started a parallel family , an issue that was never openly discussed .
( “ It ’s a little game we play , ” Elena said of the arrangement . )
Andrey retreated to his room , where , thanks to Vladimir ’s belief that “ the future would have something to do with computers , ” there was always a machine , as up to date as the family could afford .
Vladimir invested great effort in Andrey ’s upbringing , engaging a Chinese tutor , a weight - lifting coach , and a chess teacher .
But most of Andrey ’s learning occurred alone , with his computer .
He started with games , usually of the reality - simulating variety .
By fourth grade , he was writing code .
Like many young Russians with programming skills , Ternovskiy turned to hacking .
When he was eleven , he came upon zloy.org ( which translates as angry.org ) , a hacker forum led by a young man named Sergey ( a.k.a. Terminator ) , who trained his followers in cyber warfare .
Using the handle Flashboy , Ternovskiy soon mastered the art of the denial - of - service attack , wherein a target system is paralyzed by a mass of incoming communication requests .
Next came Web - site and e-mail hacking , a service he gladly performed for girls who asked nicely .
By 2007 , at the age of fifteen , Ternovskiy had learned about what hackers call “ social engineering ” — getting what one wants through deceit or manipulation .
Posing as a teacher , Ternovskiy got access to some practice tests before they were delivered to his school .
As Ternovskiy spent more and more time on the computer , his grades tumbled .
Vladimir , concerned by his son ’s academic languor , hired a graduate student as a math tutor .
But Ternovskiy was often late to the sessions , and , worse , he seemed either unable or unwilling to solve the most basic problems .
“ I just do n’t understand how someone can code and have such big blank spots in math , ” the tutor , Fedor Puchkov , said .
He soon realized , however , that , despite Ternovskiy ’s inability to crack simple problems , the more unusual and visual the problem the more elegant Ternovskiy ’s answer .
Two robots parachute onto an infinite checkered strip ; how do you make them track each other down ?
“ Andrey found the optimal solution , ” Puchkov said .
How do you cut a square into convex pentagons ?
“ Here ’s how Andrey solved it , ” Puchkov said , and sketched a square with two abutting pentagons in the center and lines radiating out cleanly to the perimeter .
It was the simplest solution — and Ternovskiy had come to it far more quickly than Puchkov had .
“ I do n’t know , ” Ternovskiy says of the way he thinks .
“ I quickly get the scheme of how it should work in my head .
I just write out the remaining details , and that ’s all the work .
It ’s probably weird . ”
Puchkov ’s explanation is “ He ’s not stupid — he ’s lazy . ”
The math sessions with Puchkov had no impact on Ternovskiy ’s classroom performance .
The deputy chief of security at his school has a thick file on Ternovskiy ’s delinquencies , including chronic truancy and correcting the English of his English teacher .
His mother recently tried to make peace with the school authorities , but they waved her off , dismissing Ternovskiy as an unwelcome “ millionaire . ”
Ternovskiy , meanwhile , sees school — and college — as a waste of time .
“ The last three years at school , I have n’t done anything , ” he says .
“ I just ca n’t make myself .
There ’s so much interesting stuff in the world , and I have to sit there with textbooks ? ”
By “ the world , ” of course , Ternovskiy means the Internet , which is also where most of his friends are .
His closest confidant is a Russian immigrant named Kirill Gura , who lives in Charleston , West Virginia .
Every night for the past five years , Ternovskiy has turned on his computer , found Kirill on MSN Messenger , and talked to him until one of them fell asleep .
“ He ’s a real friend , ” Ternovskiy says .
Sitting in his carefully engineered workspace — a comfortable chair and two giant monitors placed at the precise distance that Wikipedia says prevents eyestrain and a humped posture — Ternovskiy says that he sees the computer as “ one hundred per cent my window into the world . ”
He does n’t seek much else .
“ I always believed that computer might be that thing that I only need , that I only need that thing to survive , ” he says .
“ It might replace everything . ”
Chatroulette.com was originally called Head - to - Head.org , and it came online on August 2 , 2009 .
Ternovskiy ’s friends did n’t like it , so he advertised on Web forums .
Users trickled in , but the site had glitches , and the name seemed off .
So on November 16th , having recently watched the Russian - roulette scene in “ The Deer Hunter , ” Ternovskiy bought the domain name Chatroulette.com , for seven dollars , and revamped the code .
The site took off when a Brazilian soccer fan posted a notice inviting kindred spirits to mill around and talk about the sport .
Hundreds of them showed up — at their peak , they constituted half of Chatroulette users — but they did n’t talk about soccer ; instead , they took off their clothes .
During the next few months , Ternovskiy introduced an array of features , most of which missed the mark : one - on - one chats in “ rooms ” organized by subject ( this was done away with because users kept encountering the same people ) and a short - lived bulletin board called Lost & Found , which quickly filled up with men whose hearts had been crushed by the “ Next ” button and the people who mocked them .
There was talk of having a reverse button ( for those who regretted a decision to “ next ” ) and of allowing three - way conversations , but the ideas were quickly scrapped for fear of upsetting the already fragile dynamics .
After each mistake , Ternovskiy would move on , and traffic would increase .
In the past three months , Chatroulette had nearly forty - eight million unique visitors .
When I talked to Ternovskiy in Moscow , he was content to see his success as sheer luck .
He had got about ten thousand dollars in investments , mostly from his father , and he was now making fifteen hundred dollars a day in advertising from a Russian dating service called Mamba .
He had to use part of that money to pay for fourteen servers in Germany and five programmers in Belarus .
He seemed to maintain the same indifferent attitude toward finances that he had demonstrated in his uncle ’s store .
“ I do n’t know .
I have n’t counted , ” he said , once he figured out that I had asked him a question about profit rather than revenue .
“ It ’s not important , ” he added , saying that his costs were covered by the advertising .
At one point , he seemed to sense that he was making the wrong impression on a Western journalist who he reckoned might be keen to find the next Facebook .
So he quickly began to talk of future secret projects and an umbrella company that would encompass all such future secret projects .
Ternovskiy sucked down a glass of fresh - squeezed grapefruit juice and pattered on about happiness and the intersection between virtual reality and real reality .
But he was clearly distracted .
Earlier that day , he had been approved for an American tourist visa , which had been fast - tracked by a letter from Fred Wilson , who runs Union Square Ventures , one of the largest venture - capital firms in New York .
“ I felt like a kid getting a present , ” Ternovskiy told me .
“ I screamed in the street . ”
Ternovskiy was already being courted by Yuri Milner , the C.E.O. of Digital Sky Technologies , a Moscow - based Internet investment company that has reportedly acquired a stake of nearly ten per cent in Facebook .
But Ternovskiy was not interested .
“ I am not planning anything with him , ” he said , flapping his fingers against his thumb to imitate Milner talking .
“ I want to meet with American investors . ”
He was going to the States for three weeks , first to New York , to meet investors , and then to “ San Francisco , then maybe California . ”
The Ternovskiys are proud of their Russian ethnic background , but they have a complicated relationship with the motherland .
Andrey ’s great - great - grandfather was a teacher of ancient languages and a representative in the local parliament of Tobolsk , a small city in Siberia .
During the Civil War , the advancing Bolsheviks drowned him in an ice hole in a river .
Ternovskiy ’s grandfather was an engineer who learned to be neutral and obliging toward the state .
For his devotion , he ended up in the secret city of Sarov — the Soviet Los Alamos — where he worked on developing nuclear weapons with the physicist ( and later dissident ) Andrei Sakharov .
“ We never had much good will toward the Soviet state , I can bear witness to that , ” Vladimir Ternovskiy says .
But he adds that he also saw no reason to emigrate “ just because I do n’t like the government . ”
Like his grandfather , Andrey Ternovskiy knows when to toe the pro-Russian line ; for example , when reporters from state television call .
In private , however , he gripes , albeit cautiously , about his country and his countrymen .
He does n’t like his peers ’ increasingly anti-Western attitudes , which he says make him “ uncomfortable ” because most of his virtual friends happen to be in the U.S.
He is puzzled by Russia ’s hypersensitive self - absorption .
He has also been worried about getting drafted into the Russian Army , which has become infamous for hazing so brutal that it kills dozens of draftees every year .
As a self - described happy nerd — a word he loves to drop in English — he cringes at the anger and frustration that he sees in his compatriots .
When I asked him where he got his optimism , he said , simply , “ Dad is happy , Mom is Russian . ”
One might think that this would be an ideal time for the Ternovskiy family .
“ Modernization ” has been the buzzword of Dmitry Medvedev ’s Presidency , and he has begun a major initiative to turn the Russian economy away from the extraction of natural resources ( which now funds nearly two - thirds of the federal budget ) and toward one based on innovation and technology .
The Kremlin has poured more than five billion dollars into Rusnano , a state corporation meant to modernize Russia through nanotechnology .
And , in February , Medvedev , in typically top - down Russian governmental fashion , announced plans to build a high - tech zone inspired by Silicon Valley .
Ternovskiy , however , cares little about all these plans .
When the Russian media finally caught on to his rise , Ternovskiy found their attention and patriotic questions distasteful .
“ I do n’t want to make it a Russian thing , ” he told me .
“ The whole point is to have no borders . ”
Ternovskiy also has reason to be skeptical of the Kremlin ’s recent interest in grooming intellectual talent , given the exodus of scientists from the country — by 2002 , more than half a million had left — and the pitiful state of Russia ’s intelligentsia since the fall of Communism .
Andrey ’s parents are exactly the kind of people Russia might be cultivating in its modernization drive , yet Vladimir makes only five hundred dollars a month and Elena three hundred .
Official talk of modernization and innovation rankles Vladimir , who supplements his income with work for Russian Souvenirs .
“ It ’s demagoguery , ” he says .
Recently , he sent a project proposal to Rusnano : no response .
“ These projects do n’t interest them .
The Internet does n’t interest them .
If I proposed something else , like cutting down some forest in the Far East , that would instantly interest them .
There ’s no support from the government .
It ’s completely absent .
And Andrey knows that if he stays here no one will support him .
The country does n’t need people like him . ”
CHICAGO – The U.S. Supreme Court began hearings today regarding a landmark case about whether to lift a 28 - year - old handgun ban here .
The case , McDonald v. Chicago , could be an uphill battle for gun-control supporters after the Supreme Court lifted Washington D.C. ’s ban two years ago .
Otis McDonald , 76 , and three other residents here say the ban infringes on their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms .
But , the city is expected to argue that its local legislative power is different from D.C. ’s , which is under federal jurisdiction .
A final decision is expected this summer .
The ruling could determine what type of gun laws can be passed by cities nationwide .
“ Lifting the ban is a bad idea , ” said Michael Rodriguez , violence prevention director with Enlace Chicago , a community organization on the city ’s southwest side .
“ There are too many young people on the streets dying everyday due to the easy access of guns .
Until we solve this problem there ’s no way we can even think about lifting the measure on guns in Chicago . ”
Rodriguez recalled two young men who died within days of each other recently due to gang retaliation and illegal guns .
Four families were immediately affected by the senseless incident in a matter of days , he said .
Gun-rights activists argue that lifting the ban would actually lead to safer neighborhoods by giving citizens the ability to arm and defend themselves .
“ I have never heard the mother of child killed by gun violence say owning guns would help save lives , ” said Rodriguez .
People who believe that are disconnected from the reality of the inner-city , he said .
Tio Hardiman is the director of Cease Fire Illinois and said Chicago has been plagued with gun violence for years .
Lifting the ban on guns will increase the violence and give a green light to a “ semi- cowboy state of mind , ” he said .
“ We have to change the way we think about violence , ” said Hardiman .
Street violence for many neighborhoods is considered the norm , but it ’s really a learned behavior and we have to instill in our youth that it ’s not okay to shoot people , he said .
“ We have to change that culture and mentality . ”
Hardiman said more funding should be allocated toward violence prevention programs and outreach workers throughout Chicago including job - readiness services and long term employment opportunities for young people .
Officials here say a 10 percent reduction in the murder rate in the past two years is proof that the ban is working .
Figures show that 81 percent of the murders here were gun-related ; nearly 60 percent were gang - related .
Meanwhile Chicago has passed Los Angeles with the highest youth homicide rate in the nation .
In the 2008 - 09 school year , a record 36 city public school students were murdered , mostly by gun violence and underage gang activity .
It was the third straight year the numbers had risen .
Mayor Richard Daley , who is strongly against lifting the ban , contends the federal government does too little to address the issue for fear of the powerful gun lobby .
He hopes the high court rules in the city ’s favor .
“ We ’ve turned our backs on common - sense gun laws in America and we continue , unfortunately , shooting each other on a daily basis , ” Daley told reporters .
“ What ’s at stake for those of us on the front - line … is nothing less than the safety of our streets and our families and all of our children .
How many more must needlessly die because guns are too easily available in our society today ? ”

( Newser ) – The same banks that fed the Greek financial crisis are wagering on the country 's collapse — and in doing so , critics say , they 're making default more likely .
Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan and others who helped mask the true extent of Greece 's financial problems are now placing bets against the country on a new index that lets players make credit - default swaps -- essentially , bets on whether or not a country will go bust .
The index was created last September , and the market on betting against Greece has since exploded , the New York Times reports .
The index is a vicious circle :
The more bets are placed against Greece , the harder it gets for Athens to borrow the funds it needs to pay its bills .
The more trouble Athens has , the more investors wager against it .
Critics say similar swap schemes contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers .

CINCINNATI -- A 17 - year - old Notre Dame football recruit who was killed in a fall from a fifth - floor hotel balcony during his senior - year spring break in Florida was " drunk and belligerent , " authorities said Saturday .
Matt James died Friday around 6:30 p.m. ET at the Days Inn Motel in Panama City Beach .
Police said he was dead when officers arrived .
" It appears to be a tragic accident , " Panama City Beach police Maj .
David Humphreys said .
Matt James " had leaned over the balcony rail , was shaking his finger at the people in the next room over .
He fell over , " police said .
John Albright / Icon SMI
James ' former teammates at St. Xavier High School gathered for a private prayer service in the school 's chapel , mourning the second death of an athlete this school year .
James , an all - state offensive lineman , had been the first top signing for new Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly .
James was part of a group of about 40 St. Xavier students and a half - dozen parents on the trip .
" Witnesses and friends indicate he had become drunk and belligerent , " Humphreys said .
" He had leaned over the balcony rail , was shaking his finger at the people in the next room over .
He fell over . "
Humphreys said the railing at the hotel met the standards for proper height .
He said police would be interested in pursuing charges if they learn who provided the underage teen with alcohol .
Police said an autopsy on James would be done later .
Toxicology results were pending .
James ' parents went to Florida on Friday night , returned to Cincinnati and released a statement Saturday evening asking for privacy while they make funeral arrangements and grieve .
" We would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support during this tragic time , particularly the family at St. X , " Jerry and Peggy James said .
" Matt was a very special young man , and it is gratifying to us that you all could see that as well .
We are touched by this outpouring of love . "
The 6 - foot - 6 , 290 - pound offensive lineman also was on St. Xavier 's varsity basketball team .
" This is just such a tragedy because he was just a wonderful , wonderful kid , " said Mary Massa , the mother of St. Xavier quarterback Luke Massa , who also has committed to Notre Dame .
" When he first came to St. X , he was pretty quiet .
He was tall and kind of awkward .
He just blossomed while he was there .
He was just a good , wonderful kid .
It 's heartbreaking . "
Word of his death spread quickly through social - networking sites on Friday night .
Students gathered at the football field next to the school for an impromptu vigil .
There are many , many replies to Roger Ebert ’s reeking ejaculate , from measured Judo - inspired reversals of momentum to primal shrieks which communicate rage in a harrowing , proto-linguistic state .
Thatgamecompany ’s Kellee Santiago chose to respond to him , which gave the whole thing a kind of symmetry , seeing as it was her TED speech that drove that wretched , ancient warlock into his original spasm .
That was very polite of her , behaving as though she were one side of a conversation .
For what it ’s worth .
Which is n’t much , honestly , because this were n’t never a dialogue .
He is not talking to you , he is just talking .
And he ’s arguing
1. in bad faith ,
2. in an internally contradictory way ,
3. with nebulously defined terms ,
so there ’s nothing here to discuss .
You can if you want to , and people certainly do , but there ’s no profit in it .
Nobody ’s going to hold their blade aloft at the end of this thing and found a kingdom .
It ’s just something to fill the hours .
Also , do we win something if we defeat him ?
Does he drop a good helm ?
Because I ca n’t for the life of me figure out why we give a shit what that creature says .
He does n’t operate under some divine shroud that lets him determine what is or is not valid culture .
He cannot rob you , retroactively , of wholly valid experiences ; he cannot transform them into worthless things .
He ’s simply a man determined to be on the wrong side of history , the wrong side of the human drive to create , and dreadfully so ; a monument to the same generational bullshit that says because something has not been , it must not and could never be .

The company helped pioneer the disk in 1981 , introducing the technology that year and then starting to sell the discs in 1983 .
At its height in the year 2000 , Sony shipped 47 million disks , but that number has progressively fallen , reaching just 8.5 million in 2009 .
However , that also begs the question , why were so many floppies shipped even in 2009 and who is still using them ?
Sony holds 70 percent of the Japanese market share for the disks , compared to around 40 percent globally .
The company cited lack of demand as the main reasoning behind the decision , given the cheap prices of much smaller and higher capacity devices , like USB flash drives .

Chemicals leaching from lab plastic throw off results .
Is it DNA or is it just chemicals leaching out of the tube ?
dra_schwartz/iStockphoto
Biologists using standard plastic test tubes to gauge the concentration of DNA and proteins in their samples may be getting wildly incorrect readings because chemicals are leaching out of the containers .
An established way of assessing the concentrations and some key properties of DNA and proteins is to measure the levels of ultraviolet light the molecules absorb at wavelengths of between 220 and 260 nanometres .
But methods used routinely in molecular biology cause the plastic tubes to release compounds that absorb light in the same range , increasing the reading by as much as 300 % , say researchers from Texas State University in San Marcos who have studied the problem1 .
" The leaching of chemicals out of polypropylene tubes consistently resulted in an overestimation of measurements , " says Kevin Lewis , a molecular geneticist and an author on the study .
Graduate student Michael Robson stumbled on the effect while studying how efficiently DNA binds to clay .
To his surprise , water centrifuged for 30 minutes or longer — during which time it warmed up slightly — began to absorb light at wavelengths characteristic of DNA .
Suspecting that their microcentrifuge tubes might be the culprits , Robson and his colleagues took a closer look at ten types of tube from nine manufacturers , using mass spectrometry to determine the levels of leached chemicals .
Leaching increased both after the tubes were heated above 37 °C and when inorganic solvents were used — procedures used in enzyme - catalysed reactions , protein extractions and the polymerase chain reaction .
There is " no doubt " , Lewis says , that some results in the literature are incorrect , at least quantitatively — although the relative differences between control and experimental samples should still hold .
He adds that double - checking results with other techniques , such as gel electrophoresis or fluorometry , in which leaching chemicals do not affect readings , would catch the problem .
Widespread problem
Manufacturers contacted by Nature were not able to respond before publication of this story .
But the Texas team is n't alone in reporting concerns over lab plastics .
In November 2008 , researchers in Canada found that chemicals in pipette tips and plastic tubes interfered with the activity of an enzyme they were studying2 ( see ' Why plastic is n't always fantastic ' ) .
And more recently , researchers in Germany reported that standard - issue Petri dishes — made of polystyrene , another type of plastic — were skewing the results of cell - culture assays3 .

" Despite increasing exposure of this problem over the past two or three years , pipette tips and microfuge tubes purchased from the majority of sources — and particularly the more inexpensive brands — still contain additives that leach into buffers and solvents and interfere with measurements , " pharmacologist Andrew Holt of the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada , told Nature .
The problem has also found its way into the clinic .
Last year , Holt and his colleagues at Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem reported a spike in diagnoses of a rare metabolic disorder after the lab changed the supplier of its pipette tips4 .
Lewis 's lab , which reports its results in the April issue of BioTechniques 1 , now uses only tubes advertised as low in additives .
" There may be some drawbacks " to such tubes , he notes , because the additives are meant to protect the plastic .
" They may break down or become brittle faster with time . "
Ron O'Brien , director of public relations at Thermo Fisher Scientific , makers of Nalgene tubes tested in the study , said the company provides an online guide to help researchers judge the integrity of materials contained in the lab products they sell .
“ We believe the scientists using our products choose those materials carefully , ” the company said in a statement .
” We offer a wide selection of centrifuge tubes in many different types of advanced bio-analytical grade resins to meet the requirements of a variety of assays . ”

Sadie ( 7.5 ) has been doing book copying for a couple years now and they are getting more and more detailed .
She spends hours on these .
I have a mini - freak - out when I find them .
She usually adds a sibling and sometimes changes the gender .
With some books she will turn the animal characters into human ones .
It 's the study and copy of composition and color that floors me .
I have a box I toss these into before they get lost .
She loves revisiting them later after not seeing them for months .
Then sometimes she copies her own copy .
Oh , child brain — I love you !
Partnering in Afghanistan New McChrystal Approach Means Greater Danger for German Forces
During his much - anticipated visit to Berlin , US General Stanley McChrystal , the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan , refrained from making any demands for additional German troops .
But McChrystal 's new " partnering " strategy means the Bundeswehr will have to get involved in highly dangerous operations .
60 Year Old Triathlete Seeks Lower Back Pain Relief
Question : I am a 60 yr old triathlete who ALWAYS has a problem with lower back / hips / shoulders , etc .
I am currently seeing a massage therapist , who seems to have gotten a hold on my pain issues .
Both the light / eye test and the blood pressure test were negative .
Should I still do the supplements and watch my sugar intake ?
First of all , I highly recommend giving up sugar all together .
I always do .
It ’s the major contributer to aging and all major health issues .
And , it takes a worse toll the older we get .
The thing that you have going for you though is that your exercise .
When blood sugar is high , like after eating any sugar at all , insulin goes up to bring the high blood sugar down .
High insulin this one of the main causes of many diseases .
I could go on and on about what high insulin does to the body .
One is that it pushes a lot of the sugar to the muscles .
If you workout not too long after sugar or processed foods , then that sugar is burned off .
But , muscles burning sugar ( anaerobic – without oxygen ) get a lot more sore than muscles burning fat ( aerobic – with oxygen ) .
Since you are an athlete , and you passed the two adrenal test , then the adrenals are not likely to be your issue .
My next suspect would be tight muscles , though there are other possibilities .
For people with good adrenal glands , lower back pain relief can still be found .
With the lower back it is likely the psoas muscle that is tight .
It is the deepest muscle in the body running from the inside of the lower back diagonally to the hip and down to the inside of the upper thigh bone .
When this muscle is tight , it will pull the lower back forward increasing the arch in the lower back .
If rounding the back makes it feel considerably better , then I would do some pressure point release on the psoas and see if that gives you relief .
Here is a video on how to do this massage .
It is demonstrated on someone , but it is possible to do it on yourself .
Psoas Massage / Release for Lower Back Pain Relief from Kalidasa Brown on Vimeo .
While this is the most likely the cause of your back pain , there are other possible causes .
You can find 40 causes of back pain here , but even that list is incomplete .
I hope you can find the issue and find real back pain relief soon .
And , I wish I could see you in person , so far I have been able to eliminate back pain for every client I have ever had .
Maybe I just have n’t gotten a tough case yet .
Players control armies of different species that do battle in StarCraft Police in South Korea are investigating allegations of match fixing by professional players of sci- fi - themed strategy game StarCraft .
The game , made by World of Warcraft developer Blizzard , is enormously popular in South Korea .
Leagues of professional players compete in televised tournaments and receive coaching and sponsorship .
However , some players and officials are alleged to have accepted bribes from gambling websites to rig the games .
There has been little coverage of the event in the country 's mainstream media but the Korea Times website claims that the Korea e-Sports Association filed charges against individual players and coaches in March 2010 .
According to the newspaper StarCraft accounts for 70 % of so - called " e- sports " activities in South Korea .
A spokesperson from the Korean Embassy in the UK told the BBC that there had been no official statement from the Ministry of Culture but did confirm that an incident had been reported to the police .
Website Gamepron said the news was being compared with the 1919 Black Sox scandal , in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox baseball team were found to have deliberately lost games .

Enter , if you dare , the erotic sub / dom world of Superman ’s Kinky Girlfriend in THE TOP SEVEN S&M COVERS OF LOIS LANE .
Every image is unaltered .
Every cover is REAL .
All Some art by Dick Giordano .
Most of the layouts are by Bob Oksner ( I ’ve been corrected , and am duly chastised , but I still believe Dick Giordano inked ’em ) .
Number # 7
LOIS LANE 111 : Trapped by The Justice League
Okay , this is weak sauce .
So she ’s in a bikini , and she ’s being tied down ?
Hardly something to keep the sheets bundled up at night , is it ?
But it does mark the FIRST time either of those things happened in a Lois Lane comic , eleven years into the fifteen year run .
I mean , it ’s not like Lois Lane did n’t
have odd covers before , but she was mostly getting married to an assortment of people ( creatures - Superman – Batman – convicts – Satan ) every other month , or stepping into her “ NEGRO - MACHINE ” for the day .
Weird , sure , but were living in the Seventies , and we ’d grown to expect innovations like the Negro Machine .
So this cover , with the little people putting the bondage to the half naked Lois , was the start , a dipping of the toe into the world of kink .
But oh , it ’s gonna get so much better .
Hee hee .
Number # 6 :
LOIS LANE 122 : 77 Coffins
Okay , now we ’re talking .
Lois is properly introduced to bondage and submission as she SHOULD be .
And DIG
that hog - tied roommate on the floor !!
You almost miss the leatherette wearing “ Thorn ” bound up along side them , there ’s so much misbehavior going on here .
What I love is that the letterer gave all the thought dialog to the one on the ground .
( I think her name was “ Melba ” , or “ Selma ” , or “ Does It Matter , She Was Clearly There To Stamp the Comic As Token Seventies Liberalism ” )
Even the letterer knew , all eyes were on the floor .
I mean , this is NOT your big sister ’s Lois Lane comics .
Why ca n’t a poor girl just marry Satan like she ’s supposed to and get on with things ?
Number # 5
LOIS LANE 135 : The Amazing After - Life of Lois Lane
I do n’t know about her after life , but she seems to be having an interesting afternoon .
If you learn one thing from this cover , learn THIS : when tying a woman to a truck bumper , it ’s important to separate the thighs as much as possible , and if you can get her to arch her back , it really helps .
These covers are starting to get interesting .
And I ’m starting to wonder how Dick Giordano Bob Oksner spent his weekends .
Number # 4 :
LOIS LANE 123 : The Serpent in Paradise :
My wife cannot even look at this one without cringing .
I had to scan it with tongs , while she was out of the room .
Okay , sure , if you ’re going to have a story about serpents in paradise , you ’ve got no choice than to throw a little snake bondage into the mix .
But what sets this cover apart is a new feature , which we ’ll be seeing more of in the next few covers , and that is the “ crotch ” point .
Check out Superman ’s hand , with that bizarrely tilted finger pointing out the spot to look for Lois ’ Crotch .
You do n’t believe in the “ crotch point ” ?
Keep your eyes peeled .
Number # 3 :
LOIS LANE 127 : Curse of the Flame
Go ahead and deny the “ crotch point ” now .
Just go ahead .
That shark is interested in one thing and one thing only and that ’s snacking on her “ bikini area ” in a way that I suspect is n’t wholesome .
And why is Superman looking for the girl in the boat ?
Hmm ?
He should be looking for the MAN IN THE BOAT , but of course , he ’s oblivious .
Oh well , at least something is going to eat her .
( Did I just go there ?
Did I ?!?)
Not so much bondage as the others , but a delightful switch on Vagina Dentata .
Number # 2
LOIS LANE 133 : The Lady is a Bomb
Oh . My. God .
Can you even imagine what Bob was thinking when he sketched this cover ?
( And inked , I suspect , by a Dick , and you may make of that what you will ! ) .
What was DC editorial thinking ?
We can only thank God and country that the colourist did n’t colour the lamppost red or pink , or there would have been a breakdown of the social order , and America would have been destroyed .
Where to start ?
Okay , first off , is Superman spent ?
He seems to be done …or is he just about to …No .
I ca n’t go there .
And why is the post all bent like that ?
I heard President Clinton had a condition called … No I can ’t .
This is a family blog .
And the torn clothes… ?
The …ruined landscape .
TAKE THIS IMAGE AWAY !
It tempts me !
It mocks me !
It makes me feel all “ grown up ” in a way I do n’t understand .
Bring me back to a world where Lois marries a serial killer , and things are NORMAL !
Number # 1
LOIS LANE 120 .
It does n’t seem to have a title , so I ’ll just call this one “ THE MANY CROTCH DARTS OF LOIS LANE ’S CROTCH , featuring Superman ’s Girlfriend , Lois Lane ’s Vagina ” .
Or that might be too subtle .
This is the one time in history that someone was placed on a giant dart board as a means of killing them , with the bullseye someplace OTHER THAN BEHIND THEIR HEART .
According to the story , a Mexican band of Crotch Darters had been roaming the badlands of the border areas for days , and Superman is called in to investigate a series of “ Crotch Dartings ” that had plagued the country side .
I wo n’t ruin the ending for you , you ’ll have to find a copy for yourself , but it involves crotches .
This is the ONLY comic book I ’ve ever asked a creator to sign the cover of in my entire collection .
I begged , pleaded and demanded that Dick Giordano ( the inker ) sign this when I discovered we were both guests at the same small convention a few years ago .
I asked him what was going on at the time that Lois was suddenly all about the crotches and manacles , and Dick said he had n’t noticed any change in the covers for this period , but signed the copy with a smile .
Thanks for the memories , creative staff at Lois Lane .
I ’ll never look at another Crotch Dart without thinking of you guys .

The app will quickly analyze your hard drive , and when it 's done , you 'll be presented with a cool visualization like this :

What you 're looking at is a pretty cool graphical representation of your hard drive usage by folders .
At the center of the graphic is your hard drive ; each concentric circle moving out from the center represents a folder .
( For example , when Disk Space Fan completes its first scan , the center may represent your C:\ drive .
One of the larger arcs directly outside the center may represent C : \Windows .
The further you go from the center circle , the further you 've drilled down into the file system .
If you go several levels out , you 'll end up looking at something further into the file system at something like C : \Windows \System32 \DriverStore .

All you have to do to determine what an arc represents on your hard drive is hover over it with your mouse and you 'll see not only what file and folder it represents , but also how much space it 's eating on your hard drive .
You can drill down into any folder by simply clicking on any arc .
When you do , you 'll get a new graphical representation , this time with the folder you just clicked on at the center and its sub - folders and files surrounding it .

So how do you go from this fancy graphic to cleaning up your hard drive ?
It 's actually pretty simple .
The larger an arc , the more disk space it takes up .
Drill down on the big arcs and you 'll find the big files .
Right click file or folder from the app to view it , browse to it , see its properties , or delete it altogether .
Find Hard Drive Hogs with WinDirStat : Disk Space
Fan may win out on eye candy , but we 'll always have a special place in our hearts for the classic , open source WinDirStat .
If you 've drilled through Disk Space Fan but want to take a second pass through your drive with a different lens , download WinDirStat , point it at the drive you want analyzed , and click OK .
Once it 's finished chomping through your drive , you 'll see something like this :

Again , it 's a graphical representation of the files and folders on your drive , but with a different spin from Disk Space Fan .
WinDirStat displays every file and folder on your drive represented by size , so you can quickly examine the largest rectangles ( the larger the rectangle , the larger the file on your drive ) , click it to see what it is , or right - click and select Explorer
Here if you want to see the file in Explorer and delete it .
WinDirStat color codes popular file types so you can quickly identify videos or MP3s , for example , and clicking on a file type in the file type panel will highlight those file types in the graphical representation no matter where they are on your drive .

Awfully handy , huh ?
Clean Out the Unneeded Crap
The above methods will help you hunt down those common files , large and small , eating up your precious hard drive space , but when it comes to the little stuff that fills up your computer with crap a little at a time , you can't go wrong with the beloved CCleaner ( the first " C " is for Crap ) .
CCleaner runs through common Windows spots where unnecessary files build up ( IE , Windows Explorer , temporary files , etc. ) , as well as common applications ( think Firefox , Chrome , etc. ) , finds the stuff that is n't necessary to run and that you may want to get rid of , and cleans it out .

So download it , install it if you do n't already have it ( make sure to untick the checkbox asking to install the Yahoo Toolbar ) , and fire it up .
Before you run it the first time , you may want to look at everything CCleaner wants to clean up , and if you see anything you 're not so sure you want cleaned , untick its corresponding checkbox .
Once you 're ready to give it a first run , click the Analyze button .

CCleaner will analyze the files your current settings will remove and tell you how much space you 'll clean out along with more specific numbers from each place it cleans .
If you 're happy with the way things are looking , click the Run Cleaner button and let CCleaner vacuum up and remove those files you just analyzed .
( As CCleaner notes when you click Run , it will permanently delete these files , so make sure it 's not cleaning anything you do n't want it to . )
The only setback with CCleaner is that it does n't have any scheduling feature to allow you to run it regularly without manually running through this process every time , but luckily our crafty friend the How - To Geek has detailed how to set up CCleaner to run on a schedule , so if you 'd prefer setting it and forgetting it , check out his instructions .

Automatically Clean Out Your Downloads Folder
If there 's one folder on my hard drive that quickly fills up with junk that I only need temporarily , and for a relatively short time , it 's my Downloads folder .
If I downloaded something from the internet that I wanted to use , I 've either installed it or moved it into more useful folders .
Whatever 's left in my Downloads folder for a couple of weeks is more likely than not junk .

Earlier this week I showed you how to automatically clean and organize your Downloads folder along with other folders on your desktop using Belvedere for Windows and Hazel for Macs .
If you 're serious about automation and desktop organization , you can do all sorts of cool stuff with those tools , but if keeping your hard drive clean and freeing up space is your concern , let 's focus on your Downloads folder .
Check out the step - by - step post for details , but creating a Belvedere rule to send files in your Downloads folder to your Recycle Bin after they 're X weeks old is a great way to keep that folder clean and free up a little extra space on your hard drive .

If you do n't want to constantly run yet another system tray application , you can run Belvedere as a scheduled task — similar to how you scheduled CCleaner above — with the -r < integer > command line switch .
This defines how many times you want Belvedere to run before the app silently exits .
If you wanted Belvedere to silently run through its rules one time , for example , you 'd schedule a command like :
% programfiles % \Belvedere\Belvedere.exe -r 1
... as a Windows Scheduled Task .
If you 'd set up a rule like the one above , Belvedere would run once when you scheduled it to , send old downloads to your Recycle Bin , then quit .

Install a New Hard Drive
Let 's face it :
We could go on all day finding system files that are safe to delete , and we could get ruthless about what gets to stay on your hard drive , but if you find yourself constantly bumping up against the limits of your hard drive despite following some of the strategies above , you may just need more hard drive space .

Sure it 's a bit of a cop out , but hard drive space really is cheap , and rather than spend too much time obsessing over every little file on your computer , you may want to evaluate your situation and determine whether or not you 're better off with a new drive altogether .
You can snag a 1TB + drive on NewEgg for around $ 100 , and installing a new hard drive is probably much easier than you think .

The most frustrating aspect of home brewing is when a batch goes bad .
The only way to improve your chances of avoiding this depressing situation is to maintain the highest degree of sanitation in your home brewery as is possible .
There are also some other pitfalls of the modern age that require a closer look , and some basic tools that will give you the best chances of fighting bacterial infestations , vinegar cultures , and rogue yeasts in your home brew .
One factor often overlooked when cleaning and sanitizing home brew set - ups is that of the water used .
Tap water in modern cities is sometimes good , sometimes terrible .
It is wise to do some research and find out how your city water rates when analyzed for bacteria , harmful chemicals , and heavy metals .
The quality of water used in making beer has a very strong connection with the quality of the finished product .
But how to deal with it ?
We caught up with Ken Grossman , Founder of the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company , and got a little background on his early home brewing days and his take on the importance of sanitation in the home brewery .
Ken Grossman , Sierra Nevada
C. Lavender :
In your five - gallon batch days , what would you say the single most important aspect of sanitation was for you ?
K. Grossman : Since I was n't taking micro samples and plating various stages and equipment during most of my home brewing days , my thoughts are going to be more empirical than absolute .
I owned a homebrew shop for several years , so besides my own , I got to sample lots of not so perfect beers .
I would say one of the key areas of concern and common pitfall was at the start of fermentation .
Lack of a healthy and robust start to fermentation allows bacteria to get a foothold ; the fermentation needs to get off to a rapid start to ensure no bacteria can get a foothold .
No matter how hard you try , and how clean your technique achieving absolute sterility in a home brewing , ( or for that matter most commercial operations ) environment is nearly impossible .
But many bacteria cannot compete or survive in the beer with rapidly dropping pH , and alcohol formation .
One compounding factor is often a lack of Wort aeration that limits yeast growth and a rapid start of fermentation .
Although there are wide variables and several rules of thumb , ( such as 1 million cells per degree Wort Plato ) in pitching recommendations , for top fermenting yeast we find 6 - 8 million cell range for Ale strains or 12 - 15 million for lager coupled with 100 % saturation with air ( 8 ppm O2 ) gets the beer started on the right track .
C. Lavender : Was water quality an important variable in your sanitation equation ?
If so , what sort of water quality did you look for ?
K Grossman : Water quality , particularly in regard to microbiological contamination is important , but typically municipal sources which are chlorinated are not a huge source of beer spoilage bacteria .
Fermentation equipment particularly plastic , which can be somewhat porous and easily scratched can harbor bacteria and be difficult to render sterile .
Keeping idle equipment submerged in a sanitizer , or ensuring every surface has sufficient contact time with a sanitizing solution before use is critical .
C Lavender :
What was your home brewing method and system of choice ?
( Extract , All - Grain , Gravity , RIMS , HERMS , etc ... ) K Grossman : I started using extract in 1969 and soon switched to 100 % grain mashing in 1970 - 71 .
I first started with a one temperature infusion mash in an insulated Igloo and then added heating and separate lauter vessel .
We also spoke with award winning brewers Vinnie and Natalie Cilurzo , brewers and owners of the Russian River Brewing Company , to see how they approach sanitation in the home brewery .
Vinnie & Natalie Cilurzo , Russian River Brewing Company
C. Lavender :
In your five - gallon batch days , what would you say the single most important aspect of sanitation was for you ?
V. Cilurzo : I would say that especially for beginning home brewers , sanitation is everything !
One can not be too careful or overly cautious when just starting out .
Aside from having good , healthy yeast , having not just good , but great sanitation practices might just be the difference if the home brewer decides to continue on .
Good sanitation ( and healthy yeast ) will hopefully land the home brewer a good , drinkable beer that will encourage him / her to continue on .
Sanitation & Brewing with Kegs
A great way to insure uncontaminated beer is to use closed systems that reduce the amount of air exposure to your finished beer .
There are many closed brewing / transfer systems that you can purchase on the market including the conical Fermentasaurus Fermenter that can transfer beer to different vessels under low pressure .
There are many other conical fermenters on the market with similar features .
Using two homebrew kegs with the correct fittings will also achieve a similar result , allowing you to close transfer your beer from a closed primary to secondary with little air exposure .
Boiling water in your keg is a great way to sanitize the keg , but can put some wear and tear on your fittings and O - rings .
Sanitizing with a solution that has a residue that evaporates is a good idea , then kegs can be purged of outside air with the use of CO2 .
In fact , by brewing with kegs , one can ensure that , even when racking , no outside air comes in contact with the beer .
In order to affect this situation , you will need two kegs .
You will need to make two custom parts for your soda keg .
One of which will be an airlock fitting that attaches to the gas - in port valve .
The other will be a length of surgical tubing which attaches on either end to a liquid - out valve .
First , after your wort has chilled , pour it into a sanitized soda keg .
Add your yeast and seal the keg , purging the outside air and replacing it with CO2 .
Then , place your one - way airlock onto the gas - in port valve .
Let your beer ferment , and when it is ready for racking , take the airlock off of the gas - in port and attach your double ended racking tube to the two kegs liquid - out valve posts , and place the one - way airlock on the gas out valve post on the secondary fermentation vessel .
Now is the time to add hops to your secondary fermentation vessel if needed for dry hopping and then pump the CO2 into the primary fermenting vessel at a moderate rate until all the liquid has gone from the primary into the secondary fermentation vessel .
If you time it right , you wo n't even need to add priming sugar to the secondary fermenter for carbonation , as you can capture the last fermenting action of the yeast to affect this .
This process works very well if you cut about 1 / 2 an inch off of the liquid - out dip tube in both kegs .
This helps keep down on sediment in your final product .
The final word of advice is to keep you beer lines clean and well maintained , and scrub those pots until they shine before sanitizing them !
